[[Francis Marion]], who was known as the \"Swamp Fox\", had an encampment near Kingston just across the Waccamaw River.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  The areas of Kingston and Charles Town, S.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sc_tories.tripod.com/estate_confiscation_lists_of_february_1782.htm|title=Estate Confiscation Lists|website=sc_tories.tripod.com|access-date=2018-04-21}}</ref> were communities with a higher population of Tories than many other Colonial American towns during the revolutionary war era.  A Tory was a colonist who supported the government during that period.\n\nAfter the war, patriotic citizens wanted to discard the name that honored Great Britain's [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. The county's name was changed to Horry (pronounced \"oh-ree\") in honor of General Peter Horry in 1801, and a courthouse was established in Kingston. \"Kingston\" was later changed to \"Conwayborough\", for General [[Robert Conway (general)|Robert Conway]]. In 1883, the General Assembly changed the name to \"Conway\".\n\n==Geography==\nConway is situated on the [[Atlantic coastal plain|South Carolina Coastal Plain]] on the western banks of the [[Waccamaw River]], and is approximately {{convert|14|mi}} from the Atlantic Ocean.

Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship]], and the [[PGA Championship]]) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff.

It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

In 1954, they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up.<ref name=\"Hist\"/>\n\nThe original trophy weighs over 130 pounds, and sits on a four-foot wide base. It resides permanently at Augusta National and depicts the clubhouse of the classic course. The replica, which is significantly smaller, stands just 6.5 inches tall and weighs 20 pounds. The champion and the runner-up both have their names engraved on the permanent trophy, solidifying themselves in golf history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/09/19/masters-trophy-facts-size-weight-history-97937 |title=The Masters Trophy facts: Size, weight, history and more |date=September 19, 2016 |website=GolfNewsNet.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Double Eagle trophy was introduced in 1967 when [[Bruce Devlin]] holed out for double eagle on number 8.

The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters. The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/inaugural-drive-chip-and-putt |title=Inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship has juniors living Augusta National dreams |last=Hennessey |first=Stephen |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2014 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/04/08/masters-augusta-national-drive-chip-and-putt-contest/2064565/ |title=Masters unveils drive, chip and putt contest |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=April 8, 2013 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22996264/drive-chip-putt-winners-crowned-augusta-national-ahead-masters |title=Drive, Chip & Putt winners crowned at Augusta |work=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=Apr 1, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman [[Fred Ridley]] announced that the club would host the [[Augusta National Women's Amateur]] beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

He would die by treason without being ever decisively bested on the battlefield.<ref name=Laq/> The [[Arverni]] Gaul [[Vercingetorix]] also favored mobile warfare and cutting of supply lines in his revolt against Rome in 52 BC, and [[Arminius]] from the Germanic [[Cherusci]] capitalized on the terrain and the Roman formations to win the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].<ref name=Laq/> Another example of an enemy using guerrila was [[Tacfarinas]], chief of [[Numidians|Numidian]] rebels, who forced Rome into allying with neighboring natives in order to finally defeat him.<ref name=Laq/> Later [[Caratacus]], the war chief of the British [[Catuvellauni]], employed guerrilla warfare mixed in with occasional set-piece battles for eight years.

In 1443 he rallied [[Albanians|Albanian]] forces and drove the Turks from his homeland. Skanderbeg fought a guerrilla war against invading armies up to 20 times larger than his, by using the mountainous terrain to his advantage. He harassed the vast Ottoman army with small \"hit and run\" units, as well as using feint retreats followed by sudden counterattacks, and other tactics unknown in warfare up to then.

In the 17th century Ireland, Irish irregulars called [[tories]] and [[rapparees]] used guerrilla warfare in the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] and the [[Williamite war in Ireland]]. [[Finland|Finnish]] guerrillas, [[Sissi (Finnish guerrilla)|''sissis'']], fought against Russian occupation troops in the [[Great Northern War]], 1710\u20131721.

Iroquois forces used hit and run tactics, harassment and avoided costly pitched battles. The colonists of New France began calling these Indian tactics La Petite Guerre because the tactics were meant for raiding as opposed to pitched battles. Under the tutelage of Wendake, Wobanaki, Algonquin and Ottawa tutors the habitants of New France learned La Petite Guerre and successfully used them against the Iroquois.\n\nLed by Major [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]], New Englanders had also been adopting Indian scouting and raiding tactics since [[King Philip's War]]. Throughout the four [[French and Indian Wars]], starting in the late 17th century Canadiens, the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]], and some [[Acadians]] brought La Petite Guerre to New England and the Ohio Valley. In present-day Maine, Father [[Sebastian Rale]] led the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] in a [[Father Rale's War|petite guerre]] along the New England/ Acadia border. A generation later, in [[Nova Scotia]], Father [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]] led the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] and the [[Acadians]] in a [[Father Le Loutre's War|petite guerre]] behind Anglo-American lines in the lead up to the last [[French and Indian War]].<ref>John Grenier.

The British military establishment began adopting some of the tactics of La Petite Guerre as \"light infantry.\"<ref name=\"Horn\">Horn, Bernd ''The Canadian way of war:serving the national interest'', Dundurn Press Ltd., 2006, 21.</ref>\n\n=== American Revolution ===\nAlthough many of the engagements of the [[American Revolution]] were [[conventional warfare|conventional]], guerrilla warfare was used to a certain extent during this conflict from 1775\u20131783, which made a significant impact. Guerrilla tactics were first used at the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] by the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] at April 19, 1775. [[George Washington]] sometimes used some sort of unconventional methods to fight the British. During the [[Forage War]], George Washington sent [[militia]] units with limited [[Continental Army]] support to launch [[Raid (military)|raids]] and [[ambush]]es on British detachments and forage parties, the militia, and Continental Army support would skirmish with British detachments in small-scale battles and engagements. Throughout the Forage War, British casualties exceeded past 900. The Forage War raised morale for the Patriots as their guerrilla operations against the British were very effective. Next, there are other Americans that used [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit and run]] raids, ambushes, and surprise attacks against the British such as [[William R. Davie]], [[David Wooster]], [[Francis Marion]], Shadrach Inman, [[Daniel Morgan]], Morgan's [[riflemen]], and the [[Overmountain Men]]. All these American guerrilla fighters did their part by using unconventional tactics to fight the British and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]]. [[Nathanael Greene]] used a guerrilla strategy very effectively against [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]]. First, Nathanael Greene would keep retreating to lure the British far from their supply lines, then send out his forces to fight in small skirmishes and engagements with British detachments to weaken them. Then fighting the conventional battle, Nathanael Greene fought Lord Cornwallis at [[Battle of Guilford Court House|Guilford Court House]] and gave him a severe blow. Although Lord Cornwallis was the victor, his victory was [[Pyrrhic victory|pyrrhic]] as he had too many casualties that he could ill afford. [[Siege of Yorktown|After the British surrender at Yorktown]] and America gaining their independence, many of these Americans who used guerrilla tactics and strategies became immortalized and romanticized as time passed. Although guerrilla warfare was frequently used when avoiding battles, the Americans fought in conventional linear formations in decisive battles against the British. The American Revolution could be seen as a [[Hybrid warfare|hybrid war]] since both conventional and guerrilla warfare was used throughout its duration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n=== Vend\u00e9an Counter-Revolution ===\nFrom 1793\u20131796 a revolt broke out against the [[French Revolution]] by Catholic royalists in the Department of the [[Vend\u00e9e]]. This movement was intended to oppose the persecution endured by the Roman Catholic Church in revolutionary France (see [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution#The Revolution and the Church]]) and ultimately to restore the monarchy. Though ill-equipped and untrained in conventional military tactics, the Vend\u00e9an counter-revolution, known as the \"Royal Catholic Army,\" relied heavily on guerrilla tactics, taking full advantage of their intimate knowledge of the marsh filled, heavily forested countryside. Though the [[Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e]] was eventually \"pacified\" by government troops, their successes against the larger, better equipped republican army were notable.\n\nWorks such as ''\"La Vend\u00e9e\"'' by Anthony Trollope,<ref>https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/8vend10.txt</ref> G.A.

They were fought using mostly guerrilla-warfare tactics; however, several conventional battles also took place. Indigenous Australians led by [[Pemulwuy]], a resistance leader, also conducted raids around [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]], a western suburb in Sydney, during the period between 1795 and 1802. These attacks led Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] to issue an order in 1801 which authorized settlers to shoot Indigenous Australians on sight in Parramatta, [[Georges River]] and [[Prospect, New South Wales|Prospect]] areas. The wars resulted in the defeat of the Hawkesbury River and Nepean river Indigenous clans who were subsequently dispossessed of their lands.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10389b.htm|title=Pemulwuy (c. 1750 \u2013 1802)|last=Kohen|first=J.

This often led to some resistance by the local population if the army did not pay fair prices for products they consumed. Usually, this resistance was sporadic, and not very successful, so it is not classified as guerrilla action. There are three notable exceptions, though:\n* The rebellion of 1809 in [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] led by [[Andreas Hofer]].\n[[File:Assault on San Engracia monastery by Baron Lejeune.JPG|200px|thumb|''[[Siege of Saragossa (1809)|Siege of Saragossa]]'' : The assault on the ''San Engracia'' monastery.]]\n\n==== Napoleon's Invasion of Russia ====\nIn [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]] of 1812 two actions could be seen as initiating guerrilla tactics. The [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|burning of Moscow]] after it had been occupied by Napoleon's [[Grand Army]], depriving the French of shelter in the city, resembled guerrilla action insofar as it was an attack on the available resources rather than directly on the troops (and insofar as it was a Russian action rather than an inadvertent consequence of nineteenth-century troops' camping in a largely abandoned city of wooden buildings). In a different sense, the imperial command that the Russian [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]] should attack the French resembled guerrilla tactics in its reliance on partisans rather than army regulars. This did not so much spark a guerrilla war as encourage a revengeful slaughter of French deserters by Russian peasants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tolstoy.thefreelibrary.com/War-and-Peace/14-3|title=Leo Tolstoy: War and Peace: Book Fourteen: 1812 \u2013 Chapter III \u2013 Free Online Library|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Meanwhile, Fieldmarshal Kutuzov permitted than-Hussar Lieutenant-Colonel [[Denis Davydov]] to open the Partisan War against the French communications. Davydov, Seslavin, Figner and others are since known in Russia as the 'Partisan Rangers of the Year '12' (Russian: \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044b [\u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b 18] '12-\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430). They were successful in their operations making the French troops unable to fight or even move, because of food and ammunition shortage, and not just because of the [[Russian Winter]] as is usually stated.\n\n==== Peninsular War ====\n[[File:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' by [[Francisco Goya]], showing Spanish resisters being executed by Napoleon's troops.]]\n\nIn the [[Peninsular War]] Spanish and Portuguese guerrillas tied down tens of thousands of French troops and killed hundreds of thousands. The continual losses of troops caused Napoleon to describe this conflict as his \"Spanish ulcer\". This was one of the most successful partisan wars in history and was where the word ''guerrilla'' was first used in this context. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] as the oldest known source, speaking of \"Guerrillas\" in 1809. Poet [[William Wordsworth]] showed a surprising early insight into guerrilla methods in his pamphlet on the [[Convention of Cintra]]:\n:\"It is manifest that, though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army, less or greater, yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people, nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them, or to keep them in subjugation\u2013much less if this people, like those of Spain in the present instance, be numerous, and, like them, inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature. For a great army, and even several great armies, cannot accomplish this by marching about the country, unbroken, but each must split itself into many portions, and the several detachments become weak accordingly, not merely as they are small in size, but because the soldiery, acting thus, necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority, which lies in what may be called the engineer of war; and far more, because they lose, in proportion as they are broken, the power of profiting by the military skill of the Commanders, or by their own military habits. The experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced, man to the level of man: and it is then, that the truly brave man rises, the man of good hopes and purposes; and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power.\" (''William Wordsworth: Selected Prose'', [[Penguin Classics]] 1988, page 177-8.)\n\nThis war saw [[British Army|British]] and [[Portuguese Army|Portuguese]] forces using Portugal as a secure position to launch campaigns against the French army, while Spanish ''guerrilleros'' bled the occupiers. Gates notes that much of the French army \"was rendered unavailable for operations against Wellington because innumerable Spanish contingents kept materialising all over the country. In 1810, for example, when Massena invaded Portugal, the Imperial forces in the Peninsula totaled a massive 325,000 men, but only about one quarter of these could be spared for the offensive \u2013 the rest were required to contain the Spanish insurgents and regulars. This was the greatest single contribution that the Spaniards were to make and, without it, Wellington could not have maintained himself on the continent for long\u2014let alone emerge victorious from the conflict\".<ref>Gates, David (1986), The Spanish Ulcer: A History of the Peninsular War, Pimlico (published 2002), {{ISBN|0-7126-9730-6}}, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> Combined, the regular and [[irregular warfare|irregular]] allied forces prevented Napoleon's [[Marshal of France#French Empire|Marshals]] from subduing the rebellious Spanish provinces.<ref>Chandler, David G. (1995), ''The Campaigns of Napoleon'', Simon & Schuster, {{ISBN|0-02-523660-1}}</ref>\n\n====War of 1812====\nAlthough a great number of engagements were conventional, unconventional warfare was used to a certain extent by the Americans in their second conflict with the [[British Empire]]. This war has been a controversial subject to date between historians and scholars. But it cannot be denied that some [[Guerrilla Warfare|guerrilla]] actions did take place and expertly used by the Americans. For the Americans, while they fought the British conventionally head on. They have used some forms of unconventional warfare. Such as raiding, hit and run incursions, surprise attacks, and sometimes ambushes. Three commanders of the [[Regiment of Riflemen]] were fairly competent in some limited unconventional types of warfare against the British Empire such as [[Benjamin Forsyth]], [[Daniel Appling]], and [[Ludowick Morgan]]. Other Americans that used hit and run raids plus surprise incursions were [[Duncan MacArthur]], [[Alexander Smyth]], [[Andrew Holmes (army officer)|Andrew Holmes]], [[Daniel Bissell (general)|Daniel Bissell]], [[John B. Campbell]], and George McGlassin. But the United States also had amphibious like combatants that could be seen as guerrillas of the sea. These were either American naval commanders or privateers that raided British merchant shipping, raise British colors to surprise and capture British ships, or disguise one's ship as a harmless looking vessel with hidden riflemen to ambush/surprise unsuspecting British ships. These Americans were [[Melancthon Taylor Woolsey]], [[Otway Burns]], [[Thomas Boyle]], [[David Porter (naval officer)| David Porter]], [[Jesse Elliot]], [[John Percival]], [[John Ordronaux (privateer)|John ORdronaux]], and [[William Josephus Stafford]]. Next, the American militia which were famous for their forms of guerrilla warfare in the [[American Revolution]] were not used so effectively in the [[War of 1812]]. It has been reported that the militia were poorly utilized as conventional troops, poorly armed, underfunded, and poorly trained which made them significantly less effective than their [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary]] counter-parts. There has been other sources where American militias can set up some effective ambushes against British troops, sailors, or infantry. But with the American militia's poor status, they could do so little damage. However, if used carefully in a sophisticated way. They can be effective guerrilla fighters. One of the most notable commanders to use them effectively was [[Alexander Macomb (general)|Alexander Macomb]]. His exploits are mentioned in this book: The Battles at Plattsburgh: September 11, 1814 By Keith A. Herkalo. The history book mentioned how General Alexander Macomb had the American militia fire at the British from behind trees, rocks, and bushes while retreating or maneuvering around them in the woods in the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]. British or Canadian commanders quoted how the American militia were formidable and did not fight like gentlemen but firing from concealed positions behind trees and rocks. It was said that the American Militia with their guerrilla style fighting in this battle played an important role in America's victory of Plattsburgh. At the end of the war, American gained very little favorable results such as the defeat of their formidable native America foe [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]. But that was the only favorable result. Otherwise, America could only fight the British to a draw at the end of this conflict. It's debatable if any of these American combatant's guerrilla like actions had any impact on the outcome of the war, but they do provide good insight of lessons to be learned for future military commanders or historians yearning to learn the ways of military tactics and strategy.\n\n== 19th century (1815\u20131914) ==\n=== American Civil War ===\n{{Main|Guerrilla warfare in the American Civil War}}\n\nIrregular warfare in the [[American Civil War]] followed the patterns of irregular warfare in 19th century Europe. Structurally, irregular warfare can be divided into three different types conducted during the Civil War: 'People's War', 'partisan warfare', and 'raiding warfare'. The concept of 'People's war,' first described by [[Carl von Clausewitz]] in ''[[On War]]'', was the closest example of a mass guerrilla movement in the era. In general, this type of irregular warfare was conducted in the hinterland of the Border States (Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and northwestern Virginia), and was marked by a vicious neighbor-against-neighbor conflict. One such example was the opposing irregular forces operating in Missouri and northern Arkansas from 1862 to 1865, most of which were pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] or pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in name only and preyed on civilians and isolated military forces of both sides with little regard of politics. From these semi-organized guerrillas, several groups formed and were given some measure of legitimacy by their governments. [[Quantrill's Raiders]], who terrorized pro-Union civilians and fought Federal troops in large areas of Missouri and Kansas, was one such unit. Another notorious unit, with debatable ties to the Confederate military, was led by [[Champ Ferguson]] along the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Ferguson became one of the only figures of Confederate cause to be executed after the war. Dozens of other small, localized bands terrorized the countryside throughout the border region during the war, bringing total war to the area that lasted until the end of the Civil War and, in some areas, beyond.\n\nPartisan warfare, in contrast, more closely resembles Commando operations of the 20th century. Partisans were small units of conventional forces, controlled and organized by a military force for operations behind enemy lines. The 1862 [[Partisan Ranger Act]] passed by the Confederate Congress authorized the formation of these units and gave them legitimacy, which placed them in a different category than the common 'bushwhacker' or 'guerrilla'. [[John Singleton Mosby]] formed a partisan unit which was very effective in tying down Federal forces behind Union lines in northern Virginia in the last two years of the war.\n\nLastly, deep raids by conventional cavalry forces were often considered 'irregular' in nature. The \"Partisan Brigades\" of [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] and [[John Hunt Morgan]] operated as part of the cavalry forces of the [[Confederate Army of Tennessee]] in 1862 and 1863. They were given specific missions to destroy logistical hubs, railroad bridges, and other strategic targets to support the greater mission of the Army of Tennessee. By mid-1863, with the destruction of Morgan's raiders during the [[Morgan's Raid|Great Raid of 1863]], the Confederacy conducted few deep cavalry raids in the latter years of the war, mostly because of the losses in experienced horsemen and the offensive operations of the Union army. Federal cavalry conducted several successful raids during the war but in general used their cavalry forces in a more conventional role. A good exception was the 1863 [[Grierson's Raid]], which did much to set the stage for General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s victory during the [[Vicksburg Campaign]].\n\nFederal counter-guerrilla operations were very successful in preventing the success of Confederate guerrilla warfare. In [[Arkansas]], Federal forces used a wide variety of strategies to defeat irregulars. These included the use of Arkansas Unionist forces as anti-guerrilla troops, the use of riverine forces such as gunboats to control the waterways, and the [[provost marshal]] military law enforcement system to spy on suspected guerrillas and to imprison those captured. Against Confederate raiders, the Federal army developed an effective cavalry themselves and reinforced that system by numerous blockhouses and fortification to defend strategic targets.\n\nHowever, Federal attempts to defeat Mosby's Partisan Rangers fell short of success because of Mosby's use of very small units (10\u201315 men) operating in areas considered friendly to the Rebel cause. Another regiment known as the \"Thomas Legion\", consisting of white and anti-Union [[Cherokee]] Indians, morphed into a guerrilla force and continued fighting in the remote mountain back-country of western [[North Carolina]] for a month after Lee's surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]]. That unit was never completely suppressed by Union forces, but voluntarily ceased hostilities after capturing the town of [[Waynesville, North Carolina|Waynesville]] on May 10, 1865.\n\nIn the late 20th century several historians have focused on the non-use of guerrilla warfare to prolong the war. Near the end of the war, there were those in the Confederate government, notably [[Jefferson Davis]] who advocated continuing the southern fight as a guerrilla conflict. He was opposed by generals such as [[Robert E. Lee]] who ultimately believed that surrender and reconciliation were better than guerrilla warfare.\n\nSee also [[Bushwhackers]] (Union and Confederate) and [[Jayhawkers]] (Union).\n\n=== South African War ===\nGuerrilla tactics were used extensively by the forces of the [[Boer]] republics in the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War|Second]] Boer Wars in South Africa (1880\u20131881; 1899\u20131902) against the invading British Army. In the [[First Boer War]], the [[Boer]] [[commandos]] wore their everyday dull-coloured farming clothes. The Boers relied more on stealth and speed than discipline and formation and, being expert marksmen using smokeless ammunition, the Boer were able to easily snipe at British troops from a distance. So the British Army relaxed their close-formation tactics. The British Army had changed to [[Khaki]] uniforms, first used by the [[British Indian Army]], a decade earlier, and officers were soon ordered to dispense with gleaming buttons and buckles which made them conspicuous to snipers.\n\nIn the third phase of the [[Second Boer War]], after the British defeated the Boer armies in conventional warfare and occupied their capitals of [[Pretoria]] and [[Bloemfontein]], Boer commandos reverted to mobile warfare. Units led by leaders such as [[Jan Smuts]] and [[Christiaan de Wet]] harassed slow-moving British columns and attacked railway lines and encampments. The Boers were almost all mounted and possessed long range magazine loaded rifles. This gave them the ability to attack quickly and cause many casualties before retreating rapidly when British reinforcements arrived. In the early period of the guerrilla war, Boer commandos could be very large, containing several thousand men and even field artillery. However, as their supplies of food and ammunition gave out, the Boers increasingly broke up into smaller units and relied on captured British arms, ammunition, and uniforms.\n\nTo counter these tactics, the British under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] interned Boer civilians into [[Second Boer War#Concentration camps (1900\u20131902)|concentration camps]] and built hundreds of blockhouses all over the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and [[Orange Free State]]. Kitchener also enacted a [[scorched earth]] policy, destroying Boer homes and farms. Eventually, the Boer guerrillas surrendered in 1902, but the British granted them generous terms in order to bring the war to an end. This showed how effective guerrilla tactics could be in extracting concessions from a militarily more powerful enemy.\n\n=== Philippine\u2013American War ===\nAt the start of the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], even with the recommendation of the able General [[Antonio Luna]], guerrilla warfare strategy was viewed by the Philippine side only as a tactical option of final recourse. This led to subsequent defeat of the Filipino forces in the early stages of the war mainly due to superior American weaponry and troops. Guerrilla warfare was only used as a main strategy on November 13, 1899 which made American occupation of the Philippine archipelago all the more difficult over the next few years. This can be greatly seen by the Moro insurrection at the southern province of the Philippines wherein Moro rebels will conceal themselves in the thick Philippine jungle and will charge American troops with only [[Bolo knife|bolo knives]] in overwhelming numbers at the opportune time. These led the American weapons manufacturers to develop the famed [[M1911 pistol]].\n\n=== War of the Pacific ===\n{{Main|Andr\u00e9s Avelino C\u00e1ceres}}\nDuring the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883) the Peruvian General [[Andres Avelino Caceres]] fought a three-year guerrilla war against the victorious Chilean army in the Andean Region of Peru from 1881 to 1883 ([[La Bre\u00f1a Campaign]]); this campaign was later studied in the Austrian [[Theresian Military Academy]] as an excellent illustration of successful mountain warfare.\n\n=== Mexican Revolution ===\nIn the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1910 to 1920, the populist revolutionary leader [[Emiliano Zapata]] employed the use of predominantly guerrilla tactics. His forces, composed entirely of peasant farmers turned soldiers, wore no uniform and would easily blend into the general population after an operation's completion. They would have young soldiers, called \"dynamite boys\", hurl cans filled with explosives into enemy barracks, and then a large number of lightly armed soldiers would emerge from the surrounding area to attack it. Although Zapata's forces met considerable success, his strategy backfired as government troops, unable to distinguish his soldiers from the [[civilian]] population, waged a broad and brutal campaign against the latter.\n\n=== Brigandage in south Italy ===\n[[File:Banda del Brigante Totaro di San Fele.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Band of south Italian brigands in [[Basilicata]], during the Italian unification]]\n{{Main|Brigandage in the Two Sicilies}}\nAfter the [[Italian unification]] in 1860, many bands composed mainly by peasants emerged in [[Southern Italy]]. The sources of the trouble were the carelessness of the new government toward the problems of the southern laborers, higher taxes and higher prices of basic necessities, mandatory military service who subtracted youths from the workforce and the economical benefits reserved only for the [[bourgeois]] society. In this period thousands of poors took the way of brigandage. The most well known brigand was [[Carmine Crocco]], a former soldier in the service of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] who formed an army of two thousand men. Crocco was renowned for his [[guerrilla]] tactics, which were enhanced by the same royal soldiers who chased him. His warfare included cutting water supplies, destroying flour-mills, cutting telegraph wires and ambushing stragglers.<ref>John Ellis, ''A short history of guerrilla warfare'', p.83</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n* In 1848, both ''[[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]]'' and [[United Irishman (1848 newspaper)|''The United Irishman'']] advocated guerrilla warfare to overthrow English rule in Ireland, though no actual warfare took place.\n* The [[Poland|Poles]] and [[Lithuania]]ns used guerrilla warfare during the [[January Uprising]] of 1863\u20131865, against the [[Russian Empire]].\n* In the 19th century, peoples of the [[Balkans]] used guerrilla tactics to fight the [[Ottoman empire]].\n* the north African Muslims uprisings against the colonial powers after second world war.\n* guerrilla warfare tactics were first applied in India by Sher Shah Suri or even before the Khuwar zam Shah against the Mongol.\n* During the early stages of the [[Franco-Prussian war]], the [[Francs-tireurs]] conducted guerrilla warfare against the occupying [[Prussian Army]].\n\n== World Wars (1914\u20131945) ==\n=== Irish War of Independence and Civil War ===\n[[File:Hogan's Flying Column.gif|300px|thumb|IRA Flying Column during the [[Irish War of Independence]].]]\nThe wars between Ireland and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|British]] state have been long, and over the centuries have covered the full spectrum of the types of warfare. The Irish fought the first successful 20th century war of independence against the British Empire and the United Kingdom. After the military failure of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916, the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) used guerrilla tactics involving both [[urban guerrilla]] warfare and [[flying column]]s in the countryside during the [[Irish War of Independence]] of 1919 to 1922. Many were inspired by the fabled exploits of the 1799\u20131803 guerilla campaign by [[Michael Dwyer]] after the failed [[1798 rebellion]].\n\nThe chief IRA commanders in the localities during this period were [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]], [[Seamus Robinson (Irish Republican)|Seamus Robinson]], [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch]], [[Se\u00e1n Mac Eoin]], and [[Tom Maguire]].\n[[File:Dwyer.jpg|thumb|120px|left|<center>[[Michael Dwyer]]</center>]]\n\nThe IRA guerrilla was of considerable intensity in parts of the country, notably in [[Dublin]] and in areas such as [[County Cork]], [[County Kerry]] and [[County Mayo]] in the south and west. Despite this, the Irish fighters were never in a position to either hold territory or take on British forces in a conventional manner. Even the largest engagements of the conflict, such as the [[Kilmichael Ambush]] or [[Crossbarry Ambush]] constituted mere skirmishes by the standards of a conventional war. Another aspect of the war, particularly in the north-eastern part of the province of [[Ulster]], was communal violence. The Unionist majority there, who were largely Protestant and loyal to Britain were granted control over the security forces there, in particular the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] and used them to attack the Nationalist (and largely Catholic) population in reprisal for IRA actions. Elsewhere in Ireland, where Unionists were in a minority, they were sometimes attacked by the IRA for aiding the British forces. The extent to which the conflict was an inter-communal one as well as war of national liberation is still strongly debated in Ireland. The total death toll in the war came to a little over 2000 people.\n\nBy mid-1921, the military and political costs of maintaining the British security forces in Ireland eventually proved too heavy for the British government. In July 1921, the UK government agreed to a truce with the IRA and agreed to meet representatives of the Irish [[First Dail]], who since the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 General Election]] held seventy-three of the one hundred and five parliamentary seats for the island. Negotiations led to a settlement, the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. It created the [[Irish Free State]] of 26 counties as a [[dominion]] within the [[British Empire]]; the other 6 counties remained part of the UK as [[Northern Ireland]].\n\n[[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Irish Republican Army]] split into pro- and anti-Treaty factions with the [[Anti-Treaty IRA]] forces losing the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922\u201323) which followed. The partition of Ireland laid the seeds for the later [[Troubles]]. The Irish Civil War is a striking example of the failure of guerrilla tactics when used against a relatively popular native regime. Following their failure to hold fixed positions against an [[Irish Free State offensive]] in the summer of 1922, the IRA re-formed \"flying columns\" and attempted to [[Guerrilla Phase of the Irish Civil War|use the same tactics]] they had successfully used against the British. However, against Irish troops, who knew them and the terrain and faced with the hostility of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the majority of [[Irish nationalist]] opinion, they were unable to sustain their campaign. In addition, the Free State government, confident of its legitimacy among the Irish population, sometimes used more ruthless and effective measures of repression than the British had felt able to employ. Whereas the British executed 14 IRA men in 1919\u20131922, the Free State executed 77 anti-treaty prisoners officially and its troops killed another 150 prisoners or so in the field (see [[Executions during the Irish Civil War]]). The Free State also [[internment|interned]] 12,000 Republicans, compared with the British figure of 4,500. The last anti-Treaty guerrillas abandoned their military campaign against the Free State after nine months in March 1923.\n\n=== World War I ===\nIn a successful campaign in [[German East Africa]], the German commander [[Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck]] fought against the numerically superior allied forces. Even though he was cut off from Germany and had few Germans under his command (most of his fighters were African [[askari]]s), he won multiple victories during the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East Africa Campaign]] and managed to exhaust and trouble the Allies; he was undefeated up until his acceptance of a cease-fire in [[Northern Rhodesia]] three days after the end of the war in Europe. He returned to Germany as a hero.\n\nMajor guerrilla war was fought by the Arabs against the [[Ottoman Turks]] during the [[Arab Revolt]] (1916\u20131918). Attacking the Hejaz Railway to disrupt Ottman forces is a strategy often credited to the British officer T.E. Lawrence.<ref>[[Arab Revolt#1916: T. E. Lawrence]]</ref>\n\nAnother guerrilla war opposed the German Occupation of [[Ukraine]] in 1918 and partisan and guerrilla forces fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites during the [[Russian Civil War]]. This fighting continued into 1921 in Ukraine, in Tambov province, and in parts of Siberia. Other guerrillas opposed the Japanese occupation of the Russian Far East.\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nDespite a common misconception, both Nationalist and Communist forces maintained active underground resistance in Japanese-occupied areas during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Even before the outbreak of total war in 1937, partisans were already present in [[Manchuria]] hampering Japan's occupation of the region. After the initial phases of the war, when large swaths of the [[North China Plain]] rapidly fell to the Japanese, underground resistance, supported by either Communist sympathizers or composed of disguised Nationalist soldiers, would soon rise up to combat the garrison forces. They were quite successful, able to sabotage railroad routes and ambush reinforcements. Many major campaigns, such as the four failed invasions of [[Changsha]], were caused by overly-stretched supply lines, lack of reinforcements, and ambushes by irregulars. The Communist cells, many having decades of prior experience in guerrilla warfare against the Nationalists, usually fared much better, and many Nationalist underground groups were subsequently absorbed into Communist ones. Usually, in Japanese-occupied areas, the IJA only controlled the cities and railroad routes, with most of them countryside either left alone or with active guerrilla presence. The [[People's Republic of China]] has emphasized their contribution to the Chinese war effort, going as far to say that in addition to an \"overt theatre\", which in many cases they deny was effective, there was also a \"covert theatre\", which they claim did much to stop the Japanese advance.\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:Soviet guerilla.jpg|thumb|right|[[Soviet partisan]] fighters behind German lines in [[Belarus]] in 1943. At least 5,295 Belarusian settlements were destroyed by the Nazis. In total, one-quarter of the Belarusian population was killed in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khatyn.by/en/genocide/expeditions/|title=\"Khatyn\" - Genocide policy \u2013 Punitive operations|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>]]\n[[File: AK-soldiers Parasol Regiment Warsaw Uprising 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Poles|Polish]] guerrillas from [[Batalion Zo\u015bka]] dressed in stolen German uniforms and armed with stolen weapons, fighting in the [[Warsaw Uprising]], the largest anti-Nazi guerrilla warfare in Europe.]]\nMany clandestine organizations (often known as [[resistance movement]]s) operated in the countries occupied by [[German Reich]] during the Second World War. These organizations began forming as early as 1939 when, after the defeat of [[Poland]], the members of what would become the Polish [[Home Army]] began to gather. In March 1940, a partisan unit of the first [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] commanders in the Second World War in Europe under Major [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]] \"Hubal\" completely destroyed a [[battalion]] of German infantry in a skirmish near the village of [[Huciska]].<ref>Marek Szymanski: Oddzial Majora Hubala, Warszawa 1999, {{ISBN|83-912237-0-1}}</ref>\n\nA guerrilla movement in [[Ethiopia]] was formed to rout out Italian forces as early as 1935. Other clandestine organizations operated in [[Danish resistance movement|Denmark]], [[Belgian resistance|Belgium]], [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norway]], [[French resistance|France (Resistance)]], [[Maquis (WW2)|France (Maquis)]], [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation|Czechoslovakia]], [[Slovak National Uprising|Slovakia]], [[Chetniks|Yugoslavia (Royalist Chetniks)]], [[National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia (Partisans)]], [[Soviet partisans|Soviet Union]], [[Italian resistance movement|Italy]], [[Albanian resistance during World War II|Albania]] and [[Greek Resistance|Greece]]. From the second half of 1944, the total forces of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Partisans numbered over 500,000 men organized in four [[field army|field armies]], which engaged in conventional warfare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/yugoslavia/army/|title=Armies|author=Ivan Bajlo|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> By 1944 the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] was thought to number 600,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/poland/15.htm|title=Poland \u2013 World War II|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Many of these organizations received help from the British operated [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) which along with the [[British Commando|commandos]] was initiated by [[Winston Churchill]] to \"set Europe ablaze.\" The SOE was originally designated as 'Section D' of [[MI6]] but its aid to resistance movements to start fires clashed with MI6's primary role as an intelligence-gathering agency. When Britain was under threat of invasion, SOE trained [[Auxiliary Units]] to conduct guerrilla warfare in the event of invasion. Even the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] were trained in guerrilla warfare in the case of invasion of England.\n\nOsterley Park was the first of 3 such schools established to train the Home Guard. Not only did SOE help the resistance to tie down many German units as garrison troops, so directly aiding the conventional war effort, but also guerrilla incidents in occupied countries were useful in the propaganda war, helping to repudiate German claims that the occupied countries were pacified and broadly on the side of the Germans. Despite these minor successes, many historians believe that the efficacy of the European resistance movements has been greatly exaggerated in popular novels, films and other media.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nContrary to popular belief, in the Western and [[Southern Europe]] the resistance groups were only able to seriously counter the German in areas that offered the protection of rugged terrain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} In relatively flat, open areas, such as France, the resistance groups were all too vulnerable to decimation by German regulars and pro-German collaborators.

They were formed to put into effect [[Orde Wingate]]'s newly developed [[guerilla warfare]] tactic of [[long range penetration]].\n\nThe Japanese military themselves also used guerrilla warfare during the later part of the Pacific War, when Japan's resource was already dwindling and the Allies have started invading. [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] famously used guerrilla warfare during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], where the general used network of tunnels and caves to attack American forces. His tactic was somewhat successful, delaying the Americans from taking Iwo Jima for 36 days.

However, this is a simplification of a much more complex situation which followed the pattern outlined by Maoist theory.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|National Liberation Front]] (NLF), drawing its ranks from the South Vietnamese peasantry and working class, used guerrilla tactics in the early phases of the war. However, by 1965 when U.S. involvement escalated, the National Liberation Front was in the process of being supplanted by regular units of the [[North Vietnamese Army]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[North Vietnamese Army|NVA]] regiments organized along traditional military lines, were supplied via the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] rather than living off the land, and had access to weapons such as [[tank]]s and [[artillery]] which are not normally used by guerrilla forces. Furthermore, parts of North Vietnam were \"off-limits\" by American bombardment for political reasons, giving the NVA personnel and their material a haven that does not usually exist for a guerrilla army.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nOver time, more of the fighting was conducted by the North Vietnamese Army and the character of the war become increasingly conventional. The final offensive into [[South Vietnam]] in 1975 was a mostly conventional military operation in which guerrilla warfare played a minor, supporting role.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[Cu Chi Tunnels]] (''\u00d0\u1ecba \u0111\u1ea1o C\u1ee7 Chi'') was a major base for guerrilla warfare during the Vietnam War. Located about 60&nbsp;km northwest of Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), the Viet Cong (NLF) used the complex system tunnels to hide and live during the day and come up to fight at night.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThroughout the Vietnam War, the Communist Party closely supervised all levels of the conflict. The bulk of the VC/NLF were initially southerners, with some distinctive southern issues and sensibilities. Nevertheless, the VC/NLF was associated with the Northern Lao Dong Party which furnished it with supplies, weaponry and trained cadres, including regular NVA/PAVN troops. The Southern Communist party, the Peoples Revolutionary Party (PRP) organized in 1962, to participate in the insurgency, and COVSN, Central Office for Southern Vietnam, which partially controlled military activity. The general replacement of CV irregulars with NVA troops supplanted the original VC goals with those proposed by the NVA. As the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] was primarily a VC operation in which large numbers of VC fighters were killed, increasing the role of the NVA in the war effort.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThis is a set of tactics which were used frequently in the Vietnam War by the NVA.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==== Within Laos ====\n{{See also|Laotian Civil War}}\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]] raised a [[Operation Momentum|guerrilla army]] to oppose PAVN invaders of the [[Kingdom of Laos]]. Consisting principally [[Hmong (people)|Hmong hill tribesmen]], ''L'Armee Clandestine'' under General [[Vang Pao]] was the only guerrilla army to ever enjoy [[air supremacy]]. It fought the Vietnamese regulars from 1961\u20131975 before reduced numbers and dwindling American support led to their defeat.<ref>Conboy, Kenneth and James Morrison (1995).

The Afghan side was a collection of tribes who initially fought with obsolete weapons such as rifles from the 19th century or the First World War. The resistance fighters were known collectively as the Mujahideen. The United States started to support the Afghanistan resistance with gradually more potent weapons and eventually anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles which then would cause so much damage to the far larger Soviet army that the Soviet Union abandoned its occupation and retreated back to the Soviet Union.\n\n=== Bangladesh Liberation War ===\n[[Mukti Bahini]] ({{lang-bn|\u09ae\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf \u09ac\u09be\u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09c0}} \"Liberation Army\") collectively refers to the armed organizations who fought against the [[Pakistan Army]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. It was dynamically formed by (mostly) Bengali regulars and civilians after the proclamation of independence for [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Pakistan]]) on March 26, 1971. Subsequently, by mid-April 1971 the former members of East Pakistan armed forces formed the \"Bangladesh Armed Forces\" and [[M A G Osmani]] assumed the command of the same. The civilian groups continued to assist the armed forces during the war. After the war \"Mukti Bahini\" became the general term to refer to all forces (military and civilian) of former East Pakistani origin fighting against the Pakistani armed forces during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Often Mukti Bahini operated as an effective guerrilla force to keep their enemies on the run. It has been compared to the French [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], the [[Viet Cong]], and the [[Yugoslav Partisans|guerrillas]] of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in their tactics and effectiveness.<ref>[http://www.defencejournal.com/apr99/bangladesh.htm WHY THE MOVEMENT FOR BANGLADESH SUCCEEDED: A military appreciation] by Mumtaz Iqbal</ref>\n\n=== Northern Ireland conflict ===\nIn the late 1960s [[the Troubles]] began again in [[Northern Ireland]].

The theory was that a harsh military regime would oppress the [[middle class]]es who would then support the guerrillas and create a popular uprising.\n\nWhile these movements did destabilize governments, such as [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Peru]] to the point of military intervention, the military generally proceeded to completely wipe out the guerrilla movements, usually committing several atrocities among both civilians and armed insurgents in the process.\n\nSeveral other [[left-wing]] guerrilla movements, sometimes backed by [[Cuba]], attempted to overthrow US-backed governments or [[right-wing]] military [[dictatorship]]s. US-backed [[Contras|Contra]] guerrillas attempted to overthrow the left-wing [[Sandinista]] government of Nicaragua. The Sandinista Revolution saw the involvement of [[Women and the Armed Struggle in Nicaragua]].\n\n===Algeria ===\n=== Iran\u2013Iraq War ===\nDuring the eight-year [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], irregular warfare was used against Iraqi military. The Iranian [[Irregular Warfare Headquarters]], the [[65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade]] of Iranian Army, and [[Peshmerga]] of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] were involved.\n\n== Since 1990 ==\n=== Europe since 2000 ===\nThe [[History of Modern Greece|Greek]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November|17 November]] disbanded around 2002 following the capture and imprisonment of much of its leadership.\n\nThe ongoing war between pro-independence groups in [[Chechnya]] and the Russian government is currently the most active guerrilla war in Europe. Most of the incidents reported by the Western news media are very gory terrorist acts against Russian civilians committed by Chechen separatists outside Chechnya. However, within Chechnya the war has many of the characteristics of a classic guerrilla war. See the article [[History of Chechnya]] for more details.\n\nIn [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Real Irish Republican Army]] and the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army]], two small, radical splinter groups who broke with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], continue to exist. They are dwarfed in size by the Provisional IRA and have been less successful in terms of both popularity among Irish republicans and guerrilla activity: The Continuity IRA has failed to carry out any killings, while the Real IRA's only attacks resulting in deaths were the 1998 [[Omagh bombing]], which killed 29 civilians, a [[booby trap]] torch bomb in [[Derry]] which killed a former [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] soldier, and a 2009 attack on a Northern Ireland military installation which killed 2 British soldiers and wounded several others.\n\n=== Iran ===\nAfter [[1979 Revolution]], the [[Iran]]ian Defence Minister [[Mostafa Chamran]] established the [[Irregular Warfare Headquarters]] as part of the [[Iranian Armed Forces]].

The unit was later disbanded.\n\n=== Iraq (2003-2011) ===\nMany guerrilla tactics are used by the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]] against the U.S.-led coalition. Such tactics include the bombing of vehicles and human targets, [[suicide bombing]]s, [[ambushes]], sniper attacks, and traditional hit and run raids. Although it is unclear how many U.S. casualties can be attributed to insurgent guerrilla action because of the high numbers of non-combat related injuries and deaths being included in all available statistics of total coalition casualties,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} it is estimated that they have injured more than 18,000 coalition troops and killed over 3,900, including more than 3,000 U.S. soldiers.

When the British restricted Jewish immigration to the region (see [[White Paper of 1939]]), Jewish immigrants began to use guerrilla warfare against the British for two purposes: to bring in more Jewish refugees, and to turn the tide of British sentiment at home. Jewish groups such as the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] and the [[Irgun]] \u2013 many of whom had experience in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|Warsaw Ghetto battles]] against the Nazis, fought British soldiers whenever they could, including the [[King David Hotel Bombing|bombing of the King David Hotel]]. They also conducted attacks against the Arabs, and prepared the infrastructure for the coming 1948 conflict.\n\nThe Jewish irregular forces were fighting the British Empire, which had just emerged victorious from World War II. Some of these groups were amalgamated into the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and subsequently fought in the [[1948 War of Independence]].\n\n=== Naxal Insurgency ===\nThe Naxal insurgency in West Bengal was the beginning of the rising of [[Maoism|Maoists]] in eastern India. The Naxals, begun their [[People's War]] through radical students in the city of Calcutta, however it continues today, having its bases in rural India and top universities. The area under maoist control has been viewed as a war zone and the group itself has been called the biggest threat to Indian Security by the Prime Minister.\n\n=== Khalistan Movement ===\nKhalistan movement was a movement initiated by the [[Sikh]]s of the Indian Punjab.

It had traditionally been perceived as a predominately counterterrorism (CT) effort used to fight violent extremist organizations, but that under the IWA the skills will be applied to all areas of military competition.

In 1443 he rallied [[Albanians|Albanian]] forces and drove the Turks from his homeland. Skanderbeg fought a guerrilla war against invading armies up to 20 times larger than his, by using the mountainous terrain to his advantage. He harassed the vast Ottoman army with small \"hit and run\" units, as well as using feint retreats followed by sudden counterattacks, and other tactics unknown in warfare up to then.

In the 17th century Ireland, Irish irregulars called [[tories]] and [[rapparees]] used guerrilla warfare in the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] and the [[Williamite war in Ireland]]. [[Finland|Finnish]] guerrillas, [[Sissi (Finnish guerrilla)|''sissis'']], fought against Russian occupation troops in the [[Great Northern War]], 1710\u20131721. The Russians retaliated brutally against the civilian populace; the period is called [[Greater Wrath|''Isoviha'' (Grand Hatred)]] in Finland.\n\n== Long 18th century (1700\u20131815) ==\n=== North America Colonial Wars ===\n\nIn North America, one of the earliest recorded instances of guerrilla warfare was [[Apalachee]] resistance to the Spanish during the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]] in 1528 in present-day [[Florida]].\n\nIn the mid 17th century the Colonists of New France were in conflict with the Iroquois Confederacy. Iroquois forces used hit and run tactics, harassment and avoided costly pitched battles. The colonists of New France began calling these Indian tactics La Petite Guerre because the tactics were meant for raiding as opposed to pitched battles. Under the tutelage of Wendake, Wobanaki, Algonquin and Ottawa tutors the habitants of New France learned La Petite Guerre and successfully used them against the Iroquois.\n\nLed by Major [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]], New Englanders had also been adopting Indian scouting and raiding tactics since [[King Philip's War]]. Throughout the four [[French and Indian Wars]], starting in the late 17th century Canadiens, the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]], and some [[Acadians]] brought La Petite Guerre to New England and the Ohio Valley. In present-day Maine, Father [[Sebastian Rale]] led the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] in a [[Father Rale's War|petite guerre]] along the New England/ Acadia border. A generation later, in [[Nova Scotia]], Father [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]] led the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] and the [[Acadians]] in a [[Father Le Loutre's War|petite guerre]] behind Anglo-American lines in the lead up to the last [[French and Indian War]].<ref>John Grenier.

British military leaders like Jeffery Amherst, John Forbes, and Henry Bouquet understood they needed to learn and adopt the techniques and tactics of the little war or be consumed, like Braddock. The British military establishment began adopting some of the tactics of La Petite Guerre as \"light infantry.\"<ref name=\"Horn\">Horn, Bernd ''The Canadian way of war:serving the national interest'', Dundurn Press Ltd., 2006, 21.</ref>\n\n=== American Revolution ===\nAlthough many of the engagements of the [[American Revolution]] were [[conventional warfare|conventional]], guerrilla warfare was used to a certain extent during this conflict from 1775\u20131783, which made a significant impact. Guerrilla tactics were first used at the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] by the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] at April 19, 1775. [[George Washington]] sometimes used some sort of unconventional methods to fight the British. During the [[Forage War]], George Washington sent [[militia]] units with limited [[Continental Army]] support to launch [[Raid (military)|raids]] and [[ambush]]es on British detachments and forage parties, the militia, and Continental Army support would skirmish with British detachments in small-scale battles and engagements. Throughout the Forage War, British casualties exceeded past 900. The Forage War raised morale for the Patriots as their guerrilla operations against the British were very effective. Next, there are other Americans that used [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit and run]] raids, ambushes, and surprise attacks against the British such as [[William R. Davie]], [[David Wooster]], [[Francis Marion]], Shadrach Inman, [[Daniel Morgan]], Morgan's [[riflemen]], and the [[Overmountain Men]]. All these American guerrilla fighters did their part by using unconventional tactics to fight the British and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]]. [[Nathanael Greene]] used a guerrilla strategy very effectively against [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]]. First, Nathanael Greene would keep retreating to lure the British far from their supply lines, then send out his forces to fight in small skirmishes and engagements with British detachments to weaken them. Then fighting the conventional battle, Nathanael Greene fought Lord Cornwallis at [[Battle of Guilford Court House|Guilford Court House]] and gave him a severe blow. Although Lord Cornwallis was the victor, his victory was [[Pyrrhic victory|pyrrhic]] as he had too many casualties that he could ill afford. [[Siege of Yorktown|After the British surrender at Yorktown]] and America gaining their independence, many of these Americans who used guerrilla tactics and strategies became immortalized and romanticized as time passed. Although guerrilla warfare was frequently used when avoiding battles, the Americans fought in conventional linear formations in decisive battles against the British. The American Revolution could be seen as a [[Hybrid warfare|hybrid war]] since both conventional and guerrilla warfare was used throughout its duration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n=== Vend\u00e9an Counter-Revolution ===\nFrom 1793\u20131796 a revolt broke out against the [[French Revolution]] by Catholic royalists in the Department of the [[Vend\u00e9e]]. This movement was intended to oppose the persecution endured by the Roman Catholic Church in revolutionary France (see [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution#The Revolution and the Church]]) and ultimately to restore the monarchy. Though ill-equipped and untrained in conventional military tactics, the Vend\u00e9an counter-revolution, known as the \"Royal Catholic Army,\" relied heavily on guerrilla tactics, taking full advantage of their intimate knowledge of the marsh filled, heavily forested countryside. Though the [[Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e]] was eventually \"pacified\" by government troops, their successes against the larger, better equipped republican army were notable.\n\nWorks such as ''\"La Vend\u00e9e\"'' by Anthony Trollope,<ref>https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/8vend10.txt</ref> G.A.

They were fought using mostly guerrilla-warfare tactics; however, several conventional battles also took place. Indigenous Australians led by [[Pemulwuy]], a resistance leader, also conducted raids around [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]], a western suburb in Sydney, during the period between 1795 and 1802. These attacks led Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] to issue an order in 1801 which authorized settlers to shoot Indigenous Australians on sight in Parramatta, [[Georges River]] and [[Prospect, New South Wales|Prospect]] areas. The wars resulted in the defeat of the Hawkesbury River and Nepean river Indigenous clans who were subsequently dispossessed of their lands.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10389b.htm|title=Pemulwuy (c. 1750 \u2013 1802)|last=Kohen|first=J.

This often led to some resistance by the local population if the army did not pay fair prices for products they consumed. Usually, this resistance was sporadic, and not very successful, so it is not classified as guerrilla action. There are three notable exceptions, though:\n* The rebellion of 1809 in [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] led by [[Andreas Hofer]].\n[[File:Assault on San Engracia monastery by Baron Lejeune.JPG|200px|thumb|''[[Siege of Saragossa (1809)|Siege of Saragossa]]'' : The assault on the ''San Engracia'' monastery.]]\n\n==== Napoleon's Invasion of Russia ====\nIn [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia]] of 1812 two actions could be seen as initiating guerrilla tactics. The [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|burning of Moscow]] after it had been occupied by Napoleon's [[Grand Army]], depriving the French of shelter in the city, resembled guerrilla action insofar as it was an attack on the available resources rather than directly on the troops (and insofar as it was a Russian action rather than an inadvertent consequence of nineteenth-century troops' camping in a largely abandoned city of wooden buildings). In a different sense, the imperial command that the Russian [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]] should attack the French resembled guerrilla tactics in its reliance on partisans rather than army regulars. This did not so much spark a guerrilla war as encourage a revengeful slaughter of French deserters by Russian peasants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tolstoy.thefreelibrary.com/War-and-Peace/14-3|title=Leo Tolstoy: War and Peace: Book Fourteen: 1812 \u2013 Chapter III \u2013 Free Online Library|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Meanwhile, Fieldmarshal Kutuzov permitted than-Hussar Lieutenant-Colonel [[Denis Davydov]] to open the Partisan War against the French communications. Davydov, Seslavin, Figner and others are since known in Russia as the 'Partisan Rangers of the Year '12' (Russian: \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044b [\u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b 18] '12-\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430). They were successful in their operations making the French troops unable to fight or even move, because of food and ammunition shortage, and not just because of the [[Russian Winter]] as is usually stated.\n\n==== Peninsular War ====\n[[File:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' by [[Francisco Goya]], showing Spanish resisters being executed by Napoleon's troops.]]\n\nIn the [[Peninsular War]] Spanish and Portuguese guerrillas tied down tens of thousands of French troops and killed hundreds of thousands. The continual losses of troops caused Napoleon to describe this conflict as his \"Spanish ulcer\". This was one of the most successful partisan wars in history and was where the word ''guerrilla'' was first used in this context. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] as the oldest known source, speaking of \"Guerrillas\" in 1809. Poet [[William Wordsworth]] showed a surprising early insight into guerrilla methods in his pamphlet on the [[Convention of Cintra]]:\n:\"It is manifest that, though a great army may easily defeat or disperse another army, less or greater, yet it is not in a like degree formidable to a determined people, nor efficient in a like degree to subdue them, or to keep them in subjugation\u2013much less if this people, like those of Spain in the present instance, be numerous, and, like them, inhabit a territory extensive and strong by nature. For a great army, and even several great armies, cannot accomplish this by marching about the country, unbroken, but each must split itself into many portions, and the several detachments become weak accordingly, not merely as they are small in size, but because the soldiery, acting thus, necessarily relinquish much of that part of their superiority, which lies in what may be called the engineer of war; and far more, because they lose, in proportion as they are broken, the power of profiting by the military skill of the Commanders, or by their own military habits. The experienced soldier is thus brought down nearer to the plain ground of the inexperienced, man to the level of man: and it is then, that the truly brave man rises, the man of good hopes and purposes; and superiority in moral brings with it superiority in physical power.\" (''William Wordsworth: Selected Prose'', [[Penguin Classics]] 1988, page 177-8.)\n\nThis war saw [[British Army|British]] and [[Portuguese Army|Portuguese]] forces using Portugal as a secure position to launch campaigns against the French army, while Spanish ''guerrilleros'' bled the occupiers. Gates notes that much of the French army \"was rendered unavailable for operations against Wellington because innumerable Spanish contingents kept materialising all over the country. In 1810, for example, when Massena invaded Portugal, the Imperial forces in the Peninsula totaled a massive 325,000 men, but only about one quarter of these could be spared for the offensive \u2013 the rest were required to contain the Spanish insurgents and regulars. This was the greatest single contribution that the Spaniards were to make and, without it, Wellington could not have maintained himself on the continent for long\u2014let alone emerge victorious from the conflict\".<ref>Gates, David (1986), The Spanish Ulcer: A History of the Peninsular War, Pimlico (published 2002), {{ISBN|0-7126-9730-6}}, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> Combined, the regular and [[irregular warfare|irregular]] allied forces prevented Napoleon's [[Marshal of France#French Empire|Marshals]] from subduing the rebellious Spanish provinces.<ref>Chandler, David G. (1995), ''The Campaigns of Napoleon'', Simon & Schuster, {{ISBN|0-02-523660-1}}</ref>\n\n====War of 1812====\nAlthough a great number of engagements were conventional, unconventional warfare was used to a certain extent by the Americans in their second conflict with the [[British Empire]]. This war has been a controversial subject to date between historians and scholars. But it cannot be denied that some [[Guerrilla Warfare|guerrilla]] actions did take place and expertly used by the Americans. For the Americans, while they fought the British conventionally head on. They have used some forms of unconventional warfare. Such as raiding, hit and run incursions, surprise attacks, and sometimes ambushes. Three commanders of the [[Regiment of Riflemen]] were fairly competent in some limited unconventional types of warfare against the British Empire such as [[Benjamin Forsyth]], [[Daniel Appling]], and [[Ludowick Morgan]]. Other Americans that used hit and run raids plus surprise incursions were [[Duncan MacArthur]], [[Alexander Smyth]], [[Andrew Holmes (army officer)|Andrew Holmes]], [[Daniel Bissell (general)|Daniel Bissell]], [[John B. Campbell]], and George McGlassin. But the United States also had amphibious like combatants that could be seen as guerrillas of the sea. These were either American naval commanders or privateers that raided British merchant shipping, raise British colors to surprise and capture British ships, or disguise one's ship as a harmless looking vessel with hidden riflemen to ambush/surprise unsuspecting British ships. These Americans were [[Melancthon Taylor Woolsey]], [[Otway Burns]], [[Thomas Boyle]], [[David Porter (naval officer)| David Porter]], [[Jesse Elliot]], [[John Percival]], [[John Ordronaux (privateer)|John ORdronaux]], and [[William Josephus Stafford]]. Next, the American militia which were famous for their forms of guerrilla warfare in the [[American Revolution]] were not used so effectively in the [[War of 1812]]. It has been reported that the militia were poorly utilized as conventional troops, poorly armed, underfunded, and poorly trained which made them significantly less effective than their [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary]] counter-parts. There has been other sources where American militias can set up some effective ambushes against British troops, sailors, or infantry. But with the American militia's poor status, they could do so little damage. However, if used carefully in a sophisticated way. They can be effective guerrilla fighters. One of the most notable commanders to use them effectively was [[Alexander Macomb (general)|Alexander Macomb]]. His exploits are mentioned in this book: The Battles at Plattsburgh: September 11, 1814 By Keith A. Herkalo. The history book mentioned how General Alexander Macomb had the American militia fire at the British from behind trees, rocks, and bushes while retreating or maneuvering around them in the woods in the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]. British or Canadian commanders quoted how the American militia were formidable and did not fight like gentlemen but firing from concealed positions behind trees and rocks. It was said that the American Militia with their guerrilla style fighting in this battle played an important role in America's victory of Plattsburgh. At the end of the war, American gained very little favorable results such as the defeat of their formidable native America foe [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]. But that was the only favorable result. Otherwise, America could only fight the British to a draw at the end of this conflict. It's debatable if any of these American combatant's guerrilla like actions had any impact on the outcome of the war, but they do provide good insight of lessons to be learned for future military commanders or historians yearning to learn the ways of military tactics and strategy.\n\n== 19th century (1815\u20131914) ==\n=== American Civil War ===\n{{Main|Guerrilla warfare in the American Civil War}}\n\nIrregular warfare in the [[American Civil War]] followed the patterns of irregular warfare in 19th century Europe. Structurally, irregular warfare can be divided into three different types conducted during the Civil War: 'People's War', 'partisan warfare', and 'raiding warfare'. The concept of 'People's war,' first described by [[Carl von Clausewitz]] in ''[[On War]]'', was the closest example of a mass guerrilla movement in the era. In general, this type of irregular warfare was conducted in the hinterland of the Border States (Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and northwestern Virginia), and was marked by a vicious neighbor-against-neighbor conflict. One such example was the opposing irregular forces operating in Missouri and northern Arkansas from 1862 to 1865, most of which were pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] or pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in name only and preyed on civilians and isolated military forces of both sides with little regard of politics. From these semi-organized guerrillas, several groups formed and were given some measure of legitimacy by their governments. [[Quantrill's Raiders]], who terrorized pro-Union civilians and fought Federal troops in large areas of Missouri and Kansas, was one such unit. Another notorious unit, with debatable ties to the Confederate military, was led by [[Champ Ferguson]] along the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Ferguson became one of the only figures of Confederate cause to be executed after the war. Dozens of other small, localized bands terrorized the countryside throughout the border region during the war, bringing total war to the area that lasted until the end of the Civil War and, in some areas, beyond.\n\nPartisan warfare, in contrast, more closely resembles Commando operations of the 20th century. Partisans were small units of conventional forces, controlled and organized by a military force for operations behind enemy lines. The 1862 [[Partisan Ranger Act]] passed by the Confederate Congress authorized the formation of these units and gave them legitimacy, which placed them in a different category than the common 'bushwhacker' or 'guerrilla'. [[John Singleton Mosby]] formed a partisan unit which was very effective in tying down Federal forces behind Union lines in northern Virginia in the last two years of the war.\n\nLastly, deep raids by conventional cavalry forces were often considered 'irregular' in nature. The \"Partisan Brigades\" of [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] and [[John Hunt Morgan]] operated as part of the cavalry forces of the [[Confederate Army of Tennessee]] in 1862 and 1863. They were given specific missions to destroy logistical hubs, railroad bridges, and other strategic targets to support the greater mission of the Army of Tennessee. By mid-1863, with the destruction of Morgan's raiders during the [[Morgan's Raid|Great Raid of 1863]], the Confederacy conducted few deep cavalry raids in the latter years of the war, mostly because of the losses in experienced horsemen and the offensive operations of the Union army. Federal cavalry conducted several successful raids during the war but in general used their cavalry forces in a more conventional role. A good exception was the 1863 [[Grierson's Raid]], which did much to set the stage for General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s victory during the [[Vicksburg Campaign]].\n\nFederal counter-guerrilla operations were very successful in preventing the success of Confederate guerrilla warfare. In [[Arkansas]], Federal forces used a wide variety of strategies to defeat irregulars. These included the use of Arkansas Unionist forces as anti-guerrilla troops, the use of riverine forces such as gunboats to control the waterways, and the [[provost marshal]] military law enforcement system to spy on suspected guerrillas and to imprison those captured. Against Confederate raiders, the Federal army developed an effective cavalry themselves and reinforced that system by numerous blockhouses and fortification to defend strategic targets.\n\nHowever, Federal attempts to defeat Mosby's Partisan Rangers fell short of success because of Mosby's use of very small units (10\u201315 men) operating in areas considered friendly to the Rebel cause. Another regiment known as the \"Thomas Legion\", consisting of white and anti-Union [[Cherokee]] Indians, morphed into a guerrilla force and continued fighting in the remote mountain back-country of western [[North Carolina]] for a month after Lee's surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]]. That unit was never completely suppressed by Union forces, but voluntarily ceased hostilities after capturing the town of [[Waynesville, North Carolina|Waynesville]] on May 10, 1865.\n\nIn the late 20th century several historians have focused on the non-use of guerrilla warfare to prolong the war. Near the end of the war, there were those in the Confederate government, notably [[Jefferson Davis]] who advocated continuing the southern fight as a guerrilla conflict. He was opposed by generals such as [[Robert E. Lee]] who ultimately believed that surrender and reconciliation were better than guerrilla warfare.\n\nSee also [[Bushwhackers]] (Union and Confederate) and [[Jayhawkers]] (Union).\n\n=== South African War ===\nGuerrilla tactics were used extensively by the forces of the [[Boer]] republics in the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War|Second]] Boer Wars in South Africa (1880\u20131881; 1899\u20131902) against the invading British Army. In the [[First Boer War]], the [[Boer]] [[commandos]] wore their everyday dull-coloured farming clothes. The Boers relied more on stealth and speed than discipline and formation and, being expert marksmen using smokeless ammunition, the Boer were able to easily snipe at British troops from a distance. So the British Army relaxed their close-formation tactics. The British Army had changed to [[Khaki]] uniforms, first used by the [[British Indian Army]], a decade earlier, and officers were soon ordered to dispense with gleaming buttons and buckles which made them conspicuous to snipers.\n\nIn the third phase of the [[Second Boer War]], after the British defeated the Boer armies in conventional warfare and occupied their capitals of [[Pretoria]] and [[Bloemfontein]], Boer commandos reverted to mobile warfare. Units led by leaders such as [[Jan Smuts]] and [[Christiaan de Wet]] harassed slow-moving British columns and attacked railway lines and encampments. The Boers were almost all mounted and possessed long range magazine loaded rifles. This gave them the ability to attack quickly and cause many casualties before retreating rapidly when British reinforcements arrived. In the early period of the guerrilla war, Boer commandos could be very large, containing several thousand men and even field artillery. However, as their supplies of food and ammunition gave out, the Boers increasingly broke up into smaller units and relied on captured British arms, ammunition, and uniforms.\n\nTo counter these tactics, the British under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] interned Boer civilians into [[Second Boer War#Concentration camps (1900\u20131902)|concentration camps]] and built hundreds of blockhouses all over the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and [[Orange Free State]]. Kitchener also enacted a [[scorched earth]] policy, destroying Boer homes and farms. Eventually, the Boer guerrillas surrendered in 1902, but the British granted them generous terms in order to bring the war to an end. This showed how effective guerrilla tactics could be in extracting concessions from a militarily more powerful enemy.\n\n=== Philippine\u2013American War ===\nAt the start of the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], even with the recommendation of the able General [[Antonio Luna]], guerrilla warfare strategy was viewed by the Philippine side only as a tactical option of final recourse. This led to subsequent defeat of the Filipino forces in the early stages of the war mainly due to superior American weaponry and troops. Guerrilla warfare was only used as a main strategy on November 13, 1899 which made American occupation of the Philippine archipelago all the more difficult over the next few years. This can be greatly seen by the Moro insurrection at the southern province of the Philippines wherein Moro rebels will conceal themselves in the thick Philippine jungle and will charge American troops with only [[Bolo knife|bolo knives]] in overwhelming numbers at the opportune time. These led the American weapons manufacturers to develop the famed [[M1911 pistol]].\n\n=== War of the Pacific ===\n{{Main|Andr\u00e9s Avelino C\u00e1ceres}}\nDuring the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883) the Peruvian General [[Andres Avelino Caceres]] fought a three-year guerrilla war against the victorious Chilean army in the Andean Region of Peru from 1881 to 1883 ([[La Bre\u00f1a Campaign]]); this campaign was later studied in the Austrian [[Theresian Military Academy]] as an excellent illustration of successful mountain warfare.\n\n=== Mexican Revolution ===\nIn the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1910 to 1920, the populist revolutionary leader [[Emiliano Zapata]] employed the use of predominantly guerrilla tactics. His forces, composed entirely of peasant farmers turned soldiers, wore no uniform and would easily blend into the general population after an operation's completion. They would have young soldiers, called \"dynamite boys\", hurl cans filled with explosives into enemy barracks, and then a large number of lightly armed soldiers would emerge from the surrounding area to attack it. Although Zapata's forces met considerable success, his strategy backfired as government troops, unable to distinguish his soldiers from the [[civilian]] population, waged a broad and brutal campaign against the latter.\n\n=== Brigandage in south Italy ===\n[[File:Banda del Brigante Totaro di San Fele.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Band of south Italian brigands in [[Basilicata]], during the Italian unification]]\n{{Main|Brigandage in the Two Sicilies}}\nAfter the [[Italian unification]] in 1860, many bands composed mainly by peasants emerged in [[Southern Italy]]. The sources of the trouble were the carelessness of the new government toward the problems of the southern laborers, higher taxes and higher prices of basic necessities, mandatory military service who subtracted youths from the workforce and the economical benefits reserved only for the [[bourgeois]] society. In this period thousands of poors took the way of brigandage. The most well known brigand was [[Carmine Crocco]], a former soldier in the service of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] who formed an army of two thousand men. Crocco was renowned for his [[guerrilla]] tactics, which were enhanced by the same royal soldiers who chased him. His warfare included cutting water supplies, destroying flour-mills, cutting telegraph wires and ambushing stragglers.<ref>John Ellis, ''A short history of guerrilla warfare'', p.83</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n* In 1848, both ''[[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]]'' and [[United Irishman (1848 newspaper)|''The United Irishman'']] advocated guerrilla warfare to overthrow English rule in Ireland, though no actual warfare took place.\n* The [[Poland|Poles]] and [[Lithuania]]ns used guerrilla warfare during the [[January Uprising]] of 1863\u20131865, against the [[Russian Empire]].\n* In the 19th century, peoples of the [[Balkans]] used guerrilla tactics to fight the [[Ottoman empire]].\n* the north African Muslims uprisings against the colonial powers after second world war.\n* guerrilla warfare tactics were first applied in India by Sher Shah Suri or even before the Khuwar zam Shah against the Mongol.\n* During the early stages of the [[Franco-Prussian war]], the [[Francs-tireurs]] conducted guerrilla warfare against the occupying [[Prussian Army]].\n\n== World Wars (1914\u20131945) ==\n=== Irish War of Independence and Civil War ===\n[[File:Hogan's Flying Column.gif|300px|thumb|IRA Flying Column during the [[Irish War of Independence]].]]\nThe wars between Ireland and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|British]] state have been long, and over the centuries have covered the full spectrum of the types of warfare. The Irish fought the first successful 20th century war of independence against the British Empire and the United Kingdom. After the military failure of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916, the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) used guerrilla tactics involving both [[urban guerrilla]] warfare and [[flying column]]s in the countryside during the [[Irish War of Independence]] of 1919 to 1922. Many were inspired by the fabled exploits of the 1799\u20131803 guerilla campaign by [[Michael Dwyer]] after the failed [[1798 rebellion]].\n\nThe chief IRA commanders in the localities during this period were [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]], [[Seamus Robinson (Irish Republican)|Seamus Robinson]], [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch]], [[Se\u00e1n Mac Eoin]], and [[Tom Maguire]].\n[[File:Dwyer.jpg|thumb|120px|left|<center>[[Michael Dwyer]]</center>]]\n\nThe IRA guerrilla was of considerable intensity in parts of the country, notably in [[Dublin]] and in areas such as [[County Cork]], [[County Kerry]] and [[County Mayo]] in the south and west. Despite this, the Irish fighters were never in a position to either hold territory or take on British forces in a conventional manner. Even the largest engagements of the conflict, such as the [[Kilmichael Ambush]] or [[Crossbarry Ambush]] constituted mere skirmishes by the standards of a conventional war. Another aspect of the war, particularly in the north-eastern part of the province of [[Ulster]], was communal violence. The Unionist majority there, who were largely Protestant and loyal to Britain were granted control over the security forces there, in particular the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] and used them to attack the Nationalist (and largely Catholic) population in reprisal for IRA actions. Elsewhere in Ireland, where Unionists were in a minority, they were sometimes attacked by the IRA for aiding the British forces. The extent to which the conflict was an inter-communal one as well as war of national liberation is still strongly debated in Ireland. The total death toll in the war came to a little over 2000 people.\n\nBy mid-1921, the military and political costs of maintaining the British security forces in Ireland eventually proved too heavy for the British government. In July 1921, the UK government agreed to a truce with the IRA and agreed to meet representatives of the Irish [[First Dail]], who since the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 General Election]] held seventy-three of the one hundred and five parliamentary seats for the island. Negotiations led to a settlement, the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. It created the [[Irish Free State]] of 26 counties as a [[dominion]] within the [[British Empire]]; the other 6 counties remained part of the UK as [[Northern Ireland]].\n\n[[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Irish Republican Army]] split into pro- and anti-Treaty factions with the [[Anti-Treaty IRA]] forces losing the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922\u201323) which followed. The partition of Ireland laid the seeds for the later [[Troubles]]. The Irish Civil War is a striking example of the failure of guerrilla tactics when used against a relatively popular native regime. Following their failure to hold fixed positions against an [[Irish Free State offensive]] in the summer of 1922, the IRA re-formed \"flying columns\" and attempted to [[Guerrilla Phase of the Irish Civil War|use the same tactics]] they had successfully used against the British. However, against Irish troops, who knew them and the terrain and faced with the hostility of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the majority of [[Irish nationalist]] opinion, they were unable to sustain their campaign. In addition, the Free State government, confident of its legitimacy among the Irish population, sometimes used more ruthless and effective measures of repression than the British had felt able to employ. Whereas the British executed 14 IRA men in 1919\u20131922, the Free State executed 77 anti-treaty prisoners officially and its troops killed another 150 prisoners or so in the field (see [[Executions during the Irish Civil War]]). The Free State also [[internment|interned]] 12,000 Republicans, compared with the British figure of 4,500. The last anti-Treaty guerrillas abandoned their military campaign against the Free State after nine months in March 1923.\n\n=== World War I ===\nIn a successful campaign in [[German East Africa]], the German commander [[Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck]] fought against the numerically superior allied forces. Even though he was cut off from Germany and had few Germans under his command (most of his fighters were African [[askari]]s), he won multiple victories during the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East Africa Campaign]] and managed to exhaust and trouble the Allies; he was undefeated up until his acceptance of a cease-fire in [[Northern Rhodesia]] three days after the end of the war in Europe. He returned to Germany as a hero.\n\nMajor guerrilla war was fought by the Arabs against the [[Ottoman Turks]] during the [[Arab Revolt]] (1916\u20131918). Attacking the Hejaz Railway to disrupt Ottman forces is a strategy often credited to the British officer T.E. Lawrence.<ref>[[Arab Revolt#1916: T. E. Lawrence]]</ref>\n\nAnother guerrilla war opposed the German Occupation of [[Ukraine]] in 1918 and partisan and guerrilla forces fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites during the [[Russian Civil War]]. This fighting continued into 1921 in Ukraine, in Tambov province, and in parts of Siberia. Other guerrillas opposed the Japanese occupation of the Russian Far East.\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nDespite a common misconception, both Nationalist and Communist forces maintained active underground resistance in Japanese-occupied areas during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Even before the outbreak of total war in 1937, partisans were already present in [[Manchuria]] hampering Japan's occupation of the region. After the initial phases of the war, when large swaths of the [[North China Plain]] rapidly fell to the Japanese, underground resistance, supported by either Communist sympathizers or composed of disguised Nationalist soldiers, would soon rise up to combat the garrison forces. They were quite successful, able to sabotage railroad routes and ambush reinforcements. Many major campaigns, such as the four failed invasions of [[Changsha]], were caused by overly-stretched supply lines, lack of reinforcements, and ambushes by irregulars. The Communist cells, many having decades of prior experience in guerrilla warfare against the Nationalists, usually fared much better, and many Nationalist underground groups were subsequently absorbed into Communist ones. Usually, in Japanese-occupied areas, the IJA only controlled the cities and railroad routes, with most of them countryside either left alone or with active guerrilla presence. The [[People's Republic of China]] has emphasized their contribution to the Chinese war effort, going as far to say that in addition to an \"overt theatre\", which in many cases they deny was effective, there was also a \"covert theatre\", which they claim did much to stop the Japanese advance.\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:Soviet guerilla.jpg|thumb|right|[[Soviet partisan]] fighters behind German lines in [[Belarus]] in 1943. At least 5,295 Belarusian settlements were destroyed by the Nazis. In total, one-quarter of the Belarusian population was killed in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khatyn.by/en/genocide/expeditions/|title=\"Khatyn\" - Genocide policy \u2013 Punitive operations|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>]]\n[[File: AK-soldiers Parasol Regiment Warsaw Uprising 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Poles|Polish]] guerrillas from [[Batalion Zo\u015bka]] dressed in stolen German uniforms and armed with stolen weapons, fighting in the [[Warsaw Uprising]], the largest anti-Nazi guerrilla warfare in Europe.]]\nMany clandestine organizations (often known as [[resistance movement]]s) operated in the countries occupied by [[German Reich]] during the Second World War. These organizations began forming as early as 1939 when, after the defeat of [[Poland]], the members of what would become the Polish [[Home Army]] began to gather. In March 1940, a partisan unit of the first [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] commanders in the Second World War in Europe under Major [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]] \"Hubal\" completely destroyed a [[battalion]] of German infantry in a skirmish near the village of [[Huciska]].<ref>Marek Szymanski: Oddzial Majora Hubala, Warszawa 1999, {{ISBN|83-912237-0-1}}</ref>\n\nA guerrilla movement in [[Ethiopia]] was formed to rout out Italian forces as early as 1935. Other clandestine organizations operated in [[Danish resistance movement|Denmark]], [[Belgian resistance|Belgium]], [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norway]], [[French resistance|France (Resistance)]], [[Maquis (WW2)|France (Maquis)]], [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation|Czechoslovakia]], [[Slovak National Uprising|Slovakia]], [[Chetniks|Yugoslavia (Royalist Chetniks)]], [[National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia (Partisans)]], [[Soviet partisans|Soviet Union]], [[Italian resistance movement|Italy]], [[Albanian resistance during World War II|Albania]] and [[Greek Resistance|Greece]]. From the second half of 1944, the total forces of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Partisans numbered over 500,000 men organized in four [[field army|field armies]], which engaged in conventional warfare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/yugoslavia/army/|title=Armies|author=Ivan Bajlo|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> By 1944 the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] was thought to number 600,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/poland/15.htm|title=Poland \u2013 World War II|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> Many of these organizations received help from the British operated [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) which along with the [[British Commando|commandos]] was initiated by [[Winston Churchill]] to \"set Europe ablaze.\" The SOE was originally designated as 'Section D' of [[MI6]] but its aid to resistance movements to start fires clashed with MI6's primary role as an intelligence-gathering agency. When Britain was under threat of invasion, SOE trained [[Auxiliary Units]] to conduct guerrilla warfare in the event of invasion. Even the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] were trained in guerrilla warfare in the case of invasion of England.\n\nOsterley Park was the first of 3 such schools established to train the Home Guard. Not only did SOE help the resistance to tie down many German units as garrison troops, so directly aiding the conventional war effort, but also guerrilla incidents in occupied countries were useful in the propaganda war, helping to repudiate German claims that the occupied countries were pacified and broadly on the side of the Germans. Despite these minor successes, many historians believe that the efficacy of the European resistance movements has been greatly exaggerated in popular novels, films and other media.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nContrary to popular belief, in the Western and [[Southern Europe]] the resistance groups were only able to seriously counter the German in areas that offered the protection of rugged terrain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} In relatively flat, open areas, such as France, the resistance groups were all too vulnerable to decimation by German regulars and pro-German collaborators.

They were formed to put into effect [[Orde Wingate]]'s newly developed [[guerilla warfare]] tactic of [[long range penetration]].\n\nThe Japanese military themselves also used guerrilla warfare during the later part of the Pacific War, when Japan's resource was already dwindling and the Allies have started invading. [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] famously used guerrilla warfare during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], where the general used network of tunnels and caves to attack American forces. His tactic was somewhat successful, delaying the Americans from taking Iwo Jima for 36 days.

However, this is a simplification of a much more complex situation which followed the pattern outlined by Maoist theory.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|National Liberation Front]] (NLF), drawing its ranks from the South Vietnamese peasantry and working class, used guerrilla tactics in the early phases of the war. However, by 1965 when U.S. involvement escalated, the National Liberation Front was in the process of being supplanted by regular units of the [[North Vietnamese Army]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[North Vietnamese Army|NVA]] regiments organized along traditional military lines, were supplied via the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] rather than living off the land, and had access to weapons such as [[tank]]s and [[artillery]] which are not normally used by guerrilla forces. Furthermore, parts of North Vietnam were \"off-limits\" by American bombardment for political reasons, giving the NVA personnel and their material a haven that does not usually exist for a guerrilla army.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nOver time, more of the fighting was conducted by the North Vietnamese Army and the character of the war become increasingly conventional. The final offensive into [[South Vietnam]] in 1975 was a mostly conventional military operation in which guerrilla warfare played a minor, supporting role.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe [[Cu Chi Tunnels]] (''\u00d0\u1ecba \u0111\u1ea1o C\u1ee7 Chi'') was a major base for guerrilla warfare during the Vietnam War. Located about 60&nbsp;km northwest of Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), the Viet Cong (NLF) used the complex system tunnels to hide and live during the day and come up to fight at night.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThroughout the Vietnam War, the Communist Party closely supervised all levels of the conflict. The bulk of the VC/NLF were initially southerners, with some distinctive southern issues and sensibilities. Nevertheless, the VC/NLF was associated with the Northern Lao Dong Party which furnished it with supplies, weaponry and trained cadres, including regular NVA/PAVN troops. The Southern Communist party, the Peoples Revolutionary Party (PRP) organized in 1962, to participate in the insurgency, and COVSN, Central Office for Southern Vietnam, which partially controlled military activity. The general replacement of CV irregulars with NVA troops supplanted the original VC goals with those proposed by the NVA. As the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] was primarily a VC operation in which large numbers of VC fighters were killed, increasing the role of the NVA in the war effort.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThis is a set of tactics which were used frequently in the Vietnam War by the NVA.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==== Within Laos ====\n{{See also|Laotian Civil War}}\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]] raised a [[Operation Momentum|guerrilla army]] to oppose PAVN invaders of the [[Kingdom of Laos]]. Consisting principally [[Hmong (people)|Hmong hill tribesmen]], ''L'Armee Clandestine'' under General [[Vang Pao]] was the only guerrilla army to ever enjoy [[air supremacy]]. It fought the Vietnamese regulars from 1961\u20131975 before reduced numbers and dwindling American support led to their defeat.<ref>Conboy, Kenneth and James Morrison (1995).

The Afghan side was a collection of tribes who initially fought with obsolete weapons such as rifles from the 19th century or the First World War. The resistance fighters were known collectively as the Mujahideen. The United States started to support the Afghanistan resistance with gradually more potent weapons and eventually anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles which then would cause so much damage to the far larger Soviet army that the Soviet Union abandoned its occupation and retreated back to the Soviet Union.\n\n=== Bangladesh Liberation War ===\n[[Mukti Bahini]] ({{lang-bn|\u09ae\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf \u09ac\u09be\u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09c0}} \"Liberation Army\") collectively refers to the armed organizations who fought against the [[Pakistan Army]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. It was dynamically formed by (mostly) Bengali regulars and civilians after the proclamation of independence for [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Pakistan]]) on March 26, 1971. Subsequently, by mid-April 1971 the former members of East Pakistan armed forces formed the \"Bangladesh Armed Forces\" and [[M A G Osmani]] assumed the command of the same. The civilian groups continued to assist the armed forces during the war. After the war \"Mukti Bahini\" became the general term to refer to all forces (military and civilian) of former East Pakistani origin fighting against the Pakistani armed forces during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Often Mukti Bahini operated as an effective guerrilla force to keep their enemies on the run. It has been compared to the French [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], the [[Viet Cong]], and the [[Yugoslav Partisans|guerrillas]] of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in their tactics and effectiveness.<ref>[http://www.defencejournal.com/apr99/bangladesh.htm WHY THE MOVEMENT FOR BANGLADESH SUCCEEDED: A military appreciation] by Mumtaz Iqbal</ref>\n\n=== Northern Ireland conflict ===\nIn the late 1960s [[the Troubles]] began again in [[Northern Ireland]].

The theory was that a harsh military regime would oppress the [[middle class]]es who would then support the guerrillas and create a popular uprising.\n\nWhile these movements did destabilize governments, such as [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Peru]] to the point of military intervention, the military generally proceeded to completely wipe out the guerrilla movements, usually committing several atrocities among both civilians and armed insurgents in the process.\n\nSeveral other [[left-wing]] guerrilla movements, sometimes backed by [[Cuba]], attempted to overthrow US-backed governments or [[right-wing]] military [[dictatorship]]s. US-backed [[Contras|Contra]] guerrillas attempted to overthrow the left-wing [[Sandinista]] government of Nicaragua. The Sandinista Revolution saw the involvement of [[Women and the Armed Struggle in Nicaragua]].\n\n===Algeria ===\n=== Iran\u2013Iraq War ===\nDuring the eight-year [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], irregular warfare was used against Iraqi military. The Iranian [[Irregular Warfare Headquarters]], the [[65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade]] of Iranian Army, and [[Peshmerga]] of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] were involved.\n\n== Since 1990 ==\n=== Europe since 2000 ===\nThe [[History of Modern Greece|Greek]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November|17 November]] disbanded around 2002 following the capture and imprisonment of much of its leadership.\n\nThe ongoing war between pro-independence groups in [[Chechnya]] and the Russian government is currently the most active guerrilla war in Europe. Most of the incidents reported by the Western news media are very gory terrorist acts against Russian civilians committed by Chechen separatists outside Chechnya. However, within Chechnya the war has many of the characteristics of a classic guerrilla war. See the article [[History of Chechnya]] for more details.\n\nIn [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Real Irish Republican Army]] and the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army]], two small, radical splinter groups who broke with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], continue to exist. They are dwarfed in size by the Provisional IRA and have been less successful in terms of both popularity among Irish republicans and guerrilla activity: The Continuity IRA has failed to carry out any killings, while the Real IRA's only attacks resulting in deaths were the 1998 [[Omagh bombing]], which killed 29 civilians, a [[booby trap]] torch bomb in [[Derry]] which killed a former [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] soldier, and a 2009 attack on a Northern Ireland military installation which killed 2 British soldiers and wounded several others.\n\n=== Iran ===\nAfter [[1979 Revolution]], the [[Iran]]ian Defence Minister [[Mostafa Chamran]] established the [[Irregular Warfare Headquarters]] as part of the [[Iranian Armed Forces]]. He employed the force against [[Iraq]]i military during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. The unit was later disbanded.\n\n=== Iraq (2003-2011) ===\nMany guerrilla tactics are used by the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]] against the U.S.-led coalition. Such tactics include the bombing of vehicles and human targets, [[suicide bombing]]s, [[ambushes]], sniper attacks, and traditional hit and run raids. Although it is unclear how many U.S. casualties can be attributed to insurgent guerrilla action because of the high numbers of non-combat related injuries and deaths being included in all available statistics of total coalition casualties,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} it is estimated that they have injured more than 18,000 coalition troops and killed over 3,900, including more than 3,000 U.S. soldiers.

When the British restricted Jewish immigration to the region (see [[White Paper of 1939]]), Jewish immigrants began to use guerrilla warfare against the British for two purposes: to bring in more Jewish refugees, and to turn the tide of British sentiment at home. Jewish groups such as the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] and the [[Irgun]] \u2013 many of whom had experience in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|Warsaw Ghetto battles]] against the Nazis, fought British soldiers whenever they could, including the [[King David Hotel Bombing|bombing of the King David Hotel]]. They also conducted attacks against the Arabs, and prepared the infrastructure for the coming 1948 conflict.\n\nThe Jewish irregular forces were fighting the British Empire, which had just emerged victorious from World War II. Some of these groups were amalgamated into the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and subsequently fought in the [[1948 War of Independence]].\n\n=== Naxal Insurgency ===\nThe Naxal insurgency in West Bengal was the beginning of the rising of [[Maoism|Maoists]] in eastern India. The Naxals, begun their [[People's War]] through radical students in the city of Calcutta, however it continues today, having its bases in rural India and top universities. The area under maoist control has been viewed as a war zone and the group itself has been called the biggest threat to Indian Security by the Prime Minister.\n\n=== Khalistan Movement ===\nKhalistan movement was a movement initiated by the [[Sikh]]s of the Indian Punjab. The Punjab region is of historical and religious significance for Sikhs and was contested during the separation of [[British India|United India]].

It had traditionally been perceived as a predominately counterterrorism (CT) effort used to fight violent extremist organizations, but that under the IWA the skills will be applied to all areas of military competition.

Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force. Five infantry battalions will undertake the new specialist infantry role; these units will provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas, and will number around 300 personnel.

Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties. These battalions will periodically rotate roles and postings.\n\n====Scottish Division====\nThe six battalions of the Scottish Division have amalgamated into a single five battalion regiment to be called the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]].\n*Armoured Infantry ([[The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)|4 SCOTS]]) - 1\n*Light Role ([[Royal Scots Borderers|1 SCOTS]], [[Royal Highland Fusiliers|2 SCOTS]], [[Black Watch|3 SCOTS]]) - 3\n*Air Assault/Light Role ([[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|5 SCOTS]]) - 1\n\n====King's Division====\nThe six battalions of the King's Division have amalgamated into two regiments;\n*[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)]] - this is a two battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[King's Own Royal Border Regiment]], [[King's Regiment]] and [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]].\n**Mechanised Infantry (1 LANCS) - 1\n**Light Role (2 LANCS) - 1\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment]] - this is a three battalion regiment formed from the amalgamation of the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]], [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]].\n**Armoured Infantry ([[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|3 YORKS]]) - 1\n**Light Role ([[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire|1 YORKS]], [[Green Howards|2 YORKS]])- 2\n\n====Prince of Wales's Division====\nThe original seven battalions of the Prince of Wales's Division have been reduced to five with the transfer of the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] and the [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]] to the Light Division.

These two were amalgamated into a single battalion and then amalgamated with [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]] and the [[Royal Green Jackets]] to form a new five battalion regiment, called [[The Rifles]]. On its formation, the Light Division was abolished.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/rifles_hq/sitrep_2.htm The Rifles - March 2006 situation report 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515082627/http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/rifles_hq/sitrep_2.htm |date=15 May 2006 }}</ref>\n*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Role (2 RIFLES, 3 RIFLES) - 2\n*Mechanised Infantry (4 RIFLES) - 1\n*Commando (1 RIFLES) - 1\n\n====Other infantry regiments====\n\n* The single regular battalion of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] is unamalgamated to \"retain an infantry footprint in Northern Ireland\".\n**Air Assault/Light Role (1 R IRISH) - 1\n* The [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] is unaffected by the restructuring.

The Guards Division has The London Regiment as an affiliated TA battalion.\n\n===Strategic Defence and Security Review (2010)/Army 2020===\n{{main|Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010|Army 2020}}\nFollowing the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]], the new government instituted a new defence review. The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force. Five infantry battalions will undertake the new specialist infantry role; these units will provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas, and will number around 300 personnel. Four of these battalions, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland; 2nd Battalion, The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment; 2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment; and 4th Battalion, The Rifles, will be existing battalions, while the fifth will be formed as a new battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-12-15/HCWS367/|title=Strategic Defence and Security Review - Army: Written statement - HCWS367|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/defence-committee/sdsr-2015-and-the-army/oral/34418.html|title=Oral evidence: SDSR 2015 and the Army, HC 108|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.janes.com/article/81826/uk-to-recruit-more-gurkha-soldiers |title=UK to recruit more Gurkha soldiers |last=Ripley |first=Tim |date=18 July 2018|website=Jane's 360 |publisher= |access-date=20 July 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n====Guards Division====\n*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (1 SG) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 COLDM GDS, 1 IG) - 2\n*Light Role/Public Duties (1 GREN GDS, 1 WG) - 2\n*Public Duties (2 GREN GDS, 2 COLDM GDS, 2 SG){{ref|Alpha|\u03b1}}\n*Army Reserve (LONDONS) - 1\n<small>All five battalions will periodically rotate roles</small>\n\n====Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 R WELSH) - 1\n*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (4 SCOTS) - 1\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (3 SCOTS, 1 R IRISH) - 2\n*Light Role Infantry (2 SCOTS) - 1\n*Specialised Training Infantry (1 SCOTS) - 1\n*Public Duties - (5 SCOTS){{ref|Alpha|\u03b1}}\n*Army Reserve - (6 SCOTS, 7 SCOTS, 3 R WELSH, 2 R IRISH) - 4\n\n====King's Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 YORKS, 1 MERCIAN) - 2\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (2 YORKS) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 LANCS, 2 MERCIAN) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (2 LANCS) - 1\n*Army Reserve (4 LANCS, 4 YORKS, 4 MERCIAN) - 3\n\n====Queen's Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 PWRR, 1 RRF) - 2\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (2 R ANGLIAN) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 R ANGLIAN) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (Home Defence) (1 RG) - 1\n*Specialised Training Infantry (2 PWRR) - 1\n*Army Reserve (3 PWRR, 4 PWRR, 5 RRF, 3 R ANGLIAN) - 4\n\n====The Rifles====\n*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (3 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 RIFLES, 2 RIFLES) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (4 RIFLES) - 1\n*Army Reserve (6 RIFLES, 7 RIFLES, 8 RIFLES) - 3\n\n====Other infantry regiments====\n*Light Role Infantry (1 RGR, 2 RGR) - 2\n*Parachute Infantry (2 PARA, 3 PARA, 4 PARA) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (3 RGR) - 1\n<small>:{{note|Alpha|\u03b1}} These are the battalions represented by the [[British Army incremental infantry companies|four incremental companies]]</small>\n\n==Other regiments==\n\n===Disbanded regiments===\nOver time, a handful of infantry regiments have disappeared from the roll through disbandment rather than amalgamation.
