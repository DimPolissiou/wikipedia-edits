[[Argentina|Argentine]] [[president (government title)|president]] [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] was the driving force behind the creation of the circuit, after seeing the success of the country's own [[Juan Manuel Fangio]].\n\n==Origins and history==\nThe [[Buenos Aires Grand Prix (motor racing)|Buenos Aires Grand Prix]] was an event first started in 1930 as a sportscar event held at the Costanera circuit until 1940 and switched to the Retiro circuit for 1941. After a six-year break and by then [[Juan Peron]] in office, racing resumed in 1947 at [[Circuito Retiro|Retiro]] with the start of the South American \"Temporada\" Grand Prix series, competing twice that year under the [[Formula Libre]] regulations. Italian Luigi Villoresi won all 1947 Temporada events. The race regularly attracted Brazilian and European drivers and also Argentine drivers competing in Europe, such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]]. For the 1948 Grand Prix season, the race was moved to the [[Circuito Palermo|Palermo]] circuit where it would remain to host six of twelve \"Peron Cup\" races until the end of 1950. In 1951, the Costanera Norte circuit would host its last three Grand Prix events before completion of the [[Autodromo Juan y Oscar Galvez|Autodromo 17 de Octubre]] (October 17), a purpose-built circuit where the championship Formula One Argentine Grand Prix was held on different variants of the facility from 1953 to 1960, 1972 to 1981 and 1995 to 1998.\n\n===Buenos Aires===\n\nBuilt in 1952 on [[swamp]]land just outside [[Buenos Aires]], the circuit featured a white archway dedicated to the memory of Admiral [[William Brown (admiral)|William Brown]]. The circuit opened in March 1952 with the fifth edition of the \"Per\u00f3n Cup\", which was won by [[Juan Manuel Fangio]]<ref>[http://www.jmfangio.org/gp1952baires.htm 1952 Argentina \u2013 Gran Premio Presidente Per\u00f3n] jmfangio.org</ref> and in 1953, hosted the first Formula One race to be held in South America.\n\nThe track featured four different configurations for Grand Prix racing. From 1953 to 1960, the Argentine Grand Prix was held on the \"No. 2\" layout, clockwise for the all these years except 1954, when it was run counterclockwise. From 1971\u20131973 the race was held on the \"No. 9\" configuration, more or less the same as the \"No. 2\" configuration but for the section after Tobogan which was shortened and the Horquilla turn was made tighter and shorter. Then from 1974\u20131981 the race was run on the \"No. 15\" configuration, the longest and fastest layout that combined two very fast successive right and left hand corners with two long straights and a spectacular long and wide third corner (called the Curvon Salotto) into the infield section from the previous \"No. 9\" configuration. For the period from 1995 to 1998, the race was held on the twisty \"No. 6\" configuration using only the infield section with the \"S\" shaped \"Los Mixos chicane.\n\n====1953\u20131960====\n\nThe 1953 race saw Fangio retire his [[Maserati]] after 36 laps due to a transmission failure; [[Alberto Ascari]]'s victory for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] was overshadowed by an accident which killed nine people and injured many others due to overcrowding along the track. The race was heavily advertised and it is believed that around 400,000 people turned up for the event. The facility was so packed that people were standing on the edges of corners, inches away from the cars apexing the corners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/1953/53ra.html |title=1953 VII Gran Premio de la Republica Argentina|publisher=silhouet.com |date= |accessdate=April 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, the circuit was run in an anticlockwise direction, and Fangio did reach the top of the podium, winning his home Grand Prix on his second attempt; he would go on to win the next three Grands Prix in Argentina, one of which was the 1955 race. It was one of the hottest races on record, at 40C (104F) with track temperatures reaching 51C (122F). Fangio, now driving for Mercedes, was the only driver to complete the 96 laps, after three hours without handing his car over to another driver. One of his legs was badly burned by a chassis tube heated by the exhaust, an injury that forced a three-month recovery. In {{F1|1958}}, [[Stirling Moss]] took the win, in the penultimate race in Fangio's career. It was also the first Formula One championship victory for a rear or mid-engined car and the first for a privateer. New Zealander Bruce McLaren won in 1960. With Fangio's retirement and the disappearance of fellow Argentine driver [[Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], combined with unstable governments after the [[exile]] of Peron (in 1955), the Argentine Grand Prix disappeared from the F1 calendar in 1961 for over a decade.\n\n====1971\u20131981====\n\nA non-championship Formula One race was held at Buenos Aires in 1971, won by [[Chris Amon]] over two heats.<ref>[http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1971/1971.html 1971 Non Championship Formula One results] www.silhouet.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1971/1971.html |title=1971 Non Championship Formula One results|publisher=silhouet.com |date=|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statsf1.com/en/1971-hc/grand-prix-267.aspx |title=1971 \u2013 VIII Gran Premio de la Republica Argentina|publisher=statsf1.com |date=|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> In {{F1|1972}} the Argentine Grand Prix returned to the World Championship, with [[Carlos Reutemann]] emerging as the new home favorite. The variant used for these two years was similar to the one used before, except the straight leading into the hairpin after the Toboggan esses was shortened. Reutemann took [[pole position]] in his world championship debut, becoming only the second driver to achieve this feat.  The race was won by [[list of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|world champion]] [[Jackie Stewart]]. 1973 saw [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] take victory at the last part of the race from Frenchman [[Fran\u00e7ois Cevert]].\n\nFor 1974, the circuit used the faster and longer No. 15 circuit, which included two very fast and slightly banked corners that led into a section that went around a lake, which included a 3000&nbsp;ft (1&nbsp;km) long straight that led into an absolutely flat-out right handed 180 corner called the Curvon, and this led into a 4000&nbsp;ft (1.4&nbsp;km) straight which returned to the twisty arena that had always been used before. The cars were flat-out for 45 whole seconds throughout this whole lake loop: overtaking was rife on this part of the circuit. During the 1974 race, homeland hero Reutemann so very nearly took victory, but the Brabham mechanics apparently did not put enough fuel in the Argentine's car and he ran out, and victory went to veteran New Zealander Denny Hulme. 1977 saw South African Jody Scheckter take an amazing victory in the Walter Wolf team's first ever Grand Prix in extremely hot weather, and 1978 saw Mario Andretti begin his domination of that season, driving for Lotus. 1979 was an exciting race, the race started with a huge accident at the first two very fast esses; Scheckter and John Watson in a McLaren collided and took out nine cars; six of whom were eliminated on the spot. The race was restarted, and the blue Ligiers of Frenchmen [[Jacques Laffite]] and [[Patrick Depailler]] lead much of the proceedings, but the wily Reutemann, now driving for Lotus, drove methodically through the field and pressed Laffite, but could not catch the flying Frenchman, and Reutemann finished 2nd.\n\nIn 1980, the drivers, led by Emerson Fittipaldi attempted to boycott the race due to the poor state of the track; the new surface was breaking up in many spots because of the hot weather and the extreme suction of the ground-effect cars of the time, and gravel was strewn all over the track from the cracks in the tarmac. The race went ahead anyway after some repairs (which proved not to be good enough, and the track broke up again) and Australian [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] in a Williams, Brazilian [[Nelson Piquet]] in a Brabham, Canadian [[Gilles Villeneuve]], Laffite and Reutemann all battled for top positions; Reutemann went out early with engine problems after he went off the circuit after attempting to pass Piquet and he got grass in his radiators. Because of the track breaking apart and being littered with gravel, Jones went off twice at the Ombu section and was passed by Laffite, Villeneuve and Piquet (who all went off at other parts of the track); and he went into the pits, got the grass out of his radiators and came out in 4th. He charged through the field and passed Villeneuve and Piquet; Laffite retired with engine problems; and the Australian took victory followed by Piquet and [[Keke Rosberg]] scoring his first podium finish; and Frenchman [[Alain Prost]] scored one point in his debut F1 race,<ref name=\"Folley\">Folley, Malcolm. \"Senna versus Prost\" (book published 2009) Page 49: \"Prost commemorated his debut in Formula One at the Argentine Grand Prix by finishing sixth, and scoring his very first point\"</ref> driving for McLaren.<ref name=\"Folley\"/> The 1981 race, which was held in cooler April weather, was a Brabham procession; designer Gordon Murray found a way to circumvent the new regulations with a hydropneumatic suspension which lowered the cars closer to the ground; and therefore were faster around corners than everyone else. Piquet took victory, Reutemann finished 2nd and Prost took 3rd.\n\nThe 1982 round was supposed to be held in early March, but the political fallout during the drivers strike just before the South African Grand Prix caused the sponsors of the Argentine Grand Prix to back out of the race;<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/10/sports/argentine-grand-prix-removed-from-agenda.html|title=Argentine Grand Prix Removed From Agenda|date=10 February 1982|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2017|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> and the race was initially postponed five weeks before it was due to take place; and then the Argentine political situation was problematic and they also [[Falklands War|entered a brief war]] with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands in early April, and within the context of an entirely European sport that consisted mostly of British organizations, this caused the Argentine organizers' contract to be terminated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cir-013.html |title=Circuits: Buenos Aires (Autodromo Oscar Galvez) |publisher=grandprix.com |date= |accessdate=April 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog/2013/oct/14/remembering-1982-f1-world-championship?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=Remembering the tragedy and mayhem of the 1982 F1 World Championship |publisher=theguardian.com |date= 2013-10-14|accessdate=April 5, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian |last1=Pye |first1=Steven }}</ref> An attempt to bring back the Argentine Grand Prix to the same circuit in Buenos Aires in 1986 did not work out, and the race did not return for nine years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keilloh |first=Graham |url=http://www.talkingaboutf1.com/2011/02/looking-back-f1s-phantom-races.html |title=The F1 blog: Looking back: F1's Phantom Races |publisher=Talking about F1 |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}</ref>\n\n====1995\u20131998====\n\nA private [[consortium]] purchased the Buenos Aires track in 1991, renamed it and began to upgrade it.

The No. 6 arena circuit was used, which did not include the flat-out lake run. This tight, twisty circuit was not well suited to Formula One cars and it was very difficult to pass on this variant because of the corners being so close together. The modernized Argentine Grand Prix returned in {{F1|1995}}, with victory going to [[Damon Hill]].

[[Argentina|Argentine]] [[president (government title)|president]] [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] was the driving force behind the creation of the circuit, after seeing the success of the country's own [[Juan Manuel Fangio]].\n\n==Origins and history==\nThe [[Buenos Aires Grand Prix (motor racing)|Buenos Aires Grand Prix]] was an event first started in 1930 as a sportscar event held at the Costanera circuit until 1940 and switched to the Retiro circuit for 1941. After a six-year break and by then [[Juan Peron]] in office, racing resumed in 1947 at [[Circuito Retiro|Retiro]] with the start of the South American \"Temporada\" Grand Prix series, competing twice that year under the [[Formula Libre]] regulations. Italian Luigi Villoresi won all 1947 Temporada events. The race regularly attracted Brazilian and European drivers and also Argentine drivers competing in Europe, such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]]. For the 1948 Grand Prix season, the race was moved to the [[Circuito Palermo|Palermo]] circuit where it would remain to host six of twelve \"Peron Cup\" races until the end of 1950. In 1951, the Costanera Norte circuit would host its last three Grand Prix events before completion of the [[Autodromo Juan y Oscar Galvez|Autodromo 17 de Octubre]] (October 17), a purpose-built circuit where the championship Formula One Argentine Grand Prix was held on different variants of the facility from 1953 to 1960, 1972 to 1981 and 1995 to 1998.\n\n===Buenos Aires===\n\nBuilt in 1952 on [[swamp]]land just outside [[Buenos Aires]], the circuit featured a white archway dedicated to the memory of Admiral [[William Brown (admiral)|William Brown]]. The circuit opened in March 1952 with the fifth edition of the \"Per\u00f3n Cup\", which was won by [[Juan Manuel Fangio]]<ref>[http://www.jmfangio.org/gp1952baires.htm 1952 Argentina \u2013 Gran Premio Presidente Per\u00f3n] jmfangio.org</ref> and in 1953, hosted the first Formula One race to be held in South America.\n\nThe track featured four different configurations for Grand Prix racing. From 1953 to 1960, the Argentine Grand Prix was held on the \"No.2\" layout, clockwise for the all these years except 1954, when it was run counterclockwise. From 1971\u20131973 the race was held on the \"No.9\" configuration, more or less the same as the \"No.2\" configuration but for the section after Tobogan which was shortened and the Horquilla turn was made tighter and shorter. Then from 1974\u20131981 the race was run on the \"No.15\" configuration, the longest and fastest layout that combined two very fast successive right and left hand corners with two long straights and a spectacular long and wide third corner (called the Curvon Salotto) into the infield section from the previous \"No.9\" configuration. For the period from 1995 to 1998, the race was held on the twisty \"No.6\" configuration using only the infield section with the \"S\" shaped \"Los Mixos chicane.\n\n====1953\u20131960====\n\nThe 1953 race saw Fangio retire his [[Maserati]] after 36 laps due to a transmission failure; [[Alberto Ascari]]'s victory for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] was overshadowed by an accident which killed nine people and injured many others due to overcrowding along the track. The race was heavily advertised and it is believed that around 400,000 people turned up for the event. The facility was so packed that people were standing on the edges of corners, inches away from the cars apexing the corners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/1953/53ra.html |title=1953 VII Gran Premio de la Republica Argentina|publisher=silhouet.com |date= |accessdate=April 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, the circuit was run in an anticlockwise direction, and Fangio did reach the top of the podium, winning his home Grand Prix on his second attempt; he would go on to win the next three Grands Prix in Argentina, one of which was the 1955 race. It was one of the hottest races on record, at 40C (104F) with track temperatures reaching 51C (122F). Fangio, now driving for Mercedes, was the only driver to complete the 96 laps, after 3 hours without handing his car over to another driver. One of his legs was badly burned by a chassis tube heated by the exhaust, an injury that forced a 3-month recovery. In {{F1|1958}}, [[Stirling Moss]] took the win, in the penultimate race in Fangio's career. It was also the first Formula One championship victory for a rear or mid-engined car and the first for a privateer. New Zealander Bruce McLaren won in 1960. With Fangio's retirement and the disappearance of fellow Argentine driver [[Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], combined with unstable governments after the [[exile]] of Peron (in 1955), the Argentine Grand Prix disappeared from the F1 calendar in 1961 for over a decade.\n\n====1971\u20131981====\n\nA non-championship Formula One race was held at Buenos Aires in 1971, won by [[Chris Amon]] over two heats.<ref>[http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1971/1971.html 1971 Non Championship Formula One results] www.silhouet.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1971/1971.html |title=1971 Non Championship Formula One results|publisher=silhouet.com |date=|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statsf1.com/en/1971-hc/grand-prix-267.aspx |title=1971 \u2013 VIII Gran Premio de la Republica Argentina|publisher=statsf1.com |date=|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref> In {{F1|1972}} the Argentine Grand Prix returned to the World Championship, with [[Carlos Reutemann]] emerging as the new home favorite. The variant used for these two years was similar to the one used before, except the straight leading into the hairpin after the Toboggan esses was shortened. Reutemann took [[pole position]] in his world championship debut, becoming only the second driver to achieve this feat.  The race was won by [[list of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|world champion]] [[Jackie Stewart]]. 1973 saw [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] take victory at the last part of the race from Frenchman [[Fran\u00e7ois Cevert]].\n\nFor 1974, the circuit used the faster and longer No.15 circuit, which included two very fast and slightly banked corners that led into a section that went around a lake, which included a 3000&nbsp;ft (1&nbsp;km) long straight that led into an absolutely flat-out right handed 180 corner called the Curvon, and this led into a 4000&nbsp;ft (1.4&nbsp;km) straight which returned to the twisty arena that had always been used before. The cars were flat-out for 45 whole seconds throughout this whole lake loop- overtaking was rife on this part of the circuit. During the 1974 race, homeland hero Reutemann so very nearly took victory, but the Brabham mechanics apparently did not put enough fuel in the Argentine's car and he ran out, and victory went to veteran New Zealander Denny Hulme. 1977 saw South African Jody Scheckter take an amazing victory in the Walter Wolf team's first ever Grand Prix in extremely hot weather, and 1978 saw Mario Andretti begin his domination of that season, driving for Lotus. 1979 was an exciting race, the race started with a huge accident at the first 2 very fast esses; Scheckter and John Watson in a McLaren collided and took out 9 cars; 6 of whom were eliminated on the spot. The race was restarted, and the blue Ligiers of Frenchmen [[Jacques Laffite]] and [[Patrick Depailler]] lead much of the proceedings, but the wily Reutemann, now driving for Lotus, drove methodically through the field and pressed Laffite, but could not catch the flying Frenchman, and Reutemann finished 2nd.\n\nIn 1980, the drivers, led by Emerson Fittipaldi attempted to boycott the race due to the poor state of the track; the new surface was breaking up in many spots because of the hot weather and the extreme suction of the ground-effect cars of the time, and gravel was strewn all over the track from the cracks in the tarmac. The race went ahead anyway after some repairs (which proved not to be good enough, and the track broke up again) and Australian [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] in a Williams, Brazilian [[Nelson Piquet]] in a Brabham, Canadian [[Gilles Villeneuve]], Laffite and Reutemann all battled for top positions; Reutemann went out early with engine problems after he went off the circuit after attempting to pass Piquet and he got grass in his radiators. Because of the track breaking apart and being littered with gravel, Jones went off twice at the Ombu section and was passed by Laffite, Villeneuve and Piquet (who all went off at other parts of the track); and he went into the pits, got the grass out of his radiators and came out in 4th. He charged through the field and passed Villeneuve and Piquet; Laffite retired with engine problems; and the Australian took victory followed by Piquet and [[Keke Rosberg]] scoring his first podium finish; and Frenchman [[Alain Prost]] scored one point in his debut F1 race,<ref name=\"Folley\">Folley, Malcolm. \"Senna versus Prost\" (book published 2009) Page 49: \"Prost commemorated his debut in Formula One at the Argentine Grand Prix by finishing sixth, and scoring his very first point\"</ref> driving for McLaren.<ref name=\"Folley\"/> The 1981 race, which was held in cooler April weather, was a Brabham procession; designer Gordon Murray found a way to circumvent the new regulations with a hydropneumatic suspension which lowered the cars closer to the ground; and therefore were faster around corners than everyone else. Piquet took victory, Reutemann finished 2nd and Prost took 3rd.\n\nThe 1982 round was supposed to be held in early March, but the political fallout during the drivers strike just before the South African Grand Prix caused the sponsors of the Argentine Grand Prix to back out of the race;<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/10/sports/argentine-grand-prix-removed-from-agenda.html|title=Argentine Grand Prix Removed From Agenda|date=10 February 1982|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2017|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> and the race was initially postponed 5 weeks before it was due to take place; and then the Argentine political situation was problematic and they also [[Falklands War|entered a brief war]] with the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands in early April, and within the context of an entirely European sport that consisted mostly of British organizations, this caused the Argentine organizers' contract to be terminated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cir-013.html |title=Circuits: Buenos Aires (Autodromo Oscar Galvez) |publisher=grandprix.com |date= |accessdate=April 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog/2013/oct/14/remembering-1982-f1-world-championship?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=Remembering the tragedy and mayhem of the 1982 F1 World Championship |publisher=theguardian.com |date= 2013-10-14|accessdate=April 5, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian |last1=Pye |first1=Steven }}</ref> An attempt to bring back the Argentine Grand Prix to the same circuit in Buenos Aires in 1986 did not work out, and the race did not return for nine years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keilloh |first=Graham |url=http://www.talkingaboutf1.com/2011/02/looking-back-f1s-phantom-races.html |title=The F1 blog: Looking back: F1's Phantom Races |publisher=Talking about F1 |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}</ref>\n\n====1995\u20131998====\n\nA private [[consortium]] purchased the Buenos Aires track in 1991, renamed it and began to upgrade it.

The No.6 arena circuit was used, which did not include the flat-out lake run. This tight, twisty circuit was not well suited to Formula One cars and it was very difficult to pass on this variant because of the corners being so close together. The modernized Argentine Grand Prix returned in {{F1|1995}}, with victory going to [[Damon Hill]].  Hill won the event again in {{F1|1996}} (his championship [[season (sport)|season]]), and in {{F1|1997}} [[Jacques Villeneuve]] won the race in his championship season.\n\nThe organizers of the event ran into financial difficulties, and the {{F1|1998}} race was the last running of the Argentine Grand Prix, the checkered flag waving victory to [[Michael Schumacher]], in his ninth win for Ferrari.\n\n====Absence====\n\nA race was scheduled for [[1999 Formula One season|1999]], but was cancelled pre-season, leaving a 5-week gap between the opening two rounds of the 1999 championship.\n\nIn February 2012, Argentine president [[Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner]] announced negotiations were coming to a close to bring the Grand Prix back to the country by 2013, this time at a street circuit to be created in the seaside resort city of [[Mar del Plata]],<ref>[http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-korea-to-be-replaced-by-argentina-in-2013/ F1: Korea To Be Replaced By Argentina In 2013?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408190444/http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-korea-to-be-replaced-by-argentina-in-2013 |date=2012-04-08 }}, speedtv.com, April 6, 2012.

The Azerbaijani rug is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions. Traditionally, since ancient times the carpets were used in Azerbaijan to cover floors, decorate interior walls, sofas, chairs, beds and tables.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00389 The traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan ]</ref>\n\n[[Carpet|Carpet making]] is a family tradition transferred orally and through practice, with carpet making and [[rug making]] being predominantly a women's occupation. In the past, every young girl had to learn the art of weaving carpets, and the carpets she wove became a part of her dowry. In the case of a newly married son, it was his mother who wove a large rug for his new household. Starting a new carpet meant a feast, but the completion of a rug meant an even greater celebration for the family. In the old days, finished carpets were laid out in front of the house so that passers-by with the weight of their feet could make them even tighter than they had already been knotted. For the traditional process of carpet and rug making, men sheared the sheep for the wool in the spring and autumn, while women collected dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring, summer and autumn. Azerbaijani carpets are classified under four large regional groups, i.e. Quba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh, and Baku.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>{{failed verification|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\">[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00389 The traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan ]</ref><ref>[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=134436 Azerbaijani carpet entered UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage ]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Carpet market Ganja XIXcentury.jpg|thumb|300px|The rug trade in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Azerbaijan]] in the late 19th century.]]\n[[File:Carpet manufacturing Ganja XIXcentury.jpg|thumb|300px|Carpet manufacturing in Ganja in the early 20th century.]]\n{{main|Azerbaijani carpet weaving}}\nSince ancient times, Azerbaijan has been known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well-developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working and ceramics, and last but not least carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC.\n\nThe results of the archeological digging in Azerbaijan validate the antiquity of the carpet weaving traditions on this land. The Gultapin excavations discovered carpet weaving tools which date back to the 4th-3rd millennium BC. For many centuries during the historical existence of Azerbaijan, both settled and nomadic ways of life were of importance.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe carpet making was born{{CN|date=April 2019}} in rural huts and with time ranked among the most essential arts. It was highly valued by the heads of states, and the gifted weavers were glorified by the greatest poets. The carpet history is assumed to be divided into the following four main periods:{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n* I period - the early stage of the carpet development. The carpet ware is very simple, without any motifs and patterns. The first palas and djedjims appear.\n* II period - introduction of the kilim weaving practice by the intricate threading technique.\n* III period - weaving of shadda, verni, sumakh, zili. The period of simple and complex whipping techniques.\n* IV period - introduction of the knotted pile weaving. Both from the technical and artistic standpoints this stage can be considered the acme of the carpet making.\n\n==Flat-weave carpets==\n\n===Shadda===\n[[File:Azeri shadda.jpg|thumb|A 19th century Azeri shadda of exceptionally high quality. It was exhibited at the [[Textile Museum (Washington, D.C.)]], and has been published in three books.|upright=0.8]]\nShadda is a flat weave carpet, made primarily in Nakhchivan, Agdam, Gubadly, Agjabedi. The artistic composition of shadda made by complicated whipping, as well as its constituents have a complex form. Early in the 20th century the oldest weavers and carpet experts called this type of carpets \u201cshadra\u2019 or \u201cshatra\u201d. The word \u201cshadda\u201d is a distorted form of \u201cshatranj\u201d and \u201cshadvard\u201d. Shadda comes in a number of varieties, each having a specific technique such as monochrome, checkered or subject. Monochrome shadda are made by the simple interweaving technique. Shadda with a checkered pattern is based on the palas and jejim principle.{{CN|date=April 2019}} The same technique is used to make subject-based shadda. The subject shadda \u201cDavali\u201d are famous all over the world. They use practically one and the same subject with the composition being almost invariable: the camelcade moving along the carpet field from left to right, along a few horizontal rows, and each string running into a figure of a sarvan on foot. The humans and animals are set off against the dark-red field, its color is smooth and hot.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[File:Silk embroidery, greater Azerbaijan, 17th-18th century.jpg|thumb|Silk embroidery, greater Azerbaijan, 17th-18th century. In the collections of the [[Textile Museum (Washington, D.C.)]] ]]\n\n===Verni===\nThe most widely spread type of the flat-weave carpet is \u201cverni\u201d. Perhaps none of the flat-weave carpets can boast such a monumental pattern and harmonious clarity as the \u201cverni\u201d made only in Azerbaijan. The technical perfection and utmost emotionality of these carpets is a sort of acme of the Azerbaijani carpet art. Sample \u201cverni\u201d displayed in various museums throughout the world presents the outstanding monument of the richest heritage of the Azerbaijani folk art in which we by right take pride. Among the \u201cverni\u201d centers were Agjabedi, Barda, Agdam, Nakhchivan.{{CN|date=April 2019}} The key d\u00e9cor feature, which is intrinsical to every \u201dverni\u201d is the S-element. Its shape varies, it may resemble both figure 5 and letter S. This element means \u201cdragon\u201d among the nomads and \u201cwater\u201d among the village people. Based on the stories told by the oldest Azerbaijani weavers with nomadic roots, a dragon featuring carpet would protect the family from foul weather. In Taoism, a dragon is associated with spring. The Tibet pantheon considers dragon as a good deity, a master of chiefs. If the S-element takes up the whole of the carpet space, it would be viewed as an image of a dragon itself rather than a dragon symbol. This element has been known to the local weaver for centuries and is characterized by an ability to come alive through embodiment in a specific image and to symbolize the good and happiness.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Jejim===\nJejims are woven on simple horizontal looms by narrow stripes 30\u201335&nbsp;cm wide and 15\u201310&nbsp;cm long. The resulting product is a cloth to be used as a wall carpet, a bedding coverlet, or curtains. The width of a jejim matches the distance between the weaver\u2019s feet as in the process of weaving the whole width of the cloth should pass through the weaver\u2019s feet. The ornamental d\u00e9cor of jejims is diverse and rich. Various vertical stripes that decorate jejims are spectacular, colorful and decorative. They are often decorated by stylized images of utensils (comb, thread, candlesticks) and geometrical elements. Up to the mid 20th century delicate jejims were used to make garments both for men and women. The major jejim production centers are Barda, Nakhchivan, Zangilan, Shusha, Shamakha.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Zilli===\n[[File:Carpet tools.jpg|thumb|right|Some traditional tools of the craft.]]\n\u201cZilli\u201d are characterized by stylized forms of animals and vegetal elements. In terms of their composition and pattern, the Azerbaijani zillis are very diverse. They feature a plastic flexibility of the pattern and emotional expressiveness. The ornamental decoration is marked by images of large elements in the shape of big lozenges, paired horns, various stylized elements. There are \u201czillis\u201d with a variety of compositions, which differed by peculiar vegetal ornamental patterns and overall rich colors. The key element in such compositions lies in the recurring alternation of colors along the horizontal pt vertical lines, which form an \"energetic\" rhythm. As to their technical and artistic qualities, \u201czillis\u201d are rich in moving images of stylized birds, elaborated \u201cbutas\u201d and other elements. \u201cZilli\u201d were influenced by the tendency to fill in the space by various motifs, each being repeated in the field according to its individual layout, and the overall result resembles a fancy garden with a rich and fairy-tale flora.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Kilim===\nKilim is the most widespread type of flat-woven carpets.{{CN|date=April 2019}} They are made by passing the weft through the warp using the technique of compound interweaving. Kilim is characterized by a slot-like gap (opening) around the geometrical patterns. These openings impart a lace effect the kilim. The technique of kilim weaving predetermines the pattern shapes in the form of a lozenge, triangle, trapezium.<ref name=\"Azerbaijan-kilim\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.therugcompany.com/uk/azerbaijan-kilim-60073 |title=Azerbaijan-kilim |access-date=2017-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115093633/http://www.therugcompany.com/uk/azerbaijan-kilim-60073 |archive-date=2016-01-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Nearly all the vegetal elements, images of animals, birds and humans are geometrized in kilims. Kilims of different regions are distinguished by their composition, pattern, and colors. In terms of their technical peculiarities, kilims can be classified into five major groups based on the area of production: Kazakh, Karabakh, Absheron, and Shirvan kilims. They are all characterized by a balanced composition, contrasting colors and clear symmetry. The pattern is traditional, in the form of large and small lozenge and hook-like elements, which are rather expressive and dramatic.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Sumakh===\nThe \u201cSumakh\u201d carpets present one of the interesting types of flat-weave carpets, which have become widely spread and recognized over the last few centuries. Beginning with the 18th century \u201cSumakhs\u201d have been made in the Quba nd Gusary districts.<ref name=\"sumakh-carpets\">[http://www.lezgimountaincrafts.com/products/sumakh-carpets sumakh-carpets]</ref>\u201cSumakhs\u201d were created much later than other types of flat-woven carpets. In the early stage of their development they, might have had their own individual composition, but the \u201cSumakhs\u201d of the 18th-20th centuries reproduce the compositions and patterns copied from the pile carpets made in Shirvan, Quba, Karabakh and Ganja. The technological peculiarity of \u201cSumakh\u201d lies in their rich composition and colors. The diverse stylized vegetal motifs, various geometrical elements such as large hexahedral, square, rhomboid medallions impart festive beauty to \u201cSumakh\u201d. The traditional pattern includes the minor edge with a wave-like pattern, which is called \u201cdolan-gach\u201d (pass around - run away). It is used basically in all \u201cSumakh\u201d type carpets.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Palas===\nPalas is one of the widely spread flat-weave carpets. The palas weaving process consists in passing the weft through the warp by a simple technique. The weavers decorate the palas by traditional patterns in the form of horizontal stripes commonly used throughout Azerbaijan. But every individual weavers had their own choice of composition and colors.<ref name=\"azerbaijani palas\">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/palas azerbaijani palas]</ref> As a rule, the palas is not framed by a border. \n\nThe palases called \u201cchiy\u201d are made by a very unusual weaving technique. Similarly to other simple types of palases the background of \u201cchiy\u201d is [[plain weave]]. At the same time, the pattern-making thread is used to create a fine tiny geometrical pattern by piercing \u201csanjma\u201d. This creates the embroidery effect.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[File:Azerbaijani carpet from Shusha.jpg|thumbnail|Namazlyg carpet from [[Shusha]]. 19th century.]]\n\n==Dyeing wool==\nAt dyeing workshops, professionals dye yarns with dye-stuffs mainly of plant origin, strictly following the centuries-old traditional techniques of colouring.{{CN|date=April 2019}} To prepare the seven basic colors (red, green, yellow, black, dark blue, white, purple) and their tints used in carpet making, professional dyers use green walnut shells, the skin of pomegranates, indigo, leaves of the mulberry, quince and walnut plants, and roots of madder. In order to achieve yellow and its hues, they use bulb onion peels, mulberry leaves collected in the late autumn, etc. To produce red and pink colors, madder is used, and to obtain dark blue, blue and green, indigo dye is used. At the very end of the yarn dyeing process a dyer adds salt, alum or vinegar into the dye solution to increase the intensity, fastness and durability of colours. Then, dyed yarns are pressed and dried with special techniques.{{explain|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Weaving==\nThey are made using weaving looms, with average knot density (from 35\u00f560 to 55\u00f555). Three hand tools are used - a knife, a beater and shears.\n\n==Pulling==\nIn most cases carpets manually woven of silk and wool have clear unevenness of their edges. To eliminate this characteristic, carpets are fastened to wooden floors with their four ends pulled. They are then raised up from the middle by means of special wooden lifters and smoothened on the reverse side. After that, the carpet is pulled and fastened to the wooden floor again and left in this position for two days. This process helps to straighten out the edges of the carpet.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Carpet-weaving schools==\n===Quba-Shirvan schools of carpet weaving===\nThe rise of the carpet art on the territory of Azerbaijan was undoubtedly related to a number of objective factors, among them the geographical location of this land, at the joint of the East and the West. The Greater Caucasus ridge, home to some Quba-Shirvan carpet-weaving schools, lies the borderline between Asia and Europe. Here is the historical juxtaposition point between the Islamic and Christian cultures. Long camelcades passed through this land in the Middle Ages.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n====Quba school of carpet weaving====\n{{main|Quba rugs and carpets}}\nThe Quba school that includes the Gonagkend and Divichi districts covers up to 35 pattern compositions of the carpets. Quba is an historical region hosting a plenitude of various tribes. The region is populated by ethnic groups that speak different languages, among them Azerbaijanis, Lezghins, Tats, Budugs, Gyryzys and others. Quba carpets come with a wide variety of designs, which may differ even from village to village. The ornamental pattern is characterized by geometrical and vegetal motifs, most of them stylized. These include Gyryz, Gymyl, Gonakend, Shahnezerli and other carpets.\n\n====Shirvan school of carpet weaving====\nThe Shirvan school is famous for its superb carpets.{{CN|date=April 2019}} Shirvan is one of the most ancient historical regions of Azerbaijan. Carpet making of different types is a widespread craft with both settled and nomadic natives. The Shirvan school accounts for carpets manufactured in the following towns and villages of the Shirvan region: Shemaha, Maraza, Bijo, Gashad, Gagali, Archiman, Kurdamir. The school totals 25 compositions. The Salyan carpets, with similar artistic and technical features, also belong to this school. The Shirvan carpets are characterized by an intricate design, which depicts numerous artifacts of everyday life, birds and people.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Ganja-Kazakh school of carpet weaving ===\n{{main|Ganja rugs}}\nThe carpets of this school are notable for peculiarity of their compositions and ornamental patterns. The Ganja carpets include a relatively small number of carpet compositions, all in all between 8 and 20 patterns. The Kazakh carpets cover about 16 compositions with various patterns. Kazakh, which is located on the NW of Azerbaijan, is the most famous carpet production region and also accounts for the Kazakh and Borchaly carpet groups.{{CN|date=April 2019}} The Kazakh carpets have a geometrical ornamental pattern, the composition is not very complex with a focus on a schematic presentation of the geometrical patterns, plants and animals. The ornamental decor of the Ganja carpets is rich and diverse, with a focus on geometrical motifs as well as schematic presentation of plants and animals.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Baku school of carpet weaving===\nThe Baku school of carpet weaving includes the villages of Novkhany, Fatmai, Nardaran, Bulbulya, Mardakan, Gaadi. These carpets are marked for their increased softness of the material and intense colors, as well as excellent artistic taste and exquisite decoration. This school has about 10 compositions. The historical sources and inscriptions on the carpets testify to the fact that carpet making was widely spread in these villages and carpet-ware was exported outside the country. The carpet composition often includes medallions. They are filled by various motifs, most often by stylized images of plants, which lost their resemblance to the original object after they had been geometrized.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Karabakh school of carpet weaving===\n{{main|Karabakh carpet}}\nThe Karabakh carpets consist of 33 varieties. Due to the specifics of the local sheep wool, the Karabakh carpets are characterized by thick pile, high and fluffy. These carpets are marked for their vivid and joyous colors.

The Azerbaijani rug is a traditional handmade textile of various sizes, with dense texture and a pile or pile-less surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions. Traditionally, since ancient times the carpets were used in Azerbaijan to cover floors, decorate interior walls, sofas, chairs, beds and tables.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00389 The traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan ]</ref>\n\n[[Carpet|Carpet making]] is a family tradition transferred orally and through practice, with carpet making and [[rug making]] being predominantly a women's occupation. In the past every young girl had to learn the art of weaving carpets, and the carpets she wove became a part of her dowry. In the case of a newly married son, it was his mother who wove a large rug for his new household. Starting a new carpet meant a feast, but the completion of a rug meant an even greater celebration for the family. In the old days finished carpets were laid out in front of the house so that passers-by with the weight of their feet could make them even tighter than they had already been knotted. For the traditional process of carpet and rug making, men sheared the sheep for the wool in the spring and autumn, while women collected dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring, summer and autumn. Azerbaijani carpets are classified under four large regional groups, i.e. Quba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh, and Baku.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>{{failed verification|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was proclaimed a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"UNESCO\">[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00389 The traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in the Republic of Azerbaijan ]</ref><ref>[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=134436 Azerbaijani carpet entered UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage ]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Carpet market Ganja XIXcentury.jpg|thumb|300px|The rug trade in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Azerbaijan]] in the late 19th century.]]\n[[File:Carpet manufacturing Ganja XIXcentury.jpg|thumb|300px|Carpet manufacturing in Ganja in the early 20th century.]]\n{{main|Azerbaijani carpet weaving}}\nSince ancient times, Azerbaijan has been known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working and ceramics, and last but not least carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC.\n\nThe results of the archeological digging in Azerbaijan validate the antiquity of the carpet weaving traditions on this land. The Gultapin excavations discovered carpet weaving tools which date back to the 4th-3rd millennium BC. For many centuries during the historical existence of Azerbaijan both settled and nomadic ways of life were of importance.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe carpet making was born{{CN|date=April 2019}} in rural huts and with time ranked among the most essential arts. It was highly valued by the heads of states, and the gifted weavers were glorified by the greatest poets. The carpet history is assumed to be divided into the following four main periods:{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n* I period - the early stage of the carpet development. The carpet ware is very simple, without any motifs and patterns. The first palas and djedjims appear.\n* II period - introduction of the kilim weaving practice by the intricate threading technique.\n* III period - weaving of shadda, verni, sumakh, zili. The period of simple and complex whipping techniques.\n* IV period - introduction of the knotted pile weaving. Both from the technical and artistic standpoints this stage can be considered the acme of the carpet making.\n\n==Flat-weave carpets==\n\n===Shadda===\n[[File:Azeri shadda.jpg|thumb|A 19th century Azeri shadda of exceptionally high quality. It was exhibited at the [[Textile Museum (Washington, D.C.)]], and has been published in three books.|upright=0.8]]\nShadda is a flat weave carpet, made primarily in Nakhchivan, Agdam, Gubadly, Agjabedi. The artistic composition of shadda made by complicated whipping, as well as its constituents have a complex form. Early in the 20th century the oldest weavers and carpet experts called this type of carpets \u201cshadra\u2019 or \u201cshatra\u201d. The word \u201cshadda\u201d is a distorted form of \u201cshatranj\u201d and \u201cshadvard\u201d. Shadda comes in a number of varieties, each having a specific technique such as monochrome, checkered or subject. Monochrome shadda are made by the simple interweaving technique. Shadda with a checkered pattern is based on the palas and jejim principle.{{CN|date=April 2019}} The same technique is used to make subject-based shadda. The subject shadda \u201cDavali\u201d are famous all over the world. They use practically one and the same subject with the composition being almost invariable: the camelcade moving along the carpet field from left to right, along a few horizontal rows, and each string running into a figure of a sarvan on foot. The humans and animals are set off against the dark-red field, its color is smooth and hot.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[File:Silk embroidery, greater Azerbaijan, 17th-18th century.jpg|thumb|Silk embroidery, greater Azerbaijan, 17th-18th century. In the collections of the [[Textile Museum (Washington, D.C.)]] ]]\n\n===Verni===\nThe most widely spread type of the flat-weave carpet is \u201cverni\u201d. Perhaps none of the flat-weave carpets can boast such a monumental pattern and harmonious clarity as the \u201cverni\u201d made only in Azerbaijan. The technical perfection and utmost emotionality of these carpets is a sort of acme of the Azerbaijani carpet art. Sample \u201cverni\u201d displayed in various museums throughout the world present the outstanding monument of the richest heritage of the Azerbaijani folk art in which we by right take pride. Among the \u201cverni\u201d centers were Agjabedi, Barda, Agdam, Nakhchivan.{{CN|date=April 2019}} The key d\u00e9cor feature, which is intrinsical to every \u201dverni\u201d is the S-element. Its shape varies, it may resemble both figure 5 and letter S. This element means \u201cdragon\u201d among the nomads and \u201cwater\u201d among the village people. Based on the stories told by the oldest Azerbaijani weavers with nomadic roots, a dragon featuring carpet would protect the family from foul weather. In Taoism, a dragon is associated with spring. The Tibet pantheon considers dragon as a good deity, a master of chiefs. If the S-element takes up the whole of the carpet space, it would be viewed as an image of a dragon itself rather than a dragon symbol. This element has been known to the local weaver for centuries and is characterized by an ability to come alive through embodiment in a specific image and to symbolize the good and happiness.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Jejim===\nJejims are woven on simple horizontal looms by narrow stripes 30\u201335&nbsp;cm wide and 15\u201310&nbsp;cm long. The resulting product is a cloth to be used as a wall carpet, a bedding coverlet, or curtains. The width of a jejim matches the distance between the weaver\u2019s feet as in the process of weaving the whole width of the cloth should pass through the weaver\u2019s feet. The ornamental d\u00e9cor of jejims is diverse and rich. Various vertical stripes that decorate jejims are spectacular, colorful and decorative. They are often decorated by stylized images of utensils (comb, thread, candlesticks) and geometrical elements. Up to the mid 20th century delicate jejims were used to make garments both for men and women. The major jejim production centers are Barda, Nakhchivan, Zangilan, Shusha, Shamakha.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Zilli===\n[[File:Carpet tools.jpg|thumb|right|Some traditional tools of the craft.]]\n\u201cZilli\u201d are characterized by stylized forms of animals and vegetal elements. In terms of their composition and pattern the Azerbaijani zillis are very diverse. They feature a plastic flexibility of the pattern and emotional expressiveness. The ornamental decoration is marked by images of large elements in the shape of big lozenges, paired horns, various stylized elements. There are \u201czillis\u201d with a variety of compositions, which differed by peculiar vegetal ornamental patterns and overall rich colors. The key element in such compositions lies in the recurring alternation of colors along the horizontal pt vertical lines, which form an \"energetic\" rhythm. As to their technical and artistic qualities, \u201czillis\u201d are rich in moving images of stylized birds, elaborated \u201cbutas\u201d and other elements. \u201cZilli\u201d were influenced by the tendency to fill in the space by various motifs, each being repeated in the field according to its individual layout, and the overall result resembles a fancy garden with a rich and fairy-tale flora.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Kilim===\nKilim is the most widespread type of flat-woven carpets.{{CN|date=April 2019}} They are made by passing the weft through the warp using the technique of compound interweaving. Kilim is characterized by a slot-like gap (opening) around the geometrical patterns. These openings impart a lace effect the kilim. The technique of kilim weaving predetermines the pattern shapes in the form of a lozenge, triangle, trapezium.<ref name=\"Azerbaijan-kilim\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.therugcompany.com/uk/azerbaijan-kilim-60073 |title=Azerbaijan-kilim |access-date=2017-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115093633/http://www.therugcompany.com/uk/azerbaijan-kilim-60073 |archive-date=2016-01-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Nearly all the vegetal elements, images of animals, birds and humans are geometrized in kilims. Kilims of different regions are distinguished by their composition, pattern, and colors. In terms of their technical peculiarities, kilims can be classified into five major groups based on the area of production: Kazakh, Karabakh, Absheron, and Shirvan kilims. They are all characterized by a balanced composition, contrasting colors and clear symmetry. The pattern is traditional, in the form of large and small lozenge and hook-like elements, which are rather expressive and dramatic.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Sumakh===\nThe \u201cSumakh\u201d carpets present one of the interesting types of flat-weave carpets, which have become widely spread and recognized over the last few centuries. Beginning with the 18th century \u201cSumakhs\u201d have been made in the Quba nd Gusary districts.<ref name=\"sumakh-carpets\">[http://www.lezgimountaincrafts.com/products/sumakh-carpets sumakh-carpets]</ref>\u201cSumakhs\u201d were created much later than other types of flat-woven carpets. In the early stage of their development they, might have had their own individual composition, but the \u201cSumakhs\u201d of the 18th-20th centuries reproduce the compositions and patterns copied from the pile carpets made in Shirvan, Quba, Karabakh and Ganja. The technological peculiarity of \u201cSumakh\u201d lies in their rich composition and colors. The diverse stylized vegetal motifs, various geometrical elements such as large hexahedral, square, rhomboid medallions impart festive beauty to \u201cSumakh\u201d. The traditional pattern includes the minor edge with a wave-like pattern, which is called \u201cdolan-gach\u201d (pass around - run away). It is used basically in all \u201cSumakh\u201d type carpets.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Palas===\nPalas is one of the widely spread flat-weave carpets. The palas weaving process consists in passing the weft through the warp by a simple technique. The weavers decorate the palas by traditional patterns in the form of horizontal stripes commonly used throughout Azerbaijan. But every individual weavers had their own choice of composition and colors.<ref name=\"azerbaijani palas\">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/palas azerbaijani palas]</ref> As a rule, the palas is not framed by a border. \n\nThe palases called \u201cchiy\u201d are made by a very unusual weaving technique. Similarly to other simple types of palases the background of \u201cchiy\u201d is [[plain weave]]. At the same time, the pattern-making thread is used to create a fine tiny geometrical pattern by piercing \u201csanjma\u201d. This creates the embroidery effect.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[File:Azerbaijani carpet from Shusha.jpg|thumbnail|Namazlyg carpet from [[Shusha]]. 19th century.]]\n\n==Dyeing wool==\nAt dyeing workshops, professionals dye yarns with dye-stuffs mainly of plant origin, strictly following the centuries-old traditional techniques of colouring.{{CN|date=April 2019}} To prepare the seven basic colors (red, green, yellow, black, dark blue, white, purple) and their tints used in carpet making, professional dyers use green walnut shells, the skin of pomegranates, indigo, leaves of the mulberry, quince and walnut plants, and roots of madder. In order to achieve yellow and its hues, they use bulb onion peels, mulberry leaves collected in the late autumn, etc. To produce red and pink colors, madder is used, and to obtain dark blue, blue and green, indigo dye is used. At the very end of the yarn dyeing process a dyer adds salt, alum or vinegar into the dye solution to increase the intensity, fastness and durability of colours. Then, dyed yarns are pressed and dried with special techniques.{{explain|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Weaving==\nThey are made using weaving looms, with average knot density (from 35\u00f560 to 55\u00f555). Three hand tools are used - a knife, a beater and shears.\n\n==Pulling==\nIn most cases carpets manually woven of silk and wool have clear unevenness of their edges. To eliminate this characteristic, carpets are fastened to wooden floors with their four ends pulled. They are then raised up from the middle by means of special wooden lifters and smoothened on the reverse side. After that, the carpet is pulled and fastened to the wooden floor again and left in this position for two days. This process helps to straighten out the edges of the carpet.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Carpet-weaving schools==\n===Quba-Shirvan schools of carpet weaving===\nThe rise of the carpet art on the territory of Azerbaijan was undoubtedly related to a number of objective factors, among them the geographical location of this land, at the joint of the East and the West. The Greater Caucasus ridge, home to some Quba-Shirvan carpet-weaving schools, lies the borderline between Asia and Europe. Here is the historical juxtaposition point between the Islamic and Christian cultures. Long camelcades passed through this land in the Middle Ages.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n====Quba school of carpet weaving====\n{{main|Quba rugs and carpets}}\nThe Quba school that includes the Gonagkend and Divichi districts covers up to 35 pattern compositions of the carpets. Quba is an historical region hosting a plenitude of various tribes. The region is populated by ethnic groups that speak different languages, among them Azerbaijanis, Lezghins, Tats, Budugs, Gyryzys and others. Quba carpets come with wide variety of designs, which may differ even from village to village. The ornamental pattern is characterized by geometrical and vegetal motifs, most of them stylized. These include Gyryz, Gymyl, Gonakend, Shahnezerli and other carpets.\n\n====Shirvan school of carpet weaving====\nThe Shirvan school is famous for its superb carpets.{{CN|date=April 2019}} Shirvan is one of the most ancient historical regions of Azerbaijan. Carpet making of different types is a widespread craft with both settled and nomadic natives. The Shirvan school accounts for carpets manufactured in the following towns and villages of the Shirvan region: Shemaha, Maraza, Bijo, Gashad, Gagali, Archiman, Kurdamir. The school totals 25 compositions. The Salyan carpets, with similar artistic and technical features, also belong to this school. The Shirvan carpets are characterized by an intricate design, which depicts numerous artifacts of everyday life, birds and people.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Ganja-Kazakh school of carpet weaving ===\n{{main|Ganja rugs}}\nThe carpets of this school are notable for peculiarity of their compositions and ornamental patterns. The Ganja carpets include a relatively small number of carpet compositions, all in all between 8 and 20 patterns. The Kazakh carpets cover about 16 compositions with various patterns. Kazakh, which is located on the NW of Azerbaijan, is the most famous carpet production region and also accounts for the Kazakh and Borchaly carpet groups.{{CN|date=April 2019}} The Kazakh carpets have a geometrical ornamental pattern, the composition is not very complex with a focus on a schematic presentation of the geometrical patterns, plants and animals. The ornamental decor of the Ganja carpets is rich and diverse, with a focus on geometrical motifs as well as schematic presentation of plants and animals.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Baku school of carpet weaving===\nThe Baku school of carpet weaving includes the villages of Novkhany, Fatmai, Nardaran, Bulbulya, Mardakan, Gaadi. These carpets are marked for their increased softness of the material and intense colors, as well as excellent artistic taste and exquisite decoration. This school has about 10 compositions. The historical sources and inscriptions on the carpets testify to the fact that carpet making was widely spread in these villages and carpet-ware was exported outside the country. The carpet composition often includes medallions. They are filled by various motifs, most often by stylized images of plants, which lost their resemblance to the original object after they had been geometrized.{{CN|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Karabakh school of carpet weaving===\n{{main|Karabakh carpet}}\nThe Karabakh carpets consist of 33 varieties. Due to the specifics of the local sheep wool the Karabakh carpets are characterized by thick pile, high and fluffy. These carpets are marked for their vivid and joyous colors. They are divided into four groups: without medallions, with medallions, namazlyk and subject carpet.

He is best known for his reputation and later conviction as a confessed [[serial killer]] of children.\n\nA member of the [[House of Big Dickness|House of Montmorency-Laval]], Gilles de Rais grew up under the tutelage of his maternal grandfather and increased his fortune by marriage. He earned the favour of the Duke of Brittany and was admitted to the French court. From 1427 to 1435, Rais served as a commander in the French army, and fought alongside Joan of Arc against the English and their [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] allies during the [[Hundred Years' War]], for which he was appointed [[Marshal of France]].\n\nIn 1434 or 1435 he retired from military life, depleted his wealth by staging an extravagant theatrical spectacle of his own composition, and was accused of dabbling in the [[occult]]. After 1432, Rais was accused of engaging in a series of child murders, with victims possibly numbering in the hundreds. The killings came to an end in 1440, when a violent dispute with a clergyman led to an ecclesiastical investigation that brought the crimes to light, and attributed them to Rais. At his trial the parents of missing children in the surrounding area and Rais's own confederates in crime testified against him. He was condemned to death and hanged at [[Nantes]] on 26 October 1440.\n\nRais is believed to be the inspiration for the French folktale \"[[Bluebeard]]\" (\"Barbe bleue\"), which is earliest recorded in 1697.\n\n== Early life ==\nGilles de Rais was born on an unknown date, perhaps in late 1405<ref>{{cite book|first=Matei|last=Cazacu|title=Gilles de Rais|publisher=Tallandier|location=Paris, France|date=2005|ISBN=978-2847342277|pages=11; 23\u201325|language=French}}</ref> to Guy II de Montmorency-Laval and Marie de Craon in the family castle at [[Champtoc\u00e9-sur-Loire]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Ambroise Ledru, \"Gilles de Rais dit Barbe-Bleue, mar\u00e9chal de France.

The play consisted of more than 20,000 lines of verse, requiring 140 speaking parts and 500 extras. Rais was almost bankrupt at the time of the production and began selling property as early as 1432 to support his extravagant lifestyle. By March 1433, he had sold all his estates in Poitou (except his wife's) and all his property in Maine. Only two castles in [[Anjou]], [[Champtoc\u00e9-sur-Loire]] and [[Ingrandes, Maine-et-Loire|Ingrandes]], remained in his possession. Half the total sales and mortgages was spent on the production of his play. It was first performed in [[Orl\u00e9ans]] on 8&nbsp;May 1435. Six hundred costumes were constructed, worn once, discarded, and constructed afresh for subsequent performances. Unlimited supplies of food and drink were made available to spectators at Rais' expense.<ref>{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=128\u2013133}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1435, family members gathered to put a curb on Rais. They appealed to [[Pope Eugene IV]] to disavow the Chapel of the Holy Innocents (he refused) and carried their concerns to the king. On 2&nbsp;July 1435, a royal edict was proclaimed in [[Orl\u00e9ans]], [[Tours]], [[Angers]], [[Pouzauges]] and [[Champtoc\u00e9-sur-Loire]] denouncing Rais as a [[spendthrift]] and forbidding him to sell any more property. No subject of Charles VII was allowed to enter into any contract with him, and those in command of his castles were forbidden to dispose of them. Rais' credit fell immediately and his creditors pressed upon him. He borrowed heavily, using his ''[[Objet d'art|objets d'art]]'', manuscripts, books and clothing as security. When he left Orl\u00e9ans in late August or early September 1435, the town was littered with precious objects he was forced to leave behind. The edict did not apply to Brittany, and the family was unable to persuade the Duchy of Brittany to enforce it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=135}}</ref>\n\n=== Occult involvement ===\nIn 1438, according to testimony at his trial by the priest Eustache Blanchet and the cleric [[Fran\u00e7ois Prelati]], Rais sent out Blanchet to seek individuals who knew [[alchemy]] and [[Evocation|demon summoning]]. Blanchet contacted Prelati in [[Florence]] and persuaded him to take service with his Master. Having reviewed the [[Grimoire|magical books]] of Prelati and a traveling Breton, Rais chose to initiate experiments, the first in the lower hall of his [[Ch\u00e2teau de Tiffauges|castle at Tiffauges]], attempting to summon a demon named Barron. Rais provided a contract with the demon for riches that Prelati was to give to the demon later.\n\nAs no demon manifested after three tries, the Marshal grew frustrated with the lack of results. Prelati said Barron was angry and required the offering of parts of a child. Rais provided these remnants in a glass vessel at a future evocation, but to no avail, and the occult experiments left him bitter and his wealth severely depleted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Georges|last=Bataille|title=The Trial of Gilles de Rais|publisher=Amok Books|location=Los Angeles, California|date=1991|ISBN=978-1878923028}}</ref>\n\n== Child murders ==\n\nIn his confession, Rais said he committed his first assaults on children between spring 1432 and spring 1433.<ref name=\"BenedettiP109\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=109}}</ref> The first murders occurred at [[Champtoc\u00e9-sur-Loire]], but no account of them survived.<ref name=\"BenedettiP112\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=112}}</ref> Shortly after, Rais moved to [[Machecoul]], where, according to his confession, he killed, or ordered to be killed, a large but uncertain number of children after he [[sodomy|sodomized]] them.<ref name=\"BenedettiP112\" />\n\nThe first documented case of child-snatching and murder concerns a boy of 12 called Jeudon (first name unknown), an apprentice to the [[furrier]] Guillaume Hilairet.<ref name=\"BenedettiP113\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=113}}</ref> Rais' cousins Gilles de Sill\u00e9 and Roger de Briqueville asked the furrier to lend them the boy to take a message to Machecoul, and, when Jeudon did not return, the two noblemen told the inquiring furrier that they were ignorant of the boy's whereabouts and suggested he had been carried off by thieves at [[Tiffauges]] to be made into a [[Page (occupation)|page]].<ref name=\"BenedettiP113\" /> At Rais' trial, the events were attested to by Hilairet and his wife, the boy's father Jean Jeudon, and five others from Machecoul.\n\nIn his 1971 biography of Rais, Jean Benedetti tells how the children who fell into Rais' hands were put to death:\n\n{{quote|text=[The boy] was pampered and dressed in better clothes than he had ever known. The evening began with a large meal and heavy drinking, particularly [[hippocras]], which acted as a stimulant. The boy was then taken to an upper room to which only Gilles and his immediate circle were admitted. There he was confronted with the true nature of his situation. The shock thus produced on the boy was an initial source of pleasure for Gilles.<ref name=\"BenedettiP113\" />}}\n\nRais' bodyservant \u00c9tienne Corrillaut, known as Poitou, was an accomplice in many of the crimes and testified that his master stripped the child naked and hung him with ropes from a hook to prevent him from crying out, then [[masturbation|masturbated]] upon the child's belly or thighs. If the victim was a boy he would touch his genitals (particularly testicles) and buttocks. Taking the victim down, Rais comforted the child and assured him he only wanted to play with him. Rais then either killed the child himself or had the child killed by his cousin Gilles de Sill\u00e9, Poitou or another bodyservant called Henriet.<ref name=\"BenedettiP114\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=114}}</ref> The victims were killed by decapitation, cutting of their throats, dismemberment, or breaking of their necks with a stick. A short, thick, double-edged [[sword]] called a ''braquemard'' was kept at hand for the murders.<ref name=\"BenedettiP114\"/> Poitou further testified that Rais sometimes abused the victims (whether boys or girls) before wounding them and at other times after the victim had been slashed in the throat or decapitated. According to Poitou, Rais disdained the victims' sexual organs, and took \"infinitely more pleasure in debauching himself in this manner&nbsp;... than in using their natural orifice, in the normal manner.\"<ref name=\"BenedettiP114\"/>\n\nIn his own confession, Gilles testified that \u201cwhen the said children were dead, he kissed them and those who had the most handsome limbs and heads he held up to admire them, and had their bodies cruelly cut open and took delight at the sight of their inner organs; and very often when the children were dying he sat on their stomachs and took pleasure in seeing them die and laughed\u201d.<ref name=\"BenedettiP115\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=115}}</ref>\n\nPoitou testified that he and Henriet burned the bodies in the fireplace in Rais' room. The clothes of the victim were placed into the fire piece by piece so they burned slowly and the smell was minimized. The ashes were then thrown into the cesspit, the moat, or other hiding places.<ref name=\"BenedettiP115\" /> The last recorded murder was of the son of \u00c9onnet de Villeblanche and his wife Mac\u00e9e. Poitou paid 20 ''[[Solidus (coin)#France|sous]]'' to have a page's [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] made for the victim, who was then assaulted, murdered and incinerated in August 1440.<ref name=\"BenedettiP171\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=171}}</ref>\n\n=== Trial and execution ===\n[[File:Gilles-de-rais-tribunal.jpg|thumb|left|Trial of Gilles de Rais]]\nOn 15 May 1440, Rais kidnapped a cleric during a dispute at the Church of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-de-Mer-Morte]].<ref name=\"BenedettiP168\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=168}}</ref><ref name=\"WolfP173\u201c\">{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=173}}</ref> The act prompted an investigation by the [[Bishop of Nantes]], during which evidence of Rais' crimes was uncovered.<ref name=\"BenedettiP168\" /> On 29 July, the Bishop released his findings,<ref name=\"BenedettiP169\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=169}}</ref> and he subsequently obtained the prosecutorial cooperation of Rais' former protector, [[John VI, Duke of Brittany]].

The number of murders is generally placed between 100 and 200; a few have conjectured that there were more than 600.

Writers such as secret societies specialist [[:fr:Jean-Pierre Bayard|Jean-Pierre Bayard]], in his book ''Plaidoyer pour Gilles de Rais'', contend he was a victim of the [[Inquisition]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, anthropologist [[Margaret Murray]] and occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] questioned the involvement of the ecclesiastic and secular authorities in the case. Crowley described Rais as \"in almost every respect...the male equivalent of Joan of Arc\", whose main crime was \"the pursuit of knowledge\".<ref name=\"Crowley2011\">{{cite book|first=Aleister|last=Crowley|authorlink=Aleister Crowley|title=The Banned Lecture: Gilles de Rais|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAcOqAAACAAJ|date=December 2011|publisher=Black Moon Publishing|location=New Orleans, Louisiana|isbn=978-1-890399-39-9}}</ref> Murray, who propagated the [[witch-cult hypothesis]], speculated in her book ''[[The Witch-Cult in Western Europe]]'' that Rais was really a witch and an adherent of a [[fertility cult]] centered on the [[pagan]] goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].<ref>{{cite book|first= Margaret|last= Murray|authorlink=Margaret Murray|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20411|title= The Witch-Cult in Western Europe|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford, England|date=1921|ISBN=978-1304099136|pages= 173\u2013174|quote= Gilles de Rais was tried and executed as a witch and, in the same way, much that is mysterious in this trial can also be explained by the Dianic Cult}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aeja.org/Murray/index.html |title=\"Historical Association for Joan of Arc Studies.\" |access-date=2006-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927110534/http://www.aeja.org/Murray/index.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Most historians reject Murray's theory.<ref>{{cite book|first=Hugh R.|last=Trevor-Roper|title=The European Witch-craze of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries|publisher=[[Penguin Publishing]]|location=New York City|date=1969|ISBN=978-0140137187}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Jeffrey|last=Russell|title=A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans|date=1970.</ref><ref>Simpson, Jacqueline. \"Margaret Murray: Who Believed Her and Why?\" ''Folkrealllore'' 105, 1994, pp. 89\u201396.</ref><ref>Hutton, Ronald.

He earned the favour of the Duke of Brittany and was admitted to the French court. From 1427 to 1435, Rais served as a commander in the French army, and fought alongside Joan of Arc against the English and their [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] allies during the [[Hundred Years' War]], for which he was appointed [[Marshal of France]].\n\nIn 1434 or 1435 he retired from military life, depleted his wealth by staging an extravagant theatrical spectacle of his own composition, and was accused of dabbling in the [[occult]]. After 1432, Rais was accused of engaging in a series of child murders, with victims possibly numbering in the hundreds. The killings came to an end in 1440, when a violent dispute with a clergyman led to an ecclesiastical investigation that brought the crimes to light, and attributed them to Rais. At his trial the parents of missing children in the surrounding area and Rais's own confederates in crime testified against him. He was condemned to death and hanged at [[Nantes]] on 26 October 1440.\n\nRais is believed to be the inspiration for the French folktale \"[[Bluebeard]]\" (\"Barbe bleue\"), which is earliest recorded in 1697.\n\n== Early life ==\nGilles de Rais was born on an unknown date, perhaps in late 1405<ref>{{cite book|first=Matei|last=Cazacu|title=Gilles de Rais|publisher=Tallandier|location=Paris, France|date=2005|ISBN=978-2847342277|pages=11; 23\u201325|language=French}}</ref> to Guy II de Montmorency-Laval and Marie de Craon in the family castle at [[Champtoc\u00e9-sur-Loire]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Ambroise Ledru, \"Gilles de Rais dit Barbe-Bleue, mar\u00e9chal de France.

Half the total sales and mortgages was spent on the production of his play. It was first performed in [[Orl\u00e9ans]] on 8&nbsp;May 1435. Six hundred costumes were constructed, worn once, discarded, and constructed afresh for subsequent performances. Unlimited supplies of food and drink were made available to spectators at Rais' expense.<ref>{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|pp=128\u2013133}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1435, family members gathered to put a curb on Rais. They appealed to [[Pope Eugene IV]] to disavow the Chapel of the Holy Innocents (he refused) and carried their concerns to the king. On 2&nbsp;July 1435, a royal edict was proclaimed in [[Orl\u00e9ans]], [[Tours]], [[Angers]], [[Pouzauges]] and [[Champtoc\u00e9-sur-Loire]] denouncing Rais as a [[spendthrift]] and forbidding him to sell any more property. No subject of Charles VII was allowed to enter into any contract with him, and those in command of his castles were forbidden to dispose of them. Rais' credit fell immediately and his creditors pressed upon him. He borrowed heavily, using his ''[[Objet d'art|objets d'art]]'', manuscripts, books and clothing as security. When he left Orl\u00e9ans in late August or early September 1435, the town was littered with precious objects he was forced to leave behind. The edict did not apply to Brittany, and the family was unable to persuade the Duchy of Brittany to enforce it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=135}}</ref>\n\n=== Occult involvement ===\nIn 1438, according to testimony at his trial by the priest Eustache Blanchet and the cleric [[Fran\u00e7ois Prelati]], Rais sent out Blanchet to seek individuals who knew [[alchemy]] and [[Evocation|demon summoning]]. Blanchet contacted Prelati in [[Florence]] and persuaded him to take service with his Master. Having reviewed the [[Grimoire|magical books]] of Prelati and a traveling Breton, Rais chose to initiate experiments, the first in the lower hall of his [[Ch\u00e2teau de Tiffauges|castle at Tiffauges]], attempting to summon a demon named Barron. Rais provided a contract with the demon for riches that Prelati was to give to the demon later.\n\nAs no demon manifested after three tries, the Marshal grew frustrated with the lack of results. Prelati said Barron was angry and required the offering of parts of a child. Rais provided these remnants in a glass vessel at a future evocation, but to no avail, and the occult experiments left him bitter and his wealth severely depleted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Georges|last=Bataille|title=The Trial of Gilles de Rais|publisher=Amok Books|location=Los Angeles, California|date=1991|ISBN=978-1878923028}}</ref>\n\n== Child murders ==\n\nIn his confession, Rais said he committed his first assaults on children between spring 1432 and spring 1433.<ref name=\"BenedettiP109\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=109}}</ref> The first murders occurred at [[Champtoc\u00e9-sur-Loire]], but no account of them survived.<ref name=\"BenedettiP112\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=112}}</ref> Shortly after, Rais moved to [[Machecoul]], where, according to his confession, he killed, or ordered to be killed, a large but uncertain number of children after he [[sodomy|sodomized]] them.<ref name=\"BenedettiP112\" />\n\nThe first documented case of child-snatching and murder concerns a boy of 12 called Jeudon (first name unknown), an apprentice to the [[furrier]] Guillaume Hilairet.<ref name=\"BenedettiP113\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=113}}</ref> Rais' cousins Gilles de Sill\u00e9 and Roger de Briqueville asked the furrier to lend them the boy to take a message to Machecoul, and, when Jeudon did not return, the two noblemen told the inquiring furrier that they were ignorant of the boy's whereabouts and suggested he had been carried off by thieves at [[Tiffauges]] to be made into a [[Page (occupation)|page]].<ref name=\"BenedettiP113\" /> At Rais' trial, the events were attested to by Hilairet and his wife, the boy's father Jean Jeudon, and five others from Machecoul.\n\nIn his 1971 biography of Rais, Jean Benedetti tells how the children who fell into Rais' hands were put to death:\n\n{{quote|text=[The boy] was pampered and dressed in better clothes than he had ever known. The evening began with a large meal and heavy drinking, particularly [[hippocras]], which acted as a stimulant. The boy was then taken to an upper room to which only Gilles and his immediate circle were admitted. There he was confronted with the true nature of his situation. The shock thus produced on the boy was an initial source of pleasure for Gilles.<ref name=\"BenedettiP113\" />}}\n\nRais' bodyservant \u00c9tienne Corrillaut, known as Poitou, was an accomplice in many of the crimes and testified that his master stripped the child naked and hung him with ropes from a hook to prevent him from crying out, then [[masturbation|masturbated]] upon the child's belly or thighs. If the victim was a boy he would touch his genitals (particularly testicles) and buttocks. Taking the victim down, Rais comforted the child and assured him he only wanted to play with him. Rais then either killed the child himself or had the child killed by his cousin Gilles de Sill\u00e9, Poitou or another bodyservant called Henriet.<ref name=\"BenedettiP114\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=114}}</ref> The victims were killed by decapitation, cutting of their throats, dismemberment, or breaking of their necks with a stick. A short, thick, double-edged [[sword]] called a ''braquemard'' was kept at hand for the murders.<ref name=\"BenedettiP114\"/> Poitou further testified that Rais sometimes abused the victims (whether boys or girls) before wounding them and at other times after the victim had been slashed in the throat or decapitated. According to Poitou, Rais disdained the victims' sexual organs, and took \"infinitely more pleasure in debauching himself in this manner&nbsp;... than in using their natural orifice, in the normal manner.\"<ref name=\"BenedettiP114\"/>\n\nIn his own confession, Gilles testified that \u201cwhen the said children were dead, he kissed them and those who had the most handsome limbs and heads he held up to admire them, and had their bodies cruelly cut open and took delight at the sight of their inner organs; and very often when the children were dying he sat on their stomachs and took pleasure in seeing them die and laughed\u201d.<ref name=\"BenedettiP115\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=115}}</ref>\n\nPoitou testified that he and Henriet burned the bodies in the fireplace in Rais' room. The clothes of the victim were placed into the fire piece by piece so they burned slowly and the smell was minimized. The ashes were then thrown into the cesspit, the moat, or other hiding places.<ref name=\"BenedettiP115\" /> The last recorded murder was of the son of \u00c9onnet de Villeblanche and his wife Mac\u00e9e. Poitou paid 20 ''[[Solidus (coin)#France|sous]]'' to have a page's [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] made for the victim, who was then assaulted, murdered and incinerated in August 1440.<ref name=\"BenedettiP171\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=171}}</ref>\n\n=== Trial and execution ===\n[[File:Gilles-de-rais-tribunal.jpg|thumb|left|Trial of Gilles de Rais]]\nOn 15 May 1440, Rais kidnapped a cleric during a dispute at the Church of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-de-Mer-Morte]].<ref name=\"BenedettiP168\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=168}}</ref><ref name=\"WolfP173\u201c\">{{Harvnb|Wolf|1980|p=173}}</ref> The act prompted an investigation by the [[Bishop of Nantes]], during which evidence of Rais' crimes was uncovered.<ref name=\"BenedettiP168\" /> On 29 July, the Bishop released his findings,<ref name=\"BenedettiP169\">{{Harvnb|Benedetti|1971|p=169}}</ref> and he subsequently obtained the prosecutorial cooperation of Rais' former protector, [[John VI, Duke of Brittany]].

The transcript, which included testimony by the parents of many of these children as well as graphic descriptions of the murders provided by Rais' accomplices, was said to be so lurid that the judges ordered the worst parts to be struck from the record.\n\nThe number of Rais' victims is not known, as most of the bodies were burned or buried. The number of murders is generally placed between 100 and 200; a few have conjectured that there were more than 600.

Counterarguments are based on the theory that Rais was himself a victim of an ecclesiastic plot or act of revenge by the [[Catholic Church]] or French State. Doubts about Rais' guilt have long persisted because the Duke of Brittany, who was given the authority to prosecute, received all the titles to Rais' former lands after his conviction.
