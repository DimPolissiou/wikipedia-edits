A complete Yuga cycle consists of ''[[Satya Yuga]]'', ''[[Treta Yuga]],'' ''[[Dvapara Yuga]], and'' ''[[Kali Yuga]]''. Traditionally, Kali Yuga is followed by Satya Yuga at the start of each cycle (S,T,D,K) (S,T,D,K).

One can also compare the current age with the characteristics described for each yuga and see that Kali Yuga is the best match. \n\nSome scholars say that our present time is ascending Kali Yuga,<ref>{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=BBwLVlOipyUC&pg=PA15&dq=four+yugas#v=onepage&q=four%20yugas&f=false| title=The Path to Immortality|page=15|first1= Mark L.|last1=Prophet|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Clare Prophet|author2-link=Elizabeth Clare Prophet|publisher= Summit University Press| isbn=9781932890099| year=2006}}</ref> while some other scholars say that Kali Yuga ended in 1700 CE and now we're in ascending Dwapara Yuga.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Holy Science|last=Swami|first=Sri Yukeshwar Giri|publisher=Yogoda Satsang Society|year=1949|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics of the four Yugas ==\nThere are four Yugas in one cycle:\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' (or Krita Yuga)\n* ''[[Treta Yuga]]''\n* ''[[Dwapara Yuga]]''\n* ''[[Kali Yuga]]''\n\n=== Characteristics of each Yuga ===\n\n* '''Satya Yuga''' (\"The age of truth\" or \"[[Golden Age#Hindu|Golden Age]]\"): The first and best yuga. It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of a Yuga cycle is traditionally believed to be 4,320,000 years (12,000 divine years). Some modern scholars believe in a shorter cycle of 24,000 years. Some other scholars believe in a 25,772 year cycle because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system. {{Original research|date=February 2020}}However, the traditional timescale is more widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga. The Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) - Satya, Dwapar, Treta and Kali.\n\nKali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nDwapar Yuga (432,000 * 2) = '''864,000 years'''\n\nTreta Yuga (432,000 * 3) = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nSatya Yuga (432,000 * 4) = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is one cycle of the four yugas which lasts for '''4,320,000 years'''. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day (kalpa) of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night (kalpa) is of equal duration. So the entire day-night (24 hrs) of Brahma lasts: \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 years and when he passes away the universe ends. When a new Brahma is born, a new universe is created again. \n\nThere are 360 days in Brahma's year and he lives for 100 of his years. The entire duration of life for the universe is:\n\n8,640,000,000 * 360 * 100 = '''311,040,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nA shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle differing greatly from the traditional calculations.\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 432,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). It's believed that this originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". It is believed that this was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]].\n\nHowever, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=\"penprase182\" />\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The duration of the Satya Yuga is therefore 4,800 \u00d7 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tret\u0101 Yuga is 3,600 \u00d7 360, or 1,296,000 years. The duration of the Dv\u0101para Yuga is 2,400 \u00d7 360, or 864,000 years.<ref name=web>{{Cite book|url=http://vedabase.com/sb/3/11/19/|title=SB 3.11.19|first=|last=|access-date=15 July 2011|website=vedabase.com|date=2011-07-15}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a Time measurement section of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a Book I Chapter III adds:\n\n* 2 Ayanas (6-month periods, see above) = 1 human year or 1 day of the devas.\n* 12,000 divine years = 4 Yugas (= 4,320,000 human years) = 1 Mah\u0101-Yuga (also is equal to 12,000 Daiva [divine] Yuga).\n* 2 \u00d7 12,000 = 24,000 divine year = 12000 revolutions of sun around its dual.\n\nWhile the long yuga count is the most popular, it does not correlate to any known celestial motion found in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]. The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme. Human stature was 21 cubits (33&nbsp;ft 6 inches). Average human lifespan was 100,000 years.\n* ''[[Treta Yuga]]'' \u2013 There was 3 quarter virtue and 1 quarter sin.

A complete Yuga cycle consists of ''[[Satya Yuga]]'', ''[[Treta Yuga]],'' ''[[Dvapara Yuga]], and'' ''[[Kali Yuga]]''.

It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of a Yuga cycle is traditionally believed to be 4,320,000 years (12,000 divine years). Some modern scholars believe in a shorter cycle of 24,000 years. Some other scholars believe in a 25,772 year cycle because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system. {{Original research|date=February 2020}}However, the traditional timescale is more widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga. The Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) - Satya, Dwapar, Treta and Kali.\n\nKali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nDwapar Yuga (432,000 * 2) = '''864,000 years'''\n\nTreta Yuga (432,000 * 3) = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nSatya Yuga (432,000 * 4) = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is one cycle of the four yugas which lasts for '''4,320,000 years'''. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day (kalpa) of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night (kalpa) is of equal duration. So the entire day-night (24 hrs) of Brahma lasts: \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 years and when he passes away the universe ends. When a new Brahma is born, a new universe is created again. \n\nSo the entire duration of life of universe is -\n\n8,640,000,000 * 365 * 100 = '''315,360,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nA shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle differing greatly from the traditional calculations.\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 432,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). It's believed that this originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". It is believed that this was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]].\n\nHowever, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=\"penprase182\" />\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The duration of the Satya Yuga is therefore 4,800 \u00d7 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tret\u0101 Yuga is 3,600 \u00d7 360, or 1,296,000 years.

The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

The film was directed by the husband-and-wife team of [[Rocky Morton]] and [[Annabel Jankel]], written by Parker Bennett, Terry Runt\u00e9 and [[Ed Solomon]], and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] through [[Hollywood Pictures]]. Its story follows the Mario brothers ([[Bob Hoskins]] and [[John Leguizamo]]) in their quest to rescue [[Princess Daisy]] ([[Samantha Mathis]]) from a [[Dystopia|dystopic]] parallel universe ruled by the ruthless [[Bowser (character)|President Koopa]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]).\n\nGiven free creative license by Nintendo, the screenwriters envisioned the film as a subversive comedy with a \"weird and dark\" tone similar to ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984); the setting was primarily inspired by ''[[Super Mario World]]'' (1990), with other elements drawn from [[fairy tale]]s and contemporary American culture. Released on May 28, 1993, the film was unsuccessful critically and financially, grossing $20.9 million domestically against a budget of $48 million. Reviewers praised the film for its innovative special effects, creative artistic direction, and the performances of its actors, but criticized the confusing narrative, lack of similarity to the games and inconsistent tone; ''Mario'' creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] opined that while there was effort put into the film, the end result tried too hard to replicate the game series.\n\nDespite its poor reception, the film's producer and co-director have claimed that ''Super Mario Bros.'' gained a [[Cult film|cult following]] in later years. In 2012, a [[webcomic]] sequel was produced by fans in collaboration with Bennett. It remained  the only live-action film based on a Nintendo property until ''[[Detective Pikachu (film)|Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu]]'' (2019).  As of 2018, an animated ''Mario'' [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] film was in development by [[Universal Pictures]] through its [[Illumination (animation company)|Illumination]] division, with Miyamoto serving as co-producer alongside Illumination founder [[Chris Meledandri]], with the film's release slated for 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nAbout 65 million years ago, a [[Chicxulub impactor|meteorite crashes]] into the Earth, [[K-Pg extinction event|killing the dinosaurs]] and splitting the universe into two parallel dimensions. The surviving dinosaurs cross into a new dimension and evolve into a humanoid race. In the present, a mysterious woman leaves a large egg, along with a rock, at a Catholic orphanage, but as she attempts to leave, she is accosted by [[Bowser (character)|King Koopa]], who demands the location of the rock. Rocks then fall onto the woman, killing her. The egg then hatches, containing an infant girl.\n\nTwenty years later, [[Italian Americans|Italian American]] plumbers [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] live in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. They are on the verge of being driven out of business by the mafia-operated Scapelli Construction Company led by Anthony Scapelli. Luigi falls for [[New York University|NYU]] student [[Princess Daisy|Daisy]], who is digging under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] for dinosaur bones. After a date, Daisy takes Luigi back to the bridge only to witness two of Scapelli's men sabotaging it by leaving the water pipes open. Mario and Luigi manage to fix it but are knocked unconscious by [[Iggy Koopa|Iggy]] and Spike, Koopa's henchmen and cousins, who kidnap Daisy. Mario and Luigi awaken and pursue them through an interdimensional portal that leads them to Dinohattan.\n\nIggy and Spike realize they didn't bring Daisy's rock, a meteorite fragment which Koopa is trying to get in order to merge his world with the human world. It is then revealed that Daisy is the long-lost [[Princess]] of the other dimension. When Koopa overthrew Daisy's father the [[King]] and devolved him into fungus, her mother the [[Queen regnant|Queen]] took her to Brooklyn. The portal was then closed, but Scapelli's men inadvertently reopened the portal when they blasted the cave. Koopa sends Spike and Iggy to find Daisy and the rock to merge the dimensions and make him dictator of both worlds. However, after Koopa subjects them to one of his experiments to make them more intelligent, Spike and Iggy realize Koopa's evil intentions and side with the Mario Bros. in the desert. Daisy is taken to Koopa-Tower, where she meets [[Yoshi]]. Koopa informs Daisy that she descended from the dinosaurs, believing only Daisy can merge the worlds because of her royal heritage. Eventually, the Mario Bros. rescue Daisy with the help of [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], a good-natured guitarist who was devolved into a [[Goomba]] as punishment.\n\nEventually, the two worlds merge and Koopa devolves Scapelli into a chimpanzee before going after Mario, but Luigi and Daisy manage to remove the fragment from the meteorite and the worlds separate again. In Dinohattan, Mario confronts Koopa and eventually defeats him when he and Luigi fire their devolution guns at Koopa and blast him with a [[List of Mario franchise characters#Recurring enemies|Bob-omb]]. Koopa, now transformed into a ferocious, semi-humanoid ''Tyrannosaurus'', attempts to kill the Mario Bros., but they destroy him once and for all by transforming him into an actual ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', which is too intense for him to live through and instead turns him into [[Primordial soup|primeval slime]]. With Daisy's father restored after Koopa's defeat, he reclaims control over the kingdom. The citizens celebrate and immediately destroy anything under Koopa's influence. Luigi professes his love for Daisy and wants her to come to Brooklyn with him, but Daisy cannot come until the damage caused by Koopa is repaired and thus, she wants to spend more time with her father. Heartbroken, Luigi kisses Daisy goodbye as he and Mario return home to Brooklyn, with Daisy watching them leave. Three weeks later, the Mario Bros. are getting ready for dinner when their story comes on the news and the anchorman says they should be called the \"Super Mario Bros.\" Daisy then arrives and asks the Mario Bros. to help her on a new mission.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], two Japanese business executives propose making a video game based on Iggy and Spike, now trapped on Earth, who decide on the title ''The Super Koopa Cousins''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Mario|Mario Mario]]\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Luigi| Luigi Mario]]\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as [[Bowser (character)|President Koopa]]\n* [[Samantha Mathis]] as [[Princess Daisy]]\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as [[Iggy Koopa|Iggy]]\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Spike\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Lena\n* [[Mojo Nixon]] as [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]]\n* Dana Kaminski as Daniella\n* Francesca Roberts as Big Bertha\n* [[Gianni Russo]] as Anthony Scapelli\n* [[Don Lake]] as Sgt.

One month after their meeting, Joff\u00e9 went to Nintendo's corporate headquarters in Kyoto spending 10 days waiting to meet Hiroshi Yamauchi. After some time, Joff\u00e9 received a phone call summoning him to Yamauchi's office. He pitched to Yamauchi the storyline which led to Nintendo receiving interest in the project.

The film was directed by the husband-and-wife team of [[Rocky Morton]] and [[Annabel Jankel]], written by Parker Bennett, Terry Runt\u00e9 and [[Ed Solomon]], and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] through [[Hollywood Pictures]]. Its story follows the Mario brothers ([[Bob Hoskins]] and [[John Leguizamo]]) in their quest to rescue [[Princess Daisy]] ([[Samantha Mathis]]) from a [[Dystopia|dystopic]] parallel universe ruled by the ruthless [[Bowser (character)|President Koopa]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]).\n\nGiven free creative license by Nintendo, the screenwriters envisioned the film as a subversive comedy with a \"weird and dark\" tone similar to ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984); the setting was primarily inspired by ''[[Super Mario World]]'' (1990), with other elements drawn from [[fairy tale]]s and contemporary American culture. Released on May 28, 1993, the film was unsuccessful critically and financially, grossing $20.9 million domestically against a budget of $48 million. Reviewers praised the film for its innovative special effects, creative artistic direction, and the performances of its actors, but criticized the confusing narrative, lack of similarity to the games and inconsistent tone; ''Mario'' creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] opined that while there was effort put into the film, the end result tried too hard to replicate the game series.\n\nDespite its poor reception, the film's producer and co-director have claimed that ''Super Mario Bros.'' gained a [[Cult film|cult]] following]] in later years. In 2012, a [[webcomic]] sequel was produced by fans in collaboration with Bennett. It remained  the only live-action film based on a Nintendo property until ''[[Detective Pikachu (film)|Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu]]'' (2019).  As of 2018, an animated ''Mario'' [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] film was in development by [[Universal Pictures]] through its [[Illumination (animation company)|Illumination]] division, with Miyamoto serving as co-producer alongside Illumination founder [[Chris Meledandri]], with the film's release slated for 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nAbout 65 million years ago, a [[Chicxulub impactor|meteorite crashes]] into the Earth, [[K-Pg extinction event|killing the dinosaurs]] and splitting the universe into two parallel dimensions. The surviving dinosaurs cross into a new dimension and evolve into a humanoid race. In the present, a mysterious woman leaves a large egg, along with a rock, at a Catholic orphanage, but as she attempts to leave, she is accosted by [[Bowser (character)|King Koopa]], who demands the location of the rock. Rocks then fall onto the woman, killing her. The egg then hatches, containing an infant girl.\n\nTwenty years later, [[Italian Americans|Italian American]] plumbers [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] live in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. They are on the verge of being driven out of business by the mafia-operated Scapelli Construction Company led by Anthony Scapelli. Luigi falls for [[New York University|NYU]] student [[Princess Daisy|Daisy]], who is digging under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] for dinosaur bones. After a date, Daisy takes Luigi back to the bridge only to witness two of Scapelli's men sabotaging it by leaving the water pipes open. Mario and Luigi manage to fix it but are knocked unconscious by [[Iggy Koopa|Iggy]] and Spike, Koopa's henchmen and cousins, who kidnap Daisy. Mario and Luigi awaken and pursue them through an interdimensional portal that leads them to Dinohattan.\n\nIggy and Spike realize they didn't bring Daisy's rock, a meteorite fragment which Koopa is trying to get in order to merge his world with the human world. It is then revealed that Daisy is the long-lost [[Princess]] of the other dimension. When Koopa overthrew Daisy's father the [[King]] and devolved him into fungus, her mother the [[Queen regnant|Queen]] took her to Brooklyn. The portal was then closed, but Scapelli's men inadvertently reopened the portal when they blasted the cave. Koopa sends Spike and Iggy to find Daisy and the rock to merge the dimensions and make him dictator of both worlds. However, after Koopa subjects them to one of his experiments to make them more intelligent, Spike and Iggy realize Koopa's evil intentions and side with the Mario Bros. in the desert. Daisy is taken to Koopa-Tower, where she meets [[Yoshi]]. Koopa informs Daisy that she descended from the dinosaurs, believing only Daisy can merge the worlds because of her royal heritage. Eventually, the Mario Bros. rescue Daisy with the help of [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], a good-natured guitarist who was devolved into a [[Goomba]] as punishment.\n\nEventually, the two worlds merge and Koopa devolves Scapelli into a chimpanzee before going after Mario, but Luigi and Daisy manage to remove the fragment from the meteorite and the worlds separate again. In Dinohattan, Mario confronts Koopa and eventually defeats him when he and Luigi fire their devolution guns at Koopa and blast him with a [[List of Mario franchise characters#Recurring enemies|Bob-omb]]. Koopa, now transformed into a ferocious, semi-humanoid ''Tyrannosaurus'', attempts to kill the Mario Bros., but they destroy him once and for all by transforming him into an actual ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', which is too intense for him to live through and instead turns him into [[Primordial soup|primeval slime]]. With Daisy's father restored after Koopa's defeat, he reclaims control over the kingdom. The citizens celebrate and immediately destroy anything under Koopa's influence. Luigi professes his love for Daisy and wants her to come to Brooklyn with him, but Daisy cannot come until the damage caused by Koopa is repaired and thus, she wants to spend more time with her father. Heartbroken, Luigi kisses Daisy goodbye as he and Mario return home to Brooklyn, with Daisy watching them leave. Three weeks later, the Mario Bros. are getting ready for dinner when their story comes on the news and the anchorman says they should be called the \"Super Mario Bros.\" Daisy then arrives and asks the Mario Bros. to help her on a new mission.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], two Japanese business executives propose making a video game based on Iggy and Spike, now trapped on Earth, who decide on the title ''The Super Koopa Cousins''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Mario|Mario Mario]]\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Luigi| Luigi Mario]]\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as [[Bowser (character)|President Koopa]]\n* [[Samantha Mathis]] as [[Princess Daisy]]\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as [[Iggy Koopa|Iggy]]\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Spike\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Lena\n* [[Mojo Nixon]] as [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]]\n* Dana Kaminski as Daniella\n* Francesca Roberts as Big Bertha\n* [[Gianni Russo]] as Anthony Scapelli\n* [[Don Lake]] as Sgt.

Joff\u00e9 met the Nintendo of America president and [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]]'s son-in law [[Minoru Arakawa]]. He presented Arakawa with an initial draft of the script. One month after their meeting, Joff\u00e9 went to Nintendo's corporate headquarters in Kyoto spending 10 days waiting to meet Hiroshi Yamauchi. After some time, Joff\u00e9 received a phone call summoning him to Yamauchi's office. He pitched to Yamauchi the storyline which led to Nintendo receiving interest in the project. Joff\u00e9 left with a $2 million contract giving the temporary control of the character of Mario over to Joff\u00e9. Nintendo retained merchandising rights for the film through a \"creative partnership\" with Lightmotive.<ref name=SuperLarge>{{cite news |last=Stayton |first=Richard |date=August 16, 1992 |title=The Bros.

However, Nintendo had no interest in creative control and believed the Mario brand was strong enough to allow an American experiment. \"I think they looked at the movie as some sort of strange creature that was kind of rather intriguing to see if we could walk or not,\" said Joff\u00e9.<ref name=Wired>{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Jamie|title=Why the Super Mario Movie Sucked|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/04/generation-xbox-super-mario-movie|website=Wired|date=April 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\"How do we catch this wonderful mixture of images and inputs and strangeness?\", Joff\u00e9 wondered.

Parker were brought on next to write a more traditional adaptation. \"So right away we knew that the best way to do this is to essentially have a journey into this world, not unlike ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'',\" said Jennewein. His and Parker's take on the story was to subvert fairy tale clich\u00e9s and satirize them, as well as focus on the relationship between Mario and Luigi.  \"Essentially what we did was what ''[[Shrek]]'' did,\" Jennewein argues. \"And we knew the story had to be about the brothers and that the emotional through-line would be about the brothers.\"<ref name=GameOver>{{Cite book|url=https://www.thisislukeowen.co.uk/lights-camera-game-over-read-online|title=Lights, Camera GAME OVER!: How Video Game Movies Get Made|last=Owen|first=Luke|date=2017|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9780764353178|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Greg Beeman]] of ''[[License to Drive]]'' was attached to direct and development had already moved into pre-production, but the failure of Beeman's recent ''[[Mom and Dad Save the World]]'' led to his dismissal by nervous producers.<ref name=SuperLarge/> Joff\u00e9 then offered [[Harold Ramis]] the director's mantle, but Ramis declined the opportunity despite being a fan of the video game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kohler|first=Chris|title=Harold Ramis Glad He Turned Down Mario Movie|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/06/harold-ramis-passed-on-mario-movie/|website=Wired|date=June 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n\"We tried some various avenues that didn't work, that came up too medieval or somehow wasn't the right thing.

[[Jared Harris]], [[Simon McBurney]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] also star.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in February 2016 in London.

It received mixed reviews from critics, although Pitt and particularly Cotillard's performances were praised, and grossed $119 million worldwide. It also received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1942 during [[World War II]], [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to [[Casablanca]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] to assassinate a German ambassador. He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.\n\nThe two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]].\n\nA year later in 1943, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident [[Hitler]] wanted dead. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of [[Misinformation|false intelligence]] at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for [[high treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\n\nDefying orders, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded by a wartime injury, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in [[Dieppe]] and would be able to identify her. Max finds a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note \u2014 asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour \u2014 and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare.\n\nMax and Marianne host a house party. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is all a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to [[V-Section]].\n\nThe following evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail, but Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.\n\nBack in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a German spy because German agents were threatening Anna.\n\nMax, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to flee the country. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] arrive. Max tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, and then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max himself will not be punished.\n\nAfter the war, Max moves to a ranch in [[Medicine Hat]], [[Alberta]], Canada, as he had always wanted to do, and raises Anna. Marianne reads a letter that she had written to her daughter, anticipating that one day her real identity would be uncovered.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan<ref name=\"Feb2015THR\" />\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour<ref name=\"CotillardCast\" />\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Colonel]] Frank Heslop<ref name=\"HarrisCast\" />\n* [[Daniel Betts]] as [[Flight Lieutenant]] George Kavanagh\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as [[Group Captain]] Guy Sangster\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as [[Pilot Officer]] Bridget Vatan,<ref name=\"CaplanCast\" /> Max's sister\n* [[Anton Lesser]] as Emmanuel Lombard\n* [[August Diehl]] as Captain Hobar\n* [[Camille Cottin]] as Monique\n* [[Charlotte Hope]] as Louise\n* [[Marion Bailey]] as Mrs. Sinclair\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as S.O.E.

It received mixed reviews from critics, although Pitt and particularly Cotillard's performances were praised, and grossed $119 million worldwide. It also received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1942 during [[World War II]], [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to [[Casablanca]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] to assassinate a German ambassador. He is partnered with a [[French Resistance]] fighter named Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.\n\nThe two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in [[Hampstead]], and have a baby girl named Anna, who is born during a [[The Blitz|bombing raid]].\n\nA year later in 1943, Max learns from the [[Special Operations Executive]] that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France, and that the German ambassador they assassinated was a dissident [[Hitler]] wanted dead. In order to test their suspicions, SOE run a \"blue dye\" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of [[Misinformation|false intelligence]] at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, and if he is found to be an accomplice he will be hanged for [[high treason]]. Max is told otherwise to act normally and not conduct his own investigation.\n\nDefying orders, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne; however, Sangster, blinded by a wartime injury, cannot confirm her identity. He reveals that resistance fighter Paul Delamare, who worked with Marianne in France, is still alive in [[Dieppe]] and would be able to identify her. Max finds a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph with a \"classified\" note \u2014 asking if the woman in the photo is Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour \u2014 and instructs him to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer from Delamare.\n\nMax and Marianne host a house party. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop comes and tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer from Delamare and berates him for his insubordination. Max wonders if what he was told about Marianne is all a test of his loyalty as part of a promotion to [[V-Section]].\n\nThe following evening, Max takes the place of a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] pilot and flies to France to meet Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail, but Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, whom Max and the resistance manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had once played ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.\n\nBack in England, Max takes Marianne to a local [[pub]] and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot. She admits she is a spy and forwarded the \"blue dye\" message, which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine, and that she was forced back into being a German spy because German agents were threatening Anna.\n\nMax, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to flee the country. He kills Marianne's [[Agent handling|handlers]], a nanny and a jeweller. They drive to a local airbase, but Max cannot get the plane to start before Heslop and the [[Military police of the United Kingdom|military police]] arrive. Max tries to plead his case before the officers, but Marianne tells him that she loves him, asks him to take care of Anna, and then shoots herself. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max himself will not be punished.\n\nAfter the war, Max moves to a ranch in [[Medicine Hat]], [[Alberta]], Canada, as he had always wanted to do, and raises Anna. Marianne reads a letter that she had written to her daughter, anticipating that one day her real identity would be uncovered.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Max Vatan<ref name=\"Feb2015THR\" />\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Marianne Beaus\u00e9jour<ref name=\"CotillardCast\" />\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Colonel]] Frank Heslop<ref name=\"HarrisCast\" />\n* [[Daniel Betts]] as [[Flight Lieutenant]] George Kavanagh\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as [[Group Captain]] Guy Sangster\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as [[Pilot Officer]] Bridget Vatan,<ref name=\"CaplanCast\" /> Max's sister\n* [[Anton Lesser]] as Emmanuel Lombard\n* [[August Diehl]] as Captain Hobar\n* [[Camille Cottin]] as Monique\n* [[Charlotte Hope]] as Louise\n* [[Marion Bailey]] as Mrs. Sinclair\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as S.O.E.

''[[TIME (magazine)|Time]]'' stated that \"Even within this highly synthetic world, Pitt and Cotillard give sturdy, coded performances that feel naturalistic, not phony: They understand clearly that
