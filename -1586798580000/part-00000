It differs from a [[submersible]], which has more limited underwater capability. It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to [[remotely operated vehicle]]s and [[Autonomous underwater vehicle|robots]], as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels, such as the [[midget submarine]] and the [[wet sub]].

Submarines were first widely used during [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), and are now used in many [[navy|navies]] large and small. Military uses include attacking enemy surface [[ship]]s (merchant and military), or other submarines, [[aircraft carrier]] protection, [[blockade]] running, [[ballistic missile submarine]]s as part of a nuclear strike force, [[reconnaissance]], conventional land attack (for example using a [[cruise missile]]), and covert insertion of [[special forces]]. Civilian uses for submarines include [[marine science]], salvage, exploration and facility inspection and maintenance. Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or [[undersea cable]] repair. Submarines are also used in tourism and [[undersea archaeology]].\n\nMost large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, which houses communications and sensing devices as well as [[periscope]]s. In modern submarines, this structure is the \"[[Sail (submarine)|sail]]\" in American usage and \"fin\" in European usage. A \"[[conning tower]]\" was a feature of earlier designs: a separate pressure hull above the main body of the [[boat]] that allowed the use of shorter periscopes. There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various hydrodynamic control fins. Smaller, deep-diving and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional layout. Submarines use [[diving plane]]s and also change the amount of water and air in [[ballast tank]]s to change [[buoyancy]] for submerging and surfacing.\n\nSubmarines have one of the widest ranges of types and capabilities of any vessel. They range from small autonomous examples and one- or two-person subs that operate for a few hours to vessels that can remain submerged for six months\u2014such as the Russian {{sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|4}}, the biggest submarines ever built. Submarines can work at greater depths than are survivable or practical for human [[Underwater diving|divers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Worlds Biggest Submarine|url=http://englishrussia.com/2009/04/14/worlds-biggest-submarine/ |last=Sherman|first=Chris |date=14 April 2009|website=English Russia |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> Modern deep-diving submarines derive from the [[bathyscaphe]], which in turn evolved from the [[diving bell]].\n==History==\n{{Main|History of submarines}}\n\n=== Etymology ===\nWhereas the principal meaning of \"submarine\" is an armed, submersible [[warship]], the more general meaning is for any type of submersible craft.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/submarine |title=submarine |website=Lexico |access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> The definition as of 1899 was for any type of \"submarine boat\".<ref>''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993, Vol. 2 N\u2013Z</ref> By [[naval tradition]], submarines are still usually referred to as \"boats\" rather than as \"ships\", regardless of their size.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ROPWAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=pig+boat |title=Pigboat 39: An American Sub Goes to War |last=Gugliotta |first=Bobette |date=2014-02-17 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=9780813146317 |language=en}}</ref> In other navies with a history of large submarine fleets they are also \"boats\"; in German it is an {{lang|de|Unterseeboot}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unterseebootbau|last=Gabler, Ulrich |date=1997|publisher=Bernard und Graefe|isbn=3763759581|edition=4th |location=Koblenz|oclc=75848309|language=de}}</ref> or {{lang|de|U-Boot}} (under-sea boat)<ref>{{Cite book |title=Uboote im 2.

This era marked a pivotal time in submarine development, and several important technologies appeared. A number of nations built and used submarines. [[Diesel-electric transmission|Diesel electric]] propulsion became the dominant power system and equipment such as the periscope became standardized. Countries conducted many experiments on effective tactics and weapons for submarines, which led to their large impact in [[World War I]].\n\nThe [[Ireland|Irish]] inventor [[John Philip Holland]] built a model submarine in 1876 and a full-scale version in 1878, which were followed by a number of unsuccessful ones. In 1896 he designed the Holland Type VI submarine, which used internal combustion engine power on the surface and electric [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power underwater. Launched on 17 May 1897 at Navy Lt. [[Lewis Nixon (naval architect)|Lewis Nixon]]'s [[Crescent Shipyard]] in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], ''Holland VI'' was purchased by the [[United States Navy]] on 11 April 1900, becoming the Navy's first commissioned submarine, christened {{USS|Holland|SS-1|6}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9040797/John-Philip-Holland |title=John Philip Holland |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nCommissioned in June 1900, the French steam and electric {{ship|French submarine|Narval|Q4|2}} employed the now typical double-hull design, with a pressure hull inside the outer shell. These 200-ton ships had a range of over {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} underwater. The French submarine ''Aigrette'' in 1904 further improved the concept by using a diesel rather than a gasoline engine for surface power. Large numbers of these submarines were built, with seventy-six completed before 1914.\n\nThe Royal Navy commissioned five {{sclass2-|Holland|submarine|2}}s from [[Vickers]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], under licence from the [[General Dynamics Electric Boat|Holland Torpedo Boat Company]] from 1901 to 1903. Construction of the boats took longer than anticipated, with the first only ready for a diving trial at sea on 6 April 1902. Although the design had been purchased entirely from the US company, the actual design used was an untested improvement to the original Holland design using a new {{convert|180|hp}} petrol engine.<ref>Galantin, Ignatius J., Admiral, USN (Ret.). Foreword to ''Submariner'' by Johnnie Coote, p. 1</ref>\n\nThese types of submarines were first used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u201305. Due to the blockade at [[Port Arthur, China|Port Arthur]], the Russians sent their submarines to [[Vladivostok]], where by 1 January 1905 there were seven boats, enough to create the world's first \"operational submarine fleet\". The new submarine fleet began patrols on 14 February, usually lasting for about 24 hours each. The first confrontation with Japanese warships occurred on 29 April 1905 when the Russian submarine [[Som-class submarine|''Som'']] was fired upon by Japanese torpedo boats, but then withdrew.<ref>Olender p. 175</ref>\n\n====World War I====\n[[File:U9Submarine.jpg|thumb|The German submarine {{SMU|U-9}}, which sank three British [[cruiser]]s in [[Action of 22 September 1914|less than an hour in September 1914]]]]\n\nMilitary submarines first made a significant impact in [[World War I]].

More submersibles than true submarines, U-boats operated primarily on the surface using regular engines, submerging occasionally to attack under battery power.

(Shipping was vital to supply Britain's population with food, industry with raw material, and armed forces with fuel and armaments.) While U-boats destroyed a significant number of ships, the strategy ultimately failed. Although the U-boats had been updated in the interwar years, the major innovation was improved communications, encrypted using the famous [[Enigma machine|Enigma cipher machine]]. This allowed for mass-attack [[naval tactics]] (''Rudeltaktik'', commonly known as \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]\"), but was also ultimately the U-boats' downfall. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ships (175 warships, 2,825 merchantmen) had been sunk by U-boats.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H.

They also had submarines with the highest submerged speeds during World War II ({{sclass-|I-201|submarine|2}}s) and submarines that could carry multiple aircraft ({{sclass-|I-400|submarine|2}}s). They were also equipped with one of the most advanced torpedoes of the conflict, the oxygen-propelled [[Type 95 torpedo|Type 95]]. Nevertheless, despite their technical prowess, Japan chose to use its submarines for fleet warfare, and consequently were relatively unsuccessful, as warships were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships.\n\nThe submarine force was the most effective anti-ship weapon in the American arsenal. Submarines, though only about 2 percent of the U.S. Navy, destroyed over 30 percent of the Japanese Navy, including 8 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship and 11 cruisers. US submarines also destroyed over 60 percent of the Japanese merchant fleet, crippling Japan's ability to supply its military forces and industrial war effort. [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War]] destroyed more Japanese shipping<!--because \"shipping\" means \"merchant\", generally, & that's the important factor--> than all other weapons combined. This feat was considerably aided by the Imperial Japanese Navy's failure to provide adequate escort forces for the nation's merchant fleet.\n\nDuring World War II, 314&nbsp;submarines served in the US Navy, of which nearly 260 were deployed to the Pacific.<ref name=\"O'Kane, p. 333\">O'Kane, p. 333</ref> When the Japanese attacked Hawaii in December 1941, 111 boats were in commission; 203 submarines from the {{sclass-|Gato|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Balao|submarine|5}}, and {{sclass-|Tench|submarine|4}}es were commissioned during the war.

Submarines would attack either on the surface, using deck guns or submerged, using [[torpedo]]es. They were particularly effective in sinking Allied transatlantic shipping in both World Wars, and in disrupting Japanese supply routes and naval operations in the Pacific in World War II.\n\n[[Naval mine|Mine]]-laying submarines were developed in the early part of the 20th century. The facility was used in both World Wars. Submarines were also used for inserting and removing covert agents and military forces in [[special operations]], for intelligence gathering, and to rescue aircrew during air attacks on islands, where the airmen would be told of safe places to crash-land so the submarines could rescue them. Submarines could carry cargo through hostile waters or act as supply vessels for other submarines.\n\nSubmarines could usually locate and attack other submarines only on the surface, although {{HMS|Venturer|P68|6}} managed to sink {{GS|U-864||2}} with a four torpedo spread while both were submerged. The British developed a specialized anti-submarine submarine in WWI, the [[British R-class submarine|R class]]. After WWII, with the development of the homing torpedo, better [[sonar]] systems, and [[nuclear propulsion]], submarines also became able to hunt each other effectively.\n\nThe development of [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] and submarine-launched [[cruise missile]]s gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from [[cluster bomb]]s to [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\nThe primary defense of a submarine lies in its ability to remain concealed in the depths of the ocean. Early submarines could be detected by the sound they made. Water is an excellent conductor of sound (much better than air), and submarines can detect and track comparatively noisy surface ships from long distances. Modern submarines are built with an emphasis on [[Stealth technology|stealth]]. Advanced [[propeller]] designs, extensive sound-reducing insulation, and special machinery help a submarine remain as quiet as ambient ocean noise, making them difficult to detect. It takes specialized technology to find and attack modern submarines.\n\n[[Sonar#Active sonar|Active sonar]] uses the reflection of sound emitted from the search equipment to detect submarines. It has been used since WWII by surface ships, submarines and aircraft (via dropped buoys and helicopter \"dipping\" arrays), but it reveals the emitter's position, and is susceptible to counter-measures.\n\nA concealed military submarine is a real threat, and because of its stealth, can force an enemy navy to waste resources searching large areas of ocean and protecting ships against attack. This advantage was vividly demonstrated in the 1982 [[Falklands War]] when the British [[nuclear-powered]] submarine {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} sank the Argentine cruiser {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano||2}}. After the sinking the Argentine Navy recognized that they had no effective defense against submarine attack, and the Argentine surface fleet withdrew to port for the remainder of the war, though an Argentine submarine remained at sea.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Finlan\n | first = Alastair\n | title = The Royal Navy in the Falklands Conflict and the Gulf War: Culture and Strategy\n | publisher = Psychology Press\n | series = British Politics and Society\n | volume = 15\n | date = 2004\n | location = London\n | pages = 214\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=TmP27lCid8AC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=general+belgrano+naval+strategy#v=onepage&q=general%20belgrano%20naval%20strategy&f=false\n | isbn = 978-0-7146-5479-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Civilian===\nAlthough the majority of the world's submarines are military, there are some civilian submarines, which are used for tourism, exploration, oil and gas platform inspections, and pipeline surveys.

The submarine then visits underwater points of interest such as natural or artificial reef structures. To surface safely without danger of collision the location of the submarine is marked with an air release and movement to the surface is coordinated by an observer in a support craft.\n\nA recent development is the deployment of so-called [[narco submarine]]s by South American drug smugglers to evade law enforcement detection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/05/AR2009060503718_3.html|work=The Washington Post|first1=William|last1=Booth|first2=Juan|last2=Forero|title=Plying the Pacific, Subs Surface as Key Tool of Drug Cartels|date=6 June 2009}}</ref> Although they occasionally deploy [[narco submarine#True submarines|true submarines]], most are self-propelled [[semi-submersible]]s, where a portion of the craft remains above water at all times.

To submerge hydrostatically, a ship must have negative buoyancy, either by increasing its own weight or decreasing its displacement of water. To control their displacement, submarines have [[ballast tank]]s, which can hold varying amounts of water and air.\n\nFor general submersion or surfacing, submarines use the forward and aft tanks, called Main Ballast Tanks (MBT), which are filled with water to submerge or with air to surface. Submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, which simplifies their design, and on many submarines these tanks are a section of interhull space. For more precise and quick control of depth, submarines use smaller Depth Control Tanks (DCT)\u2014also called hard tanks (due to their ability to withstand higher pressure), or trim tanks. The amount of water in depth control tanks can be controlled to change depth or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions (chiefly water density) change. Depth control tanks may be located either near the submarine's [[center of gravity]], or separated along the submarine body to prevent affecting [[dynamic trimming|trim]].\n\nWhen submerged, the water pressure on a submarine's hull can reach {{convert|4|MPa|psi|abbr=on|lk=on}} for steel submarines and up to {{convert|10|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} for [[titanium]] submarines like {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-278 Komsomolets||2}}, while interior pressure remains relatively unchanged. This difference results in hull compression, which decreases displacement. Water density also marginally increases with depth, as the [[salinity]] and pressure are higher.<ref name=nave>{{cite web|title=Bulk Elastic Properties|author=Nave, R.|work=HyperPhysics|publisher=[[Georgia State University]]|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html|accessdate=26 October 2007}}</ref> This change in density incompletely compensates for hull compression, so buoyancy decreases as depth increases. A submerged submarine is in an unstable equilibrium, having a tendency to either sink or float to the surface. Keeping a constant depth requires continual operation of either the depth control tanks or control surfaces.<ref name=\"Physics Of Liquids & Gases\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/tpecp_08.html|title=Physics Of Liquids & Gases|accessdate=7 October 2006|work=Elementary Classical Physics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Richard O'Kane|title=Wahoo|url=https://archive.org/details/wahoopatrolsofam00okan|url-access=registration|publisher=Presidio Press|year=1987|page=[https://archive.org/details/wahoopatrolsofam00okan/page/12 12]}}</ref>\n\nSubmarines in a neutral buoyancy condition are not intrinsically trim-stable. To maintain desired trim, submarines use forward and aft trim tanks. Pumps can move water between the tanks, changing weight distribution and pointing the sub up or down. A similar system is sometimes used to maintain stability.\n\n[[File:Kiosk Casabianca.jpg|thumb|[[Sail (submarine)|Sail]] of the French nuclear submarine {{ship|French submarine|Casabianca|S603|2}}; note the diving planes, [[camouflage]]d masts, periscope, electronic warfare masts, hatch, and [[wikt:deadlight|deadlight]].]]\nThe hydrostatic effect of variable ballast tanks is not the only way to control the submarine underwater. Hydrodynamic maneuvering is done by several surfaces, which can be moved to create hydrodynamic forces when a submarine moves at sufficient speed. The stern planes (hydroplanes in UK), located near the propeller and normally horizontal, serve the same purpose as the trim tanks, controlling the trim, and are commonly used, while other control surfaces may not be present on all submarines. The fairwater planes on the sail and/or bow planes on the main body, both also horizontal, are closer to the center of gravity, and are used to control depth with less effect on the trim.<ref>{{cite book|title=Concepts In Submarine Design|author1=Roy Burcher |author2=Louis Rydill |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|page=170}}</ref>\n\nWhen a submarine performs an emergency surfacing, all depth and trim methods are used simultaneously, together with propelling the boat upwards. Such surfacing is very quick, so the sub may even partially jump out of the water, potentially damaging submarine systems.\n\n===Hull===\n{{main|Submarine hull}}\n\n====Overview====\n[[File:USS Greeneville (SSN 772) - dry dock Pearl Harbor (1).jpg|thumb|The [[US Navy]] {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|0}} {{USS|Greeneville|SSN-772|6}} in dry dock, showing cigar-shaped hull]]\n\nModern submarines are cigar-shaped. This design, visible in early submarines, is sometimes called a \"[[teardrop hull]]\". It reduces the hydrodynamic [[drag (physics)|drag]] when submerged, but decreases the sea-keeping capabilities and increases drag while surfaced. Since the limitations of the propulsion systems of early submarines forced them to operate surfaced most of the time, their hull designs were a compromise. Because of the slow submerged speeds of those subs, usually well below 10&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|kt]] (18&nbsp;km/h), the increased drag for underwater travel was acceptable. Late in World War II, when technology allowed faster and longer submerged operation and increased aircraft surveillance forced submarines to stay submerged, hull designs became teardrop shaped again to reduce drag and noise. {{USS|Albacore|AGSS-569}} was a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form (sometimes referred to as an \"Albacore hull\") of modern submarines. On modern military submarines the outer hull is covered with a layer of sound-absorbing rubber, or [[anechoic tile|anechoic plating]], to reduce detection.\n\nThe occupied pressure hulls of deep diving submarines such as {{ship|DSV|Alvin}} are spherical instead of cylindrical. This allows a more even distribution of stress at the great depth. A titanium frame is usually affixed to the pressure hull, providing attachment for ballast and trim systems, scientific instrumentation, battery packs, [[syntactic foam|syntactic flotation foam]], and lighting.\n\nA raised tower on top of a submarine accommodates the [[periscope]] and electronics masts, which can include radio, [[radar]], [[electronic warfare]], and other systems including the snorkel mast. In many early classes of submarines (see history), the control room, or \"conn\", was located inside this tower, which was known as the \"[[conning tower]]\". Since then, the conn has been located within the hull of the submarine, and the tower is now called the \"[[Sail (submarine)|sail]]\". The conn is distinct from the \"bridge\", a small open platform in the top of the sail, used for observation during surface operation.\n\n\"Bathtubs\" are related to conning towers but are used on smaller submarines. The bathtub is a metal cylinder surrounding the hatch that prevents waves from breaking directly into the cabin. It is needed because surfaced submarines have limited [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], that is, they lie low in the water. Bathtubs help prevent swamping the vessel.\n\n==== Single and double hulls ====\n[[File:U995 2004 1.jpg|thumb|{{GS|U-995||2}}, Type VIIC/41 U-boat of World War II, showing the ship-like lines of the outer hull for surface travel, blended into the cylindrical pressure hull structure.]]\n\nModern submarines and submersibles, as well as the oldest ones, usually have a single hull. Large submarines generally have an additional hull or hull sections outside. This external hull, which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer hull (''[[Casing (submarine)|casing]]'' in the Royal Navy) or [[light hull]], as it does not have to withstand a pressure difference. Inside the outer hull there is a strong hull, or [[pressure hull]], which withstands sea pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside.\n\nAs early as World War I, it was realized that the optimal shape for withstanding pressure conflicted with the optimal shape for seakeeping and minimal drag, and construction difficulties further complicated the problem. This was solved either by a compromise shape, or by using two hulls; internal for holding pressure, and external for optimal shape. Until the end of World War II, most submarines had an additional partial cover on the top, bow and stern, built of thinner metal, which was flooded when submerged. Germany went further with the [[Type XXI]], a general predecessor of modern submarines, in which the pressure hull was fully enclosed inside the light hull, but optimized for submerged navigation, unlike earlier designs that were optimized for surface operation.\n\n[[File:SRH025-p40.jpg|thumb|left|[[Type XXI]] U-boat, late World War II, with pressure hull almost fully enclosed inside the light hull]]\nAfter World War II, approaches split. The Soviet Union changed its designs, basing them on German developments. All post-World War II heavy Soviet and Russian submarines are built with a [[double hull]] structure. American and most other Western submarines switched to a primarily single-hull approach. They still have light hull sections in the bow and stern, which house main ballast tanks and provide a hydrodynamically optimized shape, but the main cylindrical hull section has only a single plating layer. Double hulls are being considered for future submarines in the United States to improve payload capacity, stealth and range.<ref>[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2000/May/Virginia-Class.htm].

There are also examples of more than two hulls in a submarine, like the {{sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|4}}, which has two main pressure hulls and three smaller ones for control room, torpedoes and steering gear, with the missile launch system between the main hulls.\n\nThe [[Submarine depth ratings|dive depth]] cannot be increased easily. Simply making the hull thicker increases the weight and requires reduction of onboard equipment weight, ultimately resulting in a ''[[bathyscaphe]]''. This is acceptable for civilian research submersibles, but not military submarines.\n\nWWI submarines had hulls of [[carbon steel]], with a {{convert|100|m|ft|adj=on}} maximum depth. During WWII, high-strength [[alloy]]ed steel was introduced, allowing {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=on}} depths. High-strength alloy steel remains the primary material for submarines today, with {{convert|250|-|400|m|ft|adj=on}} depths, which cannot be exceeded on a military submarine without design compromises. To exceed that limit, a few submarines were built with [[titanium]] hulls. Titanium can be stronger than steel, lighter, and is not [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]], important for stealth. Titanium submarines were built by the Soviet Union, which developed specialized high-strength alloys. It has produced several types of titanium submarines. Titanium alloys allow a major increase in depth, but other systems must be redesigned to cope, so test depth was limited to {{convert|1000|m|ft}} for the {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-278 Komsomolets}}, the deepest-diving combat submarine. An {{sclass2-|Alfa|submarine|2}} may have successfully operated at {{convert|1300|m|ft}},<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/deep.htm|title=Federation of American Scientists|publisher=Fas.org|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> though continuous operation at such depths would produce excessive stress on many submarine systems. Titanium does not flex as readily as steel, and may become brittle after many dive cycles. Despite its benefits, the high cost of titanium construction led to the abandonment of titanium submarine construction as the Cold War ended. Deep-diving civilian submarines have used thick [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] pressure hulls.\n\nThe deepest [[deep-submergence vehicle]] (DSV) to date is [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|''Trieste'']]. On 5 October 1959, ''Trieste'' departed San Diego for [[Guam]] aboard the freighter ''Santa Maria'' to participate in ''[[Project Nekton]]'', a series of very deep dives in the [[Mariana Trench]]. On 23 January 1960, ''Trieste'' reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying [[Jacques Piccard]] (son of Auguste) and Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]], USN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/trieste.htm |title=Trieste |publisher=History.navy.mil |access-date=18 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317120249/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/trieste.htm |archive-date=17 March 2010 |df= }}</ref> This was the first time a vessel, manned or unmanned, had reached the deepest point in the Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of {{convert|11521|m|ft|0}}, although this was later revised to {{convert|10916|m|ft|0}} and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep slightly shallower, at {{convert|10911|m|ft|0}}.\n\nBuilding a pressure hull is difficult, as it must withstand pressures at its required diving depth. When the hull is perfectly round in cross-section, the pressure is evenly distributed, and causes only hull compression. If the shape is not perfect, the hull is bent, with several points heavily strained. Inevitable minor deviations are resisted by stiffener rings, but even a one-inch (25&nbsp;mm) deviation from roundness results in over 30 percent decrease of maximal hydrostatic load and consequently dive depth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/naoe/courses/en200/ch10.pdf|title=US Naval Academy|publisher=}}</ref> The hull must therefore be constructed with high precision. All hull parts must be welded without defects, and all joints are checked multiple times with different methods, contributing to the high cost of modern submarines. (For example, each {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine|0}} attack submarine costs US$2.6 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], over US$200,000 per [[long ton|ton]] of displacement.)\n\n===Propulsion===<!-- \"diesel-electric transmission\" has a see also linking here -->\n{{Further|Marine propulsion|Air-independent propulsion|Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear submarine}}\n[[File:HMCS Windsor SSK 877.jpg|thumb|{{HMCS|Windsor|SSK 877|6}}, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] {{sclass-|Victoria|submarine|0}} diesel-electric hunter-killer submarine]]\n\nThe first submarines were propelled by humans. The first mechanically driven submarine was the 1863 French {{ship|French submarine|Plongeur||2}}, which used compressed air for propulsion. Anaerobic propulsion was first employed by the Spanish ''[[Ictineo II]]'' in 1864, which used a solution of [[zinc]], [[manganese dioxide]], and [[potassium chlorate]] to generate sufficient heat to power a steam engine, while also providing [[oxygen]] for the crew. A similar system was not employed again until 1940 when the German Navy tested a [[hydrogen peroxide]]-based system, the [[Hellmuth Walter|Walter]] [[turbine]], on the experimental [[V-80 submarine]] and later on the naval {{GS|U-791||2}} and [[German Type XVII submarine|type XVII]] submarines;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sharkhunters.com/typeadditional.htm|title=Details on German U-Boat Types|accessdate=21 September 2008|work=Sharkhunters International}}</ref> the system was further developed for the British {{sclass-|Explorer|submarine|0}}, completed in 1958.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Miller, David  |author2=Jordan, John | title=Modern Submarine Warfare| location=London | publisher=Salamander Books | year=1987 | isbn=0-86101-317-4 |page =63 }}</ref>\n\nUntil the advent of [[nuclear marine propulsion]], most 20th-century submarines used batteries for running underwater and [[gasoline]] (petrol) or [[diesel engine|diesel]] engines on the surface, and for battery recharging. Early submarines used gasoline, but this quickly gave way to [[kerosene]] (paraffin), then diesel, because of reduced flammability. Diesel-electric became the standard means of propulsion. The diesel or gasoline engine and the electric motor, separated by clutches, were initially on the same shaft driving the propeller. This allowed the engine to drive the electric motor as a generator to recharge the batteries and also propel the submarine. The clutch between the motor and the engine would be disengaged when the submarine dived, so that the motor could drive the propeller. The motor could have multiple armatures on the shaft, which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed (these connections were called \"group down\" and \"group up\", respectively).\n\n==== Diesel-electric ====\n[[File:Submarine recharging (JMSDF).jpg|thumb|Recharging battery ([[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JMSDF]])]]\n{{Further|Diesel-electric transmission}}\n\nEarly submarines used a direct mechanical connection between the engine and propeller, switching between diesel engines for surface running, and battery-driven electric motors for submerged propulsion.\n\nIn 1928, the [[United States Navy]]'s Bureau of Engineering proposed a diesel-electric transmission. Instead of driving the propeller directly while running on the surface, the submarine's diesel drove a generator that could either charge the submarine's batteries or drive the electric motor. This made electric motor speed independent of diesel engine speed, so the diesel could run at an optimum and non-critical speed. One or more diesel engines could be shut down for maintenance while the submarine continued to run on the remaining engine or battery power. The US pioneered this concept in 1929, in the [[United States S-class submarine|S-class submarines]] {{USS|S-3|SS-107|2}}, {{USS|S-6|SS-111|2}}, and {{USS|S-7|SS-112|2}}. The first production submarines with this system were the [[United States Porpoise-class submarine|''Porpoise'' class]] of the 1930s, and it was used on most subsequent US diesel submarines through the 1960s. No other navy adopted the system before 1945, apart from the Royal Navy's [[British U-class submarine|U-class submarines]], though some submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy used separate diesel generators for low speed running.<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=U.S. submarines through 1945: an illustrated design history|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1995|pages=259\u2013260|isbn=978-1-55750-263-6}}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of such an arrangement were that a submarine could travel slowly with the engines at full power to recharge the batteries quickly, reducing time on the surface or on [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]]. It was then possible to [[soundproofing|isolate]] the noisy diesel engines from the pressure hull, making the submarine quieter. Additionally, diesel-electric transmissions were more compact.\n\nDuring World War II the Germans experimented with the idea of the [[Submarine snorkel|''schnorchel'']] (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines, but didn't see the need for them until rather late in the war. The ''schnorchel'' was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at [[periscope depth]], allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. There were problems with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Speed was limited to {{convert|8|kn|km/h}}, lest the device snap from stress. The ''schnorchel'' also created noise that made the boat easier to detect with sonar, yet more difficult for the on-board sonar to detect signals from other vessels. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the ''schnorchel'' mast could be detected beyond visual range.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ireland |first=Bernard |title=Battle of the Atlantic |publisher=Pen & Sword Books |year=2003 |location=Barnsley, UK |page=187 |isbn=978-1-84415-001-4}}</ref>\n\nWhile the snorkel renders a submarine far less detectable, it is not perfect. In clear weather, diesel exhaust can be seen on the surface to a distance of about three miles,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schull|first1=Joseph|title=The Far Distant Ships|date=1961|publisher=Queen's Printer, Canada|location=Ottawa|pages=259}}</ref> while \"periscope feather\" (the wave created by the snorkel or periscope moving through the water) is visible from far off in calm sea conditions.

Modern snorkel induction masts use a fail-safe design using [[compressed air]], controlled by a simple electrical circuit, to hold the \"head valve\" open against the pull of a powerful spring. Seawater washing over the mast shorts out exposed electrodes on top, breaking the control, and shutting the \"head valve\" while it is submerged. US submarines did not adopt the use of snorkels until after WWII.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GLy8quRc-YYC&pg=PA86&dq=submarine+snorkel#v=onepage&q=submarine%20snorkel&f=false|title=The Submarine|last=Navy|first=United States|date=September 2008|publisher=United States Printing Office|isbn=978-1-935327-44-8|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOne new technology that is being introduced starting with the Japanese Navy's eleventh [[S\u014dry\u016b-class submarine|''S\u014dry\u016b''-class submarine]] (JS ''\u014cry\u016b'') is a more modern battery, the [[lithium-ion battery]]. These batteries have about double the electric storage of traditional batteries, and by changing out the lead-acid batteries in their normal storage areas plus filling up the large hull space normally devoted to [[Air-independent propulsion|AIP]] engine and fuel tanks with many tons of lithium-ion batteries, modern submarines can actually return to a \"pure\" diesel-electric configuration yet have the added underwater range and power normally associated with AIP equipped submarines.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n====Air-independent====\n{{main|Air-independent propulsion}}\n[[File:2004-Bremerhaven U-Boot-Museum-Sicherlich retouched.jpg|thumb|[[German Type XXI submarine]]]]\n[[File:SS X-1 Midget Submarine.jpg|thumb|American X-1 Midget Submarine]]\n\nDuring World War II, [[German Type XXI submarine]]s (also known as \"''Elektroboote''\") were the first submarines designed to operate submerged for extended periods. Initially they were to carry hydrogen peroxide for long-term, fast air-independent propulsion, but were ultimately built with very large batteries instead. At the end of the War, the [[United Kingdom|British]] and Soviets experimented with hydrogen peroxide/kerosene (paraffin) engines that could run surfaced and submerged. The results were not encouraging. Though the Soviet Union deployed a class of submarines with this engine type (codenamed {{sclass2-|Quebec|submarine|5}} by NATO), they were considered unsuccessful.\n\nThe United States also used hydrogen peroxide in an experimental [[midget submarine]], [[USS X-1|X-1]]. It was originally powered by a hydrogen peroxide/diesel engine and battery system until an explosion of her hydrogen peroxide supply on 20 May 1957. X-1 was later converted to use diesel-electric drive.<ref>{{cite web|title=SS X-1 |url=http://www.hnsa.org/ships/x1.htm |publisher=Historic Naval Ships Association |access-date=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818031654/http://www.hnsa.org/ships/x1.htm |archive-date=18 August 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\nToday several navies use air-independent propulsion.

By eliminating the need for atmospheric oxygen, the time that a submarine could remain submerged was limited only by its food stores, as breathing air was recycled and fresh water [[Distillation|distilled]] from seawater. More importantly, a nuclear submarine has unlimited range at top speed. This allows it to travel from its operating base to the combat zone in a much shorter time and makes it a far more difficult target for most anti-submarine weapons. Nuclear-powered submarines have a relatively small battery and diesel engine/generator powerplant for emergency use if the reactors must be shut down.\n\nNuclear power is now used in all large submarines, but due to the high cost and large size of nuclear reactors, smaller submarines still use diesel-electric propulsion. The ratio of larger to smaller submarines depends on strategic needs.

Other major operators rely on a mix of nuclear submarines for strategic purposes and diesel-electric submarines for defense. Most fleets have no nuclear submarines, due to the limited availability of nuclear power and submarine technology.\n\nDiesel-electric submarines have a stealth advantage over their nuclear counterparts. Nuclear submarines generate noise from coolant pumps and turbo-machinery needed to operate the reactor, even at low power levels.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Roger|title=Lessons Not Learned|publisher=US Naval Institute Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59114-865-4|page=34}}</ref> Some nuclear submarines such as the American {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|4}} can operate with their reactor coolant pumps secured, making them quieter than electric subs. A conventional submarine operating on batteries is almost completely silent, the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow noise around the hull, all of which stops when the sub hovers in mid-water to listen, leaving only the noise from crew activity. Commercial submarines usually rely only on batteries, since they operate in conjunction with a mother ship.\n\nSeveral [[nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll|serious nuclear and radiation accidents]] have involved nuclear submarine mishaps.<ref name=johnston2007/><ref name=timenuke/> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-19}} reactor accident in 1961 resulted in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people were over-exposed to radiation.<ref name=rad>[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf Strengthening the Safety of Radiation Sources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326181428/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }} p. 14</ref> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-27}} reactor accident in 1968 resulted in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries.<ref name=johnston2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/radevents1.html|title=Deadliest radiation accidents and other events causing radiation casualties|author=Johnston, Robert|date=23 September 2007|publisher=Database of Radiological Incidents and Related Events}}</ref> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-431}} accident in 1985 resulted in 10 fatalities and 49 other radiation injuries.<ref name=timenuke>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705,00.html|title=The Worst Nuclear Disasters|work=TIME.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=25 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Alternative====\nOil-fired steam turbines powered the British [[British K-class submarine|K-class submarines]], built during [[World War I]] and later, to give them the surface speed to keep up with the battle fleet. The K-class subs were not very successful, however.\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, some submarines\u2014such as the British ''Vanguard'' class\u2014began to be fitted with [[pump-jet]] propulsors instead of propellers. Though these are heavier, more expensive, and less efficient than a propeller, they are significantly quieter, providing an important tactical advantage.\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:Ocelot-TorpedoTubes.JPG|thumb|The forward torpedo tubes in HMS ''Ocelot'']]\nThe success of the submarine is inextricably linked to the development of the [[torpedo]], invented by [[Robert Whitehead]] in 1866. His invention is essentially the same now as it was 140 years ago. Only with self-propelled torpedoes could the submarine make the leap from novelty to a weapon of war. Until the perfection of the [[Acoustic torpedo|guided torpedo]], multiple \"straight-running\" torpedoes were required to attack a target. With at most 20 to 25 torpedoes stored on board, the number of attacks was limited. To increase [[combat endurance]] most World War I submarines functioned as submersible gunboats, using their [[deck gun]]s against unarmed targets, and diving to escape and engage enemy warships. The importance of guns encouraged the development of the unsuccessful [[cruiser submarine|Submarine Cruiser]] such as the French {{ship|French submarine|Surcouf||2}} and the [[Royal Navy]]'s {{HMS|X1||2}} and [[British M-class submarine|M-class]] submarines. With the arrival of [[Anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) aircraft, guns became more for defense than attack. A more practical method of increasing combat endurance was the external torpedo tube, loaded only in port.\n\nThe ability of submarines to approach enemy harbours covertly led to their use as [[minelayer]]s. Minelaying submarines of World War I and World War II were specially built for that purpose. Modern submarine-laid [[Naval mine|mines]], such as the British Mark 5 [[Stonefish (mine)|Stonefish]] and Mark 6 Sea Urchin, can be deployed from a submarine's torpedo tubes.\n\nAfter World War II, both the US and the USSR experimented with submarine-launched [[cruise missile]]s such as the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] and [[P-5 Pyatyorka]]. Such missiles required the submarine to surface to fire its missiles. They were the forerunners of modern submarine-launched cruise missiles, which can be fired from the torpedo tubes of submerged submarines, for example the US [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] and Russian [[RPK-2 Viyuga]] and versions of surface-to-surface [[anti-ship missile]]s such as the [[Exocet]] and [[Boeing Harpoon|Harpoon]], encapsulated for submarine launch. Ballistic missiles can also be fired from a submarine's torpedo tubes, for example missiles such as the anti-submarine [[SUBROC]]. With internal volume as limited as ever and the desire to carry heavier warloads, the idea of the external launch tube was revived, usually for encapsulated missiles, with such tubes being placed between the internal pressure and outer streamlined hulls.\n\nThe strategic mission of the SSM-N-8 and the P-5 was taken up by [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] beginning with the US Navy's [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] missile, and subsequently the [[UGM-73 Poseidon|Poseidon]] and [[Trident (missile)|Trident]] missiles.\n\nGermany is working on the torpedo tube-launched short-range [[IDAS (missile)|IDAS missile]], which can be used against ASW helicopters, as well as surface ships and coastal targets.\n\n===Sensors===\n{{main|Sonar}}\n\nA submarine can have a variety of sensors, depending on its missions. Modern military submarines rely almost entirely on a suite of passive and active [[sonar]]s to locate targets. Active sonar relies on an audible \"ping\" to generate echoes to reveal objects around the submarine. Active systems are rarely used, as doing so reveals the sub's presence. Passive sonar is a set of sensitive hydrophones set into the hull or trailed in a towed array, normally trailing several hundred feet behind the sub. The towed array is the mainstay of NATO submarine detection systems, as it reduces the flow noise heard by operators. Hull mounted sonar is employed in addition to the towed array, as the towed array can't work in shallow depth and during maneuvering. In addition, sonar has a blind spot \"through\" the submarine, so a system on both the front and back works to eliminate that problem. As the towed array trails behind and below the submarine, it also allows the submarine to have a system both above and below the [[thermocline]] at the proper depth; sound passing through the thermocline is distorted resulting in a lower detection range.\n\nSubmarines also carry radar equipment to detect surface ships and aircraft. Submarine captains are more likely to use radar detection gear than active radar to detect targets, as radar can be detected far beyond its own return range, revealing the submarine. Periscopes are rarely used, except for position fixes and to verify a contact's identity.\n\nCivilian submarines, such as the {{ship|DSV|Alvin}} or the [[MIR (submersible)|Russian ''Mir'' submersibles]], rely on small active sonar sets and viewing ports to navigate. The human eye cannot detect sunlight below about {{convert|300|ft|m}} underwater, so high intensity lights are used to illuminate the viewing area.\n\n===Navigation===\n{{main|Submarine navigation}}\n[[File:Ocelot-Periscopes.JPG|thumb|The larger search [[periscope]], and the smaller, less detectable attack periscope on HMS ''Ocelot'']]\n\nEarly submarines had few navigation aids, but modern subs have a variety of navigation systems. Modern military submarines use an [[inertial guidance system]] for navigation while submerged, but drift error unavoidably builds over time. To counter this, the crew occasionally uses the [[Global Positioning System]] to obtain an accurate position. The [[periscope]]\u2014a retractable tube with a [[prism (optics)|prism]] system that provides a view of the surface\u2014is only used occasionally in modern submarines, since the visibility range is short. The {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine|0}} and {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|2}}s use [[photonics mast]]s rather than hull-penetrating optical periscopes. These masts must still be deployed above the surface, and use electronic sensors for visible light, infrared, laser range-finding, and electromagnetic surveillance. One benefit to hoisting the mast above the surface is that while the mast is above the water the entire sub is still below the water and is much harder to detect visually or by radar.\n\n===Communication===\n{{main|Communication with submarines}}\n\nMilitary submarines use several systems to communicate with distant command centers or other ships. One is [[VLF]] (very low frequency) radio, which can reach a submarine either on the surface or submerged to a fairly shallow depth, usually less than {{convert|250|ft|m}}. [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] (extremely low frequency) can reach a submarine at greater depths, but has a very low bandwidth and is generally used to call a submerged sub to a shallower depth where VLF signals can reach. A submarine also has the option of floating a long, buoyant wire antenna to a shallower depth, allowing VLF transmissions by a deeply submerged boat.\n\nBy extending a radio mast, a submarine can also use a \"[[burst transmission]]\" technique. A burst transmission takes only a fraction of a second, minimizing a submarine's risk of detection.\n\nTo communicate with other submarines, a system known as Gertrude is used. Gertrude is basically a [[underwater telephone|sonar telephone]]. Voice communication from one submarine is transmitted by low power speakers into the water, where it is detected by passive sonars on the receiving submarine. The range of this system is probably very short, and using it radiates sound into the water, which can be heard by the enemy.\n\nCivilian submarines can use similar, albeit less powerful systems to communicate with support ships or other submersibles in the area.\n\n===Life support systems===\nWith [[nuclear reactor|nuclear power]] or [[air-independent propulsion]], submarines can remain submerged for months at a time. Conventional diesel submarines must periodically resurface or run on [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] to recharge their batteries. Most modern military submarines generate breathing [[oxygen]] by [[electrolysis]] of water (using a device called an \"[[Elektron (ISS)#Elektron|Electrolytic Oxygen Generator]]\"). Atmosphere control equipment includes a [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] scrubber, which uses an [[Amine gas treating|amine]] absorbent to remove the gas from air and diffuse it into waste pumped overboard. A machine that uses a [[catalyst]] to convert [[carbon monoxide]] into carbon dioxide (removed by the CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber) and bonds [[hydrogen]] produced from the ship's storage battery with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce water, is also used. An atmosphere monitoring system samples the air from different areas of the ship for [[nitrogen]], oxygen, hydrogen, [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and [[1,2-Dichlorotetrafluoroethane|R-114]] refrigerants, carbon dioxide, [[carbon monoxide]], and other gases. Poisonous gases are removed, and oxygen is replenished by use of an oxygen bank located in a main ballast tank. Some heavier submarines have two oxygen bleed stations (forward and aft). The oxygen in the air is sometimes kept a few percent less than atmospheric concentration to reduce fire risk.\n\nFresh water is produced by either an evaporator or a [[reverse osmosis]] unit. The primary use for fresh water is to provide feedwater for the reactor and steam propulsion plants. It is also available for showers, sinks, cooking and cleaning once propulsion plant needs have been met. Seawater is used to flush toilets, and the resulting \"[[Blackwater (waste)|black water]]\" is stored in a sanitary tank until it is blown overboard using pressurized air or pumped overboard by using a special sanitary pump. The blackwater-discharge system is difficult to operate, and the German [[Type VII submarine|Type VIIC]] boat {{GS|U-1206||2}} was lost with casualties because of [[human error]] while using this system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/u1206.htm|title=U-1206|publisher=Uboat.net|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> Water from showers and sinks is stored separately in \"[[greywater|grey water]]\" tanks and discharged overboard using drain pumps.\n\nTrash on modern large submarines is usually disposed of using a tube called a Trash Disposal Unit (TDU), where it is compacted into a galvanized steel can. At the bottom of the TDU is a large ball valve. An ice plug is set on top of the ball valve to protect it, the cans atop the ice plug. The top breech door is shut, and the TDU is flooded and equalized with sea pressure, the ball valve is opened and the cans fall out assisted by scrap iron weights in the cans. The TDU is also flushed with seawater to ensure it is completely empty and the ball valve is clear before closing the valve.\n\n==Crew==\n[[File:E class submarine interior IWM Q 18650.jpg|thumb|The interior of a [[British E-class submarine]]. An officer supervises submerging operations, c. 1914\u20131918.]]\n\nA typical nuclear submarine has a crew of over 80; conventional boats typically have fewer than 40. The conditions on a submarine can be difficult because crew members must work in isolation for long periods of time, without family contact. Submarines normally maintain [[radio silence]] to avoid detection. Operating a submarine is dangerous, even in peacetime, and many submarines have been lost in accidents.\n\n===Women===\n[[File:US Navy 100603-N-0000X-053 Midshipmen learn to pilot the submarine by training in the duties of the helm and planesman while underway aboard the Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine USS West Virginia (SSBN 736).jpg|thumb|[[Midshipman|Midshipmen]] learn to pilot {{USS|West Virginia|SSBN-736|6}}.]]\n\nMost navies prohibited women from serving on submarines, even after they had been permitted to serve on surface warships.

Today, pregnant women are still not allowed to serve on submarines in Sweden.

Further, they noted that a woman complying with such high demands is unlikely to become pregnant.<ref name=\"swedfem\"/> In May 2014, three women became the RN's first female submariners.<ref>{{cite news|title=Royal Navy gets first female submariners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27278588|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=BBC|date=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nWomen have served on US Navy surface ships since 1993, and {{as of|lc=y|2011|alt=as of 2011\u20132012}}, began serving on submarines for the first time.

Submarines were first widely used during [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), and are now used in many [[navy|navies]] large and small. Military uses include attacking enemy surface [[ship]]s (merchant and military), or other submarines, [[aircraft carrier]] protection, [[blockade]] running, [[ballistic missile submarine]]s as part of a nuclear strike force, [[reconnaissance]], conventional land attack (for example using a [[cruise missile]]), and covert insertion of [[special forces]]. Civilian uses for submarines include [[marine science]], salvage, exploration and facility inspection and maintenance. Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or [[undersea cable]] repair. Submarines are also used in tourism and [[undersea archaeology]].\n\nMost large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, which houses communications and sensing devices as well as [[periscope]]s. In modern submarines, this structure is the \"[[Sail (submarine)|sail]]\" in American usage and \"fin\" in European usage. A \"[[conning tower]]\" was a feature of earlier designs: a separate pressure hull above the main body of the [[boat]] that allowed the use of shorter periscopes. There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various hydrodynamic control fins. Smaller, deep-diving and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional layout. Submarines use [[diving plane]]s and also change the amount of water and air in [[ballast tank]]s to change [[buoyancy]] for submerging and surfacing.\n\nSubmarines have one of the widest ranges of types and capabilities of any vessel. They range from small autonomous examples and one- or two-person subs that operate for a few hours to vessels that can remain submerged for six months\u2014such as the Russian {{sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|4}}, the biggest submarines ever built. Submarines can work at greater depths than are survivable or practical for human [[Underwater diving|divers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Worlds Biggest Submarine|url=http://englishrussia.com/2009/04/14/worlds-biggest-submarine/ |last=Sherman|first=Chris |date=14 April 2009|website=English Russia |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> Modern deep-diving submarines derive from the [[bathyscaphe]], which in turn evolved from the [[diving bell]].\n==History==\n{{Main|History of submarines}}\n\n=== Etymology ===\nWhereas the principal meaning of \"submarine\" is an armed, submersible [[warship]], the more general meaning is for any type of submersible craft.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/submarine |title=Submarine -- definition |last=Editors |date=2019 |website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English |access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> The definition as of 1899 was for any type of \"submarine boat\".<ref>''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993, Vol. 2 N\u2013Z</ref> By [[naval tradition]], submarines are still usually referred to as \"boats\" rather than as \"ships\", regardless of their size.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ROPWAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=pig+boat#v=onepage&q=boat&f=false |title=Pigboat 39: An American Sub Goes to War |last=Gugliotta |first=Bobette |date=2014-02-17 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=9780813146317 |language=en}}</ref> In other navies with a history of large submarine fleets they are also \"boats\"; in German it is an {{lang|de|Unterseeboot}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unterseebootbau|last=Gabler, Ulrich |date=1997|publisher=Bernard und Graefe|isbn=3763759581|edition=4th |location=Koblenz|oclc=75848309|language=de}}</ref> or {{lang|de|U-Boot}} (under-sea boat)<ref>{{Cite book |title=Uboote im 2.

The French submarine ''Aigrette'' in 1904 further improved the concept by using a diesel rather than a gasoline engine for surface power. Large numbers of these submarines were built, with seventy-six completed before 1914.\n\nThe Royal Navy commissioned five {{sclass2-|Holland|submarine|2}}s from [[Vickers]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], under licence from the [[General Dynamics Electric Boat|Holland Torpedo Boat Company]] from 1901 to 1903. Construction of the boats took longer than anticipated, with the first only ready for a diving trial at sea on 6 April 1902. Although the design had been purchased entirely from the US company, the actual design used was an untested improvement to the original Holland design using a new {{convert|180|hp}} petrol engine.<ref>Galantin, Ignatius J., Admiral, USN (Ret.). Foreword to ''Submariner'' by Johnnie Coote, p. 1</ref>\n\nThese types of submarines were first used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u201305. Due to the blockade at [[Port Arthur, China|Port Arthur]], the Russians sent their submarines to [[Vladivostok]], where by 1 January 1905 there were seven boats, enough to create the world's first \"operational submarine fleet\". The new submarine fleet began patrols on 14 February, usually lasting for about 24 hours each. The first confrontation with Japanese warships occurred on 29 April 1905 when the Russian submarine [[Som-class submarine|''Som'']] was fired upon by Japanese torpedo boats, but then withdrew.<ref>Olender p. 175</ref>\n\n====World War I====\n[[File:U9Submarine.jpg|thumb|The German submarine {{SMU|U-9}}, which sank three British [[cruiser]]s in [[Action of 22 September 1914|less than an hour in September 1914]]]]\n\nMilitary submarines first made a significant impact in [[World War I]].

More submersibles than true submarines, U-boats operated primarily on the surface using regular engines, submerging occasionally to attack under battery power. They were roughly triangular in cross-section, with a distinct [[keel]] to control rolling while surfaced, and a distinct bow. During World War I more than 5,000 [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] ships were sunk by U-boats.<ref>Roger Chickering, Stig F\u00f6rster, Bernd Greiner, German Historical Institute (Washington, DC) (2005). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=evVPoSwqrG4C&pg=PA73&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false A world at total war: global conflict and the politics of destruction, 1937\u20131945]''\".

(Shipping was vital to supply Britain's population with food, industry with raw material, and armed forces with fuel and armaments.) While U-boats destroyed a significant number of ships, the strategy ultimately failed. Although the U-boats had been updated in the interwar years, the major innovation was improved communications, encrypted using the famous [[Enigma machine|Enigma cipher machine]]. This allowed for mass-attack [[naval tactics]] (''Rudeltaktik'', commonly known as \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]\"), but was also ultimately the U-boats' downfall. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ships (175 warships, 2,825 merchantmen) had been sunk by U-boats.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H.

They also had submarines with the highest submerged speeds during World War II ({{sclass-|I-201|submarine|2}}s) and submarines that could carry multiple aircraft ({{sclass-|I-400|submarine|2}}s). They were also equipped with one of the most advanced torpedoes of the conflict, the oxygen-propelled [[Type 95 torpedo|Type 95]]. Nevertheless, despite their technical prowess, Japan chose to use its submarines for fleet warfare, and consequently were relatively unsuccessful, as warships were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships.\n\nThe submarine force was the most effective anti-ship weapon in the American arsenal. Submarines, though only about 2 percent of the U.S. Navy, destroyed over 30 percent of the Japanese Navy, including 8 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship and 11 cruisers. US submarines also destroyed over 60 percent of the Japanese merchant fleet, crippling Japan's ability to supply its military forces and industrial war effort. [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War]] destroyed more Japanese shipping<!--because \"shipping\" means \"merchant\", generally, & that's the important factor--> than all other weapons combined. This feat was considerably aided by the Imperial Japanese Navy's failure to provide adequate escort forces for the nation's merchant fleet.\n\nDuring World War II, 314&nbsp;submarines served in the US Navy, of which nearly 260 were deployed to the Pacific.<ref name=\"O'Kane, p. 333\">O'Kane, p. 333</ref> When the Japanese attacked Hawaii in December 1941, 111 boats were in commission; 203 submarines from the {{sclass-|Gato|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Balao|submarine|5}}, and {{sclass-|Tench|submarine|4}}es were commissioned during the war.

Submarines would attack either on the surface, using deck guns or submerged, using [[torpedo]]es. They were particularly effective in sinking Allied transatlantic shipping in both World Wars, and in disrupting Japanese supply routes and naval operations in the Pacific in World War II.\n\n[[Naval mine|Mine]]-laying submarines were developed in the early part of the 20th century. The facility was used in both World Wars. Submarines were also used for inserting and removing covert agents and military forces in [[special operations]], for intelligence gathering, and to rescue aircrew during air attacks on islands, where the airmen would be told of safe places to crash-land so the submarines could rescue them. Submarines could carry cargo through hostile waters or act as supply vessels for other submarines.\n\nSubmarines could usually locate and attack other submarines only on the surface, although {{HMS|Venturer|P68|6}} managed to sink {{GS|U-864||2}} with a four torpedo spread while both were submerged. The British developed a specialized anti-submarine submarine in WWI, the [[British R-class submarine|R class]]. After WWII, with the development of the homing torpedo, better [[sonar]] systems, and [[nuclear propulsion]], submarines also became able to hunt each other effectively.\n\nThe development of [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] and submarine-launched [[cruise missile]]s gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from [[cluster bomb]]s to [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\nThe primary defense of a submarine lies in its ability to remain concealed in the depths of the ocean. Early submarines could be detected by the sound they made. Water is an excellent conductor of sound (much better than air), and submarines can detect and track comparatively noisy surface ships from long distances. Modern submarines are built with an emphasis on [[Stealth technology|stealth]]. Advanced [[propeller]] designs, extensive sound-reducing insulation, and special machinery help a submarine remain as quiet as ambient ocean noise, making them difficult to detect. It takes specialized technology to find and attack modern submarines.\n\n[[Sonar#Active sonar|Active sonar]] uses the reflection of sound emitted from the search equipment to detect submarines. It has been used since WWII by surface ships, submarines and aircraft (via dropped buoys and helicopter \"dipping\" arrays), but it reveals the emitter's position, and is susceptible to counter-measures.\n\nA concealed military submarine is a real threat, and because of its stealth, can force an enemy navy to waste resources searching large areas of ocean and protecting ships against attack. This advantage was vividly demonstrated in the 1982 [[Falklands War]] when the British [[nuclear-powered]] submarine {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} sank the Argentine cruiser {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano||2}}. After the sinking the Argentine Navy recognized that they had no effective defense against submarine attack, and the Argentine surface fleet withdrew to port for the remainder of the war, though an Argentine submarine remained at sea.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Finlan\n | first = Alastair\n | title = The Royal Navy in the Falklands Conflict and the Gulf War: Culture and Strategy\n | publisher = Psychology Press\n | series = British Politics and Society\n | volume = 15\n | date = 2004\n | location = London\n | pages = 214\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=TmP27lCid8AC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=general+belgrano+naval+strategy#v=onepage&q=general%20belgrano%20naval%20strategy&f=false\n | isbn = 978-0-7146-5479-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Civilian===\nAlthough the majority of the world's submarines are military, there are some civilian submarines, which are used for tourism, exploration, oil and gas platform inspections, and pipeline surveys.

The submarine then visits underwater points of interest such as natural or artificial reef structures. To surface safely without danger of collision the location of the submarine is marked with an air release and movement to the surface is coordinated by an observer in a support craft.\n\nA recent development is the deployment of so-called [[narco submarine]]s by South American drug smugglers to evade law enforcement detection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/05/AR2009060503718_3.html|work=The Washington Post|first1=William|last1=Booth|first2=Juan|last2=Forero|title=Plying the Pacific, Subs Surface as Key Tool of Drug Cartels|date=6 June 2009}}</ref> Although they occasionally deploy [[narco submarine#True submarines|true submarines]], most are self-propelled [[semi-submersible]]s, where a portion of the craft remains above water at all times.

To submerge hydrostatically, a ship must have negative buoyancy, either by increasing its own weight or decreasing its displacement of water. To control their displacement, submarines have [[ballast tank]]s, which can hold varying amounts of water and air.\n\nFor general submersion or surfacing, submarines use the forward and aft tanks, called Main Ballast Tanks (MBT), which are filled with water to submerge or with air to surface. Submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, which simplifies their design, and on many submarines these tanks are a section of interhull space. For more precise and quick control of depth, submarines use smaller Depth Control Tanks (DCT)\u2014also called hard tanks (due to their ability to withstand higher pressure), or trim tanks. The amount of water in depth control tanks can be controlled to change depth or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions (chiefly water density) change. Depth control tanks may be located either near the submarine's [[center of gravity]], or separated along the submarine body to prevent affecting [[dynamic trimming|trim]].\n\nWhen submerged, the water pressure on a submarine's hull can reach {{convert|4|MPa|psi|abbr=on|lk=on}} for steel submarines and up to {{convert|10|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} for [[titanium]] submarines like {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-278 Komsomolets||2}}, while interior pressure remains relatively unchanged. This difference results in hull compression, which decreases displacement. Water density also marginally increases with depth, as the [[salinity]] and pressure are higher.<ref name=nave>{{cite web|title=Bulk Elastic Properties|author=Nave, R.|work=HyperPhysics|publisher=[[Georgia State University]]|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html|accessdate=26 October 2007}}</ref> This change in density incompletely compensates for hull compression, so buoyancy decreases as depth increases. A submerged submarine is in an unstable equilibrium, having a tendency to either sink or float to the surface. Keeping a constant depth requires continual operation of either the depth control tanks or control surfaces.<ref name=\"Physics Of Liquids & Gases\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/tpecp_08.html|title=Physics Of Liquids & Gases|accessdate=7 October 2006|work=Elementary Classical Physics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Richard O'Kane|title=Wahoo|url=https://archive.org/details/wahoopatrolsofam00okan|url-access=registration|publisher=Presidio Press|year=1987|page=[https://archive.org/details/wahoopatrolsofam00okan/page/12 12]}}</ref>\n\nSubmarines in a neutral buoyancy condition are not intrinsically trim-stable. To maintain desired trim, submarines use forward and aft trim tanks. Pumps can move water between the tanks, changing weight distribution and pointing the sub up or down. A similar system is sometimes used to maintain stability.\n\n[[File:Kiosk Casabianca.jpg|thumb|[[Sail (submarine)|Sail]] of the French nuclear submarine {{ship|French submarine|Casabianca|S603|2}}; note the diving planes, [[camouflage]]d masts, periscope, electronic warfare masts, hatch, and [[wikt:deadlight|deadlight]].]]\nThe hydrostatic effect of variable ballast tanks is not the only way to control the submarine underwater. Hydrodynamic maneuvering is done by several surfaces, which can be moved to create hydrodynamic forces when a submarine moves at sufficient speed. The stern planes (hydroplanes in UK), located near the propeller and normally horizontal, serve the same purpose as the trim tanks, controlling the trim, and are commonly used, while other control surfaces may not be present on all submarines. The fairwater planes on the sail and/or bow planes on the main body, both also horizontal, are closer to the center of gravity, and are used to control depth with less effect on the trim.<ref>{{cite book|title=Concepts In Submarine Design|author1=Roy Burcher |author2=Louis Rydill |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|page=170}}</ref>\n\nWhen a submarine performs an emergency surfacing, all depth and trim methods are used simultaneously, together with propelling the boat upwards. Such surfacing is very quick, so the sub may even partially jump out of the water, potentially damaging submarine systems.\n\n===Hull===\n{{main|Submarine hull}}\n\n====Overview====\n[[File:USS Greeneville (SSN 772) - dry dock Pearl Harbor (1).jpg|thumb|The [[US Navy]] {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|0}} {{USS|Greeneville|SSN-772|6}} in dry dock, showing cigar-shaped hull]]\n\nModern submarines are cigar-shaped. This design, visible in early submarines, is sometimes called a \"[[teardrop hull]]\". It reduces the hydrodynamic [[drag (physics)|drag]] when submerged, but decreases the sea-keeping capabilities and increases drag while surfaced. Since the limitations of the propulsion systems of early submarines forced them to operate surfaced most of the time, their hull designs were a compromise. Because of the slow submerged speeds of those subs, usually well below 10&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|kt]] (18&nbsp;km/h), the increased drag for underwater travel was acceptable. Late in World War II, when technology allowed faster and longer submerged operation and increased aircraft surveillance forced submarines to stay submerged, hull designs became teardrop shaped again to reduce drag and noise. {{USS|Albacore|AGSS-569}} was a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form (sometimes referred to as an \"Albacore hull\") of modern submarines. On modern military submarines the outer hull is covered with a layer of sound-absorbing rubber, or [[anechoic tile|anechoic plating]], to reduce detection.\n\nThe occupied pressure hulls of deep diving submarines such as {{ship|DSV|Alvin}} are spherical instead of cylindrical. This allows a more even distribution of stress at the great depth. A titanium frame is usually affixed to the pressure hull, providing attachment for ballast and trim systems, scientific instrumentation, battery packs, [[syntactic foam|syntactic flotation foam]], and lighting.\n\nA raised tower on top of a submarine accommodates the [[periscope]] and electronics masts, which can include radio, [[radar]], [[electronic warfare]], and other systems including the snorkel mast. In many early classes of submarines (see history), the control room, or \"conn\", was located inside this tower, which was known as the \"[[conning tower]]\". Since then, the conn has been located within the hull of the submarine, and the tower is now called the \"[[Sail (submarine)|sail]]\". The conn is distinct from the \"bridge\", a small open platform in the top of the sail, used for observation during surface operation.\n\n\"Bathtubs\" are related to conning towers but are used on smaller submarines. The bathtub is a metal cylinder surrounding the hatch that prevents waves from breaking directly into the cabin. It is needed because surfaced submarines have limited [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], that is, they lie low in the water. Bathtubs help prevent swamping the vessel.\n\n==== Single and double hulls ====\n[[File:U995 2004 1.jpg|thumb|{{GS|U-995||2}}, Type VIIC/41 U-boat of World War II, showing the ship-like lines of the outer hull for surface travel, blended into the cylindrical pressure hull structure.]]\n\nModern submarines and submersibles, as well as the oldest ones, usually have a single hull. Large submarines generally have an additional hull or hull sections outside. This external hull, which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer hull (''[[Casing (submarine)|casing]]'' in the Royal Navy) or [[light hull]], as it does not have to withstand a pressure difference. Inside the outer hull there is a strong hull, or [[pressure hull]], which withstands sea pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside.\n\nAs early as World War I, it was realized that the optimal shape for withstanding pressure conflicted with the optimal shape for seakeeping and minimal drag, and construction difficulties further complicated the problem. This was solved either by a compromise shape, or by using two hulls; internal for holding pressure, and external for optimal shape. Until the end of World War II, most submarines had an additional partial cover on the top, bow and stern, built of thinner metal, which was flooded when submerged. Germany went further with the [[Type XXI]], a general predecessor of modern submarines, in which the pressure hull was fully enclosed inside the light hull, but optimized for submerged navigation, unlike earlier designs that were optimized for surface operation.\n\n[[File:SRH025-p40.jpg|thumb|left|[[Type XXI]] U-boat, late World War II, with pressure hull almost fully enclosed inside the light hull]]\nAfter World War II, approaches split. The Soviet Union changed its designs, basing them on German developments. All post-World War II heavy Soviet and Russian submarines are built with a [[double hull]] structure. American and most other Western submarines switched to a primarily single-hull approach. They still have light hull sections in the bow and stern, which house main ballast tanks and provide a hydrodynamically optimized shape, but the main cylindrical hull section has only a single plating layer. Double hulls are being considered for future submarines in the United States to improve payload capacity, stealth and range.<ref>[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2000/May/Virginia-Class.htm]. National Defense magazine. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2000/May/Virginia-Class.htm|date=April 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Pressure hull====\n[[File:Bathyscaphe Trieste.jpg|thumb|In 1960, [[Jacques Piccard]] and [[Don Walsh]] were the first people to explore the [[Challenger Deep|deepest part]] of the world's [[ocean]], and the deepest location on the surface of the Earth's crust, in the {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste}} designed by [[Auguste Piccard]].]]\n\nThe pressure hull is generally constructed of thick high-strength steel with a complex structure and high strength reserve, and is separated with watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] into several [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)|compartments]]. There are also examples of more than two hulls in a submarine, like the {{sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|4}}, which has two main pressure hulls and three smaller ones for control room, torpedoes and steering gear, with the missile launch system between the main hulls.\n\nThe [[Submarine depth ratings|dive depth]] cannot be increased easily. Simply making the hull thicker increases the weight and requires reduction of onboard equipment weight, ultimately resulting in a ''[[bathyscaphe]]''. This is acceptable for civilian research submersibles, but not military submarines.\n\nWWI submarines had hulls of [[carbon steel]], with a {{convert|100|m|ft|adj=on}} maximum depth. During WWII, high-strength [[alloy]]ed steel was introduced, allowing {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=on}} depths. High-strength alloy steel remains the primary material for submarines today, with {{convert|250|-|400|m|ft|adj=on}} depths, which cannot be exceeded on a military submarine without design compromises. To exceed that limit, a few submarines were built with [[titanium]] hulls. Titanium can be stronger than steel, lighter, and is not [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]], important for stealth. Titanium submarines were built by the Soviet Union, which developed specialized high-strength alloys. It has produced several types of titanium submarines. Titanium alloys allow a major increase in depth, but other systems must be redesigned to cope, so test depth was limited to {{convert|1000|m|ft}} for the {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-278 Komsomolets}}, the deepest-diving combat submarine. An {{sclass2-|Alfa|submarine|2}} may have successfully operated at {{convert|1300|m|ft}},<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/deep.htm|title=Federation of American Scientists|publisher=Fas.org|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> though continuous operation at such depths would produce excessive stress on many submarine systems. Titanium does not flex as readily as steel, and may become brittle after many dive cycles. Despite its benefits, the high cost of titanium construction led to the abandonment of titanium submarine construction as the Cold War ended. Deep-diving civilian submarines have used thick [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] pressure hulls.\n\nThe deepest [[deep-submergence vehicle]] (DSV) to date is [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|''Trieste'']]. On 5 October 1959, ''Trieste'' departed San Diego for [[Guam]] aboard the freighter ''Santa Maria'' to participate in ''[[Project Nekton]]'', a series of very deep dives in the [[Mariana Trench]]. On 23 January 1960, ''Trieste'' reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying [[Jacques Piccard]] (son of Auguste) and Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]], USN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/trieste.htm |title=Trieste |publisher=History.navy.mil |access-date=18 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317120249/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/trieste.htm |archive-date=17 March 2010 |df= }}</ref> This was the first time a vessel, manned or unmanned, had reached the deepest point in the Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of {{convert|11521|m|ft|0}}, although this was later revised to {{convert|10916|m|ft|0}} and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep slightly shallower, at {{convert|10911|m|ft|0}}.\n\nBuilding a pressure hull is difficult, as it must withstand pressures at its required diving depth. When the hull is perfectly round in cross-section, the pressure is evenly distributed, and causes only hull compression. If the shape is not perfect, the hull is bent, with several points heavily strained. Inevitable minor deviations are resisted by stiffener rings, but even a one-inch (25&nbsp;mm) deviation from roundness results in over 30 percent decrease of maximal hydrostatic load and consequently dive depth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/naoe/courses/en200/ch10.pdf|title=US Naval Academy|publisher=}}</ref> The hull must therefore be constructed with high precision. All hull parts must be welded without defects, and all joints are checked multiple times with different methods, contributing to the high cost of modern submarines. (For example, each {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine|0}} attack submarine costs US$2.6 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], over US$200,000 per [[long ton|ton]] of displacement.)\n\n===Propulsion===<!-- \"diesel-electric transmission\" has a see also linking here -->\n{{Further|Marine propulsion|Air-independent propulsion|Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear submarine}}\n[[File:HMCS Windsor SSK 877.jpg|thumb|{{HMCS|Windsor|SSK 877|6}}, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] {{sclass-|Victoria|submarine|0}} diesel-electric hunter-killer submarine]]\n\nThe first submarines were propelled by humans. The first mechanically driven submarine was the 1863 French {{ship|French submarine|Plongeur||2}}, which used compressed air for propulsion. Anaerobic propulsion was first employed by the Spanish ''[[Ictineo II]]'' in 1864, which used a solution of [[zinc]], [[manganese dioxide]], and [[potassium chlorate]] to generate sufficient heat to power a steam engine, while also providing [[oxygen]] for the crew. A similar system was not employed again until 1940 when the German Navy tested a [[hydrogen peroxide]]-based system, the [[Hellmuth Walter|Walter]] [[turbine]], on the experimental [[V-80 submarine]] and later on the naval {{GS|U-791||2}} and [[German Type XVII submarine|type XVII]] submarines;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sharkhunters.com/typeadditional.htm|title=Details on German U-Boat Types|accessdate=21 September 2008|work=Sharkhunters International}}</ref> the system was further developed for the British {{sclass-|Explorer|submarine|0}}, completed in 1958.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Miller, David  |author2=Jordan, John | title=Modern Submarine Warfare| location=London | publisher=Salamander Books | year=1987 | isbn=0-86101-317-4 |page =63 }}</ref>\n\nUntil the advent of [[nuclear marine propulsion]], most 20th-century submarines used batteries for running underwater and [[gasoline]] (petrol) or [[diesel engine|diesel]] engines on the surface, and for battery recharging. Early submarines used gasoline, but this quickly gave way to [[kerosene]] (paraffin), then diesel, because of reduced flammability. Diesel-electric became the standard means of propulsion. The diesel or gasoline engine and the electric motor, separated by clutches, were initially on the same shaft driving the propeller. This allowed the engine to drive the electric motor as a generator to recharge the batteries and also propel the submarine. The clutch between the motor and the engine would be disengaged when the submarine dived, so that the motor could drive the propeller. The motor could have multiple armatures on the shaft, which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed (these connections were called \"group down\" and \"group up\", respectively).\n\n==== Diesel-electric ====\n[[File:Submarine recharging (JMSDF).jpg|thumb|Recharging battery ([[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JMSDF]])]]\n{{Further|Diesel-electric transmission}}\n\nEarly submarines used a direct mechanical connection between the engine and propeller, switching between diesel engines for surface running, and battery-driven electric motors for submerged propulsion.\n\nIn 1928, the [[United States Navy]]'s Bureau of Engineering proposed a diesel-electric transmission. Instead of driving the propeller directly while running on the surface, the submarine's diesel drove a generator that could either charge the submarine's batteries or drive the electric motor. This made electric motor speed independent of diesel engine speed, so the diesel could run at an optimum and non-critical speed. One or more diesel engines could be shut down for maintenance while the submarine continued to run on the remaining engine or battery power. The US pioneered this concept in 1929, in the [[United States S-class submarine|S-class submarines]] {{USS|S-3|SS-107|2}}, {{USS|S-6|SS-111|2}}, and {{USS|S-7|SS-112|2}}. The first production submarines with this system were the [[United States Porpoise-class submarine|''Porpoise'' class]] of the 1930s, and it was used on most subsequent US diesel submarines through the 1960s. No other navy adopted the system before 1945, apart from the Royal Navy's [[British U-class submarine|U-class submarines]], though some submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy used separate diesel generators for low speed running.<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=U.S. submarines through 1945: an illustrated design history|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1995|pages=259\u2013260|isbn=978-1-55750-263-6}}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of such an arrangement were that a submarine could travel slowly with the engines at full power to recharge the batteries quickly, reducing time on the surface or on [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]]. It was then possible to [[soundproofing|isolate]] the noisy diesel engines from the pressure hull, making the submarine quieter. Additionally, diesel-electric transmissions were more compact.\n\nDuring World War II the Germans experimented with the idea of the [[Submarine snorkel|''schnorchel'']] (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines, but didn't see the need for them until rather late in the war. The ''schnorchel'' was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at [[periscope depth]], allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. There were problems with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Speed was limited to {{convert|8|kn|km/h}}, lest the device snap from stress. The ''schnorchel'' also created noise that made the boat easier to detect with sonar, yet more difficult for the on-board sonar to detect signals from other vessels. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the ''schnorchel'' mast could be detected beyond visual range.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ireland |first=Bernard |title=Battle of the Atlantic |publisher=Pen & Sword Books |year=2003 |location=Barnsley, UK |page=187 |isbn=978-1-84415-001-4}}</ref>\n\nWhile the snorkel renders a submarine far less detectable, it is not perfect. In clear weather, diesel exhaust can be seen on the surface to a distance of about three miles,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schull|first1=Joseph|title=The Far Distant Ships|date=1961|publisher=Queen's Printer, Canada|location=Ottawa|pages=259}}</ref> while \"periscope feather\" (the wave created by the snorkel or periscope moving through the water) is visible from far off in calm sea conditions.

Modern snorkel induction masts use a fail-safe design using [[compressed air]], controlled by a simple electrical circuit, to hold the \"head valve\" open against the pull of a powerful spring.

These batteries have about double the electric storage of traditional batteries, and by changing out the lead-acid batteries in their normal storage areas plus filling up the large hull space normally devoted to [[Air-independent propulsion|AIP]] engine and fuel tanks with many tons of lithium-ion batteries, modern submarines can actually return to a \"pure\" diesel-electric configuration yet have the added underwater range and power normally associated with AIP equipped submarines.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n====Air-independent====\n{{main|Air-independent propulsion}}\n[[File:2004-Bremerhaven U-Boot-Museum-Sicherlich retouched.jpg|thumb|[[German Type XXI submarine]]]]\n[[File:SS X-1 Midget Submarine.jpg|thumb|American X-1 Midget Submarine]]\n\nDuring World War II, [[German Type XXI submarine]]s (also known as \"''Elektroboote''\") were the first submarines designed to operate submerged for extended periods. Initially they were to carry hydrogen peroxide for long-term, fast air-independent propulsion, but were ultimately built with very large batteries instead. At the end of the War, the [[United Kingdom|British]] and Soviets experimented with hydrogen peroxide/kerosene (paraffin) engines that could run surfaced and submerged. The results were not encouraging. Though the Soviet Union deployed a class of submarines with this engine type (codenamed {{sclass2-|Quebec|submarine|5}} by NATO), they were considered unsuccessful.\n\nThe United States also used hydrogen peroxide in an experimental [[midget submarine]], [[USS X-1|X-1]]. It was originally powered by a hydrogen peroxide/diesel engine and battery system until an explosion of her hydrogen peroxide supply on 20 May 1957. X-1 was later converted to use diesel-electric drive.<ref>{{cite web|title=SS X-1 |url=http://www.hnsa.org/ships/x1.htm |publisher=Historic Naval Ships Association |access-date=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818031654/http://www.hnsa.org/ships/x1.htm |archive-date=18 August 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\nToday several navies use air-independent propulsion. Notably [[Sweden]] uses [[Stirling engine|Stirling technology]] on the {{sclass-|Gotland|submarine|0}} and {{sclass-|S\u00f6dermanland|submarine|2}}s. The Stirling engine is heated by burning diesel fuel with [[liquid oxygen]] from [[cryogenic]] tanks. A newer development in air-independent propulsion is [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]s, first used on the [[Germany|German]] [[Type 212 submarine]], with nine 34&nbsp;kW or two 120&nbsp;kW cells and soon to be used in the new [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] {{sclass2-|S-80|submarine|2}}s.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Defense Industry Daily|title=S-80: A Sub, for Spain, to Sail Out on the Main|date=15 December 2008|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/s80-a-sub-for-spain-to-sail-out-on-the-main-02517/||url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n====Nuclear power====\n{{main|Nuclear submarine|Nuclear marine propulsion}}\n[[File:Battery well of USS Nautilus.jpg|thumb|Battery well containing 126 cells on {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, the first nuclear-powered submarine]]\n\nSteam power was resurrected in the 1950s with a nuclear-powered steam turbine driving a generator. By eliminating the need for atmospheric oxygen, the time that a submarine could remain submerged was limited only by its food stores, as breathing air was recycled and fresh water [[Distillation|distilled]] from seawater. More importantly, a nuclear submarine has unlimited range at top speed. This allows it to travel from its operating base to the combat zone in a much shorter time and makes it a far more difficult target for most anti-submarine weapons. Nuclear-powered submarines have a relatively small battery and diesel engine/generator powerplant for emergency use if the reactors must be shut down.\n\nNuclear power is now used in all large submarines, but due to the high cost and large size of nuclear reactors, smaller submarines still use diesel-electric propulsion. The ratio of larger to smaller submarines depends on strategic needs. The US Navy, [[French Navy]], and the British [[Royal Navy]] operate only [[nuclear submarine]]s,<ref name=\"Submarine Warfare\">{{cite web|url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/hrnrotc/students/ns_courses/101odu/sumbmarine%20presentation%202005.ppt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908003323/http://www.odu.edu/ao/hrnrotc/students/ns_courses/101odu/sumbmarine%20presentation%202005.ppt|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 September 2006|title=Submarine Warfare|access-date=7 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/db/submarines/france/index.html|title=France Current Capabilities|publisher=Nti.org|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> which is explained by the need for distant operations. Other major operators rely on a mix of nuclear submarines for strategic purposes and diesel-electric submarines for defense. Most fleets have no nuclear submarines, due to the limited availability of nuclear power and submarine technology.\n\nDiesel-electric submarines have a stealth advantage over their nuclear counterparts. Nuclear submarines generate noise from coolant pumps and turbo-machinery needed to operate the reactor, even at low power levels.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Roger|title=Lessons Not Learned|publisher=US Naval Institute Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59114-865-4|page=34}}</ref> Some nuclear submarines such as the American {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|4}} can operate with their reactor coolant pumps secured, making them quieter than electric subs. A conventional submarine operating on batteries is almost completely silent, the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow noise around the hull, all of which stops when the sub hovers in mid-water to listen, leaving only the noise from crew activity. Commercial submarines usually rely only on batteries, since they operate in conjunction with a mother ship.\n\nSeveral [[nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll|serious nuclear and radiation accidents]] have involved nuclear submarine mishaps.<ref name=johnston2007/><ref name=timenuke/> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-19}} reactor accident in 1961 resulted in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people were over-exposed to radiation.<ref name=rad>[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf Strengthening the Safety of Radiation Sources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326181428/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }} p. 14</ref> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-27}} reactor accident in 1968 resulted in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries.<ref name=johnston2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/radevents1.html|title=Deadliest radiation accidents and other events causing radiation casualties|author=Johnston, Robert|date=23 September 2007|publisher=Database of Radiological Incidents and Related Events}}</ref> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-431}} accident in 1985 resulted in 10 fatalities and 49 other radiation injuries.<ref name=timenuke>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705,00.html|title=The Worst Nuclear Disasters|work=TIME.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=25 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Alternative====\nOil-fired steam turbines powered the British [[British K-class submarine|K-class submarines]], built during [[World War I]] and later, to give them the surface speed to keep up with the battle fleet. The K-class subs were not very successful, however.\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, some submarines\u2014such as the British ''Vanguard'' class\u2014began to be fitted with [[pump-jet]] propulsors instead of propellers. Though these are heavier, more expensive, and less efficient than a propeller, they are significantly quieter, providing an important tactical advantage.\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:Ocelot-TorpedoTubes.JPG|thumb|The forward torpedo tubes in HMS ''Ocelot'']]\nThe success of the submarine is inextricably linked to the development of the [[torpedo]], invented by [[Robert Whitehead]] in 1866. His invention is essentially the same now as it was 140 years ago. Only with self-propelled torpedoes could the submarine make the leap from novelty to a weapon of war. Until the perfection of the [[Acoustic torpedo|guided torpedo]], multiple \"straight-running\" torpedoes were required to attack a target. With at most 20 to 25 torpedoes stored on board, the number of attacks was limited. To increase [[combat endurance]] most World War I submarines functioned as submersible gunboats, using their [[deck gun]]s against unarmed targets, and diving to escape and engage enemy warships. The importance of guns encouraged the development of the unsuccessful [[cruiser submarine|Submarine Cruiser]] such as the French {{ship|French submarine|Surcouf||2}} and the [[Royal Navy]]'s {{HMS|X1||2}} and [[British M-class submarine|M-class]] submarines. With the arrival of [[Anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) aircraft, guns became more for defense than attack. A more practical method of increasing combat endurance was the external torpedo tube, loaded only in port.\n\nThe ability of submarines to approach enemy harbours covertly led to their use as [[minelayer]]s. Minelaying submarines of World War I and World War II were specially built for that purpose. Modern submarine-laid [[Naval mine|mines]], such as the British Mark 5 [[Stonefish (mine)|Stonefish]] and Mark 6 Sea Urchin, can be deployed from a submarine's torpedo tubes.\n\nAfter World War II, both the US and the USSR experimented with submarine-launched [[cruise missile]]s such as the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] and [[P-5 Pyatyorka]]. Such missiles required the submarine to surface to fire its missiles. They were the forerunners of modern submarine-launched cruise missiles, which can be fired from the torpedo tubes of submerged submarines, for example the US [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] and Russian [[RPK-2 Viyuga]] and versions of surface-to-surface [[anti-ship missile]]s such as the [[Exocet]] and [[Boeing Harpoon|Harpoon]], encapsulated for submarine launch. Ballistic missiles can also be fired from a submarine's torpedo tubes, for example missiles such as the anti-submarine [[SUBROC]]. With internal volume as limited as ever and the desire to carry heavier warloads, the idea of the external launch tube was revived, usually for encapsulated missiles, with such tubes being placed between the internal pressure and outer streamlined hulls.\n\nThe strategic mission of the SSM-N-8 and the P-5 was taken up by [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] beginning with the US Navy's [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] missile, and subsequently the [[UGM-73 Poseidon|Poseidon]] and [[Trident (missile)|Trident]] missiles.\n\nGermany is working on the torpedo tube-launched short-range [[IDAS (missile)|IDAS missile]], which can be used against ASW helicopters, as well as surface ships and coastal targets.\n\n===Sensors===\n{{main|Sonar}}\n\nA submarine can have a variety of sensors, depending on its missions. Modern military submarines rely almost entirely on a suite of passive and active [[sonar]]s to locate targets. Active sonar relies on an audible \"ping\" to generate echoes to reveal objects around the submarine. Active systems are rarely used, as doing so reveals the sub's presence. Passive sonar is a set of sensitive hydrophones set into the hull or trailed in a towed array, normally trailing several hundred feet behind the sub. The towed array is the mainstay of NATO submarine detection systems, as it reduces the flow noise heard by operators. Hull mounted sonar is employed in addition to the towed array, as the towed array can't work in shallow depth and during maneuvering. In addition, sonar has a blind spot \"through\" the submarine, so a system on both the front and back works to eliminate that problem. As the towed array trails behind and below the submarine, it also allows the submarine to have a system both above and below the [[thermocline]] at the proper depth; sound passing through the thermocline is distorted resulting in a lower detection range.\n\nSubmarines also carry radar equipment to detect surface ships and aircraft. Submarine captains are more likely to use radar detection gear than active radar to detect targets, as radar can be detected far beyond its own return range, revealing the submarine. Periscopes are rarely used, except for position fixes and to verify a contact's identity.\n\nCivilian submarines, such as the {{ship|DSV|Alvin}} or the [[MIR (submersible)|Russian ''Mir'' submersibles]], rely on small active sonar sets and viewing ports to navigate. The human eye cannot detect sunlight below about {{convert|300|ft|m}} underwater, so high intensity lights are used to illuminate the viewing area.\n\n===Navigation===\n{{main|Submarine navigation}}\n[[File:Ocelot-Periscopes.JPG|thumb|The larger search [[periscope]], and the smaller, less detectable attack periscope on HMS ''Ocelot'']]\n\nEarly submarines had few navigation aids, but modern subs have a variety of navigation systems. Modern military submarines use an [[inertial guidance system]] for navigation while submerged, but drift error unavoidably builds over time. To counter this, the crew occasionally uses the [[Global Positioning System]] to obtain an accurate position. The [[periscope]]\u2014a retractable tube with a [[prism (optics)|prism]] system that provides a view of the surface\u2014is only used occasionally in modern submarines, since the visibility range is short. The {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine|0}} and {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|2}}s use [[photonics mast]]s rather than hull-penetrating optical periscopes. These masts must still be deployed above the surface, and use electronic sensors for visible light, infrared, laser range-finding, and electromagnetic surveillance. One benefit to hoisting the mast above the surface is that while the mast is above the water the entire sub is still below the water and is much harder to detect visually or by radar.\n\n===Communication===\n{{main|Communication with submarines}}\n\nMilitary submarines use several systems to communicate with distant command centers or other ships. One is [[VLF]] (very low frequency) radio, which can reach a submarine either on the surface or submerged to a fairly shallow depth, usually less than {{convert|250|ft|m}}. [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] (extremely low frequency) can reach a submarine at greater depths, but has a very low bandwidth and is generally used to call a submerged sub to a shallower depth where VLF signals can reach. A submarine also has the option of floating a long, buoyant wire antenna to a shallower depth, allowing VLF transmissions by a deeply submerged boat.\n\nBy extending a radio mast, a submarine can also use a \"[[burst transmission]]\" technique. A burst transmission takes only a fraction of a second, minimizing a submarine's risk of detection.\n\nTo communicate with other submarines, a system known as Gertrude is used. Gertrude is basically a [[underwater telephone|sonar telephone]]. Voice communication from one submarine is transmitted by low power speakers into the water, where it is detected by passive sonars on the receiving submarine. The range of this system is probably very short, and using it radiates sound into the water, which can be heard by the enemy.\n\nCivilian submarines can use similar, albeit less powerful systems to communicate with support ships or other submersibles in the area.\n\n===Life support systems===\nWith [[nuclear reactor|nuclear power]] or [[air-independent propulsion]], submarines can remain submerged for months at a time. Conventional diesel submarines must periodically resurface or run on [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] to recharge their batteries. Most modern military submarines generate breathing [[oxygen]] by [[electrolysis]] of water (using a device called an \"[[Elektron (ISS)#Elektron|Electrolytic Oxygen Generator]]\"). Atmosphere control equipment includes a [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] scrubber, which uses an [[Amine gas treating|amine]] absorbent to remove the gas from air and diffuse it into waste pumped overboard. A machine that uses a [[catalyst]] to convert [[carbon monoxide]] into carbon dioxide (removed by the CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber) and bonds [[hydrogen]] produced from the ship's storage battery with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce water, is also used. An atmosphere monitoring system samples the air from different areas of the ship for [[nitrogen]], oxygen, hydrogen, [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and [[1,2-Dichlorotetrafluoroethane|R-114]] refrigerants, carbon dioxide, [[carbon monoxide]], and other gases. Poisonous gases are removed, and oxygen is replenished by use of an oxygen bank located in a main ballast tank. Some heavier submarines have two oxygen bleed stations (forward and aft). The oxygen in the air is sometimes kept a few percent less than atmospheric concentration to reduce fire risk.\n\nFresh water is produced by either an evaporator or a [[reverse osmosis]] unit. The primary use for fresh water is to provide feedwater for the reactor and steam propulsion plants. It is also available for showers, sinks, cooking and cleaning once propulsion plant needs have been met. Seawater is used to flush toilets, and the resulting \"[[Blackwater (waste)|black water]]\" is stored in a sanitary tank until it is blown overboard using pressurized air or pumped overboard by using a special sanitary pump. The blackwater-discharge system is difficult to operate, and the German [[Type VII submarine|Type VIIC]] boat {{GS|U-1206||2}} was lost with casualties because of [[human error]] while using this system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/u1206.htm|title=U-1206|publisher=Uboat.net|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> Water from showers and sinks is stored separately in \"[[greywater|grey water]]\" tanks and discharged overboard using drain pumps.\n\nTrash on modern large submarines is usually disposed of using a tube called a Trash Disposal Unit (TDU), where it is compacted into a galvanized steel can. At the bottom of the TDU is a large ball valve. An ice plug is set on top of the ball valve to protect it, the cans atop the ice plug. The top breech door is shut, and the TDU is flooded and equalized with sea pressure, the ball valve is opened and the cans fall out assisted by scrap iron weights in the cans. The TDU is also flushed with seawater to ensure it is completely empty and the ball valve is clear before closing the valve.\n\n==Crew==\n[[File:E class submarine interior IWM Q 18650.jpg|thumb|The interior of a [[British E-class submarine]]. An officer supervises submerging operations, c. 1914\u20131918.]]\n\nA typical nuclear submarine has a crew of over 80; conventional boats typically have fewer than 40. The conditions on a submarine can be difficult because crew members must work in isolation for long periods of time, without family contact. Submarines normally maintain [[radio silence]] to avoid detection. Operating a submarine is dangerous, even in peacetime, and many submarines have been lost in accidents.\n\n===Women===\n[[File:US Navy 100603-N-0000X-053 Midshipmen learn to pilot the submarine by training in the duties of the helm and planesman while underway aboard the Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine USS West Virginia (SSBN 736).jpg|thumb|[[Midshipman|Midshipmen]] learn to pilot {{USS|West Virginia|SSBN-736|6}}.]]\n\nMost navies prohibited women from serving on submarines, even after they had been permitted to serve on surface warships.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]]. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on A&E between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]], vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police.\n\nMary eventually finds Norman in the attic. The sheriff questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk.\n\nRealizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police.\n\nThe sheriff inaccurately believes Mary committed all the murders. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his \"true\" mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician in his 20s desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles Marion Crane ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner.\n\nAfter the conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red (''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'''s [[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nThe same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the [[Psycho (1960 film)|original]]) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\". At that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\"\n\nShe discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nIn 1987, [[NBC]] released a [[television film]] spin-off entitled ''Bates Motel''. The film follows Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]), a man who roomed with [[Norman Bates]] at the state lunatic asylum for nearly 20 years. After the death of Bates, Alex finds that he is in Norman's will as the inheritor of the Bates Motel, which has been vacant since the time of Norman's arrest. Alex travels to Fairville, California and with a little help from a teenage runaway named Willie ([[Lori Petty]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, only to have strange things happen. Is someone trying to drive him away, or is the motel really haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother?\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth.

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]]. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on A&E between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]], vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police.\n\nMary eventually finds Norman in the attic. The sheriff questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk.\n\nRealizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police.\n\nThe sheriff inaccurately believes Mary committed all the murders. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nThe film begins with Maureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his \"true\" mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician in his 20s desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles Marion Crane ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner.\n\nAfter the conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red (''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'''s [[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nThe same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the [[Psycho (1960 film)|original]]) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\". At that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\"\n\nShe discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nIn 1987, [[NBC]] released a [[television film]] spin-off entitled ''Bates Motel''. The film follows Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]), a man who roomed with [[Norman Bates]] at the state lunatic asylum for nearly 20 years. After the death of Bates, Alex finds that he is in Norman's will as the inheritor of the Bates Motel, which has been vacant since the time of Norman's arrest. Alex travels to Fairville, California and with a little help from a teenage runaway named Willie ([[Lori Petty]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, only to have strange things happen. Is someone trying to drive him away, or is the motel really haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother?\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money.

When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago.

Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original. He describes it as a \"Slow, stilted, completely pointless scene-for-scene remake of the Hitchcock classic (with a few awkward new touches to taint its claim as an exact replica.)\" He ultimately calls it \"an insult, rather than a tribute to a landmark film.\"{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Continuity===\nWhile ''Bates Motel'' (1987) was a partial continuation of the series as it continued from where ''Psycho'' left off, it ignored the continuity of ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'', and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' due to the death of Norman Bates in the film and the fact that Bates is deemed sane and returns to the Bates Motel in ''Psycho II''. ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

Crates have 18-in. (46-cm) \"troughs\" on each side where the piglets can safely lie without being in danger of sow overlay (when the sow lies down on top of a piglet).\n\nPiglet survival also depends on selection pressure.  Groups of piglets bred for higher survival showed no difference in mortality when weaned in farrowing crates and outdoor systems.<ref>E. M. Baxter, et al., \"Breeding for improved pre-weaning piglet survival in alternative farrowing systems,\" Proceedings of the 41st congress of the International Society for Applied Ethology (F. Galindo and L. Alvarez, eds.), 2007, Merida, Mexico.</ref>\n\n====Piglet Mortality====\nAlthough farrowing crates have been used based on the assumption that they reduce piglet mortality rates, there is little published evidence in support of this claim. The most comprehensive publication to date on this subject concluded that there is no significant effect of housing on overall piglet mortality, the authors stating that \u201cDespite the fact that the crate system has been considered to reduce piglet mortality mainly through a reduction of crushing, there is not much scientific evidence for this when considering the few large surveys that compare the mortality rate in commercial herds\u201c. The review goes on to describe several large studies dating from as early as 1983, the majority of which found no difference in piglet mortality rates between loose and crated sows. The review also details an argument as to why piglet mortality rates have been reported to be somewhat higher in a comparably small number of studies, citing methodological flaws.<ref name=Pedersen>L.J.

The same effect could be achieved with larger pens that kept the animals separate, but allowed them more freedom of movement. There are also other ways of reducing, but not eliminating, aggression besides gestation crates. These include eliminating overcrowding, not mixing pigs from different litters, providing straw or other bedding material, and providing sufficient food that not only meets nutritional needs but satisfies the appetite.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weaver | first1 = SA | last2 = Morris | first2 = MC | year = 2003 | title = Science, pigs and politics: an New Zealand perspective on the phase-out of sow stalls | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 51\u201366 }}</ref>  Other important means to reduce aggression among sows rely on alternative feeding methods, as many sows will compete with each other for food.

The American Association of Swine Veterinarians adopted a position statement in 2002 specifying five standards of sow welfare and concluding, \"Current scientific literature indicates that individual gestation stalls meet each of the aforementioned, provided the appropriate level of stockmanship is administered.\"<ref>\"AASV Position Statement: Pregnant Sow Housing.\" Accessed 31 July 2012.</ref>\n\n{{farming}}\n''The Washington Post'' reported in 2001 that researchers have not found sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of [[stress hormone]]s. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised. Some producers in Europe use a \u201cfree access\u201d maternity pen configuration in which sows are in individual pens for the first four weeks of pregnancy but can \u201cunlock\u201d the stall by backing out and entering a common area. The producers observed that pregnant pigs will stay in the individual pens more than 90 percent of the time, and return to the same stall more than 90 percent of the time.<ref name=\"Salek-Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Salek-Johnson|first=Janeen|title=Individual pens for sows' safety|url=http://thegazette.com/2012/09/30/individual-pens-for-sows-safety/|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=30 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, other veterinary studies contradict those earlier studies.

The same effect could be achieved with larger pens that kept the animals separate, but allowed them more freedom of movement. There are also other ways of reducing, but not eliminating, aggression besides gestation crates. These include eliminating overcrowding, not mixing pigs from different litters, providing straw or other bedding material, and providing sufficient food that not only meets nutritional needs but satisfies the appetite.<ref>SA Weaver and MC Morris, \"Science, pigs and politics: an New Zealand perspective on the phase-out of sow stalls,\" ''Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics'' 17 (2003), 51\u201366.</ref>  Other important means to reduce aggression among sows rely on alternative feeding methods, as many sows will compete with each other for food.  These include trickle feeding systems, individual feeding stalls, and electronic sow feeding equipment, all of which resolve feed competition among pigs.<ref>Gonyou HW. 2003. Group housing: alternative systems, alternative management. Advances in Pork Production 14:101-7.</ref>\n\nEarly veterinary studies seemed to support the use of gestation crates. According to the [[U.S. National Pork Producers Council]], which promotes pork as a food product and is a leading proponent of gestation crates, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] \"recognize[s] gestation stalls and group housing systems as appropriate for providing for the well-being of sows during pregnancy.\"<ref name=Kaufmann1/> While the practice of immobilizing the animals in crates limits fighting, it subsequently increases the animals' stress levels, causing other health problems. The American Association of Swine Veterinarians adopted a position statement in 2002 specifying five standards of sow welfare and concluding, \"Current scientific literature indicates that individual gestation stalls meet each of the aforementioned, provided the appropriate level of stockmanship is administered.\"<ref>\"AASV Position Statement: Pregnant Sow Housing.\" Accessed 31 July 2012.</ref>\n\n{{farming}}\n''The Washington Post'' reported in 2001 that researchers have not found sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of [[stress hormone]]s. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised. Some producers in Europe use a \u201cfree access\u201d maternity pen configuration in which sows are in individual pens for the first four weeks of pregnancy but can \u201cunlock\u201d the stall by backing out and entering a common area. The producers observed that pregnant pigs will stay in the individual pens more than 90 percent of the time, and return to the same stall more than 90 percent of the time.<ref name=\"Salek-Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Salek-Johnson|first=Janeen|title=Individual pens for sows' safety|url=http://thegazette.com/2012/09/30/individual-pens-for-sows-safety/|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=30 September 2012}}</ref>  \n\nHowever, other veterinary studies contradict those earlier studies. A 1997 report of the Scientific Veterinary Committee of the European Union, where a gestation crate ban went into effect in 2013, noted that because \"overall welfare appears to be better when sows are not confined throughout gestation, sows should be preferably be kept in groups.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">Tim Carman, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/pork-industry-gives-sows-room-to-move/2012/05/25/gJQAISlxyU_story.html \"Pork industry gives sows room to move\"], ''The Washington Post'', 29 May 2012.</ref> Likewise in 2008, the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, after 2.5 years of research, recommended \"the phase-out, within 10 years, of all intensive confinement systems that restrict natural movement and normal behaviors, including swine gestation crates.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\nMany studies have shown that sows in crates exhibit behavior such as bar-biting, head weaving, and tongue rolling, indicating chronic frustration. When given the choice, pigs will relieve themselves far away from where they sleep and eat.<ref> {{cite journal |title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare on a request from the Commission related to welfare of weaners and rearing pigs: effects of different space allowances and floor types |publisher=The EFSA Journal |date=2005 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2005.268 |doi-access=free }} </ref> Sows in crates bite the bars, chew even when they have no food, and press their water bottles obsessively, all reportedly signs of boredom.

For some time after the tomato was brought to [[Europe]] from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous, as some other fruits of the ''[[Solanaceae]]'' (nightshade) family are. However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around [[Naples]] to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty.\n\n[[Image:Pizzeria Port Alba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba]] in Naples, which is widely believed to be the world's first pizzeria]]\nAccording to documents discovered by historian Antonio Mattozzi in State Archive of Naples, in 1807 already 54 pizzerias existed, with their owners and addresses.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio (2015) ''Inventing the Pizzeria: a History of Pizza Making in Naples'', Bloomsbury Academic, pp.16\u201317</ref> In the second half of the nineteenth century they increased to 120.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio  ''Inventing the Pizzeria'', Distribution Maps, p.xxxiv</ref>\n\nIn Naples, two others figures connected to the trade existed&nbsp;\u2014 the pizza hawker (''pizzaiuolo ambulante''), who sold pizza, but did not make it, and the seller of pizza \"a oggi a otto\", who made pizzas, but sold them in return for a payment for seven days.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio ''Inventing the Pizzeria'', p.28</ref>\n\nThe [[pizza marinara]] method has a topping of tomato, [[oregano]], [[garlic]], and [[Olive oil#Commercial grades|extra virgin olive oil]]. It is named \"marinara\" because it was traditionally the food prepared by \"la marinara\", the seaman's wife, for her seafaring husband when he returned from fishing trips in the [[Gulf of Naples|Bay of Naples]].\n\nThe margherita is topped with modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella and fresh basil. It is widely attributed to baker [[Raffaele Esposito]], who worked at restaurant \"Pietro... e basta cos\u00ec\" (\"Pietro... and that's enough\"), established in 1880 and still in business as \"Pizzeria Brandi\".

These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means (''i pizzaioli''&nbsp;\u2014 the pizza makers&nbsp;\u2014 make the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.\n\nThere are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto. Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias follow even stricter standards than the specified rules by, for example, using only [[San Marzano tomato]]es grown on the slopes of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.\n\nThe pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is \"[[pizza al taglio]]\", which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight.\n\nIn 1962, the \"Hawaiian\" pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham, Ontario]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Nosowitz |title=Meet the 81-Year-Old Greek-Canadian Inventor of the Hawaiian Pizza|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-inventor-of-hawaiian-pizza |work=[[Atlas Obscura]] |location=Unknown |date=November 4, 2015 |access-date=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2009, the pizza napoletana was granted [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO) status by the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Hooper |title=Pizza napoletana awarded special status by EU |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/09/italian-pizza-wins-protected-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=December 9, 2009 |access-date=December 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the world's largest pizza was made in Rome and it was measured to be 1261.65 square metres in area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-pizza|title=Largest pizza|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=January 13, 2017}} From the given area, the circular pizza had a diameter of approximately 40.08&nbsp;m, or 131.5&nbsp;ft.</ref>\n\nIn 2016, robotics company [[BeeHex]], widely covered in the media, was building robots that 3D-printed pizza.<ref name = digitaltrends>{{cite web | url = http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/beehex-3d-printed-pizza/ | title = NASA wants astronauts to have 3D printed pizza, and this startup is building a printer to make it happen | publisher = [[Digital Trends]] | access-date = January 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, the pizza napoletana was inscribed on the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Naples' pizza twirling wins Unesco 'intangible' status |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/naples-pizza-twirling-wins-unesco-intangible-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=December 7, 2017 |access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Pizza in Canada==\n[[Canada]]'s first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/From+archives+Montreal+pizzerias+labour+doughy+love/5974279/story.html|date=April 22, 2014|title=From the archives: Montreal pizzerias, the labour of doughy love|publisher=montrealgazzette.com}}</ref> Starting in the late 1950s, the first pizza ovens started entering the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1 |title=Bringing the first pizza ovens to Canada in the 1950s|publisher=Canada.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318171146/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1|archivedate=March 18, 2016}}</ref> It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small [[List of pizza chains|pizzerias]]. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and [[poutine]], salad, and [[calzone]]s. [[Pizza Pops]] are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.\n\nThe most distinct pizza in Canada is the \"Canadian\" pizza. A \"Canadian\" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with \"[[Canadian bacon]]\", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.\n\nIn Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customer's choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.\n\nIn the province of Quebec [[Pizza-ghetti]] is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese\n\nSome of Canada's successful pizza brands include: [[Boston Pizza]], [[Pizza Pizza]], and Vanelli's.

For some time after the tomato was brought to [[Europe]] from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous, as some other fruits of the ''[[Solanaceae]]'' (nightshade) family are. However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around [[Naples]] to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty.\n\n[[Image:Pizzeria Port Alba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba]] in Naples, which is widely believed to be the world's first pizzeria]]\nAccording to documents discovered by historian Antonio Mattozzi in State Archive of Naples, in 1807 already 54 pizzerias existed, with their owners and addresses.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio (2015) ''Inventing the'' ''Pizzeria: a History of Pizza Making in Naples'', Bloomsbury Academic, pp.16\u201317</ref> In the second half of the nineteenth century they increased to 120.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio  ''Inventing the Pizzeria'', Distribution Maps, p.xxxiv</ref>\n\nIn Naples, two others figures connected to the trade existed&nbsp;\u2014 the pizza hawker (''pizzaiuolo ambulante''), who sold pizza, but did not make it, and the seller of pizza \"a oggi a otto\", who made pizzas, but sold them in return for a payment for seven days.<ref>Mattozzi, Antonio ''Inventing the Pizzeria'', p.28</ref>\n\nThe [[pizza marinara]] method has a topping of tomato, [[oregano]], [[garlic]], and [[Olive oil#Commercial grades|extra virgin olive oil]].

It is widely attributed to baker [[Raffaele Esposito]], who worked at restaurant \"Pietro... e basta cos\u00ec\" (\"Pietro... and that's enough\"), established in 1880 and still in business as \"Pizzeria Brandi\".

These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means (''i pizzaioli''&nbsp;\u2014 the pizza makers&nbsp;\u2014 make the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.\n\nThere are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto. Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias follow even stricter standards than the specified rules by, for example, using only [[San Marzano tomato]]es grown on the slopes of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.\n\nThe pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is \"[[pizza al taglio]]\", which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight.\n\nIn 1962, the \"Hawaiian\" pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham, Ontario]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Nosowitz |title=Meet the 81-Year-Old Greek-Canadian Inventor of the Hawaiian Pizza|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-inventor-of-hawaiian-pizza |work=[[Atlas Obscura]] |location=Unknown |date=November 4, 2015 |access-date=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2009, the pizza napoletana was granted [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO) status by the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Hooper |title=Pizza napoletana awarded special status by EU |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/09/italian-pizza-wins-protected-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=December 9, 2009 |access-date=December 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the world's largest pizza was made in Rome and it was measured to be 1261.65 square metres in area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-pizza|title=Largest pizza|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=January 13, 2017}} From the given area, the circular pizza had a diameter of approximately 40.08&nbsp;m, or 131.5&nbsp;ft.</ref>\n\nIn 2016, robotics company [[BeeHex]], widely covered in the media, was building robots that 3D-printed pizza.<ref name = digitaltrends>{{cite web | url = http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/beehex-3d-printed-pizza/ | title = NASA wants astronauts to have 3D printed pizza, and this startup is building a printer to make it happen | publisher = [[Digital Trends]] | access-date = January 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, the pizza napoletana was inscribed on the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Naples' pizza twirling wins Unesco 'intangible' status |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/naples-pizza-twirling-wins-unesco-intangible-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=December 7, 2017 |access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Pizza in Canada==\n[[Canada]]'s first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/From+archives+Montreal+pizzerias+labour+doughy+love/5974279/story.html|date=April 22, 2014|title=From the archives: Montreal pizzerias, the labour of doughy love|publisher=montrealgazzette.com}}</ref> Starting in the late 1950s, the first pizza ovens started entering the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1 |title=Bringing the first pizza ovens to Canada in the 1950s|publisher=Canada.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318171146/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1|archivedate=March 18, 2016}}</ref> It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small [[List of pizza chains|pizzerias]]. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and [[poutine]], salad, and [[calzone]]s. [[Pizza Pops]] are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.\n\nThe most distinct pizza in Canada is the \"Canadian\" pizza. A \"Canadian\" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with \"[[Canadian bacon]]\", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.\n\nIn Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customer's choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.\n\nIn the province of Quebec [[Pizza-ghetti]] is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese\n\nSome of Canada's successful pizza brands include: [[Boston Pizza]], [[Pizza Pizza]], and Vanelli's.

Demol''' (born 11 March 1966) is a Belgian former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], and a current [[Manager (association football)|manager]].\n\nHe amassed [[Belgian First Division A]] totals of 120 games and 11 goals over the course of seven seasons, mainly with [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] with which he won eight major titles combined. He also competed professionally in Italy, Portugal, France, Greece and Switzerland.\n\nDemol represented [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]]. In 2000 he started a managerial career, going on to work in several countries.\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Watermael-Boitsfort]], [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels]], Demol joined local [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]]'s youth system at the age of 14, moving to the first-team setup four years later and scoring four [[Belgian First Division A]] goals in just 17 matches in [[1985\u201386 Belgian First Division|his first full professional season]], as the [[Brussels|capital]] side renewed their domestic supremacy.\n\nDemol soon became noticed by several clubs abroad, moving to Italy for [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna FC]], but his breakthrough would arrive the following year, in Portugal with [[FC Porto]]: he scored an astonishing 11 [[Primeira Liga]] goals, and helped his team [[1989\u201390 Primeira Liga|win the national championship]].\n\nDemol moved countries again after just one year, now signing with French side [[Toulouse FC]], but he returned in late 1991 to his country after joining [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], where he helped to consecutive [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] qualifications, finishing second to Anderlecht in [[1992\u201393 Belgian First Division|his second year]].\n\nAged 27, Demol signed with [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.|Cercle Brugge KSV]], but did not receive regular playing time. He subsequently returned for another abroad spell, being equally unsuccessful for [[S.C. Braga]], [[Panionios G.S.S.|Panionios GSS]], [[FC Lugano]] and [[Sporting Toulon Var]] (the latter in the [[Ligue 2|French second division]]).\n\nDemol ended his career in 2000 at 34, after playing one year apiece with [[F.C. Verbroedering Dender Eendracht Hekelgem|FC Denderleeuw]] and amateurs SK Halle, in which he began his manager career.

Demol''' (born 11 March 1966) is a Belgian former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], and a current [[Manager (association football)|manager]].\n\nHe amassed [[Belgian First Division A]] totals of 120 games and 11 goals over the course of seven seasons, mainly with [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] and [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]] with which he won eight major titles combined. He also competed professionally in Italy, Portugal, France, Greece and Switzerland.\n\nDemol represented [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]]. In 2000 he started a managerial career, going on to work in several countries.\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Watermael-Boitsfort]], [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels]], Demol joined local [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]]'s youth system at the age of 14, moving to the first-team setup four years later and scoring four [[Belgian First Division A]] goals in just 17 matches in [[1985\u201386 Belgian First Division|his first full professional season]], as the [[Brussels|capital]] side renewed their domestic supremacy.\n\nDemol soon became noticed by several clubs abroad, moving to Italy for [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna FC]], but his breakthrough would arrive the following year, in Portugal with [[FC Porto]]: he scored an astonishing 11 [[Primeira Liga]] goals, and helped his team [[1989\u201390 Primeira Liga|win the national championship]].\n\nDemol moved countries again after just one year, now signing with French side [[Toulouse FC]], but he returned in late 1991 to his country after joining [[Standard Li\u00e8ge]], where he helped to consecutive [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] qualifications, finishing second to Anderlecht in [[1992\u201393 Belgian First Division|his second year]].\n\nAged 27, Demol signed with [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.|Cercle Brugge KSV]], but did not receive regular playing time. He subsequently returned for another abroad spell, being equally unsuccessful for [[S.C. Braga]], [[Panionios G.S.S.|Panionios GSS]], [[FC Lugano]] and [[Sporting Toulon Var]] (the latter in the [[Ligue 2|French second division]]).\n\nDemol ended his career in 2000 at 34, after playing one year apiece with [[F.C. Verbroedering Dender Eendracht Hekelgem|FC Denderleeuw]] and amateurs SK Halle, in which he began his manager career.

However, his actions were subsequently interpreted (especially by the tabloid media) as a public threat and even associated with [[terrorism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-seno-umeni-a-zakon-5269815|title=Epos 257: Seno, um\u011bn\u00ed a z\u00e1kon|date=February 9, 2012|website=Radio Wave}}</ref> After some time, he repeated this undertaking as part of the implementation for the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theater]] on the Piazzetta of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theater]] (renamed to [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] Square), albeit this time intentionally obtaining all the required official permissions<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n=== ''50 Square Meters of Public Space'' ===\nA year later, Epos continued dealing with the boundaries of public space, even in the context of legislation. At that time, he put up a fence around space on [[Palack\u00e9ho n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed (Praha)|Palackeho Square]] (on which there is an exemption to the law prohibiting public gatherings without notice, and which is therefore referred to as the Czech \u201c[[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]\u201d), around an area of 50 square meters. Inside the delimited space, nothing was happening or placed other than what was outside of it. The absurd enclosure lasted 54 days on the square. After such a long time, the artist himself contacted city officials. This work was connected to the pointing out the indifference to the use of public space and the unjustifiableness of certain restrictions associated with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-v-bourani-graffiti-je-indikator-opustenosti-mista-ale-i-svobody-5183544|title=Epos 257 v Bour\u00e1n\u00ed: Graffiti je indik\u00e1tor opu\u0161t\u011bnosti m\u00edsta, ale i svobody|date=2017-02-13|website=Radio Wave|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=Epic 257 in Demolition: Graffiti is an indicator of the abandonment of place, but also of freedom}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Portrait'' ===\nEpos 257 has also repeatedly devoted himself to [[billboard]]s. For example, In the Portrait project, which was realised before the Czech presidential elections in 2013, he cut out the giant faces of both the final candidates, smiling at people from their gigantic posters, and then framed them. While he left the remains of the promotional posters lacking the faces of politicians in the original place. Epos installed the framed and glazed representations opposite each other. Shortly after his election, Epos went on to place a gigantic portrait of the winner of the elections [[Milo\u0161 Zeman]] in the [[Czech National Library of Technology|National Technical Library]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/epos-257-umelec-ktery-prodal-zaramovanou-loupez-fl3-/recenze.aspx?c=A140406_103720_pozice_139702|title=Epos 257: Um\u011blec, kter\u00fd prodal zar\u00e1movanou loupe\u017e {{!}} Recenze|date=2014-04-18|website=Lidovky.cz|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nIt was mainly for his \u201cbillboard\u201d projects that Epos 257 was repeatedly associated with breaking the law. His actions before the presidential and municipal elections also revived the debate on the ethical boundaries of artistic creation.

However, his actions were subsequently interpreted (especially by the tabloid media) as a public threat and even associated with [[terrorism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-seno-umeni-a-zakon-5269815|title=Epos 257: Seno, um\u011bn\u00ed a z\u00e1kon|date=February 9, 2012|website=Radio Wave}}</ref> After some time, he repeated this undertaking as part of the implementation for the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theater]] on the Piazzetta of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theater]] (renamed to [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] Square), albeit this time intentionally obtaining all the required official permissions<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n=== ''50 Square Meters of Public Space'' ===\nA year later, Epos continued dealing with the boundaries of public space, even in the context of legislation. At that time, he put up a fence around space on [[Palack\u00e9ho n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed (Praha)|Palackeho Square]] (on which there is an exemption to the law prohibiting public gatherings without notice, and which is therefore referred to as the Czech \u201c[[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]\u201d), around an area of 50 square meters. Inside the delimited space, nothing was happening or placed other than what was outside of it. The absurd enclosure lasted 54 days on the square. After such a long time, the artist himself contacted city officials. This work was connected to the pointing out the indifference to the use of public space and the unjustifiableness of certain restrictions associated with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-v-bourani-graffiti-je-indikator-opustenosti-mista-ale-i-svobody-5183544|title=Epos 257 v Bour\u00e1n\u00ed: Graffiti je indik\u00e1tor opu\u0161t\u011bnosti m\u00edsta, ale i svobody|date=2017-02-13|website=Radio Wave|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=Epic 257 in Demolition: Graffiti is an indicator of the abandonment of place, but also of freedom}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Portrait'' ===\nEpos 257 has also repeatedly devoted himself to [[billboard]]s. For example, In the Portrait project, which was realised before the Czech presidential elections in 2013, he cut out the giant faces of both the final candidates, smiling at people from their gigantic posters, and then framed them. While he left the remains of the promotional posters lacking the faces of politicians in the original place. Epos installed the framed and glazed representations opposite each other. Shortly after his election, Epos went on to place a gigantic portrait of the winner of the elections [[Milo\u0161 Zeman]] in the [[Czech National Library of Technology|National Technical Library]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/epos-257-umelec-ktery-prodal-zaramovanou-loupez-fl3-/recenze.aspx?c=A140406_103720_pozice_139702|title=Epos 257: Um\u011blec, kter\u00fd prodal zar\u00e1movanou loupe\u017e {{!}} Recenze|date=2014-04-18|website=Lidovky.cz|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nIt was mainly for his \u201cbillboard\u201d projects that Epos 257 was repeatedly associated with breaking the law. His actions before the presidential and municipal elections also revived the debate on the ethical boundaries of artistic creation.

It was published between 1876 and 1944, and its circulation was over two million after the [[First World War]].\n\n==Publishing==\nDespite its name, the paper was circulated across France, and records showed claims that it had the biggest newspaper circulation in the world at this time.<ref>[http://www.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr/chan/chan/pdf/ARASAQ/11AR.pdf {{in lang|fr}} Fonds du Petit Parisien, [[Archives nationales (France)|Archives nationales]] (French national archives)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929074017/http://www.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr/chan/chan/pdf/ARASAQ/11AR.pdf |date=29 September 2006 }}</ref> In May 1927, the paper fell into a [[media prank]] set up by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and his friends, announcing that [[Charles Lindbergh]] was going to be awarded as ''[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]'' honorary student.<ref>Hayman, Ronald (1987) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCpBAQAAIAAJ ''Sartre: a life''] pp.69, 318</ref> During the [[Second World War]] the paper, under the editorship of [[Claude Jeantet]], was the official voice of the [[Vichy regime]] and in 1944 was briefly published by Jeantet in [[Nazi Germany]] before closing down.<ref>[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', 1990, p. 198</ref>\n\n==Background==\nPrior to the twentieth century, newspapers were largely political such as Paris's [[La Presse (French newspaper)|''La Presse'']]. This is largely because newspapers held close ties with political parties in order to profit. However, this led to a stunt in circulation. The creation of Joseph Pulitzer's newspaper [[Le Matin (France)|''Le Matin'']] inspired a new type of journalism. It prompted the start of [[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|''Le Petit Journal'']] and ''Le Petit Parisien'' which launched French journalism into a mass medium. These newspapers offered sensationalized news rather than relying on political propaganda which also meant they avoided the tax held on most political newspapers. This new style, reporting on topics such as finance and fashion, targeted mid to lower class readers. Appealing to this demographic helped launch ''Le Petit Parisien''{{\u2019}}s circulation to the millions.<ref name=\"auto\">Eaman, Ross. ''Historical Dictionary of Journalism''. Scarecrow Press, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Illustration==\n''Le Petit Parisien'' featured a weekly, Sunday illustration located on their front pages. These illustrations were often visual representation of current events and paired with an article located within the newspaper. Because photography was not readily available, the newspaper relied on local artists to provide drawings and sketches for human interest stories. The purpose of these illustrated covers was to capture the eye of the passerby. Some illustrations are noted as risqu\u00e9 or scandalous, with the intentional use of getting the attention of readers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women in Bed with Snakes and Other News.

It was published between 1876 and 1944, and its circulation was over two million after the [[First World War]].\n\n==Publishing==\nDespite its name, the paper was circulated across France, and records showed claims that it had the biggest newspaper circulation in the world at this time.<ref>[http://www.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr/chan/chan/pdf/ARASAQ/11AR.pdf {{in lang|fr}} Fonds du Petit Parisien, [[Archives nationales (France)|Archives nationales]] (French national archives)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929074017/http://www.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr/chan/chan/pdf/ARASAQ/11AR.pdf |date=29 September 2006 }}</ref> In May 1927, the paper fell into a [[media prank]] set up by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and his friends, announcing that [[Charles Lindbergh]] was going to be awarded as ''[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]'' honorary student.<ref>Hayman, Ronald (1987) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCpBAQAAIAAJ ''Sartre: a life''] pp.69, 318</ref> During the [[Second World War]] the paper, under the editorship of [[Claude Jeantet]], was the official voice of the [[Vichy regime]] and in 1944 was briefly published by Jeantet in [[Nazi Germany]] before closing down.<ref>[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', 1990, p. 198</ref>\n\n==Background==\nPrior to the twentieth century, newspapers were largely political such as Paris's [[La Presse (French newspaper)|''La Presse'']]. This is largely because newspapers held close ties with political parties in order to profit. However, this led to a stunt in circulation. The creation of Joseph Pulitzer's newspaper [[Le Matin (France)|''Le Matin'']] inspired a new type of journalism. It prompted the start of [[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|''Le Petit Journal'']] and ''Le Petit Parisien'' which launched French journalism into a mass medium. These newspapers offered sensationalized news rather than relying on political propaganda which also meant they avoided the tax held on most political newspapers. This new style, reporting on topics such as finance and fashion, targeted mid to lower class readers. Appealing to this demographic helped launch ''Le Petit Parisien''{{\u2019}}s circulation to the millions.<ref name=\"auto\">Eaman, Ross. ''Historical Dictionary of Journalism''. Scarecrow Press, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Illustration==\n''Le Petit Parisien'' featured a weekly, Sunday illustration located on their front pages. These illustrations were often visual representation of current events and paired with an article located within the newspaper. Because photography was not readily available, the newspaper relied on local artists to provide drawings and sketches for human interest stories. The purpose of these illustrated covers was to capture the eye of the passerby. Some illustrations are noted as risqu\u00e9 or scandalous, with the intentional use of getting the attention of readers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women in Bed with Snakes and Other News.
