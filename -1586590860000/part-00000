The channel also houses educational content via a segment known as ''Michael's Toys''. In these videos, Stevens investigates tools and toys that are useful for explaining scientific or mathematical phenomena.

Jake made much of the music in the earlier \"The Key of Awesome\" music videos. Because of this, Chudnow gives Vsauce exclusive rights to his music, and all Vsauce channels use his music in their videos. One of the most recognizable pieces of his music is \"Moon Men\", which is used in the original Vsauce channel and is often played whenever Stevens poses a mysterious question or makes a mysterious statement. Other pieces of music used by the channels include \"145-(Poodles)\", \"Sunday\", \"It's Good to be D\", \"Hydrogen\", \"Darwin\", \"Carlin Dream\", \"Lions Tigers and Apes Part II\", \"Hanami\", \"Pressed Pennies\", \"Keith\" and \"Shona\". They are often played when the audience is encouraged to think. \"Turquoise\" is often used, usually when big, astonishing, or otherwise significant facts or ideas are mentioned. \"Flan\" is often used for sad or abstract facts. \"Rainstorms and Rainbows (I Am the Hero)\", \"Going Down\", and \"Flan\" are played at the end of videos. \"192-1\", \"White\", \"For You\", \"Meet Men and Party (All Night)\", \"Banana\", \"Ducking\", \"Buildings and Bikes\", \"Shallow Anne\", \"Button\", \"Olive\", and \"Muff Mittens\" are also often used in Vsauce2 and Vsauce3.\n\nIn the video \"The Moon Terminator Illusion\", Chudnow's vinyl album ''Shona EP'' was the focus object against the wall when showing the visual effects of zooming and moving on nearby objects (a Vsauce mug) and distant ones (the EP).\n\n== Notable collaborations and other appearances ==\nVsauce has collaborated with Henry Reich of [[MinutePhysics]] on two videos: \"Guns in Space\"<ref name=Gizmodo2/> and \"What if the Earth were Hollow?\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Shaw|url=http://www.itworld.com/virtualization/291747/science-monday-minutephysics-teams-vsauce-what-if-palooza|title=Science Monday: MinutePhysics teams with VSauce for a What-if-a-palooza|work=IT World|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Vsauce has also collaborated with [[The Periodic Table of Videos|Periodic Videos]]<ref>\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/feature_vsauce_visit.htm|title=Vsauce Visit \u2013 The Periodic Table of Videos|work=Periodic Videos|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfCp7CPx-M|title=Standard Weight (feat.

Jake made much of the music in the earlier \"The Key of Awesome\" music videos.

One of the most recognizable pieces of his music is \"Moon Men\", which is used in the original Vsauce channel and is often played whenever Stevens poses a mysterious question or makes a mysterious statement. Other pieces of music used by the channels include \"145-(Poodles)\", \"Sunday\", \"It's Good to be D\", \"Hydrogen\", \"Darwin\", \"Carlin Dream\", \"Lions Tigers and Apes Part II\", \"Hanami\", \"Pressed Pennies\", \"Keith\" and \"Shona\". They are often played when the audience is encouraged to think. \"Turquoise\" is often used, usually when big, astonishing, or otherwise significant facts or ideas are mentioned. \"Flan\" is often used for sad or abstract facts. \"Rainstorms and Rainbows (I Am the Hero)\", \"Going Down\", and \"Flan\" are played at the end of videos. \"192-1\", \"White\", \"For You\", \"Meet Men and Party (All Night)\", \"Banana\", \"Ducking\", \"Buildings and Bikes\", \"Shallow Anne\", \"Button\", \"Olive\", and \"Muff Mittens\" are also often used in Vsauce2 and Vsauce3.\n\nIn the video \"The Moon Terminator Illusion\", Chudnow's vinyl album ''Shona EP'' was the focus object against the wall when showing the visual effects of zooming and moving on nearby objects (a Vsauce mug) and distant ones (the EP).\n\n== Notable collaborations and other appearances ==\nVsauce has collaborated with Henry Reich of [[MinutePhysics]] on two videos: \"Guns in Space\"<ref name=Gizmodo2/> and \"What if the Earth were Hollow?\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Shaw|url=http://www.itworld.com/virtualization/291747/science-monday-minutephysics-teams-vsauce-what-if-palooza|title=Science Monday: MinutePhysics teams with VSauce for a What-if-a-palooza|work=IT World|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Vsauce has also collaborated with [[The Periodic Table of Videos|Periodic Videos]]<ref>\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/feature_vsauce_visit.htm|title=Vsauce Visit \u2013 The Periodic Table of Videos|work=Periodic Videos|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfCp7CPx-M|title=Standard Weight (feat.

It was decided to swap the Apollo 8 and [[Apollo 9]] prime and backup crews in the flight schedule so that the crew trained for the low-orbit test could fly it as Apollo 9, when the LM would be ready. A lunar orbital flight, now Apollo 8 replaced the original Apollo 9 medium Earth orbit test. Borman, Lovell and Anders were launched on December 21, 1968, becoming the first men to travel to the [[Moon]].{{sfn|Ertel|Newkirk|Brooks|1978|pp=236\u2013254}}\n\nAs CM Pilot, Lovell served as the navigator, using the spacecraft's built-in [[sextant]] to determine its position by measuring star positions. This information was then used to calculate required mid-course corrections. The craft entered lunar orbit on Christmas Eve and made a total of ten orbits, most of them circular at an altitude of approximately {{convert|70|mi|km}} for a total of twenty hours. They broadcast black-and-white television pictures of the lunar surface back to Earth. Lovell took his turn with Borman and Anders in reading a passage from the Biblical creation story in the [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|Book of Genesis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo8_xmas.html|title=The Apollo 8 Christmas Eve Broadcast|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=December 29, 2017|date=25 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nThey began their return to Earth on Christmas Day with a rocket burn made on the Moon's far side, out of radio contact with Earth. (For this reason, the lunar orbit insertion and trans-Earth injection burns were the two most tense moments of this first lunar mission.) When contact was re-established, Lovell was the first to announce the good news, \"Please be informed, there is a [[Santa Claus]].\" The crew splashed down safely on Earth on December 27.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/apollo_8.html|title=Apollo 8: Christmas at the Moon|date=December 18, 2014|website=NASA|access-date=December 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Apollo 13====\n[[File:Jim Lovell at LC-39.png|thumb|left|Lovell in front of the launch pad before the Apollo 13 mission]]\n[[File:Jim Lovell newspaper.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lovell reads a newspaper account of Apollo 13's safe return aboard recovery vessel [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']].]]\n{{Main|Apollo 13}}\nLovell was backup commander of [[Apollo 11]] and was scheduled to command [[Apollo 14]].

In just over two hours, all on-board oxygen was lost, disabling the hydrogen [[fuel cell]]s that provided electrical power to the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] ''Odyssey''.
