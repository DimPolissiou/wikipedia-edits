It was theatrically released in India on 27 December 2019.<ref name=\"reldate\"/>\n\n== Plot ==\nVarun Batra is the CEO of a Volkswagen showroom in Mumbai. He and his wife Deepti \"Deepu\" Batra are a happily married couple going on seven years. However, they struggle to conceive a baby. Varun's sister Richa suggests the couple meet reputed fertility specialist Anand Joshi, who suggests they do [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF), a fertility technique that will enhance their chances. They agree, Varun submits sperm samples, and doctor Anand seemingly places Varun's sperm in Deepu's embryo.\n\n12 days later, Varun and Deepu are hastily summoned by Anand's wife, Dr. Sandhya Joshi. Here, Varun and Deepu encounter the other Batra couple, Honey Batra and Monika \"Moni\" Batra , a couple from Chandigarh, who have taken up IVF as well. Anand guiltily reveals that a sperm mix-up has occurred: Varun's sperm have been mixed with Moni's eggs, and Honey's sperm with Deepu's eggs. Shocked beyond belief, both couples attack the two doctors. The doctors suggest that the couples go for a minor procedure so there is no chance of pregnancy. Varun later finds out from Honey that Moni is pregnant with Varun's child, but his rudeness causes Honey to fear the loss of his own child as Deepu has also gotten pregnant. He vows to prevent an abortion on Deepu's part, and he and Moni rent out an apartment just above Varun's and Deepu's, much to the couple's shock.\n\nVarun and Deepu initially project frustration against Honey and Moni the first six months of pregnancy for interfering in their lives. However, during a routine check-up in the seventh month of pregnancy, Sandhya advises Deepu to try talking to Moni, who is probably going through as much as she is emotionally. Realizing that she needs to try understanding the situation, Deepu asks Moni out for food, during which they start getting to know each other. Deepu learns that Moni had suffered two miscarriages, making her sympathize, and the women bond. However, Varun still nurses a negative attitude, especially since Deepu is not carrying his child. Deepu takes a stand, telling Varun that he has never even tried to understand or care for what she has been going through ever since all of this happened.\n\nHoney and Varun begin bonding at a bar until Honey expresses concern over Deepu's work commitments, which he thinks will have a negative impact on the child. Varun, incensed, tells Honey to buzz off, and the mood quickly puts an end to the bonding. An argument between the two escalates until Varun storms out and Honey is arrested.\n\nThat night, Moni knocks on Deepu's door in desperation: she has gone into premature labor and Honey is nowhere to be found. Varun hurriedly drives Moni to the hospital and she gives birth. However, the newborn is shifted to a critical unit in grave condition, having been born with a respiratory defect, accelerated by Moni's history of miscarriages, with little chance of survival. As it hits him that the baby is in fact his, Varun begins crying and hugs Honey when Honey arrives. Varun goes home and breaks down in Deepu's arms, apologizing for his previous behavior. \n\nFor a few weeks, both couples pray for the baby's recovery and Moni remains in the hospital. The baby finally recovers and Deepu too has a successful delivery. Varun, now a changed man, invites Honey and Moni to meet the baby. Both couples finally bond and accept each other, holding each other's babies in their arms.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Akshay Kumar]] as Varun Batra\n*[[Kareena Kapoor Khan]] as Deepti \"Deepu\" Batra \n*[[Diljit Dosanjh]] as Honey Batra\n*[[Kiara Advani]] as Monika \"Moni\" Batra \n*[[Tisca Chopra]] as Dr. Sandhya Joshi\n*[[Adil Hussain]] as Dr. Anand Joshi\n*[[Anjana Sukhani]] as Richa Batra \n*Faisal Rashid as Vivek\n*[[Mohit Raina]] in a cameo appearance as Murari, the flight passenger beside Deepti\n===Special appearances===\n* [[Karan Johar]] in the song \"Chandigarh Mein\"\n* [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]] in the song \"Chandigarh Mein\"\n* [[Harrdy Sandhu]] in the song \"Chandigarh Mein\"\n* [[Sukhbir (musician)|Sukhbir]] in the song \"Sauda Khara Khara\"\n\n==Production==\n=== Pre-production ===\nThis film's name was announced on Twitter as - ''Good News''.

He and his wife Deepti \"Deepu\" Batra are a happily married couple going on seven years. However, they struggle to conceive a baby. Varun's sister Richa suggests the couple meet reputed fertility specialist Anand Joshi, who suggests they do [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF), a fertility technique that will enhance their chances. They agree, Varun submits sperm samples, and doctor Anand seemingly places Varun's sperm in Deepu's embryo.\n\n12 days later, Varun and Deepu are hastily summoned by Anand's wife, Dr. Sandhya Joshi. Here, Varun and Deepu encounter the other Batra couple, Honey Batra and Monika \"Moni\" Batra , a couple from Chandigarh, who have taken up IVF as well. Anand guiltily reveals that a sperm mix-up has occurred: Varun's sperm have been mixed with Moni's eggs, and Honey's sperm with Deepu's eggs. Shocked beyond belief, both couples attack the two doctors. The doctors suggest that the couples go for a minor procedure so there is no chance of pregnancy. Varun later finds out from Honey that Moni is pregnant with Varun's child, but his rudeness causes Honey to fear the loss of his own child as Deepu has also gotten pregnant. He vows to prevent an abortion on Deepu's part, and he and Moni rent out an apartment just above Varun's and Deepu's, much to the couple's shock.\n\nVarun and Deepu initially project frustration against Honey and Moni the first six months of pregnancy for interfering in their lives. However, during a routine check-up in the seventh month of pregnancy, Sandhya advises Deepu to try talking to Moni, who is probably going through as much as she is emotionally. Realizing that she needs to try understanding the situation, Deepu asks Moni out for food, during which they start getting to know each other. Deepu learns that Moni had suffered two miscarriages, making her sympathize, and the women bond. However, Varun still nurses a negative attitude, especially since Deepu is not carrying his child. Deepu takes a stand, telling Varun that he has never even tried to understand or care for what she has been going through ever since all of this happened.\n\nHoney and Varun begin bonding at a bar until Honey expresses concern over Deepu's work commitments, which he thinks will have a negative impact on the child. Varun, incensed, tells Honey to buzz off, and the mood quickly puts an end to the bonding. An argument between the two escalates until Varun storms out and Honey is arrested.\n\nThat night, Moni knocks on Deepu's door in desperation: she has gone into premature labor and Honey is nowhere to be found. Varun hurriedly drives Moni to the hospital and she gives birth. However, the newborn is shifted to a critical unit in grave condition, having been born with a respiratory defect, accelerated by Moni's history of miscarriages, with little chance of survival. As it hits him that the baby is in fact his, Varun begins crying and hugs Honey when Honey arrives. Varun goes home and breaks down in Deepu's arms, apologizing for his previous behavior. \n\nFor a few weeks, both couples pray for the baby's recovery and Moni remains in the hospital. The baby finally recovers and Deepu too has a successful delivery. Varun, now a changed man, invites Honey and Moni to meet the baby. Both couples finally bond and accept each other, holding each other's babies in their arms.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Akshay Kumar]] as Varun Batra\n*[[Kareena Kapoor Khan]] as Deepti \"Deepu\" Batra \n*[[Diljit Dosanjh]] as Honey Batra\n*[[Kiara Advani]] as Monika \"Moni\" Batra \n*[[Tisca Chopra]] as Dr. Sandhya Joshi\n*[[Adil Hussain]] as Dr. Anand Joshi\n*[[Anjana Sukhani]] as Richa Batra \n*Faisal Rashid as Vivek\n*[[Mohit Raina]] in a cameo appearance as Murari, the flight passenger beside Deepti\n===Special appearances===\n* [[Karan Johar]] in the song \"Chandigarh Mein\"\n* [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]] in the song \"Chandigarh Mein\"\n* [[Harrdy Sandhu]] in the song \"Chandigarh Mein\"\n* [[Sukhbir (musician)|Sukhbir]] in the song \"Sauda Khara Khara\"\n\n==Production==\n=== Pre-production ===\nThis film's name was announced on Twitter as - ''Good News''.

Argentine submarines have traditionally been named after the [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces of the Republic]] whose name begins with the letter 'S'; they are home based at [[Mar del Plata]] naval base. COFS members have the same rank insignia and titles as the rest of the Navy. As of 2010, the elite group ''[[Tactical Divers Group|Agrupaci\u00f3n de Buzos T\u00e1cticos]]'' is under the direct command of the submarine force.

Two Subs are currently non operational pending repairs, the other two are still active pending their replacement by the 4 Scorpene type Submarines currently under construction. However, in the early 2000s they had been upgraded with new combat systems by Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors. This gave the submarines the ability to carry and fire the MK 48 MOD 6AT ADCAP Torpedo. Although there are some reservations about the deal, the defense ministers and admirals of the Argentine Navy are enthusiastic about moving forward with it. The submarines can easily be repaired and serviced in the Tandanor drydock facility. If this deal succeeds it will allow Argentina to replace the two remaining submarines ARA Salta S-31, and ASA Santa Cruz S-41 currently in service with its fleet.

During the Han Dynasty, a marriage lacking a dowry or betrothal gift was seen as dishonorable. Only after gifts were exchanged would a marriage proceed; and the bride would be taken to live in the ancestral home of the new husband. Here, a wife was not only expected to live with the entirety of her husband's family, but to follow all of their rules and beliefs. Many families followed the Confucian teachings regarding honoring their elders. These rituals were passed down from father to son, official family lists were compiled, containing the names of all the sons and marital wives. So brides who did not produce a son were written out of family lists and forgotten. When a husband died, the bride was seen as the property of her spouse's family. Ransoms were set by some brides' families to get their daughters back, though never with her children, who remained in the property of her husband's family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry|title=Gender in history: global perspectives|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass|isbn=9781405189958|pages=29\u201330|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nJohn Engel, a professor of Family Resources at the [[University of Hawaii]], argues that the [[People's Republic of China]] established the [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1950]] to redistribute wealth and achieve a classless society.

With these pressures to be married, some women who have very few prospects willingly enter into a second marriage. Sometimes, these second wives are promised a good life and home by these men. Oftentimes, these women are poor and uneducated so when they split, they have very little left. Sometimes these women were completely unaware that the man was already married.

According to Amnesty International, the law protects individual rights and bans the usage of coercion or detainment.<ref name=Amnesty/>\n\n==Property ownership==\n\nIn current-day China, women enjoy legal [[gender equality|equal rights]] to [[property]], but in practice, these rights are often difficult to realize. However, Chinese women have historically held little rights to private property, both by societal customs and by law. In imperial China (before 1911 C.E.), family households held property collectively, rather than as individual members of the household. This property customarily belonged to the family ancestral clan, with legal control belonging to the family head, or the eldest male.<ref name=\"birge\">Birge, Bettine. Women, Property, and Confucian Reaction in Sung and Yuan China (960-1368). Cambridge University Press, 2002.</ref>\n\nAncestry in imperial China was [[patrilinearity|patrilineal]], or passed through the male. Because women were not a part of this male-based ancestral line, they could never share the family property.<ref name=\"mccreery\">McCreery, John L. \"Women's property rights and dowry in China and South Asia.\" Ethnology (1976): 163-174.</ref> Upon the death of the head of the household, property was passed to the eldest son. In the absence of an eligible son, a family would often adopt a son to continue the family line and property.<ref name=\"bernhardt\">Bernhardt, Kathryn. Women and property in China, 960-1949. Stanford University Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nHowever, as Kathryn Bernhardt, a scholar of Chinese history points out, nearly one in three women during the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 C.E.) would either have no brothers or no sons, leaving them with some agency over family property. In these cases, unmarried daughters would receive their fathers\u2019 property in the absence of direct male descendants, or an unmarried widow would choose the family heir.<ref name=bernhardt /> A new law enacted during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368-1644 C.E.) required that in the absence of a direct male descendant, a man's property was to go to his nephews. With this change in law, women's access to private property was restricted. At that point, only if none of a man's sons and none of his brothers' sons were alive to inherit property would a daughter receive the inheritance.<ref name=mccreery />\n\nIn most cases, the most control over family property that a widow would receive was maintenance, or the agency to control the property while an heir came of age.<ref name=bernhardt /> In some cases after some reforms in the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912), some women could retain maintenance over undivided property even after their sons came of age.<ref name=\"ocko\">Ocko, Jonathan K. \"Women, property, and law in the People's Republic of China.\" Marriage and inequality in Chinese society 12 (1991): 313.</ref> Law during the Republican era interpreted this to mean that widows held complete power over sons in control of the family property.<ref name=ocko />\n\nThe [[Chinese Nationalist Party|Kuomintang]], which assumed power over China in 1911, publicly advocated for gender equality, though not very many changes in property rights went into effect until the enactment of the [[Law of the Republic of China|Republican Civil Code]] in 1930, which changed the basic definitions of property and family inheritance.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=ocko /> The Code specified that family property legally belonged to the father, with no connection to the ancestral clan.<ref name=bernhardt />\n\nInheritance of this property was based on direct lineage, regardless of gender, so that sons and daughters would receive an equal share of family property upon the death of their parents. Furthermore, a man's will or appointment of a different heir could not fully bypass the legally mandated inheritance structures, preventing families from holding onto gender-discriminatory customs.<ref name=bernhardt /> Despite the law's equitable wording on the property, some scholars, such as Deborah Davis and Kathryn Bernhardt, point out that the legal definitions regarding property may not have entirely changed the practices of the general public.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=\"davis\">Davis, Deborah. \"Who gets the house? Renegotiating property rights in post-socialist urban China.\" Modern China 36, no. 5 (2010): 463-492.</ref>\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]], which assumed control in 1949 and remains in power today, also promised gender equality. The PRC's approach was different from the Kuomintang. With regards to land, all land was owned by the central Chinese government and allocated for people to use, so technically no one, male or female, owned land. In 1978, the Chinese government set up a household farming system that split agricultural land into small plots for villages to allocate to citizens.<ref name=\"Hare\">Hare, Denise, Li Yang, and Daniel Englander. \"Land management in rural China and its gender implications.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 35-61.</ref>\n\nThe land was distributed to households with legal responsibility in the family head or the eldest male. So, a woman's access to land was contingent on her being part of a household. Land leases were technically supposed to transfer with marriage to a woman's marital family, but the perfect allocation of land leases was not always reached, meaning women could potentially lose land upon marriage. Such village allocations have since ceased, so the leases to the land are now passed through families.<ref name=\"chen\">Chen, Junjie, and Gale Summerfield. \"Gender and rural reforms in China: A case study of population control and land rights policies in northern Liaoning.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 63-92.</ref>\n\nFor property other than land, new Chinese laws allow for the distinction between personal and communal property. Married couples can simultaneously own some things individually while sharing others with their spouse and family. With regard to divorce, Chinese law generally demands a 50/50 split of property. The [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1980]] defined different types of divorce that would split the conjugal property differently, such as instances of adultery or domestic violence.<ref name=davis />\n\nSince most divorce disputes are settled at a local level, the law allows courts to review specific situations and make decisions in the best interest of the child. Typically, such a decision would simultaneously favor the mother, especially in disputes over a house where the child would live. In some divorce disputes \"ownership\" and \"use\" over property would be distinguished, giving a mother and child \"use\" of the family house without awarding the mother full ownership of the house.<ref name=davis />\n\n==Employment==\nIf female labor force participation is used as the indicator to measure gender equality, China would be one of the most egalitarian countries in the world: female labor force participation in China increased dramatically after the founding of the People's Republic and almost reached the universal level.<ref name=\"bridgew.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/vol1/li.htm |title=Women's Movement and Change of Women's Status in China |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515152129/http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/vol1/li.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}</ref> According to a study by Bauer et al., of women who married between 1950 and 1965, 70 percent had jobs, and women who married between 1966 and 1976, 92 percent had jobs.<ref name=\"Bauer\"/>\n\nEven though women in China are actively contributing to the paid labor force to an extent that exceeds numerous other countries, parity in the workforce has not been reached.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=J|author2=L.

During the Han Dynasty, a marriage lacking a dowry or betrothal gift was seen as dishonorable. Only after gifts were exchanged would a marriage proceed; and the bride would be taken to live in the ancestral home of the new husband. Here, a wife was not only expected to live with the entirety of her husband's family, but to follow all of their rules and beliefs. Many families followed the Confucian teachings regarding honoring their elders. These rituals were passed down from father to son, official family lists were compiled, containing the names of all the sons and marital wives. So brides who did not produce a son were written out of family lists and forgotten. When a husband died, the bride was seen as the property of her spouse's family.

Unlike previous generations of [[arranged marriage]]s, the modern polygamy is more often voluntary.<ref name=\"Graeme Lang and Josephine Smart 2002 546\u2013569\"/> Women in China are facing serious pressures to be married, by family and friends. There is a derogatory term for women who are not married by the time they are in their late twenties, [[sheng nu]]. With these pressures to be married, some women who have very few prospects willingly enter into a second marriage. Sometimes, these second wives are promised a good life and home by these men. Oftentimes, these women are poor and uneducated so when they split, they have very little left. Sometimes these women were completely unaware that the man was already married.

According to Amnesty International, the law protects individual rights and bans the usage of coercion or detainment.<ref name=Amnesty/>\n\n==Property ownership==\n\nIn current-day China, women enjoy legal [[gender equality|equal rights]] to [[property]], but in practice, these rights are often difficult to realize. However, Chinese women have historically held little rights to private property, both by societal customs and by law. In imperial China (before 1911 C.E.), family households held property collectively, rather than as individual members of the household. This property customarily belonged to the family ancestral clan, with legal control belonging to the family head, or the eldest male.<ref name=\"birge\">Birge, Bettine. Women, Property, and Confucian Reaction in Sung and Yuan China (960-1368). Cambridge University Press, 2002.</ref>\n\nAncestry in imperial China was [[patrilinearity|patrilineal]], or passed through the male. Because women were not a part of this male-based ancestral line, they could never share the family property.<ref name=\"mccreery\">McCreery, John L. \"Women's property rights and dowry in China and South Asia.\" Ethnology (1976): 163-174.</ref> Upon the death of the head of the household, property was passed to the eldest son. In the absence of an eligible son, a family would often adopt a son to continue the family line and property.<ref name=\"bernhardt\">Bernhardt, Kathryn. Women and property in China, 960-1949. Stanford University Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nHowever, as Kathryn Bernhardt, a scholar of Chinese history points out, nearly one in three women during the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 C.E.) would either have no brothers or no sons, leaving them with some agency over family property. In these cases, unmarried daughters would receive their fathers\u2019 property in the absence of direct male descendants, or an unmarried widow would choose the family heir.<ref name=bernhardt /> A new law enacted during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368-1644 C.E.) required that in the absence of a direct male descendant, a man's property was to go to his nephews. With this change in law, women's access to private property was restricted. At that point, only if none of a man's sons and none of his brothers' sons were alive to inherit property would a daughter receive the inheritance.<ref name=mccreery />\n\nIn most cases, the most control over family property that a widow would receive was maintenance, or the agency to control the property while an heir came of age.<ref name=bernhardt /> In some cases after some reforms in the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912), some women could retain maintenance over undivided property even after their sons came of age.<ref name=\"ocko\">Ocko, Jonathan K. \"Women, property, and law in the People's Republic of China.\" Marriage and inequality in Chinese society 12 (1991): 313.</ref> Law during the Republican era interpreted this to mean that widows held complete power over sons in control of the family property.<ref name=ocko />\n\nThe [[Chinese Nationalist Party|Kuomintang]], which assumed power over China in 1911, publicly advocated for gender equality, though not very many changes in property rights went into effect until the enactment of the [[Law of the Republic of China|Republican Civil Code]] in 1930, which changed the basic definitions of property and family inheritance.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=ocko /> The Code specified that family property legally belonged to the father, with no connection to the ancestral clan.<ref name=bernhardt />\n\nInheritance of this property was based on direct lineage, regardless of gender, so that sons and daughters would receive an equal share of family property upon the death of their parents. Furthermore, a man's will or appointment of a different heir could not fully bypass the legally mandated inheritance structures, preventing families from holding onto gender-discriminatory customs.<ref name=bernhardt /> Despite the law's equitable wording on the property, some scholars, such as Deborah Davis and Kathryn Bernhardt, point out that the legal definitions regarding property may not have entirely changed the practices of the general public.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=\"davis\">Davis, Deborah. \"Who gets the house? Renegotiating property rights in post-socialist urban China.\" Modern China 36, no. 5 (2010): 463-492.</ref>\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]], which assumed control in 1949 and remains in power today, also promised gender equality. The PRC's approach was different from the Kuomintang. With regards to land, all land was owned by the central Chinese government and allocated for people to use, so technically no one, male or female, owned land. In 1978, the Chinese government set up a household farming system that split agricultural land into small plots for villages to allocate to citizens.<ref name=\"Hare\">Hare, Denise, Li Yang, and Daniel Englander. \"Land management in rural China and its gender implications.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 35-61.</ref>\n\nThe land was distributed to households with legal responsibility in the family head or the eldest male. So, a woman's access to land was contingent on her being part of a household. Land leases were technically supposed to transfer with marriage to a woman's marital family, but the perfect allocation of land leases was not always reached, meaning women could potentially lose land upon marriage. Such village allocations have since ceased, so the leases to the land are now passed through families.<ref name=\"chen\">Chen, Junjie, and Gale Summerfield. \"Gender and rural reforms in China: A case study of population control and land rights policies in northern Liaoning.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 63-92.</ref>\n\nFor property other than land, new Chinese laws allow for the distinction between personal and communal property. Married couples can simultaneously own some things individually while sharing others with their spouse and family. With regard to divorce, Chinese law generally demands a 50/50 split of property. The [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1980]] defined different types of divorce that would split the conjugal property differently, such as instances of adultery or domestic violence.<ref name=davis />\n\nSince most divorce disputes are settled at a local level, the law allows courts to review specific situations and make decisions in the best interest of the child. Typically, such a decision would simultaneously favor the mother, especially in disputes over a house where the child would live.

Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine and/or to express algorithms precisely.\n** [[Compiled language]] \u2014 programming language implemented through compilers (translators which generate machine code from source code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code, where no translation takes place).\n** [[General-purpose programming language]] \u2014 programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains.\n** [[Intermediate language]] \u2014 language of an abstract machine designed to aid in the analysis of computer programs. The term comes from their use in compilers, where a compiler first translates the source code of a program into a form more suitable for code-improving transformations, as an intermediate step before generating object or machine code for a target machine.\n** [[Object-oriented programming|Object-oriented programming language]] &ndash; programming language based on \"objects\", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, known as methods. An object's procedures can access and modify the data fields of the objects. In object-oriented programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.\n** [[Type system#Static typing|Statically typed programming language]]\n\n== General C++ concepts ==\n<!-- Place the terms below into more appropriate sections, creating new sections as needed.-->\n* [[Name resolution (programming languages)|Name resolution]]\n** [[Argument-dependent name lookup]] \u2014 applies to the lookup of an unqualified function name depending on the types of the arguments given to the function call. This behavior is also known as Koenig lookup, named after its inventor Andrew Koenig.\n* [[Auto-linking]] \u2014 mechanism for automatically determining which libraries to link to while building a C or C++ program.

Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine and/or to express algorithms precisely.\n** [[Compiled language]] \u2014 programming language implemented through compilers (translators which generate machine code from source code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code, where no translation takes place).\n** [[General-purpose programming language]] \u2014 programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains.\n** [[Intermediate language]] \u2014 language of an abstract machine designed to aid in the analysis of computer programs. The term comes from their use in compilers, where a compiler first translates the source code of a program into a form more suitable for code-improving transformations, as an intermediate step before generating object or machine code for a target machine.\n** [[Object-oriented programming|Object-oriented programming language]] &ndash; programming language based on \"objects\", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, known as methods. An object's procedures can access and modify the data fields of the objects. In object-oriented programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.\n** [[Type system#Static typing|Statically typed programming language]]\n\n== General C++ concepts ==\n<!-- Place the terms below into more appropriate sections, creating new sections as needed.-->\n* [[Name resolution (programming languages)|Name resolution]]\n** [[Argument-dependent name lookup]] \u2014 applies to the lookup of an unqualified function name depending on the types of the arguments given to the function call. This behavior is also known as Koenig lookup, named after its inventor Andrew Koenig.\n* [[Auto-linking]] \u2014 mechanism for automatically determining which libraries to link to while building a C or C++ program. It is activated by means of <code>#pragma comment(lib, <name>)</code> statements in the header files of the library.\n* [[C++ classes|Classes]] \u2014 Classes define types of data structures and the functions that operate on those data structures. Instances of these datatypes are known as objects and can contain member variables, constants, member functions, and overloaded operators defined by the programmer.

The popular media site [[IGN]] named it their fifth \"Most Awesome Cover\" in a top 25 countdown on their website.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/27/top-25-tuesday-most-awesome-covers?page=5 Top 25 Countdown]</ref> The advertising company responsible for the box art later admitted that they had deliberately chosen this theme in order to attract the customer with something original, considering there were many space shooters in the market that looked alike.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Phalanx Factor|journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly|date=September 2001}}</ref> The Game Boy Advance release redesigned the cover in favor of a prominent spaceship image.\n\nA \"mini\" version called ''Tiny Phalanx'' was featured in the 1995 fighting game ''[[Zero Divide]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Phalanx - The Enforce Fighter A-144000.png|thumb|left|''Phalanx's first stage'']]\n\nThe player's ship can switch to different three speed levels at any time, allowing the player to move fast to avoid enemies and obstacles entirely, or slow down to weave between enemy bullets. An unusual addition for a shooter at the time is the ability for the player's ship to take multiple hits before losing a life: the Phalanx had three hit points which could be restored by a certain power-up, which is important as health is persistent between levels. A variety of [[weapon]]s can be picked up from items that certain enemies leave behind, and up to three can be stored at a time; further weapons replace the currently-equipped weapon when acquired. The player can switch between these weapons freely, and sacrifice a weapon to produce a \"[[Precision-guided munition|smart bomb]]\" effect, freeing up the slot to grab another weapon without waste. The Extend was set at every 300,000 points. Difficulty can be adjusted between three levels in the options menu (unavailable during play), and primarily affects the number of bullets fired by enemies; a hidden \"Funny\" difficulty is available through the use of cheat codes, and escalates the game's difficulty dramatically.\n\n=== Weapons and Items ===\n'''L''' \u2013 Laser: Equips the ship with two stationary options, respectively above and below the ship, while changing the ship's attack to a piercing laser beam. Successive upgrades cause the options to fire beams as well, fore and aft, while increasing the beams' power. Its Smart Bomb attack causes the ship to spin rapidly, firing powerful bullets outward in a spiral pattern, while rendering the ship invulnerable.\n\n'''H''' \u2013 Homing: Equips the ship with two options which orbit clockwise around the ship, while changing the ship's main weapon to a homing ball of energy. Upgrading causes the options to fire their own homing balls, and increases their power. Its Smart Bomb attack is a ball of energy that surrounds the ship, negating all damage and causing heavy damage to any enemy touched by the energy field.\n\n'''E''' \u2013 Energizer: A charge weapon which fires energy bolts; charging increases the size and number of bolts fired; upgrades improve the maximum charge level. Its Smart Bomb attack is a full-screen antimatter reaction which causes continual damage to all visible enemies.\n\n'''R''' \u2013 Ricochet: Equips the ship with two options which orbit the ship in opposing directions, while changing the ship's attack to a green ball of energy. Upgrading causes the options to fire similar balls of energy forward diagonally up and down, which bounce off flat walls or ceilings, and increases overall damage. Its Smart Bomb attack combines the two options into a single homing drone which engages enemies at melee range, killing them before seeking a new target. Unlike other Smart Bomb attacks, the ship remains vulnerable during this attack; additionally, the drone will frequently seek out invulnerable portions of enemies to attack, reducing its usefulness against bosses.\n\n'''A''' \u2013 A-Type Missile: A standard side-weapon which launches homing missiles that detonate on impact.\n\n'''B''' \u2013 B-Type Missile: A standard side-weapon which launches forward firing rockets that do not detonate, and damage all enemies along their path.\n\n'''C''' \u2013 C-Type Missile: A standard side-weapon which launches guided missiles, mimicking the A-144's vertical movement as they fly forward, that detonate on impact.\n\n'''P''' \u2013 Power-Capsule: The game's combination healing and weapon enhancement power-up; simultaneously upgrades weapons systems by one level, and heals one point of ship health.\n\n== Plot ==\nTaking place in the year 2279, a planetary research project is sent into the depths of space. One particular group of researchers lands on and partly colonizes the alien planet Delia. However, sometime after their stay, an emergency transmission is sent from Delia to their security force orbiting the planet. The only clue they are given is a message regarding a hazardous leak. The planet's space fighters had become possessed by an unknown space squadron of alien [[bioship]]s that appear out of nowhere and soon make themselves a hostile threat among the possessed fighters. The player assumes the role of Wink Baulfield (named Rick in the Game Boy Advance version), an ace pilot assigned to investigate the disaster and possibly discover what is invading Delia in the assignment Operation Climax in the experimental space fighter the A/144 Phalanx.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Box art ===\nPhalanx's unusual SNES [[box art]], featuring an elderly man (Bertil Valley) playing a banjo has been cited in examples of bizarre video game box art.
