Former Warner cartoon director [[Bob Clampett]] was hired to catalog the Warner cartoon library.\n\n==Film archive==\nIn 1969, the United Artists Corporation presented to the [[Library of Congress]] the earliest surviving preprint material from the pre-1950 film library of Warner Bros. (including [[First National Pictures|First National]] library). The collection contains 200 silent features (1918\u201329), 800 sound features (1926\u201350), 1,800 sound shorts (1926\u201348), and 337 ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts (1931\u201348). While consisting largely of Warner Bros. releases, the collection includes nearly two hundred sound features released by Monogram Pictures Corporation between 1936 and 1946 and 231 ''Popeye'' cartoons produced by [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Famous Studios]] released between 1933 and 1957. Most motion pictures exist in the original black-and-white/Technicolor camera negatives. The Library is converting the nitrate film to safety stock and has obtained reference prints for seventy of the better known Warner Bros. features, such as ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'' (1935), ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' (1941), ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'' (1932), ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), and ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1930). There are no [[United Artists]] films (such as ''[[James Bond]]'' and ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' franchise; these are owned by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]) in the United Artists Collection.

Additional prints have been added to the collection, ranging from \"reject fine grain master positives\" (copies made for preservation but deemed inadequate) suitable for reference use, to high-quality 35mm prints reserved for theatrical projection.

United Artists has passed through various hands, but current ownership of this material resides with Turner Entertainment Co.\n\n==Ownership of properties==\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] purchased United Artists (along with the a.a.p. library) from [[Transamerica Corporation]] in 1981 and became [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer#MGM/UA Entertainment|MGM/UA Entertainment Co.]]\n\nThe rights to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1948 film  ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', originally distributed by Warner Bros. (with MGM) and later copyrighted by UATV, reverted to the director in 1968. Distribution rights were later acquired by [[Universal Pictures]] in 1983.\n\n[[Turner Broadcasting System]] (via [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]]) took over the library in 1986 after [[Ted Turner]]'s short-lived ownership of MGM/UA. When Turner sold back the MGM/UA production unit, he kept the MGM library, including select portions of the a.a.p. library (limited to the Warner Bros. films and the ''Popeye'' cartoons), for his own company. The 1936-1946 Monogram films were not included with the purchase, and thus some of these films remain with MGM.\n\nThe Warner Bros. film libraries were reunited when [[Time Warner]], the studio's parent company since the 1990 merger of [[Time Inc.]] and [[Warner Communications]] (formerly [[Kinney National Company]]), bought Turner in 1996. Turner retains the copyrights to the former a.a.p. properties, while Warner handles their distribution.\n\nUA originally leased video rights to their library (including the a.a.p. library) to [[Magnetic Video]], the first home video company. Magnetic Video was sold to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1982, becoming 20th Century-Fox Video. In 1982, Fox and [[CBS]] formed [[CBS/Fox Video]], which continued to distribute the UA/a.a.p. library under license from [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] until the rights reverted to MGM/UA. After Turner's purchase of the MGM/UA library, MGM/UA Home Video continued to distribute the films on video under license until 1999, when the rights were transferred to [[Warner Home Video]]. Laboratory in Brooklyn to Consolidated Labs in N.J. thus avoiding the New York sales tax on the purchase. Subsequently the negatives were split up between several labs in the NY area including DuArt, Mercury, Deluxe and CFI. Each lab made new acetate 16mm internegatives and re-recorded sound tracks. Some of the color films were in Technicolor and, as was Technicolor's policy, they held the 3 color negatives and mage prints. TV stations used 16mm prints for their telecasting and each lab made the prints for the titles they held.\n\nThese same prints would be the ones used on pre-1999 VHS and laserdisc releases of former a.a.p.-owned films. The a.a.p. versions of these films were also later used for cable television broadcasts (even as recently as March 2011, a.a.p. prints of WB cartoons have been seen on TV). Early releases of WB films released between 1918\u20131931 bore an a.a.p. copyright renewal notice, since these renewals came before the UA purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/v-title-database/lone/little-caesar-rca-2.html|title=Little Caesar : RCA&#93; {76476034122} U - Side 2 - CED Title - Blu-ray DVD Movie Precursor|publisher=Cedmagic.com|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, Turner began removing the a.a.p. logos from many of the films (although this process started before that by both UA and local television stations). One hundred twenty-three of the Warner Bros. cartoons purchased by a.a.p. were restored from their original negatives for inclusion in Warner Home Video's series of six ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'' DVD box sets. Several more WB cartoons formerly owned by a.a.p. have been restored for other ''Looney Tunes'' DVD releases since 2010. The black and white ''Popeye'' cartoons (and the three ''Color Specials'') were also restored from their original negatives for a series of three ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' DVD sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/popeye-dvd|title=Popeye DVD|publisher=Cartoon Brew|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=August 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209130353/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/popeye-dvd-2993.html|archivedate=2014-12-09|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Subsidiaries==\n*a.a.p.

United Artists has passed through various hands, but current ownership of this material resides with Turner Entertainment Co.\n\n==Ownership of properties==\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] purchased United Artists (along with the a.a.p. library) from [[Transamerica Corporation]] in 1981 and became [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer#MGM/UA Entertainment|MGM/UA Entertainment Co.]]\n\nThe rights to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1948 film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', originally distributed by Warner Bros. (with MGM) and later copyrighted by UATV, reverted to the director in 1968. Distribution rights were later acquired by [[Universal Pictures]] in 1983.\n\n[[Turner Broadcasting System]] (via [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]]) took over the library in 1986 after [[Ted Turner]]'s short-lived ownership of MGM/UA. When Turner sold back the MGM/UA production unit, he kept the MGM library, including select portions of the a.a.p. library (limited to the Warner Bros. films and the ''Popeye'' cartoons), for his own company. The 1936\u20131946 Monogram films were not included with the purchase, and thus some of these films remain with MGM.\n\nThe Warner Bros. film libraries were reunited when Time Warner (now [[WarnerMedia]]), the studio's parent company since the 1990 merger of [[Time Inc.]] and [[Warner Communications]] (formerly [[Kinney National Company]]), bought Turner in 1996. Turner remains the copyright owner in name only to the former Associated Artists Productions properties, while WarnerMedia handles their distribution.\n\nUA originally leased video rights to their library (including the a.a.p. library) to [[Magnetic Video]], the first home video company. Magnetic Video was sold to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1982, becoming 20th Century-Fox Video. In 1982, Fox and [[CBS]] formed [[CBS/Fox Video]], which continued to distribute the UA/a.a.p. library under license from [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] until the rights reverted to MGM/UA. After Turner's purchase of the MGM/UA library, MGM/UA Home Video continued to distribute the films on video under license until 1999. MGM/UA paid Time Warner US$225 million to end their contract of distributing the Associated Artists Productions library early.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-mar-16-fi-17731-story.html|title=MGM Buys Its Way Out of Pact for $225 Million|last=Bates|first=James|access-date=7 January 2019}}</ref> The rights to distribute were then transferred to [[Warner Home Video]] in 2000. Laboratory in Brooklyn to Consolidated Labs in N.J. thus avoiding the New York sales tax on the purchase. Subsequently the negatives were split up between several labs in the NY area including DuArt, Mercury, Deluxe and CFI. Each lab made new acetate 16mm internegatives and re-recorded sound tracks. Some of the color films were in Technicolor and, as was Technicolor's policy, they held the 3 color negatives and mage prints. TV stations used 16mm prints for their telecasting and each lab made the prints for the titles they held.\n\nThese same prints would be the ones used on pre-1999 VHS and laserdisc releases of former a.a.p.-owned films. The a.a.p. versions of these films were also later used for cable television broadcasts (even as recently as March 2011, a.a.p. prints of WB cartoons have been seen on TV). Early releases of WB films released between 1918\u20131931 bore an a.a.p. copyright renewal notice, since these renewals came before the UA purchase, however those copyrights have since been reassigned to Turner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/v-title-database/lone/little-caesar-rca-2.html|title=Little Caesar : RCA&#93; {76476034122} U - Side 2 - CED Title - Blu-ray DVD Movie Precursor|publisher=Cedmagic.com|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Turner began removing the a.a.p. logos from many of the films (although this process started before that by both UA and local television stations). With the a.a.p. logos being removed, Turner also began creating \"dubbed versions\" that same year, which are available in American and European formats and most had altered ending cards and color borders in the opening titles for the print given, which they kept, for the [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons. These \"dubbed\" prints attempted to make the material look better with whatever prints they had access to, though some ended up looking worse. One hundred twenty-three of the Warner Bros. cartoons purchased by a.a.p. were restored from their original negatives for inclusion in Warner Home Video's series of six ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'' DVD box sets. Several more WB cartoons formerly owned by a.a.p. have been restored for other ''Looney Tunes'' DVD releases since 2010. The black and white ''Popeye'' cartoons (and the three ''Color Specials'') were also restored from their original negatives for a series of three ''[[Popeye the Sailor (film series)|Popeye the Sailor]]'' DVD sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/popeye-dvd|title=Popeye DVD|publisher=Cartoon Brew|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=August 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209130353/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/popeye-dvd-2993.html|archivedate=December 9, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Subsidiaries==\n* a.a.p.

Dominant also sold and/or leased 16mm prints of WB library titles to non-theatrical rental libraries. The subsidiary was later folded into UA's main theatrical distribution arm after the company was sold to UA.
