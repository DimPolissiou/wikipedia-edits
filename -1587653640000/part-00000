He named his nephew [[Scipione Borghese]] as a cardinal (continuing the trend of nepotism) and also named [[Pope Gregory XV|Alessandro Ludovisi]], who would become his immediate successor, Pope Gregory XV, as a cardinal.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n[[File:0 Armoiries Paul V - Mosa\u00efque d\u00f4me St-Pierre - Vatican.JPG|thumb|Mosaic depicting the arms of [[:w:Paulus V|Pope Paulus V (Camillo Borghese)]]]]\n\n====Ecclesiastical jurisdiction====\nPaul's insistence of ecclesiastical jurisdiction led to a number of quarrels between the Church and the secular governments of various states, notably [[Venice]], where patricians, such as Ermolao Barbaro (1548\u20131622) of the noble [[Barbaro family]], argued in favor of the exemption of the clergy from the jurisdiction of the civil courts. Venice passed two laws obnoxious to Paul, one forbidding the alienation of real estate in favour of the clergy, the second demanding approval of the civil power for the building of new churches (in essence, a Venetian stance that the powers of the church must remain separate from those of the state). Two priests charged by the Venetian state with cruelty, wholesale poisoning, murder and licentiousness, were arrested by the Senate and put in dungeons for trial.  Having been found guilty, they were committed to prison.\n\nPaul V insisted that they be released to the Church.  He demanded the release of the priests as not being amenable to the secular law. When this was refused, the Pope threatened an interdict on account of the property laws and the imprisonment of ecclesiastics, which threat was presented to the Senate on Christmas 1605.  The Venetian position was ably defended by a canon lawyer, [[Paolo Sarpi]], who extended the matter to general principles defining separate secular and ecclesiastical spheres. In April 1606 the Pope [[excommunication|excommunicated]] the entire government of Venice and placed an [[interdict]] on the city.  Father Sarpi strongly advised the Venetian government to refuse to receive the Pope's interdict, and to reason with him while opposing force by force. The Venetian Senate willingly accepted this advice and Fra Paolo presented the case to Paul V, urging from history that the Pope's claim to intermeddle in civil matters was a usurpation; and that in these matters the Republic of Venice recognized no authority but that of God. The rest of the Catholic clergy sided with the city, with the exception of the [[Jesuits]], the [[Theatines]], and the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]].  The dissenting clergy were forthwith expelled from Venetian territories. [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es continued to be said in Venice, and the feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] was celebrated with displays of public pomp and \"magnificence\", in defiance of the Pope. Within a year (March 1607) the disagreement was mediated by [[France]] and [[Spain]]. The [[Republic of Venice|Most Serene Republic]] refused to retract the laws, but asserted that Venice would conduct herself \"with her ''accustomed piety''.\"  The Jesuits, which Venice considered subversive Papal agents, remained banned. No more could be expected. Paul withdrew his censure.\n\nThe Venetian Republic rewarded Fra Paulo Sarpi, its successful canon lawyer, with the distinction of state counsellor in jurisprudence and the liberty of access to the state archives, which infuriated Pope Paul.  In September 1607, after unsuccessfully attempting to lure Father Sarpi to Rome, the Pope responded by putting out a contract on his life.<ref name=\"ROB\">Robertson, Alexander, ''Fra Paolo Sarpi: the Greatest of the Venetians'', London: Sampson, Low, Marston & Co.

During this time, he opted for other titular churches like [[San Crisogono]] and [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome|Santi Giovanni e Paolo]].\n\nClement VIII also bestowed upon him [[episcopal consecration]] in 1597 after his appointment as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Iesi|Bishop of Iesi]]; the co-consecrators were Cardinal Silvio Savelli (former Latin Patriarch of Constantinople) and Cardinal Francesco Cornaro (former Bishop of Treviso).<ref>Charles Bransom, Jr., \"The Episcopal Lineage of Pope Clement X & Pope Paul V,\" [http://apostolicsuccession-episcopallineages.blogspot.com/p/theepiscopal-lineage-of-pope-clement-x.html Apostolic Succession & Episcopal Lineages in the Roman Catholic Church (blog)], retrieved: 14 September 2018.</ref>  Bishop Borghese retained the diocese of Iesi until 1599.\n\n==Papacy==\n\n===Election===\n{{main|Papal conclave, May 1605}}\nWhen [[Pope Leo XI]] died, 1605, Cardinal Borghese became pope over a number of candidates including [[Caesar Baronius]] and [[Robert Bellarmine|Roberto Cardinal Bellarmine]]; his neutrality in the factional times made him an ideal compromise candidate. In character he was very stern and unyielding, a lawyer rather than diplomat, who defended the privileges of the Church to his utmost. His first act was to send home to their [[diocese|see]]s the bishops who were sojourning in Rome, for the [[Council of Trent]] had insisted that every bishop reside in his diocese.<ref name=Loughlin/>  Soon after his accession as Pope Paul V, Borghese determined to humiliate Venice, as his predecessor had done, for attempting to preserve its independence from the papacy in the administration of its government.\n\n{{Infobox popestyles|\n|image      = C o a Paulo V.svg\n|dipstyle   = His Holiness\n|offstyle   = Your Holiness\n|relstyle   = Holy Father\n|deathstyle = None\n}}\n\n===Theology===\nPaul met with [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1616 after Cardinal Bellarmine had, on his orders, warned Galileo not to hold or defend the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] ideas of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]].

He named his nephew [[Scipione Borghese]] as a cardinal (continuing the trend of nepotism) and also named [[Pope Gregory XV|Alessandro Ludovisi]], who would become his immediate successor, Pope Gregory XV, as a cardinal.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n[[File:0 Armoiries Paul V - Mosa\u00efque d\u00f4me St-Pierre - Vatican.JPG|thumb|Mosaic depicting the arms of [[:w:Paulus V|Pope Paulus V (Camillo Borghese)]]]]\n\n====Ecclesiastical jurisdiction====\nPaul's insistence of ecclesiastical jurisdiction led to a number of quarrels between the Church and the secular governments of various states, notably [[Venice]], where patricians, such as Ermolao Barbaro (1548\u20131622) of the noble [[Barbaro family]], argued in favor of the exemption of the clergy from the jurisdiction of the civil courts. Venice passed two laws obnoxious to Paul, one forbidding the alienation of real estate in favour of the clergy, the second demanding approval of the civil power for the building of new churches (in essence, a Venetian stance that the powers of the church must remain separate from those of the state). Two priests charged by the Venetian state with cruelty, wholesale poisoning, murder and licentiousness, were arrested by the Senate and put in dungeons for trial.  Having been found guilty, they were committed to prison.\n\nPaul V insisted that they be released to the Church.  He demanded the release of the priests as not being amenable to the secular law. When this was refused, the Pope threatened an interdict on account of the property laws and the imprisonment of ecclesiastics, which threat was presented to the Senate on Christmas 1605.  The Venetian position was ably defended by a canon lawyer, [[Paolo Sarpi]], who extended the matter to general principles defining separate secular and ecclesiastical spheres. In April 1606 the Pope [[excommunication|excommunicated]] the entire government of Venice and placed an [[interdict]] on the city.  Father Sarpi strongly advised the Venetian government to refuse to receive the Pope's interdict, and to reason with him while opposing force by force. The Venetian Senate willingly accepted this advice and Fra Paolo presented the case to Paul V, urging from history that the Pope's claim to intermeddle in civil matters was a usurpation; and that in these matters the Republic of Venice recognized no authority but that of God. The rest of the Catholic clergy sided with the city, with the exception of the [[Jesuits]], the [[Theatines]], and the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]].  The dissenting clergy were forthwith expelled from Venetian territories. [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]es continued to be said in Venice, and the feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] was celebrated with displays of public pomp and \"magnificence\", in defiance of the Pope. Within a year (March 1607) the disagreement was mediated by [[France]] and [[Spain]]. The [[Republic of Venice|Most Serene Republic]] refused to retract the laws, but asserted that Venice would conduct herself \"with her ''accustomed piety''.\"  The Jesuits, which Venice considered subversive Papal agents, remained banned. No more could be expected. Paul withdrew his censure.\n\nThe Venetian Republic rewarded Fra Paulo Sarpi, its successful canon lawyer, with the distinction of state counsellor in jurisprudence and the liberty of access to the state archives, which infuriated Pope Paul.  In September 1607, after unsuccessfully attempting to lure Father Sarpi to Rome, the Pope responded by putting out a contract on his life.<ref name=\"ROB\">Robertson, Alexander, ''Fra Paolo Sarpi: the Greatest of the Venetians'', London: Sampson, Low, Marston & Co.

His letter of 9 July 1606 to congratulate [[James I of England|James I]] on his accession to the throne was three years late and seemed to English eyes merely a preamble to what followed, and his reference to the [[Gunpowder Plot]], made against the life of the monarch and all the members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] the previous November, was unfortunate for the papal cause, for papal agents were considered by the English to have been involved (the effigy of Pope Paul V is still burnt every year during the [[Lewes Bonfire]] celebrations). However, the Pope in that letter pleaded with James not to make the innocent Catholics suffer for the crime of a few, and Paul V also promised to exhort all the Catholics of the realm to be submissive and loyal to their sovereign\u2014in all things not opposed to the honour of God.

This condemnation served only to divide English Catholics. The other irritant (to the papacy) in English relations was Cardinal Bellarmine's letter to the English archpriest [[George Blackwell]], reproaching him for having taken the oath of allegiance in apparent disregard of his duty to the Pope.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Wentworth Point is located 16 kilometres west of the [[Sydney central business district]], in the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of [[City of Parramatta]]. It is on the western shore of [[Homebush Bay]] on the southern side of the [[Parramatta River]].\n\n==History==\nThis suburb was once part of the suburb of Homebush Bay, named after [[Homebush Bay]], the bay with a natural and artificial shoreline on the southern side of the Parramatta River. Homebush Bay is itself named after the nearby estate and suburb of [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]], established in the 1800s by the colonies assistant surgeon [[D'Arcy Wentworth]].<ref>''The Book of Sydney Suburbs'', Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia {{ISBN|0-207-14495-8}}, page 124</ref> According to local government historian Michael Jones, \"Wentworth is popularly credited with having called the area after his 'home in the bush', although Homebush is also a place in [[Kent]].\" <ref>Jones, Michael (1985). ''Oasis in the West: Strathfield's first hundred years.'' North Sydney: Allen & Unwin Australia. {{ISBN|0-86861-407-6}}, page 15</ref>\n\nThe northern part of the peninsula had been named Wentworth Point and gazetted in 1976.<ref>{{NSW GNR|id=SXckWytLIt|title=Wentworth Point|accessdate=}}</ref> \nThe waterfront residential area was renamed as the suburb of Wentworth Point on 2 October 2009<ref>http://www.auburn.nsw.gov.au/page.aspx?id=3946</ref><ref>{{NSW GNR|id=MnIOlMUlMa|title=Wentworth Point|accessdate=}}</ref> after the former [[City of Auburn|Auburn Council]] sought public comment on a proposal to rename the suburb of Homebush Bay, to remove confusion with its namesake (but separate) suburb of [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]]. The area encompassing [[Sydney Olympic Park]] was given autonomy as a suburb. The Carter Street industrial precinct was absorbed by the neighbouring suburb of [[Lidcombe, New South Wales|Lidcombe]], and therefore the suburb of Homebush Bay ceased to exist.\n\n===Industrial and commercial usage===\nAfter much of the area was reclaimed from Homebush Bay, Wentworth Point was used for a variety of industrial uses.\n\nNotable businesses include Ralph Symonds, a plywood manufacturer, which used the river as a transport route for large logs, which were then moored in Homebush Bay while awaiting processing. Other activities have included McPhee Transport depot, the former Head Office and warehouse space for Hyundai Australia and a transmission tower for Sydney radio station 2GB.\n\nde Havilland Marine (Large Craft) was located on the waters edge at Homebush Bay. Due to a lack of new business it closed its doors in 1982. In the years prior it manufactured various large aluminium craft for both the local and international market.

Wentworth Point is located 16 kilometres west of the [[Sydney central business district]], in the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of [[City of Parramatta]]. It is on the western shore of [[Homebush Bay]] on the southern side of the [[Parramatta River]].\n\n==History==\nThis suburb was once part of the suburb of Homebush Bay, named after [[Homebush Bay]], the bay with a natural and artificial shoreline on the southern side of the Parramatta River. Homebush Bay is itself named after the nearby estate and suburb of [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]], established in the 1800s by the colonies assistant surgeon [[D'Arcy Wentworth]].<ref>''The Book of Sydney Suburbs'', Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia {{ISBN|0-207-14495-8}}, page 124</ref> According to local government historian Michael Jones, \"Wentworth is popularly credited with having called the area after his 'home in the bush', although Homebush is also a place in [[Kent]].\" <ref>Jones, Michael (1985). ''Oasis in the West: Strathfield's first hundred years.'' North Sydney: Allen & Unwin Australia. {{ISBN|0-86861-407-6}}, page 15</ref>\n\nThe northern part of the peninsula had been named Wentworth Point and gazetted in 1976.<ref>{{NSW GNR|id=SXckWytLIt|title=Wentworth Point|accessdate=}}</ref> \nThe waterfront residential area was renamed as the suburb of Wentworth Point on 2 October 2009<ref>http://www.auburn.nsw.gov.au/page.aspx?id=3946</ref><ref>{{NSW GNR|id=MnIOlMUlMa|title=Wentworth Point|accessdate=}}</ref> after the former [[City of Auburn|Auburn Council]] sought public comment on a proposal to rename the suburb of Homebush Bay, to remove confusion with its namesake (but separate) suburb of [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]]. The area encompassing [[Sydney Olympic Park]] was given autonomy as a suburb. The Carter Street industrial precinct was absorbed by the neighbouring suburb of [[Lidcombe, New South Wales|Lidcombe]], and therefore the suburb of Homebush Bay ceased to exist.\n\n===Industrial and commercial usage===\nAfter much of the area was reclaimed from Homebush Bay, Wentworth Point was used for a variety of industrial uses.\n\nNotable businesses include Ralph Symonds, a plywood manufacturer, which used the river as a transport route for large logs, which were then moored in Homebush Bay while awaiting processing. Other activities have included McPhee Transport depot, the former Head Office and warehouse space for Hyundai Australia and a transmission tower for Sydney radio station 2GB.\n\nde Havilland Marine (Large Craft) was located on the waters edge at Homebush Bay. Due to a lack of new business it closed its doors in 1982. In the years prior it manufactured various large aluminium craft for both the local and international market. These included Carpentaria Class Patrol Boats for Burma & the Solomon Islands, Titan Work Boats for the New South Wales government, and the hulls of the Nepean Bell which still operates on the Nepean River in NSW.\n\n===Residential development===\nPrior to the move of the Royal Agricultural Society showgrounds from Moore Park to Homebush (as the area of Sydney Olympic Park was then known), much of Wentworth Point was bought by Payce Consolidated Limited.
