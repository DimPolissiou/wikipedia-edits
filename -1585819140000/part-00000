The bridge carried the [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]] from December 1961 until November 2017, when it was replaced by the (new) Hastings River Bridge, a [[concrete bridge|concrete road bridge]].<ref name=\"PMN20171117\"/> The Dennis Bridge is managed by the [[Port Macquarie-Hastings Council]].<ref name=\"PMN20171221\">{{cite news|last1=Daniels|first1=Peter|title=Highway bypass: who gets the old road, bridges infrastructure? |url=https://www.portnews.com.au/story/5134291/council-distances-itself-from-bridges-handover|accessdate=24 March 2020|work=Port Macquarie News|date=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Dennis Bridge was opened in December 1961 as part of a project to replace the Blackmans Point ferry across the Hastings River and to bypass Port Macquarie. As well as the Dennis Bridge, this project included a {{convert|10|km|mi|0|adj=on}} deviation of the Pacific Highway and a {{convert|3|km|mi|0|adj=on|spell=on}} connecting road from the old to the new highway route, Hastings River Drive.<ref>''Main Roads Journal'', Vol. 27, p. 80.</ref>\n\nThe bridge was named after [[Department of Main Roads (New South Wales)|Department of Main Roads]] engineer Spencer Dennis, and is one of a series of steel truss bridges of standardised design erected by the then-Department of Main Roads in the 1950s and 1960s, predominantly across the wide coastal rivers of New South Wales.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Denis Bridge Port Macquarie.png|thumb|Approaches to the Dennis Bridge in 2018]]\nThe Dennis Bridge has a total length of {{convert|468|m|ft|0}}, and consists of six {{convert|37|m|ft|0|adj=on}} truss spans and one {{convert|25.6|m|ft|0|adj=on}} truss span, as well as ten steel plate girder approach spans.

It began among the Turcoman tribes of the [[Taurus mountains]], before spreading to a wide variety of disgruntled groups.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Christine Woodhead|title=The Ottoman World|date=15 Dec 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136498947|page=94}}</ref> It is named after the leader of the rebels, [[\u015eahkulu]]. His death in battle also meant the end of the uprising.\n{{Alevism|Alevi history}}\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Safavid dynasty]] was consolidated and founded by [[Ismail I]] in the early 16th century. Ismail, being a champion of [[Shiite]] faith and partially a [[Oghuz Turk|Turkmen]], was also sympathetic to the Turkmens of Ottoman Empire. \n\nThe [[Qizilbash]], Anatolian adherents to the [[Safavid order]], held a strong presence across [[Anatolia]] from the late 15th century to the mid-16th century, and assumed a central role in the \u015eahkulu rebellion. In the decades preceding the events of the rebellion, due to the fluid religious character of the region, the primarily [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Ottoman state demonstrated a notable tolerance towards [[Shia Islam]]. However, beginning in the early 16th century, this tolerance began to recede; according to official Ottoman terminology from the period, a [[Qizilbash]] was a rebel heretic suspected of illicit relationships with the Safavids<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Zarinebaf-Shahr|first=Fariba|date=1997|title=Q\u0131z\u0131lbash \"Heresy\" and Rebellion in Ottoman Anatolia During the Sixteenth Century|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/anatm_1297-8094_1997_num_7_1_946|journal=Anatolia Moderna. Yeni Anadolu|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1\u201315|doi=10.3406/anatm.1997.946}}</ref>. Some ascribe this receding tolerance to the decline of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] coupled with the emerging socio-political legitimacy of the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid empire]]<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nThough the revolt was incited by \u015eahkulu among the Qizilbash, numbered among the eventual participants were various non-Qizilbash groups, such as former [[Sipahi|sipahis]], dispossessed Gazis, and other [[Turkmens|Turcomen]] peoples<ref>{{Cite book|last=Somel, Sel\u00e7uk Aksin, Auteur.|title=Historical dictionary of the Ottoman Empire|date=2012|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7168-7|oclc=819159189}}</ref>. This decrease in tolerance contributed in part to the malcontent of the Turcomen tribes in Anatolia towards the Ottoman State. Their refusal to pay state taxes, settle down, and accept Ottoman central control pushed these Turcomen tribes towards a more militant form of Shi\u2019ism<ref name=\":0\" />. This same malcontent would lead to multiple uprisings in Eastern Anatolia headed by tribal leaders.\n\nBeing inspired by Safavid missionaries, the Turkmens living on Ottoman soil, \"as far west as [[Konya]]\", were mobilized in a \"fervent messianic movement\", led by \u015eahkulu.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} \u015eahkulu and his followers tried to \"replicate\" the same type of revolt led by [[Ismail I]] several years earlier, \"perhaps in anticipation of a union with the Safavids\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} \nIsmail I's activities did not escape the attention of the Ottomans, but the Ottoman Empire was too preoccupied with the oncoming period of interregnum during the last years of the crippled sultan [[Bayezid II]]. Thus Ismail was able to gain many supporters among Ottoman subjects. One such supporter was ''\u015eahkulu'' (meaning ''\"servant of the [[shah]]\"''), a member of the Turkmen Tekkelu tribe.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}}\n\n== Course of events ==\nDuring the early days of interregnum, [[\u015eehzade Korkut|Korkut]], one of the princes ({{lang-tr|\u015eehzade}}), was travelling from Antalya to [[Manisa]] to be closer to capital. \u015eahkulu raided his caravan and robbed the treasury. Then he began attacking the towns and killing the government officers in the towns. He also raided [[Ala\u015fehir]] to seize a part of royal treasure. Only then, an Ottoman force under [[Karag\u00f6z Ahmet Pasha]], the [[beylerbey]] of [[Anatolia|Anadolu]]  was sent to check his activities. But \u015eahkulu defeated the forces of Ahmet Pasha and executed him. This increased the fame and the prestige of \u015eahkulu. To his partisans, after raiding a royal caravan and killing a high-ranking Ottoman statesman, he was invincible. A second army was sent after him. The commanders of the army were [[\u015eehzade Ahmet]], one of the claimants to throne, and the grand vizier [[Had\u0131m Ali Pasha]]. They were able to corner \u015eahkulu near [[Alt\u0131nta\u015f]] (in modern [[K\u00fctahya Province]]), but instead of fighting, Ahmet tried to win over the Janissaries for his cause. Failing to achieve, he left the battlefield. \u015eahkulu saw his chance and escaped. Ali Pasha with a smaller force chased him, and clashed with him at \u00c7ubukova between [[Kayseri]] and [[Sivas]].<ref>Nicolae Jorga:'' Geschiste des Osmanichen vol II'', (trans: Nil\u00fcfer Ep\u00e7eli) Yeditepe Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, 2009, {{ISBN|975-6480-19-X}} ,p.217</ref> The battle was a draw, but both Ali Pasha and \u015eahkulu were killed (July 1511).<ref>Prof. Ya\u015far Y\u00fcce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''T\u00fcrkiye tarihi Cilt II'', AKDTYKTTK Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, \u0130stanbul, 1991 p 225-226</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\u015eahkulu's partisans were not defeated, but they had lost their leader. Many scattered, but after a third army was sent by the [[Ottoman Porte]], the most devoted escaped to Persia. During their escape they raided a caravan, and accidentally killed a well-known Persian scholar. Consequently, instead of showing them hospitality, Ismail executed them. Meanwhile, in Ottoman lands, Prince Ahmet's behavior in the battle caused reaction among the soldiers. Moreover, the death of Had\u0131m Ali, the chief partisan of Ahmet, provided an advantage to the youngest claimants to throne: the succession would ultimately fall to [[Selim I]], under whose reign the Ottoman state saw spectacular victories and doubled in area. Selim was also a very devoted [[Sunni]] and effectively checked Shiite activities in Ottoman lands after defeating Ismail in the [[battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514.\n\nBut the anxiety of the Ottomans, in relation to \"losing much of their Asian possessions was not eased\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} Nor did the hatred of the Ottomans for Ismail I cease to exist, even though Ismail apologized for the atrocities caused by the Turkmens and \"disowned\" \u015eahkulu.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}}\n\nAs the possibility existed of a \"mass Turkmen exodus into the Safavid realm\", [[Bayezid II]] sought to establish good relations with Ismail, \"at least on the surface, and welcomed Ismail's gestures to establish good neighborly relations\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} In letters sent to Ismail, Bayezid II addressed Ismail as \"heir to the kingdom of [[Kay Khosrow|Kaykhosrow]] \u2013 the legendary great king of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' \u2013 and to Dara ([[Darius I|Darius]]) of the [[Achaemenid Empire|ancient Persian Empire]]\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} [[Abbas Amanat]] adds: \"He further advised Ismail to behave royally, preserve his precious and strategically vital kingdom with justice and equanimity, end forced conversions, and leave in peace with his neighbors\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}}\n\nThe political environment which resulted from this revolt would lead the next Ottoman Sultan, [[Selim I]], to take violent measures against the Qizilbash and declare war on Iran<ref name=\":0\" />. Counted among these violent measures was the decree from Selim I to kill more than 40,000 Qizilbash, children and elderly included, in [[Rumelia]] and Anatolia prior to the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in March 1514<ref>Anonymous, \"Selimn\u00e2me,\" Topkapi Sarayi Library, Revan 1540, folio 10 a (Unpublished manuscript)</ref>. In undated letters from Selim I sent to [[Ismail I|Isma'il I]], estimated to have been written in 1514, Selim I wrote that \"it has been heard repeatedly that you have subjected the upright community of Muhammad to your devious will\" and expounded upon his plans to \"crown the head of every gallows tree with a crown-wearing Sufi and clear the faction from the face of the earth\".\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book |last1=Amanat |first1=Abbas |authorlink1=Abbas Amanat |title=Iran: A Modern History |date=2017 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300231465|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = \u010c\u0100LDER\u0100N | last1 = McCaffrey | first1 = Michael J. | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/calderan-battle | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. IV, Fasc. 6 | pages = 656\u2013658 | location = | publisher = | year = 1990 | isbn = |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = ESM\u0100\u02bf\u012aL I \u1e62AFAW\u012a | last1 = Savory | first1 = Roger | authorlink1 = Roger Savory | last2 = Karamustafa | first2 = Ahmet T. | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/esmail-i-safawi | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. VIII, Fasc. 6 | pages = 628\u2013636 | location = | publisher = | year = 1998 | isbn = |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Savory|first1=Roger|title=Iran Under the Safavids|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521042512|page=40|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Rebellions in the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sahkulu Rebellion}}\n[[Category:Rebellions against the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1511]]\n[[Category:16th-century rebellions]]\n[[Category:1511 in the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Safavid Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict= \u015eahkulu rebellion\n|partof=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|date= 1511\n|place=Anatolia\n|coordinates=\n| map_type    =\n| latitude    =\n| longitude   =\n| map_size    =\n| map_caption =\n| map_label   =\n| result      = Ottoman victory\n| status      =\n| combatant1  = Pro-Shia Rebels\n| combatant2  = {{flag|Ottoman Empire}}\n| commander1  = [[\u015eahkulu]]{{KIA}}\n| commander2  = {{flagicon|Ottoman Empire}} [[Karag\u00f6z Ahmet Pasha]]<br /> {{flagicon|Ottoman Empire}} [[Had\u0131m Ali Pasha]]{{KIA}}<br /> {{flagicon|Ottoman Empire}} [[\u015eehzade Ahmet]]\n| strength1   =\n| strength2   =\n| casualties1 =\n| casualties2 =\n| notes       =\n}}\nThe '''\u015eahkulu rebellion''' (9 April \u2013 2 July 1511){{citation needed|date=July 2011}} was a widespread pro-[[Shia]] and pro-[[Safavid]] uprising in [[Anatolia]], directed against the [[Ottoman Empire]], in 1511. It began among the Turcoman tribes of the [[Taurus mountains]], before spreading to a wide variety of disgruntled groups.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Christine Woodhead|title=The Ottoman World|date=15 Dec 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136498947|page=94}}</ref> It is named after the leader of the rebels, [[\u015eahkulu]]. His death in battle also meant the end of the uprising.\n{{Alevism|Alevi history}}\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Safavid dynasty]] was consolidated and founded by [[Ismail I]] in the early 16th century. Ismail, being a champion of [[Shiite]] faith and partially a [[Oghuz Turk|Turkmen]], was also sympathetic to the Turkmens of Ottoman Empire. \n\nThe [[Qizilbash]], Anatolian adherents to the [[Safavid order]], held a strong presence across [[Anatolia]] from the late 15th century to the mid-16th century, and assumed a central role in the \u015eahkulu rebellion. In the decades preceding the events of the rebellion, due to the fluid religious character of the region, the primarily [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Ottoman state demonstrated a notable tolerance towards [[Shia Islam]]. However, beginning in the early 16th century, this tolerance began to recede; according to official Ottoman terminology from the period, a [[Qizilbash]] was a rebel heretic suspected of illicit relationships with the Safavids<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Zarinebaf-Shahr|first=Fariba|date=1997|title=Q\u0131z\u0131lbash \"Heresy\" and Rebellion in Ottoman Anatolia During the Sixteenth Century|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/anatm_1297-8094_1997_num_7_1_946|journal=Anatolia Moderna. Yeni Anadolu|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1\u201315|doi=10.3406/anatm.1997.946}}</ref>. Some ascribe this receding tolerance to the decline of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] coupled with the emerging socio-political legitimacy of the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid empire]]<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nThough the revolt was incited by \u015eahkulu among the Qizilbash, numbered among the eventual participants were various non-Qizilbash groups, such as former [[Sipahi|sipahis]], dispossessed Gazis, and other [[Turkmens|Turcomen]] peoples<ref>{{Cite book|last=Somel, Sel\u00e7uk Aksin, Auteur.|title=Historical dictionary of the Ottoman Empire|date=2012|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7168-7|oclc=819159189}}</ref>. This decrease in tolerance contributed in part to the malcontent of the Turcomen tribes in Anatolia towards the Ottoman State. Their refusal to pay state taxes, settle down, and accept Ottoman central control pushed these Turcomen tribes towards a more militant form of Shi\u2019ism<ref name=\":0\" />. This same malcontent would lead to multiple uprisings in Eastern Anatolia headed by tribal leaders.\n\nBeing inspired by Safavid missionaries, the Turkmens living on Ottoman soil, \"as far west as [[Konya]]\", were mobilized in a \"fervent messianic movement\", led by \u015eahkulu.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} \u015eahkulu and his followers tried to \"replicate\" the same type of revolt led by [[Ismail I]] several years earlier, \"perhaps in anticipation of a union with the Safavids\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} \nIsmail I's activities did not escape the attention of the Ottomans, but the Ottoman Empire was too preoccupied with the oncoming period of interregnum during the last years of the crippled sultan [[Bayezid II]]. Thus Ismail was able to gain many supporters among Ottoman subjects. One such supporter was ''\u015eahkulu'' (meaning ''\"servant of the [[shah]]\"''), a member of the Turkmen Tekkelu tribe.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}}\n\n== Course of events ==\nDuring the early days of interregnum, [[\u015eehzade Korkut|Korkut]], one of the princes ({{lang-tr|\u015eehzade}}), was travelling from Antalya to [[Manisa]] to be closer to capital. \u015eahkulu raided his caravan and robbed the treasury. Then he began attacking the towns and killing the government officers in the towns. He also raided [[Ala\u015fehir]] to seize a part of royal treasure. Only then, an Ottoman force under [[Karag\u00f6z Ahmet Pasha]], the [[beylerbey]] of [[Anatolia|Anadolu]]  was sent to check his activities. But \u015eahkulu defeated the forces of Ahmet Pasha and executed him. This increased the fame and the prestige of \u015eahkulu. To his partisans, after raiding a royal caravan and killing a high-ranking Ottoman statesman, he was invincible. A second army was sent after him. The commanders of the army were [[\u015eehzade Ahmet]], one of the claimants to throne, and the grand vizier [[Had\u0131m Ali Pasha]]. They were able to corner \u015eahkulu near [[Alt\u0131nta\u015f]] (in modern [[K\u00fctahya Province]]), but instead of fighting, Ahmet tried to win over the Janissaries for his cause.

In addition, he unsuccessfully claimed the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish throne]] until 1064 and the [[List of English monarchs|English throne]] in 1066. Before becoming king, Harald had spent around fifteen years in exile as a [[mercenary]] and military commander in [[Kievan Rus']] and of the [[Varangian Guard]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nWhen he was fifteen years old, in 1030, Harald fought in the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] together with his half-brother [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf Haraldsson]] (later Saint Olaf). Olaf sought to reclaim the Norwegian throne, which he had lost to the Danish king [[Cnut the Great]] two years prior. In the battle, Olaf and Harald were defeated by forces loyal to Cnut, and Harald was forced into exile to Kievan Rus' (the sagas' {{lang|non|[[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]]}}). He thereafter spent some time in the army of Grand Prince [[Yaroslav the Wise]], eventually obtaining rank as a captain, until he moved on to [[Constantinople]] with his companions around 1034. In Constantinople, he soon rose to become the commander of the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]], and saw action on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in [[Asia Minor]], [[Sicily]], possibly in the [[Holy Land]], [[Bulgaria]] and in Constantinople itself, where he became involved in the imperial dynastic disputes. Harald amassed considerable wealth during his time in the Byzantine Empire, which he shipped to Yaroslav in Kievan Rus' for safekeeping. He finally left the Byzantines in 1042, and arrived back in Kievan Rus' in order to prepare his campaign of reclaiming the Norwegian throne. Possibly to Harald's knowledge, in his absence the Norwegian throne had been restored from the Danes to Olaf's illegitimate son [[Magnus the Good]].\n\nIn 1046, Harald joined forces with Magnus's rival in Denmark (Magnus had also become king of Denmark), the [[pretender]] [[Sweyn II of Denmark]], and started raiding the Danish coast. Magnus, unwilling to fight his uncle, agreed to share the kingship with Harald, since Harald in turn would share his wealth with him. The co-rule ended abruptly the next year as Magnus died, and Harald thus became the sole ruler of Norway. Domestically, Harald crushed all local and regional opposition, and outlined the territorial unification of Norway under a national governance. Harald's reign was probably one of relative peace and stability, and he instituted a viable coin economy and foreign trade. Probably seeking to restore Cnut's \"[[North Sea Empire]]\", Harald also claimed the Danish throne, and spent nearly every year until 1064 raiding the Danish coast and fighting his former ally, Sweyn. Although the campaigns were successful, he was never able to conquer Denmark.\n\nNot long after Harald had renounced his claim to Denmark, the former [[Earl of Northumbria]], [[Tostig Godwinson]], brother of the newly chosen (but reigning not for long) English king [[Harold Godwinson|Harold Godwinson (also known as Harold of Wessex)]], pledged his allegiance to Harald and invited him to claim the English throne. Harald went along and invaded Northern England with 10,000 troops and 300 longships in September 1066, raided the coast and defeated English regional forces of Northumbria and Mercia in the [[Battle of Fulford]] near [[York]]. Although initially successful, Harald was defeated and killed in an attack by Harold Godwinson's forces in the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], which wiped out almost his entire army. Modern historians have often considered Harald's death, which brought an end to his invasion, as the end of the [[Viking Age]].\n\n==Epithets==\nHarald's most famous epithet is Old Norse ''har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i'', which has been translated variously as 'hard in counsel', 'tyrannical',<ref>Cleasby, Richard and Gudbrand Vigfusson, ''An Icelandic-English Dictionary'', 2nd edn by William A.

On hearing news of Olaf's planned return, Harald gathered 600 men from the Uplands to meet Olaf and his men upon their arrival in the east of Norway. After a friendly welcome, Olaf went on to gather an army and eventually fight in the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] on 29 July 1030, in which Harald took part on his brother's side.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 17\u201318</ref> The battle was part of an attempt to restore Olaf to the Norwegian throne, which had been captured by the Danish king [[Cnut the Great]] ([[Canute]]). The battle resulted in defeat for the brothers at the hands of those Norwegians who were loyal to Cnut, and Olaf was killed while Harald was badly wounded.<ref name=\"BBp54\">Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) p. 54</ref> Harald was nonetheless remarked to have shown considerable military talent during the battle.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 25</ref>\n\n==Exile in the East==\n\n===To Kievan Rus'===\nAfter the defeat at the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald managed to escape with the aid of [[R\u00f6gnvald Brusason]] (later [[Earl of Orkney]]) to a remote farm in [[Eastern Norway]]. He stayed there for some time to heal his wounds, and thereafter (possibly up to a month later) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden. A year after the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald arrived in [[Kievan Rus']] (referred to in the sagas as ''[[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]]'' or ''Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0 hin mikla''). He likely spent at least part of his time in the town of [[Staraya Ladoga]] (''Aldeigjuborg''), arriving there in the first half of 1031. Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince [[Yaroslav the Wise]], whose wife [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter|Ingegerd]] was a distant relative of Harald.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 21\u201322</ref><ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 25\u201326</ref> Badly in need of military leaders, Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 26</ref> Harald's brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to [[Yaroslavl|Yaroslav]] following the revolt in 1028,<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 16</ref> and ''[[Morkinskinna]]'' says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 25</ref> Harald took part in Yaroslav's campaign against the [[Poles]] in 1031, and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the [[Chud]]es in [[Estonia]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], as well as the [[Pechenegs]] and other steppe nomad people.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 27</ref>\n\n===In Byzantine service===\nAfter a few years in Kievan Rus', Harald and his force of around 500 men<ref name=\"vikingerikrig284\"/> moved on south to [[Constantinople]] (''[[Miklagard]]''), the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (later known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]), probably in 1033 or 1034,<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 28</ref> where they joined the [[Varangian Guard]]. Although the ''[[Flateyjarb\u00f3k]]'' maintains that Harald at first sought to keep his royal identity a secret, most sources agree that Harald and his men's reputation was well known in the east at the time. While the Varangian Guard was primarily meant to function as the emperor's bodyguard, Harald was found fighting on \"nearly every frontier\" of the empire.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 29</ref> He first saw action in campaigns against [[Arab people|Arab]] pirates in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and then in inland towns in [[Asia Minor]] / [[Anatolia]] that had supported the pirates. By this time, he had according to Snorri Sturluson become the \"leader over all the Varangians\". By 1035, the Byzantines had pushed the Arabs out of Asia Minor to the east and southeast, and Harald took part in campaigns that went as far east as the [[Tigris River]] and [[Euphrates River]] in [[Mesopotamia]], where according to his [[skald]] (poet) [[\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr Arn\u00f3rsson]] (recounted in the sagas) he participated in the capture of eighty Arab strongholds, a number which historians [[Sigfus Bl\u00f6ndal]] and [[Benedikt Benedikz]] see no particular reason to question. Although not holding independent command of an army as the sagas imply, it is not unlikely that King Harald and the Varangians at times could have been sent off to capture a castle or town.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 29\u201330</ref><ref>Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) pp. 60\u201362</ref> During the first four years of the reign of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]], Harald probably also fought in campaigns against the [[Pechenegs]].<ref name=\"Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz 2007 p. 63\">Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) p. 63</ref>\n[[File:The body of Leo V is dragged to the Hippodrome through the Skyla Gate.jpg|thumb|Near-contemporary depiction of [[Byzantine]] [[Varangian]] Guardsmen, in an illumination from the [[John Skylitzes|Skylitzes Chronicle]].]]\n\nThereafter, Harald is reported in the sagas to have gone to [[Jerusalem]] and fought in battles in the area. Although the sagas place this after his expedition to [[Sicily]], historian [[Kelly DeVries]] has questioned that chronology.<ref name=\"DeVriesp30\">DeVries (1999) p. 30</ref> Whether his trip was of a military or peaceful nature would depend on whether it took place before or after the 1036 peace treaty between Michael IV and the [[Muslim]] [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]]<ref name=\"DeVriesp30\"/> (in reality the Caliph's mother, originally a Byzantine Christian, since the Caliph was a minor), although it is considered unlikely to have been made before. Modern historians have speculated that Harald may have been in a party sent to escort pilgrims to Jerusalem (possibly including members of the Imperial family) following the peace agreement, as it was also agreed that the Byzantines were allowed to repair the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. Furthermore, this may in turn have presented Harald with opportunities to fight against bandits who preyed on Christian pilgrims.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 30\u201331</ref><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 43</ref>\n\nIn 1038, Harald joined the Byzantines in their expedition to [[Sicily]],<ref name=\"DeVries 1999 p. 31\">DeVries (1999) p. 31</ref><ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn 2010 p. 47\">Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 47</ref> in [[George Maniakes]]'s (the sagas' \"Gyrge\") attempt to reconquer the island from the Muslim [[Saracen]]s, who had established the [[Emirate of Sicily]] on the island.

[[William of Malmesbury]] states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to [[Saxo Grammaticus]] he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor.<ref name=\"DeVries 1999 pp. 34\u201335\"/> The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape in the midst of the revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).<ref name=\"DVpp3538\">DeVries (1999) pp. 35\u201338</ref>\n\n===Back to Kievan Rus'===\n[[File:Elisiv of Kiev.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Harald's wife Elisiv of Kiev, daughter of Yaroslav the Wise]]\nHarald became extremely rich during his time in the east, and secured the wealth collected in Constantinople by shipments to Kievan Rus' for safekeeping (with Yaroslav the Wise acting as safekeeper for his fortune).<ref>Thenrik Bimbaum, \"Yaroslav's Varangian Connection\" in ''Scando-Slavica'', 1600\u2013082X, Volume 24, Issue 1, 1978, Pages 5\u201325</ref> The sagas note that aside from the significant spoils of battle he had retained, he had participated three times in ''polutasvarf'' (loosely translated as \"palace-plunder\"),<ref name=\"DVp39\"/> a term which implies either the pillaging of the palace exchequer on the death of the emperor, or perhaps the disbursement of funds to the Varangians by the new emperor in order to ensure their loyalty.<ref>Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) pp. 80\u201383.</ref> It is likely that the money Harald made while serving in Constantinople allowed him to fund his claim for the crown of Norway.<ref name=\"DVp39\">DeVries (1999) p. 39</ref> If he participated in ''polutasvarf'' three times, these occasions must have been the deaths of [[Romanos III Argyros|Romanos III]], Michael IV, and Michael V, in which Harald would have opportunities, beyond his legitimate revenues, to carry off immense wealth.<ref>Skaare (1995) p. 45</ref>\n\nAfter Zoe had been restored to the throne in June 1042 together with [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine IX]], Harald requested to be allowed to return to Norway. Although Zoe refused to allow this, Harald managed to escape into the [[Bosphorus]] with two ships and some loyal followers.

During his service in the Byzantine Empire, Harald composed a love poem which included the verse \"Yet the goddess in Gardarike / will not accept my gold rings\"<ref name=Henriksen>Henriksen (2011)</ref> (whom Snorri Sturluson identifies with Elisiv), although ''Morkinskinna'' claims that Harald had to remind Yaroslav of the promised marriage when he returned to Kiev.<ref name=\"DVpp2527\">DeVries (1999) pp. 26\u201327</ref> According to the same source, Harald had spoken with Yaroslav during his first time in Rus', requesting to marry Elisiv, only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 27</ref> It is in any case significant that Harald was allowed to marry the daughter of Yaroslav, since his other children were married to figures such as [[Henry I of France]], [[Andrew I of Hungary]] and the daughter of Constantine IX.<ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn77\"/>\n\n==King of Norway==\n\n===Return to Scandinavia===\nSeeking to regain for himself the kingdom lost by his half-brother Olaf Haraldsson,<ref name=\"DVp39\"/> Harald began his journey westwards in early 1045, departing from [[Novgorod]] (''Holmgard'') to Staraya Ladoga (''Aldeigjuborg'') where he obtained a ship. His journey went through [[Lake Ladoga]], down the [[Neva River]], and then into the [[Gulf of Finland]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. He arrived in [[Sigtuna]] in Sweden, probably at the end of 1045<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 83</ref> or in early 1046.<ref name=\"DVp39\"/> When he arrived in Sweden, according to the skald Tjodolv Arnorsson, his ship was unbalanced by its heavy load of gold.<ref name=\"SNL\"/> In Harald's absence, the throne of Norway had been restored to [[Magnus the Good]], an illegitimate son of Olaf. Harald may actually have known this, and it could have been the reason why Harald wanted to return to Norway in the first place.<ref>Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) p. 96</ref> Since Cnut the Great's sons had chosen to abandon Norway and instead fight over England, and his sons and successors [[Harold Harefoot]] and [[Harthacnut]] had died young, Magnus's position as king had been secured.

Their first military exploit consisted of raiding the Danish coast, in an effort to impress the natives by demonstrating that Magnus offered them no protection, and thus leading them to submit to Harald and Sweyn.

Notably, Harald also had to agree to share half of his wealth with Magnus, who at the time was effectively bankrupt and badly in need of funds. During their short co-rule, Harald and Magnus had separate courts and kept to themselves, and their only recorded meetings nearly ended in physical clashes.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 43\u201345</ref><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 95\u2013102</ref>\n\nIn 1047, Magnus and Harald went to Denmark with their [[leidang]] forces.

In response, the army and the chieftains, headed by [[Einar Thambarskelfir]], opposed any plans of invading Denmark. Although Harald himself objected to bringing the body of Magnus back to Norway, the Norwegian army prepared to transport his body to [[Nidaros]] (now [[Trondheim]]), where they buried him next to Saint Olaf in late 1047.<ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn103\">Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 103</ref><ref>DeVries (1999) p. 57</ref> Einar, an opponent of Harald, claimed that \"to follow Magnus dead was better than to follow any other king alive\".<ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn103\"/>\n\n===Invasions of Denmark===\nHarald also wanted to re-establish Magnus's rule over Denmark,<ref name=\"SNL\"/> and in the long term probably sought to restore Cnut the Great's \"[[North Sea Empire]]\" in its entirety.<ref>Moseng et al.

Similar to his campaigns (then together with Sweyn) against Magnus's rule in Denmark, most of his campaigns against Sweyn consisted of swift and violent raids on the Danish coasts. In 1048, he plundered [[Jutland]], and in 1049 he pillaged and burned [[Hedeby]], at the time the most important Danish trade center, and one of the best protected and most populous towns in Scandinavia.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 56\u201358</ref> Hedeby as a civil town never recovered from Harald's destruction, and was left completely desolate when what remained was looted by [[Slavic peoples|Slavic tribes]] in 1066.<ref>Hjardar & Vike (2011) p. 118</ref> One of two conventional battles was set to be fought between the two kings later the same year, but according to [[Saxo Grammaticus]], Sweyn's smaller army was so frightened when approached by the Norwegians that they chose to jump in the water trying to escape; most drowned.

As Harald had not been able to conquer Denmark despite his raids, he wanted to win a decisive victory over Sweyn. He eventually set out from Norway with a great army and a fleet of around 300 ships. Sweyn had also prepared for the battle, which had been preassigned a time and place. Sweyn, did not appear at the agreed time, and Harald thus sent home his non-professional soldiers (''b\u00f3ndaherrin''), which had made up half of his forces. When the dismissed ships were out of reach, Sweyn's fleet finally appeared, possibly also with 300 ships. The battle resulted in great bloodshed as Harald defeated the Danes (70 Danish ships were reportedly left \"empty\"), but many ships and men managed to escape, including Sweyn.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 61\u201365</ref> During the battle, Harald actively shot with his bow, like most others in the early phase of the battle.<ref>Hjardar & Vike (2011) p. 83</ref>\n\nFatigue and the huge cost of the indecisive battles eventually led Harald to seek peace with Sweyn, and in 1064 (or 1065 according to ''Morkinskinna'') the two kings agreed on an unconditional peace agreement.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 66</ref> By the agreement, they retained their respective kingdoms with the former boundaries, and there would be no payments of reparations. In the subsequent winter of 1065, Harald travelled through his realm and accused the farmers of withholding taxes from him. In response, he acted with brutality, and had people maimed and killed as a warning to those who disobeyed him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Norse Warfare: The Unconventional Battle Strategies of the Ancient Vikings|author=Sprague, Martina|publisher=Hippocrene Books|year=2007|page=[https://archive.org/details/norsewarfareunco0000spra/page/302 302]|isbn=978-0-7818-1176-7|url=https://archive.org/details/norsewarfareunco0000spra/page/302}}</ref> Harald maintained control of his nation through the use of his [[hird]], a private standing army maintained by Norwegian lords. Harald's contribution to the strengthening of Norway's monarchy was the enforcement of a policy that only the king could retain a hird, thus centralising power away from local warlords.<ref>Popperwell, Ronald G., ''Norway'' (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1972), 79.</ref>\n\n===Domestic opposition===\nAccording to historian [[Knut Helle]], Harald completed the first phase of what he has termed the \"national territorial unification of Norway\".<ref name=\"Moseng79\">Moseng et al. (2019) p. 79</ref> Having forced his way to the kingship, Harald would have to convince the aristocracy that he was the right person to rule Norway alone. To establish domestic alliances, he married [[Tora Torbergsdatter]] of one of the most powerful Norwegian families.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 104\u2013106</ref> The primary opposition to Harald's rule would be the descendants of [[Haakon Sigurdsson]], from the powerful dynasty of [[Earls of Lade]] who had controlled [[Northern Norway]] and [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] with much autonomy under the Norwegian king. Haakon had even ruled the whole of Norway (nominally under the Danish king) from 975 until 995, when he was killed during the takeover by [[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvasson]]. Even after Haakon's death, his offspring held a certain degree of sovereignty in the north, and by Harald's early reign the family was headed by [[Einar Tambarskjelvar|Einar Thambarskelfir]], who was married to Haakon's daughter. While the family had maintained good relations with Magnus, Harald's absolutism and consolidation of the kingship soon led to conflict with Einar.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 51\u201352</ref><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 115</ref>\n\nIt was from his power-struggle with the Norwegian aristocracy that Harald got himself the reputation that gave him the nickname \"Hardrada\", or \"the hard ruler\".<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 114</ref> Although the relationship between Harald and Einar was poor from the start, confrontation did not occur before Harald went north to his court in Nidaros. One time in Nidaros, Einar arrived at Harald's court, and in a display of power was accompanied by \"eight or nine longships and almost five hundred men\", obviously seeking confrontation. Harald was not provoked by the incident. Although the sources differ on the circumstances, the next event nonetheless led to the murder of Einar by Harald's men, which threatened to throw Norway into a state of civil war. Although the remaining descendants of Haakon Sigurdsson considered rebellion against the king, Harald eventually managed to negotiate peace with them, and secured the family's submission for the remainder of his reign.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 52\u201356</ref><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 115\u2013120</ref> By the death of Einar and his son around 1050, the Earls of Lade had outplayed their role as a base of opposition, and Tr\u00f8ndelag was definitely subordinated to Harald's national kingdom.<ref name=\"Moseng79\"/>\n\nBefore the Battle of Nis\u00e5, Harald had been joined by [[Haakon Ivarsson]], who distinguished himself in the battle and gained Harald's favour. Reportedly even considering to give him the title of Earl, Haakon was greatly upset when Harald later backed down from his promise. With a strong hold over the Uplands, Haakon was additionally given the earldom of [[V\u00e4rmland]] by the Swedish king [[Stenkil]]. In early 1064, Haakon entered the Uplands and collected their taxes, the region thus effectively threatening to renounce their loyalty to Harald. The revolt of Haakon and the farmers in the Uplands may have been the main reason why Harald finally had been willing to enter a peace agreement with Sweyn Estridsson. After the agreement, Harald went to Oslo and sent tax collectors to the Uplands, only to find that the farmers would withhold their taxes until Haakon arrived. In response, Harald entered Sweden with an army and quickly defeated Haakon.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 144\u2013153</ref> Still facing opposition from the farmers, Harald embarked on a campaign to crush the areas that had withheld their taxes. Due to the remote location of the region in the interior of the country, the Uplands had never been an integrated part of the Norwegian king's realm. Using harsh measures, Harald burned down farms and small villages, and had people maimed and killed. Starting in [[Romerike]], his campaign continued into [[Hedmark]], [[Hadeland]] and Ringerike. Since the regions contained several rich rural communities, Harald strengthened his economic position by confiscating farming estates.<ref name=\"Moseng79\"/><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 153\u2013155</ref> By the end of 1065 there was probably peace in Norway, as any opposition had either been killed, chased into exile or silenced.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 155</ref>\n\n===Policies===\nHarald's reign was marked by his background as a military commander, as he often solved disputes with harsh force. One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he had made, in his battles in the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"SNL\"/> While the sagas largely focus on Harald's war with Sweyn and the invasion of England, little is said about his domestic policies. Modern historians have taken this as a sign that, despite his absolutism, his reign was one of peace and progress for Norway. Harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies, as he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy, which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade. He initiated trade with Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire through his connections, as well as with Scotland and Ireland.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 46\u201347</ref> According to the later sagas, Harald founded [[Oslo]], where he spent much time.<ref name=\"SNL\"/>\n\nHarald also continued to advance Christianity in Norway, and archaeological excavations show that churches were built and improved during his reign. He also imported bishops, priests and monks from abroad, especially from Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire. A slightly different form of Christianity was thus introduced in Norway from the rest of northern Europe, although the [[East\u2013West Schism]] had not yet taken place.<ref>Jakobsson (2008)</ref> Since the clergy was not ordained in England or France, it nonetheless caused controversy when Harald was visited by papal legates. The protests by the legates led Harald to throw the Catholic clergy out of his court, and he reportedly stated to the legates that \"he did not know of any other archbishop or lord of Norway than the king himself\".<ref name=\"SNL\"/><ref name=\"DeVries 1999 pp. 47\u201348\">DeVries (1999) pp. 47\u201348</ref> Norwegian historian [[Halvdan Koht]] has remarked that the \"words seemed as if spoken by a Byzantine despot\".<ref name=\"SNL\"/> It is possible that Harald maintained contacts with Byzantine emperors after he became king, which could suggest a background for his church policies.<ref>Bagge (1990) pp. 176\u2013177</ref>\n\n===Northern explorations===\nOnce he had returned to Norway, Harald seems to have displayed an interest in exploring his own realm, as for instance the ''[[Morkinskinna]]'' recounts Harald's trip into the Uplands. Harald is also said to have explored the seas beyond his kingdom, as the contemporary [[Adam of Bremen]] reports of such naval expeditions conducted by Harald:<ref name=\"DeVries49\">DeVries (1999) p. 49</ref>\n\n{{quote|The most enterprising Prince Haraldr of the Norwegians lately attempted this [sea].

England had belonged to [[Harthacnut]], the son of Cnut the Great, until he died childless in 1042. Harald based his claim to the throne of England on an agreement made between Magnus and Harthacnut in 1038, which stated that if either died, the other would inherit the throne and lands of the deceased. When Harthacnut died, Magnus assumed the crown of Denmark and considered himself the lawful heir to Harthacnut. While [[Edward the Confessor]] had himself crowned English king in his absence, Magnus had planned to invade England in 1045, only to be forced to turn his fleet towards Denmark due to an uprising by Sweyn Estridsson. Although the threat was temporarily averted by Magnus's death in 1047, Edward's negotiations with his enemies throughout the 1050s gave Harald (as well as Sweyn Estridsson and [[William the Conqueror|William of Normandy]]) an impression that he was a possible heir to Edward. When Edward died in January 1066, he was to Harald's dismay succeeded by [[Harold Godwinson]], a son of one of Edward's advisors.<ref>Hjardar & Vike (2011) pp. 283\u2013284</ref>\n[[File:Harald III of Norway.jpg|thumb|right| 13th-century portrayal of Harald Hardrada, from ''The Life of King Edward the Confessor'' by the English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]]]]\nHarald's son [[Magnus II of Norway|Magnus]] had previously been involved in [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]]'s 1058 war against the English king with a Norwegian fleet, possibly indicating that Harald had tested the situation in England long before his 1066 invasion, only to find that he could not simultaneously be at war with Denmark and England.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 66\u201367</ref> After Edward's death, Harald allied himself with [[Tostig Godwinson]], Harold's brother, who had been deprived of the [[Earl of Northumbria|earldom of Northumbria]] by Edward in 1065.<ref name=\"vikingerikrig284\"/> According to various sources, Tostig may have asked both or either of William of Normandy and Sweyn Estridsson to assist him in invading England before turning to Harald. According to the sagas, Tostig finally pledged his support for Harald, including that of the \"majority of the chieftains\", at a meeting in Norway. Some historians doubt that this meeting took place, as [[William of Malmesbury]] claims that Tostig did not pledge his support for Harald until they met at the [[Humber]]. This would indicate that the invasion originally was Harald's plan alone, and that his joining of forces with Tostig was merely a later agreement when the two met for the first time in Scotland or Northumbria. Another proposal by historians is that a meeting did indeed take place in Norway, but instead with [[Copsi]]g, one of Tostig's early supporters and a fellow exile, as Tostig's mediator. If this is correct, it would both allow an agreement to have been made in Norway, and the first personal meeting between Harald and Tostig to have taken place in Britain.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 231\u2013240</ref> Indeed, ''Morkinskinna'' mentions that \"some men\" claimed that Tostig only had sent an emissary to Norway, while he still remained in France.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 163</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Fulford.png|thumb|Harald landing near York (left), and defeating the Northumbrian army (right), from the 13th century chronicle ''The Life of King Edward the Confessor'' by Matthew Paris.

In both places he was joined by several important lords, chieftains, and soldiers, including the [[Earl of Orkney|Earls of Orkney]], [[Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson]]. He next went to [[Dunfermline]], where he met with Tostig's ally [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] (and according to some sources, with Tostig)<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 250\u2013251</ref> who allocated him a couple thousand Scottish soldiers.<ref>Hjardar & Vike (2011) pp. 284\u2013285</ref> According to most contemporary sources, Harald and Tostig met at [[Tynemouth]] on 8 September, Harald with a total force of, at the most, around 10\u201315,000 men on 240\u2013300 [[longship]]s,<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 167</ref><ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 264\u2013265 & 269</ref> and Tostig with a mere 12 ships with soldiers.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 251\u2013252</ref> Not mentioned in the sagas, but accounted for by [[John of Worcester]], Tostig had departed from his exile in [[Flanders]] already in May or June. He had then raided villages along the southern coast of Britain from the [[Isle of Wight]] to [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. As Harold Godwinson gathered a large army in response, Tostig sailed north to meet with Harald, while Harold Godwinson remained in the south in expectation of invasion by William of Normandy,<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 242\u2013243</ref> who for a long time had openly claimed the English throne.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 165</ref>\n\n===Invasion and the Battle of Stamford Bridge===\nAfter embarking from Tynemouth, Harald and Tostig probably landed at the [[River Tees]].<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 252</ref> They then entered [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]],<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 170</ref> and started plundering the coast. They encountered the first resistance at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], where Harald's demand for surrender was opposed. In the end, Harald resorted to burning down the town and this action led to other Northumbrian towns surrendering to him. After further raiding, Harald and Tostig sailed down the Humber, disembarking at [[Riccall]]. News of the invasion soon reached the earls [[Morcar|Morcar of Northumbria]] and [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]], and they fought against Harald's invading army two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of [[York]] at the [[Battle of Fulford]] on 20 September. The battle was a decisive victory for Harald and Tostig, and led York to surrender to their forces on 24 September.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 250\u2013261</ref> This would be the last time a Scandinavian army defeated English forces.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 172</ref> The same day as York surrendered to Harald and Tostig, Harold Godwinson arrived with his army in [[Tadcaster]], just seven miles from the anchored Norwegian fleet at Riccall. From there, he probably scouted the Norwegian fleet, preparing a surprise attack. As Harald had left no forces in York, Harold Godwinson marched right through the town to [[Battle of Stamford Bridge|Stamford Bridge]].<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 267\u2013270</ref>\n[[File:Battle of Stamford Bridge, full.png|right|thumb|350px|Harald at Stamford Bridge. Matthew Paris may have [[attributed arms|attributed]] the axe to Harald due to its general Norse association, or the royal iconography around St. Olaf.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Fuglesang, Signe Horn|title=Bilder og bilders bruk i vikingtid og middelalder|year=1997|page=77|publisher=Norges forskningsr\u00e5d|language=Norwegian}}</ref> According to the sagas, Harald wore a blue tunic and helmet, wielded a sword, and ''[[Raven banner#Other|Land\u00f8y\u00f0an]]'' as his royal standard, but not his [[Mail (armour)|mail-shirt]] (\"Emma\") and shield, which was left at Riccall.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 199 & 276\u2013278 & 284 & 290</ref>]]\n\nEarly on 25 September, Harald and Tostig departed their landing place at Riccall with most of their forces, but left a third of their forces behind. They brought only light armour, as they expected to just meet the citizens of York, as they had agreed the day before, at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 172\u2013174</ref> Once there Harald saw Godwinson's forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald's. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald's army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle in a state of ''[[berserker]]gang'', having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 276\u2013296</ref><ref>Hjardar & Vike (2011) pp. 289\u2013291</ref>\n\nWhen the battle was almost over, some reserve forces from Riccall led by [[Eystein Orre]] finally appeared, but they were exhausted as they had run all the way. Eystein picked up Harald's fallen banner, the \"Landwaster\" (''Land\u00f8y\u00f0an''), and initiated a final counter-attack. Although they for a moment appeared to almost breach the English line, Eystein was suddenly killed, which left the rest of the men to flee from the battlefield.<ref name=\"Hjardar & Vike 2011 p. 291\">Hjardar & Vike (2011) p. 291</ref> Among those left at Riccall after the battle, who were allowed to return home peacefully by the English forces, was Harald's son Olaf.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 296</ref><ref>Stenton (1971) p. 590</ref> Although sources state that Harald's remaining army only filled 20\u201325 ships on the return to Norway, it is likely that this number only accounts for the Norwegian forces. Most of the forces from Scotland and Orkney probably remained at Riccall throughout the battle (the earls Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson are certainly known to have been stationed there the entire time), and has not been counted in the traditional figure.<ref name=\"Hjardar & Vike 2011 p. 291\"/>\n\nHarold Godwinson's victory was short-lived, as only a few weeks later he was defeated by [[William the Conqueror]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]]. The fact that Harold had to make a forced march to fight Hardrada at Stamford Bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet the Norman invasion, all in less than three weeks, is widely seen as a primary factor in William's victory at Hastings.<ref>Stenton (1971) p. 592</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHarald is described by Snorri Sturluson to have been physically \"larger than other men and stronger\".<ref name=\"DeVries 1999 p. 40\"/> He is said to have had light hair and beard, a long \"upper beard\" (moustache), and that one of his eyebrows was somewhat higher situated than the other. He also reportedly had big hands and feet, and could measure five [[ell]]s in height. It is not known whether Snorri's description of Harald's physical appearance actually represents historical facts.<ref>Bagge (1990) pp. 187\u2013189</ref> The tall stature of and cried Harald is also substantiated by a story that relates that before the Battle of Stamford Bridge, Harold Godwinson offered Tostig back the earldom of Northumbria, and Harald \"six feet of the ground of England, or perhaps more seeing that he is taller than most men\" (according to [[Henry of Huntingdon]])<ref>{{Cite book|title=Battle 1066|author=Barclay, Cyril Nelson|year=1966|publisher=University of Michigan|page=35}}</ref> or \"six feet of English ground, or seven feet as he was taller than other men\" (according to Snorri Sturluson).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of England|author1=Carrington, C.

He was clearly interested in advancing Christianity in Norway, which can be seen by the continued building and improvement of churches throughout his reign.

In addition, he unsuccessfully claimed the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish throne]] until 1064 and the [[List of English monarchs|English throne]] in 1066. Before becoming king, Harald had spent around fifteen years in exile as a [[mercenary]] and military commander in [[Kievan Rus']] and of the [[Varangian Guard]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nWhen he was fifteen years old, in 1030, Harald fought in the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] together with his half-brother [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf Haraldsson]] (later Saint Olaf). Olaf sought to reclaim the Norwegian throne, which he had lost to the Danish king [[Cnut the Great]] two years prior. In the battle, Olaf and Harald were defeated by forces loyal to Cnut, and Harald was forced into exile to Kievan Rus' (the sagas' {{lang|non|[[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]]}}). He thereafter spent some time in the army of Grand Prince [[Yaroslav the Wise]], eventually obtaining rank as a captain, until he moved on to [[Constantinople]] with his companions around 1034. In Constantinople, he soon rose to become the commander of the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]], and saw action on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in [[Asia Minor]], [[Sicily]], possibly in the [[Holy Land]], [[Bulgaria]] and in Constantinople itself, where he became involved in the imperial dynastic disputes. Harald amassed considerable wealth during his time in the Byzantine Empire, which he shipped to Yaroslav in Kievan Rus' for safekeeping. He finally left the Byzantines in 1042, and arrived back in Kievan Rus' in order to prepare his campaign of reclaiming the Norwegian throne. Possibly to Harald's knowledge, in his absence the Norwegian throne had been restored from the Danes to Olaf's illegitimate son [[Magnus the Good]].\n\nIn 1046, Harald joined forces with Magnus's rival in Denmark (Magnus had also become king of Denmark), the [[pretender]] [[Sweyn II of Denmark]], and started raiding the Danish coast. Magnus, unwilling to fight his uncle, agreed to share the kingship with Harald, since Harald in turn would share his wealth with him. The co-rule ended abruptly the next year as Magnus died, and Harald thus became the sole ruler of Norway. Domestically, Harald crushed all local and regional opposition, and outlined the territorial unification of Norway under a national governance. Harald's reign was probably one of relative peace and stability, and he instituted a viable coin economy and foreign trade. Probably seeking to restore Cnut's \"[[North Sea Empire]]\", Harald also claimed the Danish throne, and spent nearly every year until 1064 raiding the Danish coast and fighting his former ally, Sweyn. Although the campaigns were successful, he was never able to conquer Denmark.\n\nNot long after Harald had renounced his claim to Denmark, the former [[Earl of Northumbria]], [[Tostig Godwinson]], brother of the newly chosen (but reigning not for long) English king [[Harold Godwinson|Harold Godwinson (also known as Harold of Wessex)]], pledged his allegiance to Harald and invited him to claim the English throne. Harald went along and invaded Northern England with 10,000 troops and 300 longships in September 1066, raided the coast and defeated English regional forces of Northumbria and Mercia in the [[Battle of Fulford]] near [[York]]. Although initially successful, Harald was defeated and killed in an attack by Harold Godwinson's forces in the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], which wiped out almost his entire army. Modern historians have often considered Harald's death, which brought an end to his invasion, as the end of the [[Viking Age]].\n\n==Epithets==\nHarald's most famous epithet is Old Norse ''har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i'', which has been translated variously as 'hard in counsel', 'tyrannical',<ref>Cleasby, Richard and Gudbrand Vigfusson, ''An Icelandic-English Dictionary'', 2nd edn by William A.

On hearing news of Olaf's planned return, Harald gathered 600 men from the Uplands to meet Olaf and his men upon their arrival in the east of Norway. After a friendly welcome, Olaf went on to gather an army and eventually fight in the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] on 29 July 1030, in which Harald took part on his brother's side.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 17\u201318</ref> The battle was part of an attempt to restore Olaf to the Norwegian throne, which had been captured by the Danish king [[Cnut the Great]] ([[Canute]]). The battle resulted in defeat for the brothers at the hands of those Norwegians who were loyal to Cnut, and Olaf was killed while Harald was badly wounded.<ref name=\"BBp54\">Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) p. 54</ref> Harald was nonetheless remarked to have shown considerable military talent during the battle.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 25</ref>\n\n==Exile in the East==\n\n===To Kievan Rus'===\nAfter the defeat at the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald managed to escape with the aid of [[R\u00f6gnvald Brusason]] (later [[Earl of Orkney]]) to a remote farm in [[Eastern Norway]]. He stayed there for some time to heal his wounds, and thereafter (possibly up to a month later) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden. A year after the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald arrived in [[Kievan Rus']] (referred to in the sagas as ''[[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]]'' or ''Sv\u00ed\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0 hin mikla''). He likely spent at least part of his time in the town of [[Staraya Ladoga]] (''Aldeigjuborg''), arriving there in the first half of 1031. Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince [[Yaroslav the Wise]], whose wife [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter|Ingegerd]] was a distant relative of Harald.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 21\u201322</ref><ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 25\u201326</ref> Badly in need of military leaders, Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 26</ref> Harald's brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to [[Yaroslavl|Yaroslav]] following the revolt in 1028,<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 16</ref> and ''[[Morkinskinna]]'' says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 25</ref> Harald took part in Yaroslav's campaign against the [[Poles]] in 1031, and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the [[Chud]]es in [[Estonia]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], as well as the [[Pechenegs]] and other steppe nomad people.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 27</ref>\n\n===In Byzantine service===\nAfter a few years in Kievan Rus', Harald and his force of around 500 men<ref name=\"vikingerikrig284\"/> moved on south to [[Constantinople]] (''[[Miklagard]]''), the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (later known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]), probably in 1033 or 1034,<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 28</ref> where they joined the [[Varangian Guard]]. Although the ''[[Flateyjarb\u00f3k]]'' maintains that Harald at first sought to keep his royal identity a secret, most sources agree that Harald and his men's reputation was well known in the east at the time. While the Varangian Guard was primarily meant to function as the emperor's bodyguard, Harald was found fighting on \"nearly every frontier\" of the empire.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 29</ref> He first saw action in campaigns against [[Arab people|Arab]] pirates in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and then in inland towns in [[Asia Minor]] / [[Anatolia]] that had supported the pirates. By this time, he had according to Snorri Sturluson become the \"leader over all the Varangians\". By 1035, the Byzantines had pushed the Arabs out of Asia Minor to the east and southeast, and Harald took part in campaigns that went as far east as the [[Tigris River]] and [[Euphrates River]] in [[Mesopotamia]], where according to his [[skald]] (poet) [[\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr Arn\u00f3rsson]] (recounted in the sagas) he participated in the capture of eighty Arab strongholds, a number which historians [[Sigfus Bl\u00f6ndal]] and [[Benedikt Benedikz]] see no particular reason to question. Although not holding independent command of an army as the sagas imply, it is not unlikely that King Harald and the Varangians at times could have been sent off to capture a castle or town.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 29\u201330</ref><ref>Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) pp. 60\u201362</ref> During the first four years of the reign of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]], Harald probably also fought in campaigns against the [[Pechenegs]].<ref name=\"Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz 2007 p. 63\">Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) p. 63</ref>\n[[File:The body of Leo V is dragged to the Hippodrome through the Skyla Gate.jpg|thumb|Near-contemporary depiction of [[Byzantine]] [[Varangian]] Guardsmen, in an illumination from the [[John Skylitzes|Skylitzes Chronicle]].]]\n\nThereafter, Harald is reported in the sagas to have gone to [[Jerusalem]] and fought in battles in the area. Although the sagas place this after his expedition to [[Sicily]], historian [[Kelly DeVries]] has questioned that chronology.<ref name=\"DeVriesp30\">DeVries (1999) p. 30</ref> Whether his trip was of a military or peaceful nature would depend on whether it took place before or after the 1036 peace treaty between Michael IV and the [[Muslim]] [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]]<ref name=\"DeVriesp30\"/> (in reality the Caliph's mother, originally a Byzantine Christian, since the Caliph was a minor), although it is considered unlikely to have been made before. Modern historians have speculated that Harald may have been in a party sent to escort pilgrims to Jerusalem (possibly including members of the Imperial family) following the peace agreement, as it was also agreed that the Byzantines were allowed to repair the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. Furthermore, this may in turn have presented Harald with opportunities to fight against bandits who preyed on Christian pilgrims.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 30\u201331</ref><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 43</ref>\n\nIn 1038, Harald joined the Byzantines in their expedition to [[Sicily]],<ref name=\"DeVries 1999 p. 31\">DeVries (1999) p. 31</ref><ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn 2010 p. 47\">Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 47</ref> in [[George Maniakes]]'s (the sagas' \"Gyrge\") attempt to reconquer the island from the Muslim [[Saracen]]s, who had established the [[Emirate of Sicily]] on the island.

In a [[Greece|Greek]] book written in the 1070s, the ''[[Strategikon of Kekaumenos]]'', '''Araltes''' (i.e. Harald) is said to have won the favour of the emperor.<ref>Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) p. 57</ref><ref>Bibikov (2004) p. 20</ref><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 32</ref> The book says that the Byzantine emperor first appointed him ''[[manglabites]]'' (possibly identified with the title ''[[protospatharios]]''), a soldier of the imperial guard, after the Sicilian campaign.<ref name=\"Bibikov21\">Bibikov (2004) p. 21</ref><ref>DeVries (1999) p. 33</ref> Following the campaign against the Bulgarians, in which Harald again served with distinction, he received the rank while at [[Mosynopolis]]<ref>Raffaele D'Amato, page 8 \"The Varangian Guard 988 \u2013 1453, {{ISBN|978-1-84908-179-5}}</ref> of ''[[spatharokandidatos]]'', identified by DeVries as a promotion to the possibly third highest Byzantine rank, but by Mikhail Bibikov as a lesser rank than ''protospatharios'' that was ordinarily awarded to foreign allies to the emperor.<ref name=\"Bibikov21\"/> The ''Strategikon'' indicates that the ranks awarded to Harald were rather low, since Harald reportedly was \"not angry for just having been appointed to ''manglabites'' or ''spatharokandidatos''\".<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 41</ref> According to his skald Tjodolv Arnorsson, Harald had participated in eighteen greater battles during his Byzantine service.<ref name=\"SNL\"/> Harald's favour at the imperial court quickly declined after the death of Michael IV in December 1041, which was followed by conflicts between the new emperor [[Michael V Kalaphates|Michael V]] and the powerful empress [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zoe]].<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 33\u201334</ref>\n\nDuring the turmoil, Harald was arrested and imprisoned, but the sources disagree on the grounds.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 34</ref> The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure, as well as for requesting marriage<ref name=\"DeVries 1999 pp. 34\u201335\">DeVries (1999) pp. 34\u201335</ref> with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter<ref name=\"SNL\"/> of Zoe, called Maria (his suit supposedly being turned down by the empress because she wanted to marry Harald herself). [[William of Malmesbury]] states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to [[Saxo Grammaticus]] he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor.<ref name=\"DeVries 1999 pp. 34\u201335\"/> The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape in the midst of the revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).<ref name=\"DVpp3538\">DeVries (1999) pp. 35\u201338</ref>\n\n===Back to Kievan Rus'===\n[[File:Elisiv of Kiev.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Harald's wife Elisiv of Kiev, daughter of Yaroslav the Wise]]\nHarald became extremely rich during his time in the east, and secured the wealth collected in Constantinople by shipments to Kievan Rus' for safekeeping (with Yaroslav the Wise acting as safekeeper for his fortune).<ref>Thenrik Bimbaum, \"Yaroslav's Varangian Connection\" in ''Scando-Slavica'', 1600\u2013082X, Volume 24, Issue 1, 1978, Pages 5\u201325</ref> The sagas note that aside from the significant spoils of battle he had retained, he had participated three times in ''polutasvarf'' (loosely translated as \"palace-plunder\"),<ref name=\"DVp39\"/> a term which implies either the pillaging of the palace exchequer on the death of the emperor, or perhaps the disbursement of funds to the Varangians by the new emperor in order to ensure their loyalty.<ref>Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) pp. 80\u201383.</ref> It is likely that the money Harald made while serving in Constantinople allowed him to fund his claim for the crown of Norway.<ref name=\"DVp39\">DeVries (1999) p. 39</ref> If he participated in ''polutasvarf'' three times, these occasions must have been the deaths of [[Romanos III Argyros|Romanos III]], Michael IV, and Michael V, in which Harald would have opportunities, beyond his legitimate revenues, to carry off immense wealth.<ref>Skaare (1995) p. 45</ref>\n\nAfter Zoe had been restored to the throne in June 1042 together with [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine IX]], Harald requested to be allowed to return to Norway. Although Zoe refused to allow this, Harald managed to escape into the [[Bosphorus]] with two ships and some loyal followers. Although the second ship was destroyed by the Byzantine [[boom (navigational barrier)|cross-strait iron chains]], Harald's ship sailed safely into the [[Black Sea]] after successfully manoeuvring over the barrier.<ref name=\"DVpp3538\"/> Despite this, Kekaumenos lauds the \"loyalty and love\" Harald had for the empire, which he reportedly maintained even after he returned to Norway and became king.<ref>Bagge (1990) p. 175</ref> Following his escape from Constantinople, Harald arrived back in Kievan Rus' later in 1042.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 74</ref> During his second stay there, he married [[Elisiv of Kiev|Elisabeth]] (referred to in Scandinavian sources as Ellisif), daughter of Yaroslav the Wise and granddaughter of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] king [[Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung]].<ref name=\"DVp39\"/> Shortly after Harald's arrival in Kiev, Yaroslav [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine War (1043)|attacked Constantinople]], and it is considered likely that Harald provided him with valuable information about the state of the empire.<ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn77\">Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 77</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the marriage with Elisiv had been agreed to already during Harald's first time in Rus', or that they at least had been acquainted. During his service in the Byzantine Empire, Harald composed a love poem which included the verse \"Yet the goddess in Gardarike / will not accept my gold rings\"<ref name=Henriksen>Henriksen (2011)</ref> (whom Snorri Sturluson identifies with Elisiv), although ''Morkinskinna'' claims that Harald had to remind Yaroslav of the promised marriage when he returned to Kiev.<ref name=\"DVpp2527\">DeVries (1999) pp. 26\u201327</ref> According to the same source, Harald had spoken with Yaroslav during his first time in Rus', requesting to marry Elisiv, only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 27</ref> It is in any case significant that Harald was allowed to marry the daughter of Yaroslav, since his other children were married to figures such as [[Henry I of France]], [[Andrew I of Hungary]] and the daughter of Constantine IX.<ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn77\"/>\n\n==King of Norway==\n\n===Return to Scandinavia===\nSeeking to regain for himself the kingdom lost by his half-brother Olaf Haraldsson,<ref name=\"DVp39\"/> Harald began his journey westwards in early 1045, departing from [[Novgorod]] (''Holmgard'') to Staraya Ladoga (''Aldeigjuborg'') where he obtained a ship. His journey went through [[Lake Ladoga]], down the [[Neva River]], and then into the [[Gulf of Finland]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. He arrived in [[Sigtuna]] in Sweden, probably at the end of 1045<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 83</ref> or in early 1046.<ref name=\"DVp39\"/> When he arrived in Sweden, according to the skald Tjodolv Arnorsson, his ship was unbalanced by its heavy load of gold.<ref name=\"SNL\"/> In Harald's absence, the throne of Norway had been restored to [[Magnus the Good]], an illegitimate son of Olaf. Harald may actually have known this, and it could have been the reason why Harald wanted to return to Norway in the first place.<ref>Bl\u00f6ndal & Benedikz (2007) p. 96</ref> Since Cnut the Great's sons had chosen to abandon Norway and instead fight over England, and his sons and successors [[Harold Harefoot]] and [[Harthacnut]] had died young, Magnus's position as king had been secured. No domestic threats or insurrections are recorded to have occurred during his eleven-year reign.<ref name=\"DeVries 1999 p. 40\">DeVries (1999) p. 40</ref> After the death of Harthacnut, which had left the Danish throne vacant, Magnus had in addition been selected to be the king of Denmark, and managed to defeat the Danish royal pretender [[Sweyn II of Denmark|Sweyn Estridsson]].<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 40\u201341</ref>\n[[File:Magnus Harald.png|thumb|right|Coin with the legend \"MAHNUS ARALD REX\".

Their first military exploit consisted of raiding the Danish coast, in an effort to impress the natives by demonstrating that Magnus offered them no protection, and thus leading them to submit to Harald and Sweyn. Learning about their actions, Magnus knew that their next target would be Norway.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 42</ref> Harald may have planned to be taken as king of his father's petty kingdom, and thereafter claim the rest of the country.<ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn94\">Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 94</ref> In any case, the people were unwilling to turn against Magnus, and on hearing news of Harald's schemes, Magnus (abroad at the time) went home to Norway with his entire army.<ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn94\"/> Instead of going to war, Magnus's advisors recommended the young king not fight his uncle, and a compromise was reached in 1046 in which Harald would rule Norway (not Denmark) jointly with Magnus (although Magnus would have precedence). Notably, Harald also had to agree to share half of his wealth with Magnus, who at the time was effectively bankrupt and badly in need of funds. During their short co-rule, Harald and Magnus had separate courts and kept to themselves, and their only recorded meetings nearly ended in physical clashes.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 43\u201345</ref><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 95\u2013102</ref>\n\nIn 1047, Magnus and Harald went to Denmark with their [[leidang]] forces. Later that year in [[Jylland]], less than a year into their co-rule, Magnus died without an heir. Before his death, he had decided that Sweyn was to inherit Denmark and Harald to inherit Norway.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 102\u2013103</ref> On hearing the news of Magnus's death, Harald quickly gathered the local leaders in Norway and declared himself king of Norway as well as of Denmark.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 45\u201346</ref> Although Magnus had appointed Sweyn his successor as king of Denmark, Harald immediately announced his plans to gather an army and oust his former ally from the country. In response, the army and the chieftains, headed by [[Einar Thambarskelfir]], opposed any plans of invading Denmark. Although Harald himself objected to bringing the body of Magnus back to Norway, the Norwegian army prepared to transport his body to [[Nidaros]] (now [[Trondheim]]), where they buried him next to Saint Olaf in late 1047.<ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn103\">Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 103</ref><ref>DeVries (1999) p. 57</ref> Einar, an opponent of Harald, claimed that \"to follow Magnus dead was better than to follow any other king alive\".<ref name=\"Tj\u00f8nn103\"/>\n\n===Invasions of Denmark===\nHarald also wanted to re-establish Magnus's rule over Denmark,<ref name=\"SNL\"/> and in the long term probably sought to restore Cnut the Great's \"[[North Sea Empire]]\" in its entirety.<ref>Moseng et al. (1999) p. 81</ref> While his first proposal to invade Denmark fell through, the next year Harald embarked on what would turn into constant warfare against Sweyn, from 1048 almost yearly until 1064. Similar to his campaigns (then together with Sweyn) against Magnus's rule in Denmark, most of his campaigns against Sweyn consisted of swift and violent raids on the Danish coasts. In 1048, he plundered [[Jutland]], and in 1049 he pillaged and burned [[Hedeby]], at the time the most important Danish trade center, and one of the best protected and most populous towns in Scandinavia.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 56\u201358</ref> Hedeby as a civil town never recovered from Harald's destruction, and was left completely desolate when what remained was looted by [[Slavic peoples|Slavic tribes]] in 1066.<ref>Hjardar & Vike (2011) p. 118</ref> One of two conventional battles was set to be fought between the two kings later the same year, but according to [[Saxo Grammaticus]], Sweyn's smaller army was so frightened when approached by the Norwegians that they chose to jump in the water trying to escape; most drowned.

As Harald had not been able to conquer Denmark despite his raids, he wanted to win a decisive victory over Sweyn. He eventually set out from Norway with a great army and a fleet of around 300 ships. Sweyn had also prepared for the battle, which had been preassigned a time and place. Sweyn, did not appear at the agreed time, and Harald thus sent home his non-professional soldiers (''b\u00f3ndaherrin''), which had made up half of his forces. When the dismissed ships were out of reach, Sweyn's fleet finally appeared, possibly also with 300 ships. The battle resulted in great bloodshed as Harald defeated the Danes (70 Danish ships were reportedly left \"empty\"), but many ships and men managed to escape, including Sweyn.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 61\u201365</ref> During the battle, Harald actively shot with his bow, like most others in the early phase of the battle.<ref>Hjardar & Vike (2011) p. 83</ref>\n\nFatigue and the huge cost of the indecisive battles eventually led Harald to seek peace with Sweyn, and in 1064 (or 1065 according to ''Morkinskinna'') the two kings agreed on an unconditional peace agreement.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 66</ref> By the agreement, they retained their respective kingdoms with the former boundaries, and there would be no payments of reparations. In the subsequent winter of 1065, Harald travelled through his realm and accused the farmers of withholding taxes from him. In response, he acted with brutality, and had people maimed and killed as a warning to those who disobeyed him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Norse Warfare: The Unconventional Battle Strategies of the Ancient Vikings|author=Sprague, Martina|publisher=Hippocrene Books|year=2007|page=[https://archive.org/details/norsewarfareunco0000spra/page/302 302]|isbn=978-0-7818-1176-7|url=https://archive.org/details/norsewarfareunco0000spra/page/302}}</ref> Harald maintained control of his nation through the use of his [[hird]], a private standing army maintained by Norwegian lords. Harald's contribution to the strengthening of Norway's monarchy was the enforcement of a policy that only the king could retain a hird, thus centralising power away from local warlords.<ref>Popperwell, Ronald G., ''Norway'' (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1972), 79.</ref>\n\n===Domestic opposition===\nAccording to historian [[Knut Helle]], Harald completed the first phase of what he has termed the \"national territorial unification of Norway\".<ref name=\"Moseng79\">Moseng et al. (2019) p. 79</ref> Having forced his way to the kingship, Harald would have to convince the aristocracy that he was the right person to rule Norway alone. To establish domestic alliances, he married [[Tora Torbergsdatter]] of one of the most powerful Norwegian families.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 104\u2013106</ref> The primary opposition to Harald's rule would be the descendants of [[Haakon Sigurdsson]], from the powerful dynasty of [[Earls of Lade]] who had controlled [[Northern Norway]] and [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] with much autonomy under the Norwegian king. Haakon had even ruled the whole of Norway (nominally under the Danish king) from 975 until 995, when he was killed during the takeover by [[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvasson]]. Even after Haakon's death, his offspring held a certain degree of sovereignty in the north, and by Harald's early reign the family was headed by [[Einar Tambarskjelvar|Einar Thambarskelfir]], who was married to Haakon's daughter. While the family had maintained good relations with Magnus, Harald's absolutism and consolidation of the kingship soon led to conflict with Einar.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 51\u201352</ref><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 115</ref>\n\nIt was from his power-struggle with the Norwegian aristocracy that Harald got himself the reputation that gave him the nickname \"Hardrada\", or \"the hard ruler\".<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 114</ref> Although the relationship between Harald and Einar was poor from the start, confrontation did not occur before Harald went north to his court in Nidaros. One time in Nidaros, Einar arrived at Harald's court, and in a display of power was accompanied by \"eight or nine longships and almost five hundred men\", obviously seeking confrontation. Harald was not provoked by the incident. Although the sources differ on the circumstances, the next event nonetheless led to the murder of Einar by Harald's men, which threatened to throw Norway into a state of civil war. Although the remaining descendants of Haakon Sigurdsson considered rebellion against the king, Harald eventually managed to negotiate peace with them, and secured the family's submission for the remainder of his reign.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 52\u201356</ref><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 115\u2013120</ref> By the death of Einar and his son around 1050, the Earls of Lade had outplayed their role as a base of opposition, and Tr\u00f8ndelag was definitely subordinated to Harald's national kingdom.<ref name=\"Moseng79\"/>\n\nBefore the Battle of Nis\u00e5, Harald had been joined by [[Haakon Ivarsson]], who distinguished himself in the battle and gained Harald's favour. Reportedly even considering to give him the title of Earl, Haakon was greatly upset when Harald later backed down from his promise. With a strong hold over the Uplands, Haakon was additionally given the earldom of [[V\u00e4rmland]] by the Swedish king [[Stenkil]]. In early 1064, Haakon entered the Uplands and collected their taxes, the region thus effectively threatening to renounce their loyalty to Harald. The revolt of Haakon and the farmers in the Uplands may have been the main reason why Harald finally had been willing to enter a peace agreement with Sweyn Estridsson. After the agreement, Harald went to Oslo and sent tax collectors to the Uplands, only to find that the farmers would withhold their taxes until Haakon arrived. In response, Harald entered Sweden with an army and quickly defeated Haakon.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 144\u2013153</ref> Still facing opposition from the farmers, Harald embarked on a campaign to crush the areas that had withheld their taxes. Due to the remote location of the region in the interior of the country, the Uplands had never been an integrated part of the Norwegian king's realm. Using harsh measures, Harald burned down farms and small villages, and had people maimed and killed. Starting in [[Romerike]], his campaign continued into [[Hedmark]], [[Hadeland]] and Ringerike. Since the regions contained several rich rural communities, Harald strengthened his economic position by confiscating farming estates.<ref name=\"Moseng79\"/><ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 153\u2013155</ref> By the end of 1065 there was probably peace in Norway, as any opposition had either been killed, chased into exile or silenced.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 155</ref>\n\n===Policies===\nHarald's reign was marked by his background as a military commander, as he often solved disputes with harsh force. One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he had made, in his battles in the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"SNL\"/> While the sagas largely focus on Harald's war with Sweyn and the invasion of England, little is said about his domestic policies. Modern historians have taken this as a sign that, despite his absolutism, his reign was one of peace and progress for Norway. Harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies, as he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy, which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade. He initiated trade with Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire through his connections, as well as with Scotland and Ireland.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 46\u201347</ref> According to the later sagas, Harald founded [[Oslo]], where he spent much time.<ref name=\"SNL\"/>\n\nHarald also continued to advance Christianity in Norway, and archaeological excavations show that churches were built and improved during his reign. He also imported bishops, priests and monks from abroad, especially from Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire. A slightly different form of Christianity was thus introduced in Norway from the rest of northern Europe, although the [[East\u2013West Schism]] had not yet taken place.<ref>Jakobsson (2008)</ref> Since the clergy was not ordained in England or France, it nonetheless caused controversy when Harald was visited by papal legates. The protests by the legates led Harald to throw the Catholic clergy out of his court, and he reportedly stated to the legates that \"he did not know of any other archbishop or lord of Norway than the king himself\".<ref name=\"SNL\"/><ref name=\"DeVries 1999 pp. 47\u201348\">DeVries (1999) pp. 47\u201348</ref> Norwegian historian [[Halvdan Koht]] has remarked that the \"words seemed as if spoken by a Byzantine despot\".<ref name=\"SNL\"/> It is possible that Harald maintained contacts with Byzantine emperors after he became king, which could suggest a background for his church policies.<ref>Bagge (1990) pp. 176\u2013177</ref>\n\n===Northern explorations===\nOnce he had returned to Norway, Harald seems to have displayed an interest in exploring his own realm, as for instance the ''[[Morkinskinna]]'' recounts Harald's trip into the Uplands. Harald is also said to have explored the seas beyond his kingdom, as the contemporary [[Adam of Bremen]] reports of such naval expeditions conducted by Harald:<ref name=\"DeVries49\">DeVries (1999) p. 49</ref>\n\n{{quote|The most enterprising Prince Haraldr of the Norwegians lately attempted this [sea].

XXXIX}}\n\n[[Kelly DeVries]] has suggested that Harald \"may even have known of and sought out the legendary land called [[Vinland]], which Viking sailors had discovered only a short time before\", which Adam mentions earlier in the same passage to have been widely reported in Denmark and Norway.<ref name=\"DeVries49\"/> H.

England had belonged to [[Harthacnut]], the son of Cnut the Great, until he died childless in 1042. Harald based his claim to the throne of England on an agreement made between Magnus and Harthacnut in 1038, which stated that if either died, the other would inherit the throne and lands of the deceased. When Harthacnut died, Magnus assumed the crown of Denmark and considered himself the lawful heir to Harthacnut. While [[Edward the Confessor]] had himself crowned English king in his absence, Magnus had planned to invade England in 1045, only to be forced to turn his fleet towards Denmark due to an uprising by Sweyn Estridsson. Although the threat was temporarily averted by Magnus's death in 1047, Edward's negotiations with his enemies throughout the 1050s gave Harald (as well as Sweyn Estridsson and [[William the Conqueror|William of Normandy]]) an impression that he was a possible heir to Edward. When Edward died in January 1066, he was to Harald's dismay succeeded by [[Harold Godwinson]], a son of one of Edward's advisors.<ref>Hjardar & Vike (2011) pp. 283\u2013284</ref>\n[[File:Harald III of Norway.jpg|thumb|right| 13th-century portrayal of Harald Hardrada, from ''The Life of King Edward the Confessor'' by the English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]]]]\nHarald's son [[Magnus II of Norway|Magnus]] had previously been involved in [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]]'s 1058 war against the English king with a Norwegian fleet, possibly indicating that Harald had tested the situation in England long before his 1066 invasion, only to find that he could not simultaneously be at war with Denmark and England.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 66\u201367</ref> After Edward's death, Harald allied himself with [[Tostig Godwinson]], Harold's brother, who had been deprived of the [[Earl of Northumbria|earldom of Northumbria]] by Edward in 1065.<ref name=\"vikingerikrig284\"/> According to various sources, Tostig may have asked both or either of William of Normandy and Sweyn Estridsson to assist him in invading England before turning to Harald. According to the sagas, Tostig finally pledged his support for Harald, including that of the \"majority of the chieftains\", at a meeting in Norway. Some historians doubt that this meeting took place, as [[William of Malmesbury]] claims that Tostig did not pledge his support for Harald until they met at the [[Humber]]. This would indicate that the invasion originally was Harald's plan alone, and that his joining of forces with Tostig was merely a later agreement when the two met for the first time in Scotland or Northumbria. Another proposal by historians is that a meeting did indeed take place in Norway, but instead with [[Copsi]]g, one of Tostig's early supporters and a fellow exile, as Tostig's mediator. If this is correct, it would both allow an agreement to have been made in Norway, and the first personal meeting between Harald and Tostig to have taken place in Britain.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 231\u2013240</ref> Indeed, ''Morkinskinna'' mentions that \"some men\" claimed that Tostig only had sent an emissary to Norway, while he still remained in France.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 163</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Fulford.png|thumb|Harald landing near York (left), and defeating the Northumbrian army (right), from the 13th century chronicle ''The Life of King Edward the Confessor'' by Matthew Paris.

In both places he was joined by several important lords, chieftains, and soldiers, including the [[Earl of Orkney|Earls of Orkney]], [[Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson]]. He next went to [[Dunfermline]], where he met with Tostig's ally [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] (and according to some sources, with Tostig)<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 250\u2013251</ref> who allocated him a couple thousand Scottish soldiers.<ref>Hjardar & Vike (2011) pp. 284\u2013285</ref> According to most contemporary sources, Harald and Tostig met at [[Tynemouth]] on 8 September, Harald with a total force of, at the most, around 10\u201315,000 men on 240\u2013300 [[longship]]s,<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 167</ref><ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 264\u2013265 & 269</ref> and Tostig with a mere 12 ships with soldiers.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 251\u2013252</ref> Not mentioned in the sagas, but accounted for by [[John of Worcester]], Tostig had departed from his exile in [[Flanders]] already in May or June. He had then raided villages along the southern coast of Britain from the [[Isle of Wight]] to [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. As Harold Godwinson gathered a large army in response, Tostig sailed north to meet with Harald, while Harold Godwinson remained in the south in expectation of invasion by William of Normandy,<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 242\u2013243</ref> who for a long time had openly claimed the English throne.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 165</ref>\n\n===Invasion and the Battle of Stamford Bridge===\nAfter embarking from Tynemouth, Harald and Tostig probably landed at the [[River Tees]].<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 252</ref> They then entered [[Cleveland, England|Cleveland]],<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 170</ref> and started plundering the coast. They encountered the first resistance at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], where Harald's demand for surrender was opposed. In the end, Harald resorted to burning down the town and this action led to other Northumbrian towns surrendering to him. After further raiding, Harald and Tostig sailed down the Humber, disembarking at [[Riccall]]. News of the invasion soon reached the earls [[Morcar|Morcar of Northumbria]] and [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]], and they fought against Harald's invading army two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of [[York]] at the [[Battle of Fulford]] on 20 September. The battle was a decisive victory for Harald and Tostig, and led York to surrender to their forces on 24 September.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 250\u2013261</ref> This would be the last time a Scandinavian army defeated English forces.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) p. 172</ref> The same day as York surrendered to Harald and Tostig, Harold Godwinson arrived with his army in [[Tadcaster]], just seven miles from the anchored Norwegian fleet at Riccall. From there, he probably scouted the Norwegian fleet, preparing a surprise attack. As Harald had left no forces in York, Harold Godwinson marched right through the town to [[Battle of Stamford Bridge|Stamford Bridge]].<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 267\u2013270</ref>\n[[File:Battle of Stamford Bridge, full.png|right|thumb|350px|Harald at Stamford Bridge. Matthew Paris may have [[attributed arms|attributed]] the axe to Harald due to its general Norse association, or the royal iconography around St. Olaf.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Fuglesang, Signe Horn|title=Bilder og bilders bruk i vikingtid og middelalder|year=1997|page=77|publisher=Norges forskningsr\u00e5d|language=Norwegian}}</ref> According to the sagas, Harald wore a blue tunic and helmet, wielded a sword, and ''[[Raven banner#Other|Land\u00f8y\u00f0an]]'' as his royal standard, but not his [[Mail (armour)|mail-shirt]] (\"Emma\") and shield, which was left at Riccall.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 199 & 276\u2013278 & 284 & 290</ref>]]\n\nEarly on 25 September, Harald and Tostig departed their landing place at Riccall with most of their forces, but left a third of their forces behind. They brought only light armour, as they expected to just meet the citizens of York, as they had agreed the day before, at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald.<ref>Tj\u00f8nn (2010) pp. 172\u2013174</ref> Once there Harald saw Godwinson's forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald's. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald's army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle in a state of ''[[berserker]]gang'', having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword.<ref>DeVries (1999) pp. 276\u2013296</ref><ref>Hjardar & Vike (2011) pp. 289\u2013291</ref>\n\nWhen the battle was almost over, some reserve forces from Riccall led by [[Eystein Orre]] finally appeared, but they were exhausted as they had run all the way. Eystein picked up Harald's fallen banner, the \"Landwaster\" (''Land\u00f8y\u00f0an''), and initiated a final counter-attack. Although they for a moment appeared to almost breach the English line, Eystein was suddenly killed, which left the rest of the men to flee from the battlefield.<ref name=\"Hjardar & Vike 2011 p. 291\">Hjardar & Vike (2011) p. 291</ref> Among those left at Riccall after the battle, who were allowed to return home peacefully by the English forces, was Harald's son Olaf.<ref>DeVries (1999) p. 296</ref><ref>Stenton (1971) p. 590</ref> Although sources state that Harald's remaining army only filled 20\u201325 ships on the return to Norway, it is likely that this number only accounts for the Norwegian forces. Most of the forces from Scotland and Orkney probably remained at Riccall throughout the battle (the earls Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson are certainly known to have been stationed there the entire time), and has not been counted in the traditional figure.<ref name=\"Hjardar & Vike 2011 p. 291\"/>\n\nHarold Godwinson's victory was short-lived, as only a few weeks later he was defeated by [[William the Conqueror]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]]. The fact that Harold had to make a forced march to fight Hardrada at Stamford Bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet the Norman invasion, all in less than three weeks, is widely seen as a primary factor in William's victory at Hastings.<ref>Stenton (1971) p. 592</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHarald is described by Snorri Sturluson to have been physically \"larger than other men and stronger\".<ref name=\"DeVries 1999 p. 40\"/> He is said to have had light hair and beard, a long \"upper beard\" (moustache), and that one of his eyebrows was somewhat higher situated than the other. He also reportedly had big hands and feet, and could measure five [[ell]]s in height. It is not known whether Snorri's description of Harald's physical appearance actually represents historical facts.<ref>Bagge (1990) pp. 187\u2013189</ref> The tall stature of and cried Harald is also substantiated by a story that relates that before the Battle of Stamford Bridge, Harold Godwinson offered Tostig back the earldom of Northumbria, and Harald \"six feet of the ground of England, or perhaps more seeing that he is taller than most men\" (according to [[Henry of Huntingdon]])<ref>{{Cite book|title=Battle 1066|author=Barclay, Cyril Nelson|year=1966|publisher=University of Michigan|page=35}}</ref> or \"six feet of English ground, or seven feet as he was taller than other men\" (according to Snorri Sturluson).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of England|author1=Carrington, C.

He was clearly interested in advancing Christianity in Norway, which can be seen by the continued building and improvement of churches throughout his reign.
