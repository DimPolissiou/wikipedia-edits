Pulney Andy, an English physician, who, in his letter to the 'Collector of Madras,' initially refused to sell his property owing to the difficulty with which he had purchased and developed the property. However, the South Indian Railway (SIR) Company, which was then operating train services to the south, persuaded him to sell the land, for which Andy claimed {{INRConvert|1|l}} as compensation. After acquiring the land, the SIR invited Henry Irwin, CIE (chief engineer), who did much of latter day [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic]] in Madras, and E. C. Bird, company architect, to design a building to suit the traffic need. After several alterations in the plan, the construction work began in September 1905 and was completed in 1908.<ref name=\"RedLetterDayForSR\">{{cite news  | last =  | first =  | coauthors =  | title   =Red-letter day for Southern Railway  | newspaper = The Hindu  | location = Chennai  | pages =  | language =  | publisher = The Hindu  | date = 11 June 2008  | url = http://www.hindu.com/2008/06/11/stories/2008061160021800.htm  | accessdate = 17 Jun 2012}}</ref> It was constructed by contractor T.

Upon hearing this news, Sambhaji started his preparations and took possession of the Panhala fort. He arrested the fort commander Vitthal Tryambak and senior minister Janardanpant Hanumante who were involved in the conspiracy. He also asked his father-in-law of Pilajirao Shirke to be ready with his forces at Shringarpur. Both sides were vying for the crucial support of [[Hambirrao Mohite]] the commander-in-chief of Maratha army.

Hambirrao was near [[Karad]] with his army of 20,000. Anaji and Moropant came to meet Hambirrao and asked for his support to arrest Sambhaji. Hambirrao refused and arrested both these ministers.

Sambhaji held a ceremony at Panhala to acknowledge Hambirrao's support. He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his wife mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place of 16th January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions. Peshwa Moropant had died meanwhile, his position was given to his son Nilopant Pingale. [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] was also pardoned but he was transferred to Mujumdar and his former post of Suranvis was given to [[Abaji Sondev]] <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />. In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant.

Soyarabai was guilty for her actions and commited suicide by poisoning herself. Sambhaji was very sad at the demise of Soyarabai which is evident from the letter sent by him to Bakre Shastri of Kudal wherein he mentions that 'Soyarabai had a pure heart'. Sambhaji also felt very sad for the death of Balaji Awji Chitnis in the process and built a temple in the memory of [[Balaji Awji Chitnis]] at Pali. <ref name=\":3\" /> <ref name=\":2\" /> <ref name=\":1\" /> <ref name=\":4\" />. \n\n==Military expeditions and conflicts==\nShortly following Sambhaji's accession, he began his military campaigns against neighboring states. Historians have been quick to note the distinction between the more tolerant and chivalrous practices of his father Shivaji, and the more pragmatic and brutal practices of Sambhaji. \n\n===Attack on Burhanpur===\nThe fort of Burhanpur was first in the charge of Bahadur khan who later gave it to Kakar Khan. Kakar was at the duty of collecting [[Jizya]] tax from the citizens. In order to accomplish the task, Kakar Khan destroyed more than 100 temples surrounding Burhanpur and conducting torture, plunder, killing, cutting of women's ears and men's eyes for the wealth. The Jizya was collected and stored captive at the Burhanpur fort.<ref>{|url=  http://informatonaboutsambhajiraje.blogspot.com/2016/10/maratha-yodhha-early-life-sambhaji-was.html?m=1}</ref>.Sambhaji plundered and ravaged [[Burhanpur]] in 1680.

Sambhaji then attempted a ruse, sending a party of his people to the Siddis, claiming to be defectors. They were allowed into the fort and planned to detonate the [[gunpowder magazine]] during a coming Maratha attack. However, one of the female defectors became involved with a Siddi man and he uncovered the plot, and the infiltrators were executed. The Maratha then attempted to build a stone [[causeway]] from the shore to the island, but were interrupted halfway through when the Mughal army moved to menace Raigad.

The Marathas seized the fort, seeking to turn it into a naval base, but in April 1682 were ejected from the fort by a detachment of 200 Portuguese.

He also asked his father-in-law of Pilajirao Shirke to be ready with his forces at Shringarpur.

Sambhaji held a ceremony at Panhala to acknowledge Hambirrao's support. He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his wife mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place of 16th January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions. Peshwa Moropant had died meanwhile, his position was given to his son Nilopant Pingale.

Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant.

Sambhaji then attempted a ruse, sending a party of his people to the Siddis, claiming to be defectors. They were allowed into the fort and planned to detonate the [[gunpowder magazine]] during a coming Maratha attack. However, one of the female defectors became involved with a Siddi man and he uncovered the plot, and the infiltrators were executed. The Maratha then attempted to build a stone [[causeway]] from the shore to the island, but were interrupted halfway through when the Mughal army moved to menace Raigad.

The Marathas seized the fort, seeking to turn it into a naval base, but in April 1682 were ejected from the fort by a detachment of 200 Portuguese. This incident led to a larger conflict between the two regional powers.<ref name=\"Ali1996\"/>{{rp|171}}\n\nThe [[History of Goa#Portuguese conquest and colonisation|Portuguese colony of Goa]] at that time provided supplies to the Mughals, allowed them to use the Portuguese ports in India and pass through their territory.

If the definition of a mountain range is stretched to include underwater mountains, then the [[Ocean Ridge]]s form the longest continuous mountain system on Earth, with a length of {{Convert|65000|km|mi|-2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/midoceanridge.html|title=The mid-ocean ridge is the longest mountain range on Earth|date=11 Jan 2013|publisher=US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Service}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions and categories==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}}\nThe mountain systems of the earth are characterized by a [[tree structure]], where mountain ranges can contain sub-ranges. The sub-range relationship is often expressed as a parent-child relationship. For example, the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of New Hampshire and the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] are sub-ranges of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Equivalently, the Appalachians are the parent of the White Mountains and Blue Ridge Mountains, and the White Mountains and the Blue Ridge Mountains are children of the Appalachians.\n\nThe parent-child expression extends to the sub-ranges themselves: the [[Sandwich Range]] and the [[Presidential Range]] are children of the White Mountains, while the Presidential Range is parent to the Northern Presidential Range and Southern Presidential Range.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}}[[File:Aerial photo of the Andes.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Andes]], the world's longest mountain range on the surface of a continent, seen from the air]]\nThe position of mountains influences climate, such as rain or snow. When air masses move up and over mountains, the air cools producing [[Orography|orographic]] precipitation (rain or snow). As the air descends on the leeward side, it warms again (in accordance with the [[adiabatic lapse rate]]) and is drier, having been stripped of much of its moisture. Often, a [[rain shadow]] will affect the leeward side of a range.<ref>{{cite web |title=Orographic precipitation |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/orographic-precipitation |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Erosion==\n{{RefImprove|date=October 2018}}\nMountain ranges are constantly subjected to [[erosion]]al forces which work to tear them down.  The [[Sedimentary basin|basins]] adjacent to an eroding mountain range are then filled with sediments which are buried and turned into [[sedimentary rock]]. Erosion is at work while the mountains are being uplifted until the mountains are reduced to low hills and plains. \n\nThe early [[Cenozoic]] uplift of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of Colorado provides an example. As the uplift was occurring some {{convert|10000|ft|m}} of mostly [[Mesozoic]] sedimentary [[stratum|strata]] were removed by erosion over the core of the mountain range and spread as sand and clays across the [[Great Plains]] to the east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/romo5/wegemann/sec6.htm|publisher=USGS|title=A Guide to the Geology of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024065844/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/romo5/wegemann/sec6.htm |archivedate=2012-10-24 }}</ref> This mass of rock was removed as the range was actively undergoing uplift. The removal of such a mass from the core of the range most likely caused further uplift as the region adjusted [[isostasy|isostatically]] in response to the removed weight.\n\nRivers are traditionally believed to be the principal cause of mountain range erosion, by cutting into bedrock and transporting sediment. Computer simulation has shown that as mountain belts change from tectonically active to inactive, the rate of erosion drops because there are fewer abrasive particles in the water and fewer landslides.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Egholm|first=David L.|last2=Knudsen|first2=Mads F.|last3=Sandiford|first3=Mike|title=Lifespan of mountain ranges scaled by feedbacks between landsliding and erosion by rivers|journal=Nature|volume=498|issue=7455|pages=475\u2013478|doi=10.1038/nature12218|pmid=23803847|year=2013|bibcode=2013Natur.498..475E}}</ref>\n\n==Extraterrestrial \"Montes\"==\n[[File:NH-Pluto-SputnikPlanum-HillaryMontes-NorgayMontes-20150714.jpg|thumb|[[Hillary Montes|Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Montes]] on Pluto (14 July 2015)]]\n[[File:Montes_Apenninus_AS15-M-1423.jpg|thumb|[[Montes Apenninus]] on the [[Moon]] was formed by an impact event.]]\n{{further|List of tallest mountains in the Solar System}}\nMountains on other planets and [[natural satellite]]s of the Solar System are often isolated and formed mainly by processes such as impacts, though there are examples of mountain ranges (or \"Montes\") somewhat similar to those on Earth.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.
