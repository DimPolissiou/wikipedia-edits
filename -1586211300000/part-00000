Combat operations were conducted by two offensive groups, the main blow was aimed towards the Don region. The troops of the Red Army were unable to carry out the assigned task, but their actions delayed the subsequent offensive of Denikin's army.\n\n== Prelude ==\nOn 3 July 1919, Anton Denikin issued a directive for an offensive against Moscow, planning to inflict the main blow by the [[Volunteer Army]] through Kursk, Orel, and Tula. Red Army troops conducted defensive battles on a front of some {{convert|1400|km|sp=us}} long and by the beginning of August were able to stop the advance of the Whites at [[Novoukrainka]], Romodan, [[Oboyan]], Liski, [[Borisoglebsk]], north [[Kamyshin]], Vladimirovka and [[Chyorny Yar, Astrakhan Oblast|Chyorny Yar]]. After this, the Red troops began to prepare to launch a counter-offensive.\n\n== Alignment of forces and plan of attack ==\nBy 15 August, the number of troops of the Southern Front of the Red Army, commanded by [[Vladimir Yegoryev]], was 150,500&nbsp;bayonets, 23,700&nbsp;sabers, 719&nbsp;guns, and 3,197&nbsp;machine guns. In the fortified areas there were an extra 35,000&nbsp;bayonets and sabers, 129&nbsp;guns, 184&nbsp;machine guns, and more than 50,000&nbsp;soldiers in reserve.\n\nThe AFSR forces operated under the general command of General [[Anton Denikin]], and were composed of the [[Don Army]], commanded by General [[Vladimir Sidorin]]; the [[Caucasus Army of VSUR|Caucasus Army]], commanded by General [[Pyotr Wrangel]]; and part of the [[Volunteer Army]], commanded by [[Vladimir May-Mayevsky]]. The total number of these troops was 100,960&nbsp;bayonets, 43,250&nbsp;sabers, and 303&nbsp;guns.\n\nThe main blow in the upcoming offensive was planned to be inflicted on [[Novocherkassk]] and [[Rostov-on-Don]] by the left flank of the Southern Front, in particular the Special group of [[Vasily Shorin]] composed of the [[9th Army (RSFSR)|9th]] and [[10th Army (RSFSR)|10th armies]] and the Cavalry Corps of [[Semyon Budyonny]]&nbsp;\u2013 52,500&nbsp;bayonets, 14,500&nbsp;sabers, 314&nbsp;guns, and 1,227&nbsp;machine guns. An auxiliary strike against [[Kupiansk]] was to be executed by the Special Group of [[Vladimir Selivachyov]] composed of the [[8th Army (RSFSR)|8th Army]], 3rd and 42nd Infantry Division of the [[13th Army (RSFSR)|13th Army]]&nbsp;\u2013 49,700&nbsp;bayonets, 4,700&nbsp;sabers, 268&nbsp;guns, and 1,381&nbsp;machine guns. The total length of the front of the offensive was {{convert|760|km|sp=us}}. The [[14th Army (RSFSR)|14th Army]] was to support the offensive of Selivachev's group, by attacking [[Lozovaya]].\n\nThe beginning of the counter-offensive of the Red Army was scheduled for 2\u20135 August, but by that time the preparation was not completed because of the slow transfer of reinforcements, reserves, weapons, ammunition and food supplies to the Southern Front. The planned grouping of troops did not provide sufficient forces and means yet to launch the attack.\n\nThe White Command became aware of the impending counteroffensive and preventive measures were taken. On 10&nbsp;August, the White Guard 4th Don Cavalry Corps, under [[Konstantin Mamontov]], broke through the Red front at the junction of the 8th and 9th Armies, and started operating in the rear of the Southern Front around Tambov. The actions of Mamontov's cavalry made it very difficult for the Red Army to prepare and execute the counter-offensive.\n\n== Progress of the operations ==\n\n=== Actions of the Shorin group ===\nOn 14 August, the troops of the Shorin group, with the support of the Volga detachment of the Volga-Kama flotilla\u201416&nbsp;boats, five cannodoks, one floating battery\u2014launched an offensive against the Don Army and the Caucasian Army, which numbered 12,300&nbsp;bayonets, 21,900&nbsp;sabers, 93&nbsp;guns, and 249&nbsp;machine guns. The troops of the 10th Army in cooperation with the Cavalry corps of Budyonny conducted an offensive against Kamyshin and Tsaritsyn, while the 9th Army attacked Ust-Khopyorskaya. By the end of August, the Cavalry corps of Budyonny had defeated General Sutulov's Cossack Division and together with the 10th Army struck a blow against the White troops in the village of Serebryakovo-Zelenovskaya, capturing four armored trains.\n\nIn early September, heavy fighting for [[Tsaritsyn]] unfolded. On 5\u20138 September, the troops of the 10th Army and units of the Cavalry Corps of the Budenny continued to attack. Under strong White fire, they stormed several times the trenches and wire fences, but due to heavy losses were forced to stop the offensive. On 9&nbsp;September, White troops launched an offensive by large infantry and cavalry forces with the support of 12&nbsp;batteries, armored cars and tanks against the 10th Army, and in the course of fierce fighting in several sectors forced parts of the 10th Army to retreat. By 11&nbsp;September, active fighting around Tsaritsyn stopped.\n\nThe command of the Southern Front decided to withdraw the Cavalry corps of Budenny from the 10th Army, in order to send him to [[Novokhopersk]] against Mamontov's Cavalry corps. At the same time, the commander of a newly formed cavalry corps, [[Filipp Mironov]], decided independently to march to the front against the troops of Denikin. This step was seen as rebellion, and the forces of the Cavalry corps of the Budyonny were sent to suppress it. On 13&nbsp;August, Mironov was arrested, and his 500&nbsp;men were disarmed.\n\nThe offensive of the Ninth Army developed slowly because of the stubborn resistance of the Don Army. Only by 21&nbsp;August, the 9th Army troops achieved a breakthrough and began to encroach upon parts of rivers Khopyor and Don. On 12&nbsp;September, the troops of the Ninth Army crossed the [[Khopyor River]] and managed to advance {{convert|150|to|180|km|sp=us}}. Further advance down the Don Bend failed.\n\n=== Selivachev group ===\nOn 15 August, Selivachev's group launched an offensive against a part of the Don Army and the right wing of the Volunteer Army, which numbered 20,500&nbsp;bayonets, 9,200&nbsp;sabers, 69&nbsp;guns, and 208&nbsp;machine guns. The main blow was inflicted by the Strike group\u20143rd and 42nd infantry divisions and cavalry brigade of the 13th Army, 12th, 15th, 16th, and 13th infantry divisions of the 8th Army\u2014at the junction of the Don and Volunteer armies. The remaining divisions moved in echelons and covered the flanks. The White troops had a strong right flank and an extended center.\n\nBy 27 August, the troops of the left flank of the Selivachev group had advanced {{convert|60|km|sp=us}}, occupying [[Novy Oskol]], [[Biryuch]] and [[Valuyki, Belgorod Oblast|Valuyki]]. On the right flank they advanced to [[Belgorod]]. In the center, after advancing {{convert|150|km|sp=us}}, they approached [[Kupiansk]], and came within {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} from Kharkov.\n\nBy 1&nbsp;September, the group's troops reached the line of Volchansk\u2013Kupiansk\u2013Valuyki\u2013Podgornoy station&nbsp;\u2013 north of Rossosh. However, the offensive of the Selivachev group happened without interaction with the Shorin group, along divergent lines, with put the Red troops at a disadvantage. Furthermore, the Mamontov group operated in the rear, breaking up communications and logistic support to both groups.\n\nThe White Army concentrated large forces on the flanks of the Selivachev group and on 26&nbsp;August, went on the offensive. From the Belgorod area to Koroch and Novy Oskol, two divisions of the [[1st Army Corps (AFSR)|1st Army Corps]] under [[Alexander Kutepov]], and the 3rd Kuban Cavalry under [[Andrei Shkuro|General Shkuro]], attacked. From the Karpenkov district\u2014Krasnoe, Samoteevka, Biryuch\u2014the 8th [[Plastun]] and 2nd Don divisions struck. With these attacks, the White Army tried to surround the main forces of Selivachev's group and defeat them. The Red troops stubbornly defended themselves by the flanks of the 12th and 42nd Infantry Divisions, and by 15&nbsp;September, retreated to the [[Seym River]], southwest of [[Stary Oskol]] and north of [[Novy Oskol]]. The 14th Army, in order to assist the Selivachev group, attempted to launch an offensive by crossing the Seym River, but did not achieve success and retreated.\n\n== Results ==\nThe August counteroffensive of the Southern Front of the Red Army did not achieve its goals. This was due to a number of reasons : in particular the lack of forces in the offensive groups, especially cavalry, and also the diversion of an important number of forces to fight the Mamontov Cavalry. The choice of the main attack in the direction of the Don region forced the Red forces to act in an environment with a hostile attitude of the local population. The advance of the two groups of the Southern Front was carried out in separate directions and in time, this enabled the White Army to repel them separately.\n\nNevertheless, the counteroffensive of the Red Army delayed the offensive of the Volunteer Army against [[Kursk]] and [[Oryol Governorate|Orel]], distracting the main forces of the [[Don Army]] and [[Caucasus Army of VSUR|Caucasus Army]]. The Red forces also managed to maintain communications between central Russia and the eastern regions of the country, ensuring the delivery of food and reserves from the east.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Battles of the Russian Civil War]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1919]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n |conflict    = Southern Front counteroffensive\n |partof      = the [[Southern Front of the Russian Civil War]]\n |image       = Denikin's Moscow Offensive.svg\n |date        = 14 August \u2013 12 September 1919\n |place       = [[Don Host Oblast|Don Host]]; [[Voronezh Governorate|Voronezh]]; [[Kursk Governorate|Kursk]]\n |result      = White victory\n |combatant1  = {{flagd|RUS|size=20px}} [[Armed Forces of South Russia|AFSR]]\n |combatant2  = {{flagd|RSFSR|size=20px}} [[Red Army]]\n |commander1  = [[Anton Denikin]]\n |commander2  = [[Vladimir Yegoryev]]\n |strength1   = 144,000\n |strength2   = 185,000\n |campaignbox = {{Southern Front of the Russian Civil War}}\n}}\n\nThe '''August counter-offensive of the Southern Front''' (14 August&nbsp;\u2013 12 September 1919) was an offensive during the [[Russian Civil War]] by the troops of the [[Southern Front (RSFSR)|Southern Front of the Red Army]] against the White Guard troops of [[Anton Denikin]].

On 10&nbsp;August, the White Guard 4th Don Cavalry Corps, under [[Konstantin Mamontov]], broke through the Red front at the junction of the 8th and 9th Armies, and started operating in the rear of the Southern Front around Tambov. The actions of Mamontov's cavalry made it very difficult for the Red Army to prepare and execute the counter-offensive.\n\n== Progress of the operations ==\n\n=== Actions of the Shorin group ===\nOn 14 August, the troops of the Shorin group, with the support of the Volga detachment of the Volga-Kama flotilla\u201416&nbsp;boats, five cannodoks, one floating battery\u2014launched an offensive against the Don Army and the Caucasian Army, which numbered 12,300&nbsp;bayonets, 21,900&nbsp;sabers, 93&nbsp;guns, and 249&nbsp;machine guns. The troops of the 10th Army in cooperation with the Cavalry corps of Budyonny conducted an offensive against Kamyshin and Tsaritsyn, while the 9th Army attacked Ust-Khopyorskaya. By the end of August, the Cavalry corps of Budyonny had defeated General Sutulov's Cossack Division and together with the 10th Army struck a blow against the White troops in the village of Serebryakovo-Zelenovskaya, capturing four armored trains.\n\nIn early September, heavy fighting for [[Tsaritsyn]] unfolded. On 5\u20138 September, the troops of the 10th Army and units of the Cavalry Corps of the Budenny continued to attack. Under strong White fire, they stormed several times the trenches and wire fences, but due to heavy losses were forced to stop the offensive. On 9&nbsp;September, White troops launched an offensive by large infantry and cavalry forces with the support of 12&nbsp;batteries, armored cars and tanks against the 10th Army, and in the course of fierce fighting in several sectors forced parts of the 10th Army to retreat. By 11&nbsp;September, active fighting around Tsaritsyn stopped.\n\nThe command of the Southern Front decided to withdraw the Cavalry corps of Budenny from the 10th Army, in order to send him to [[Novokhopersk]] against Mamontov's Cavalry corps. At the same time, the commander of a newly formed cavalry corps, [[Filipp Mironov]], decided independently to march to the front against the troops of Denikin. This step was seen as rebellion, and the forces of the Cavalry corps of the Budyonny were sent to suppress it. On 13&nbsp;August, Mironov was arrested, and his 500&nbsp;men were disarmed.  \n\nThe offensive of the Ninth Army developed slowly because of the stubborn resistance of the Don Army. Only by 21&nbsp;August, the 9th Army troops achieved a breaktrough and began to encroach upon parts of rivers Khopyor and Don. On 12&nbsp;September, the troops of the Ninth Army crossed the [[Khopyor River]] and managed to advance {{convert|150|to|180|km|sp=us}}. Further advance down the Don Bend failed.\n\n=== Selivachev group ===\nOn 15 August, Selivachev's group launched an offensive against a part of the Don Army and the right wing of the Volunteer Army, which numbered 20,500&nbsp;bayonets, 9,200&nbsp;sabers, 69&nbsp;guns, and 208&nbsp;machine guns. The main blow was inflicted by the Strike group\u20143rd and 42nd infantry divisions and cavalry brigade of the 13th Army, 12th, 15th, 16th, and 13th infantry divisions of the 8th Army\u2014at the junction of the Don and Volunteer armies. The remaining divisions moved in echelons and covered the flanks. The White troops had a strong right flank and an extended center.\n\nBy 27 August, the troops of the left flank of the Selivachev group had advanced {{convert|60|km|sp=us}}, occupying [[Novy Oskol]], [[Biryuch]] and [[Valuyki, Belgorod Oblast|Valuyki]]. On the right flank they advanced to [[Belgorod]]. In the center, after advancing {{convert|150|km|sp=us}}, they approached [[Kupiansk]], and came within {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} from Kharkov.\n\nBy 1&nbsp;September, the group's troops reached the line of Volchansk\u2013Kupiansk\u2013Valuyki\u2013Podgornoy station&nbsp;\u2013 north of Rossosh. However, the offensive of the Selivachev group happened without interaction with the Shorin group, along divergent lines, with put the Red troops at a disadvantage. Furthermore, the Mamontov group operated in the rear, breaking up communications and logistic support to both groups.\n\nThe White Army concentrated large forces on the flanks of the Selivachev group and on 26&nbsp;August, went on the offensive. From the Belgorod area to Koroch and Novy Oskol, two divisions of the [[1st Army Corps (AFSR)|1st Army Corps]] under [[Alexander Kutepov]], and the 3rd Kuban Cavalry under [[Andrei Shkuro|General Shkuro]], attacked. From the Karpenkov district\u2014Krasnoe, Samoteevka, Biryuch\u2014the 8th [[Plastun]] and 2nd Don divisions struck. With these attacks, the White Army tried to surround the main forces of Selivachev's group and defeat them. The Red troops stubbornly defended themselves by the flanks of the 12th and 42nd Infantry Divisions, and by 15&nbsp;September, retreated to the [[Seym River]], southwest of [[Stary Oskol]] and north of [[Novy Oskol]]. The 14th Army, in order to assist the Selivachev group, attempted to launch an offensive by crossing the Seym River, but did not achieve success and retreated.\n\n== Results ==\nThe August counteroffensive of the Southern Front of the Red Army did not achieve its goals. This was due to a number of reasons : in particular the lack of forces in the offensive groups, especially cavalry, and also the diversion of an important number of forces to fight the Mamontov Cavalry. The choice of the main attack in the direction of the Don region forced the Red forces to act in an environment with a hostile attitude of the local population. The advance of the two groups of the Southern Front was carried out in separate directions and in time, this enabled the White Army to repel them separately.\n\nNevertheless, the counteroffensive of the Red Army delayed the offensive of the Volunteer Army against [[Kursk]] and [[Oryol Governorate|Orel]], distracting the main forces of the [[Don Army]] and [[Caucasus Army of VSUR|Caucasus Army]]. The Red forces also managed to maintain communications between central Russia and the eastern regions of the country, ensuring the delivery of food and reserves from the east.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Battles of the Russian Civil War]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1919]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: breaktrough \u2192 breakthrough", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Front_counteroffensive"}

During the 1960s, she made several guest appearances on ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' as well as other variety shows such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', and ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''.\n\nIn 1964, she appeared as Minnie in her first television dramatic role in the episode \"Nightingale for Sale\" on [[Craig Stevens (actor)|Craig Stevens]]'s short-lived series ''[[Mr. Broadway]]''.\n\nIn December 1992, American Public Television aired ''Liza Minnelli Live from Radio City Music Hall'' produced by Phil Ramone and Chris Giordano. The show received six Emmy nominations and won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics, awarded to Fred Ebb and John Kander.\n\nMuch later in her career, Minnelli made guest appearances on shows such as ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'' and ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]''. In the UK, she appeared on the [[Ruby Wax]], [[Graham Norton]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] shows, and in October 2006, participated in a comedy skit on [[Charlotte Church]]'s show and was featured on [[Michael Parkinson]]'s show.\n\nIn November 2009, American Public Television aired ''Liza's at the Palace'', taped from September 30 to October 1, 2009 in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand's Hollywood Theatre.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.aptonline.org/catalog.nsf/bpt/A29BB5F22345E3F385257631006757C9?OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119075717/https://www.aptonline.org/catalog.nsf/bpt/A29BB5F22345E3F385257631006757C9?OpenDocument |archive-date=November 19, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The executive producers of the taping, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, were previously involved with the 2005 rerelease of 1972's Emmy Award- and Peabody Award-winning ''Liza with a 'Z'''.<ref>Cox, Gordon (September 17, 2009) [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008782.html?categoryid=15&cs=1 Liza's 'Palace' to get TV reprise]{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Variety''.</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nMinnelli returned to Broadway in 1997, taking over the title role in the musical ''[[Victor/Victoria (musical)|Victor/Victoria]]'', replacing [[Julie Andrews]]. In his review, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic Ben Brantley wrote \"her every stage appearance is perceived as a victory of show-business stamina over psychic frailty. She asks for love so nakedly and earnestly, it seems downright vicious not to respond.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brantley|first1=Ben|title=For Liza Minnelli, the Affection of Her Fans Is the Milk of Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/14/theater/for-liza-minnelli-the-affection-of-her-fans-is-the-milk-of-life.html|accessdate=June 17, 2015|work=New York Times|date=January 14, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAfter a serious case of [[viral encephalitis]] in 2000, doctors predicted that Minnelli would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair and perhaps not be able to speak again. However, taking vocal and dance lessons daily (especially with [[Sam Harris (singer)|Sam Harris]], Ron Lewis, and Angela Bacari), she managed to recover. She appeared on a September 19, 2001, episode of ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' notable because it was Rosie's first show back following the September 11th attacks. Despite having vocal surgery shortly prior, she sang her signature song, \"New York, New York,\" and received an enthusiastic ovation. She also returned to the stage in 2001 when asked by long-time friend [[Michael Jackson]] to perform at Madison Square Garden in New York City where she sang \"Never Never Land\" and the televised \"You Are Not Alone\" at the [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special]] concert produced by future husband [[David Gest]]. Minnelli told reporters: \"I am stable as a table.\"\n\nGest was so impressed with Minnelli's stamina and ability to stun audiences that he produced her in ''[[Liza's Back]]'' in Spring 2002, performing to rave reviews in London and New York City. The tour featured a tribute to her mother: after years of declining fans' pleas for her to sing Garland's signature song \"[[Over The Rainbow]]\", she concluded Act 1 with the final refrain of her mother's anthem to an instant ovation. Amongst performing her classic hits, other numbers unreleased in the album version included \"I Believe You\" by [[The Carpenters]]; a rap version of \"Liza with a Z\"; \"Yes\"; and [[Mary J. Blige]]'s [[Family Affair (Mary J. Blige song)|\"Family Affair\"]].\n\n[[VH1]] signed Minnelli and Gest in 2002 to appear in a reality show titled ''[[Liza and David]]''. The pilot episode was filmed following the couple around as they prepared for a party at their home, with a guest list including [[Ray Charles]], [[Luther Vandross]], [[Isaac Mizrahi]], [[Anastacia]], and others. The show was cancelled shortly after the pilot episode was filmed due to a dispute between VH1, Gest and Minnelli, and never aired. Recordings of the pilot episode still exist.\n\nFrom 2003 through 2005, she appeared as a recurring character on the Emmy Award-winning TV sitcom ''[[Arrested Development]]'' as [[Lucille Austero]] (also known as \"Lucille 2\"), the lover of both the sexually and socially awkward [[Buster Bluth]] and Buster's brother [[Gob Bluth|Gob]]. Minnelli appeared in the role for the show's fourth season in 2013.\n\nIn September 2006, Minnelli made a guest appearance on the long-running drama ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'' in \"Masquerade\", a Halloween-themed episode, broadcast on October 31, 2006.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-09-29-minelli_x.htm Minnelli to guest star on 'Law & Order'] October 1, 2006</ref>\n\nMinnelli also completed guest vocals on [[My Chemical Romance]]'s 2006 concept album ''[[The Black Parade]],'' portraying \"Mother War,\" a dark conception of the main character's mother in the song \"[[Mama (My Chemical Romance song)|Mama]]\".<ref>Brittany Spanos, \"Flashback: My Chemical Romance Recruit Liza Minnelli for ''Mama''\",\n''Rolling Stone'' (19 Dec. 2019); online at https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/flashback-my-chemical-romance-recruits-liza-minnelli-for-black-parade-mama-928847/</ref>\n\n[[File:Liza Minnelli.jpg|thumb|Minnelli at ''The Heart Truth Fashion Show'' 2008]]\nMinnelli returned to Broadway in a new solo concert at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] titled ''[[Liza's at The Palace...!]]'', which ran from December 3, 2008, through January 4, 2009.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/124222.html Liza's at The Palace ...!

She made a starring appearance in December 2010 in ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.\n\nAlso in 2010, Minnelli released an album of a number of American standards \"unplugged\" with long-time collaborator Billy Stritch, showing a sultrier and softer, more interpretive side to her artistry. The songs are said to have been recorded several years prior and later released as the album ''Confessions''.\n\nOn June 14, 2012, Minnelli headlined at [[Hampton Court Palace Festival]].

However, taking vocal and dance lessons daily (especially with [[Sam Harris (singer)|Sam Harris]], Ron Lewis, and Angela Bacari), she managed to recover. She appeared on a September 19, 2001, episode of ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' notable because it was Rosie's first show back following the September 11th attacks. Despite having vocal surgery shortly prior, she sang her signature song, \"New York, New York,\" and received an enthusiastic ovation. She also returned to the stage in 2001 when asked by long-time friend [[Michael Jackson]] to perform at Madison Square Garden in New York City where she sang \"Never Never Land\" and the televised \"You Are Not Alone\" at the [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special]] concert produced by future husband [[David Gest]]. Minnelli told reporters: \"I am stable as a table.\"\n\nGest was so impressed with Minnelli's stamina and ability to stun audiences that he produced her in ''[[Liza's Back]]'' in Spring 2002, performing to rave reviews in London and New York City. The tour featured a tribute to her mother: after years of declining fans' pleas for her to sing Garland's signature song \"[[Over The Rainbow]]\", she concluded Act 1 with the final refrain of her mother's anthem to an instant ovation. Amongst performing her classic hits, other numbers unreleased in the album version included \"I Believe You\" by [[The Carpenters]]; a rap version of \"Liza with a Z\"; \"Yes\"; and [[Mary J. Blige]]'s [[Family Affair (Mary J. Blige song)|\"Family Affair\"]].\n\n[[VH1]] signed Minnelli and Gest in 2002 to appear in a reality show titled ''[[Liza and David]]''.

The band spent their early years, from 1999 to 2003, touring Asia, Europe, and America continuously, and released two studio albums, ''Under the Pipal Tree'' (2001) and ''One Step More and You Die'' (2002) on the [[Tzadik Records]] and Music Mine Inc. record labels, respectively. From 2004 to 2007, Mono signed to [[Temporary Residence Limited]], released two more studio albums, ''Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined'' (2004) and ''You Are There'' (2006), and toured worldwide in their support. In 2008, the band took a break, returning one year later with a new studio album, ''Hymn to the Immortal Wind'' (2009), also on Temporary Residence Limited.

The band spent the bulk of the year composing more music and performing at various houses around Tokyo, in the neighbourhoods of Setagaya, [[Shimokitazawa]], and [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]]. Mono also travelled to the [[United States]] to play a one-off show in November at the [[Mercury Lounge]] in [[New York City]]; a show which was later described by Paul Wheeler of rockofjapan.com as having a \"big beautiful sound that [...] naturally [expanded] through each song.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockofjapan.com/&others.live-7.html |title=& Others-live (M-N) |publisher=Rockofjapan.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref>\n\n===''Under the Pipal Tree'': 2001===\nFollowing the release of the ''Hey, You'' extended play, Mono spent the next year playing shows throughout their native Japan, as well as playing several shows in [[New York City]] and [[Sweden]]. The band also made an appearance at the 2001 [[South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. Between performing in Japan, Mono recorded their first studio album, ''[[Under the Pipal Tree]]'' at Studio Take-1 and Forty-4 in Tokyo. The majority of the tracks were recorded live (a trend which the band would adopt for all subsequent studio albums) in one day, the recording session of which was funded by experimental American musician [[John Zorn]], with the band handling production duties. The album featured two previously released tracks (from the ''Hey, You'' extended play), as well as six original compositions. The album was released worldwide through [[New York City]] record label [[Tzadik Records|Tzadik]], owned and operated by John Zorn.\n\n===''One Step More and You Die'': 2002\u20132003===\nAfter the release of ''Under the Pipal Tree'', the band spent the next year touring Japan and the United States, also visiting Germany and Taiwan in support of the album, as well as composing new material inspired by the tour. In June 2002, between shows in Japan, the band recorded their second studio album, ''[[One Step More and You Die]]'' at Little Bach and Sound City studios in Tokyo, with Mono again handling production duties. The album was released in Japan in October of that year on Japanese record label Music Mine Inc.

The band spent the bulk of the year composing more music and performing at various houses around Tokyo, in the neighbourhoods of Setagaya, [[Shimokitazawa]], and [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]]. Mono also travelled to the [[United States]] to play a one-off show in November at the [[Mercury Lounge]] in [[New York City]]; a show which was later described by Paul Wheeler of rockofjapan.com as having a \"big beautiful sound that [...] naturally [expanded] through each song.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockofjapan.com/&others.live-7.html |title=& Others-live (M-N) |publisher=Rockofjapan.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref>\n\n===''Under the Pipal Tree'': 2001===\nFollowing the release of the ''Hey, You'' extended play, Mono spent the next year playing shows throughout their native Japan, as well as playing several shows in [[New York City]] and [[Sweden]]. The band also made an appearance at the 2001 [[South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. Between performing in Japan, Mono recorded their first studio album, ''[[Under the Pipal Tree]]'' at Studio Take-1 and Forty-4 in Tokyo. The majority of the tracks were recorded live (a trend which the band would adopt for all subsequent studio albums) in one day, the recording session of which was funded by experimental American musician [[John Zorn]], with the band handling production duties. The album featured two previously released tracks (from the ''Hey, You'' extended play), as well as six original compositions. The album was released worldwide through [[New York City]] record label [[Tzadik Records|Tzadik]], owned and operated by John Zorn.\n\n===''One Step More and You Die'': 2002\u20132003===\nAfter the release of ''Under the Pipal Tree'', the band spent the next year touring Japan and the United States, also visiting Germany and Taiwan in support of the album, as well as composing new material inspired by the tour. In June 2002, between shows in Japan, the band recorded their second studio album, ''[[One Step More and You Die]]'' at Little Bach and Sound City studios in Tokyo, with Mono again handling production duties. The album was released in Japan in October of that year on Japanese record label Music Mine Inc. The band spent most of 2003 touring in support of the album, returning to Japan, the United States, Sweden, and visiting Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom for the first time.\n\n===''Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined'': 2004===\nMono's next release was a collaboration with Japanese musician Aki Onda; whom the band met while touring New York in 2002. The band, Onda, and several notable members of the New York experimental music scene (including [[DJ Olive]], [[Jackie-O Motherfucker]], and [[Loren Connors]]) remixed ''One Step More and You Die''. The album, titled ''[[New York Soundtracks]]'', was released in February 2004 on Human Highway, Mono's own record label, and a successor to Forty-4.\n\nIn January 2004, the band began a long partnership with Chicagoan recording engineer [[Steve Albini]], recording their third studio album at Electrical Audio Engineering in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The album, titled ''[[Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined]]'' was released in April 2004 on Human Highway in Japan, and on Rykodisk in Europe and Temporary Residence Limited in the United States later in the year.
