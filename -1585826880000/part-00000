From the 14th century onwards, it developed as the provincial town of Vaslui, with a population that fluctuated considerably in the following centuries. The name of Vaslui appears first in a Polish document from 1375, referring to [[Karijotas|Koriat]]'s son [[Yuri Koriatovich]]. The name ''Vaslui'' was also mentioned in 1435, in connection with the accession of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Ilia\u015f of Moldavia|Ilia\u0219]] to the [[Moldavia]]n throne. The town was burned to the ground in 1439 and 1440 when [[Tatars in Romania|Tatars]] invaded Moldavia.\n\n[[File:Cl\u0103dire Vaslui.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Building from the medieval Princely Court historical ensemble in Vaslui]]\n\nThe peak of Vaslui's importance was in the 15th century, when it was a second-rank capital of Moldavia, during the reign of [[Stephen the Great]] (r. 1457-1504) and its population approached that of the neighbouring [[Ia\u0219i]]. In 1475, Prince Stephen won his [[Battle of Vaslui|greatest battle]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the Vaslui area. Once the Moldavian capital was moved from [[Suceava]] to Ia\u0219i and the southern town of [[B\u00e2rlad]] became an administrative center of southern Moldavia, Vaslui declined for the next three centuries to eventually become a local [[borough]] (''[[t\u00e2rg]]'').\n \nThere once was a fairly large [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] community in the city of Vaslui. Its arrival from [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] during the second half of the 19th century gave a new impetus to local economic development. In 1899, Jews formed 37% of the population, and Vaslui was home to the ''[[Vasloi (Hasidic dynasty)|Vasloi]]'' [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] dynasty. However, waves of [[pogrom]]s, associated with the [[Holocaust]] (''see [[Romania during World War II]] and [[Holocaust in Romania]]'') as well as [[Aliyah|emigration]] to [[Israel]] during Romania's [[Communist Romania|communist period]] decimated this population.\n\n[[Romania during World War II|During World War II]], the [[Stephen the Great Monument]] was relocated from [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] to Vaslui. On 22 August 1944, Vaslui was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[2nd Ukrainian Front]] in the course of the [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive]].\n\nThe population of Vaslui grew steadily again after 1968, when the town was proclaimed as the administrative center of Vaslui County, with immigration from the neighbouring countryside, attracted by the industries set up by the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]].\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the last census, from 2011, there were 55,407 people living within the city of Vaslui,<ref name=\"census\">{{cite web | url = http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rpl_2011_populatia-pe-categorii-de-localitati.xls | title = Population at 20 October 2011 | date = January 2014 | accessdate = 18 June 2016 | publisher = [[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|INSSE]] | language = Romanian}}</ref> making it the 40th largest city in Romania.

The [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma minority]] lives compactly in the southwestern [[suburb]]s of [[Rediu, Vaslui|Rediu]] and [[Brodoc]], in the southwestern part of the main town (in the neighbourhoods around Traian Street) and also scattered in the rest of the locality.

Specifically it asserts that reality exists as the summation of social perceptions and expression; and that the reality which is perceived is the only reality worth consideration. This is accompanied by the corollaries that any perceived reality is valid, that reality is subject to manipulation via control over social perceptions and expressions.\n\nThe social constructionist movement emerged in relation to both criticism and rejection of [[Objectivism]] developed by Russian-American writer [[Ayn Rand]]. Specifically, in the assumption of a positivist basis for knowledge; which is to say that social constructionism rejects the notion that empirical facts can be known about reality, where as objectivism is defined by it. Though not explicitly reliant on it, much literature on the subject of social constructionism focuses on its relationship in many facets to hierarchy and power. This intimacy demonstrates the close inspirational source of [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine, as utilized in the works of Foucault and his writings on discourse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/fouc-pol/|title=Foucault, Michel: Political Thought {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nThe work [[The Blank Slate]] of Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], the demonstrate the existence of socially constructed categories such as \"money, [[tenure]], [[citizenship]], decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States.\" which \"exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist.\" However, they are not a support of the Social Constructionism as the principle lens through which to understand reality, but rather a specific context for particular social phenomena. Instead, the autonomy and biologically informed nature of human existence.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | author-link = Steven Pinker | chapter = In touch with reality | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3_UAeo8Dh0C&pg=PA310 | title = The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature | page = 202 | publisher = Allen Lane, Penguin Books | location = London | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780713996722 }}</ref> In this manner, Pinker explicitly contradicts social constructionist scholars Marecek, Crawford & Popp in \"On the Construction of Gender, Sex, and Sexualities\", who deny the autonomy of the individual, as well as assert a variation of the [[Tabula rasa]] theory of thinking, in that knowledge and meaning are generated exclusively as a collective effort and that the individual is incapable of doing so independently. Which therefore assets that the perception of the creation of independent meaning is an illusion created by manipulation of social perceptions and expressions.\n\nAlsop, Fitzsimmons & Lennon also note that the constructionist accounts of gender creation can be divided into two main streams:<ref name=\"Alsop_Theorizing\">{{cite book | last1 = Alsop | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Fitzsimons | first2 = Annette | last3 = Lennon | first3 = Kathleen | chapter = The social construction of gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zwxuGrcA_RgC | title = Theorizing gender | pages = 64&ndash;93 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745619446 }}</ref>\n# ''Materialist theories'', which underline the structural aspects of the social environment that are responsible for perpetuating certain gender roles;\n# ''Discursive theories'', which stress the creation, through language and culture, of meanings that are associated with gender.\n\nThey also argue that both the materialist and discursive theories of social construction of gender can be either [[Essentialism|essentialist]] or [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]]. This means that some of these theories assume a clear biological division between women and men when considering the social creation of masculinity and femininity, while other contest the assumption of the biological division between the sexes as independent of social construction.\n\n===Gender===\n{{main|Gender}}\nHistorically gender was used as means describing the distinction between the biological sex and socialized aspects of femininity and masculinity.<ref name=\"Marecek, Crawford & Popp\">{{cite book | last1 = Marecek | first1 = Jeanne | last2 = Crawford | first2 = Mary | last3 = Popp | first3 = Danielle | chapter = On the construction of gender, sex, and sexualities | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-009 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 192&ndash;216 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}</ref> According to West and Zimmerman, is not a personal trait; it is \"an emergent feature of social situations: both as an outcome of and a rationale for various social arrangements, and as a means of legitimating one of the most fundamental divisions of society.\"<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\">{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&ndash;151 | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]\n:* {{cite book | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | chapter = Doing gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PA3 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | pages = 3&ndash;25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref>{{rp|126}}\n\nAs a social construct, gender is considered an achieved status by feminist theory, typically (though not exclusively) one which is achieved very early in childhood. The view as achieved is supported by the contemporary constructionist perspective, as proposed by Fenstermaker and West, asserts regarding gender as an activity (\"doing\") of utilizing normative prescriptions and beliefs about sex categories based on situational variables. These \"gender activities\" constitute sets of behavior, such as masculine and feminine, which are associated with their sexual counterpart and thus define concepts such as \"man\" and \"woman\" respectively. It is noted, however, that the perception as masculine or feminine is not limited or guaranteed to match the expression's typical or intended nature. Hence, gender can be understood as external to the individual, consisting of a series of ongoing judgements and evaluations by others, as well as of others.\n[[File:Sushi Rolls not Gender Roles (32945717780).jpg|thumb|alt=|A photo taken during a rally/march that displays a woman holding a sign stating \"Sushi Rolls Not Gender Roles\".]]\n\n====Gender roles====\n[[Gender roles]] are a continuation of the gender status, consisting of other achieved statuses that are associated with a particular gender status.

This is not to imply that participation in gender performativity can not correspond to pressure to fulfill a gender role, nor that fulfillment of a gender role can not satisfy the desire for gender performativity. The distinction refers primarily to context and motivation, rather than particular behaviors and consequences- which are often closely linked.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Judith|date=December 1988|title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3207893?origin=crossref|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=40|issue=4|pages=519|doi=10.2307/3207893}}</ref>\n\nIn some subdomains of feminism, such as [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] feminism, gender is a major though not solitary axis along which factors of oppression are considered, as expressed by Dr Berkowitz, who wrote \"The gender order is hierarchical in that, overall, men dominate women in terms of power and privilege; yet multiple and conflicting sources of power and oppression are intertwined, and not all men dominate all women. Intersectionality theorizes how gender intersects with race, ethnicity, social class, sexuality, and nation in variegated and situationally contingent ways\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nDr Berkowitz also asserts that gender at large, especially gender roles, contribute greatly as a prolific and potent avenue by which manipulations of social perceptions and expression manifest reality. Specifically, a reality in which women are typically oppressed by men within a social structure that establishes roles for women, which are of explicitly lesser capacity for accruing and exercising arbitrary power. The system which manifest and exercises this power, is typically referred to as \"patriarchy\". To clarify, the term arbitrary here is used to denote the source of power as being derived from status as feminist theory describes it. The particular model of patriarchy prescribed, does not make any distinction of stratification or power originating from competence or prestige.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Berkowitz, D., Manohar, N., & Tinkler, J.

Gender identity refers to an individual's psychological sense of one's gender as male, female, or other. Individuals whose sex assigned at birth is opposite to the gender they know themselves to be are often referred to as transgender, although this term is also used as an umbrella term for individuals whose sex assigned at birth does not match their gender identity in a myriad of other ways (Turban, Ferraiolo, Martin, & Olezeski, [113]). An individual assigned male at birth who identifies as female is typically referred to as a transgender woman/girl, and an individual assigned female at birth who identifies as male is typically referred to as a transgender man/boy. In the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM\u20105), the diagnosis of gender dysphoria refers to individuals who experience clinical distress secondary to an incongruence between their sex assigned at birth and their gender identity.

LaFrance, Paluck and Brescoll note that as a term, \"gender identity\" allows individuals to express their attitude towards and stance in relation to their current status as either women or men. Turning the scope of gender from a social consensus to objectivity to one's self-identification with a certain gender expression leaves much more space for describing variation among individuals.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = LaFrance | first1 = Marianne | last2 = Paluck | first2 = Elizabeth Levy  | last3 = Brescoll | first3 = Victoria | chapter = Sex changes: a current perspective on the psychology of gender | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-014 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 328&ndash;344 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}</ref>\n\n=====Intersections of gender identity with other identities=====\n\nGender is constructed for an individual based on the gendered interactions that the individual has with others, as well as, the other identities or roles they may hold. Gender, race, class, and other oppressions are all potential omnirelevant categories, though they are not all identically salient in every kind of social relationship where inequality is present.{{Clarify|date=August 2014}} Multiple oppressions are not seen as having \"additive\" or \"multiplicative\" effects but are seen as simultaneously depending on each other to create a unique form of oppression. Although West and Fenstermaker do not elaborate on exactly how intersectionality can be incorporated into social constructionist theory, they do say that intersecting social identities are constant \"interactional accomplishments\".{{rp|96}}\n\nWhile men and women are held accountable for normative conceptions of gender, this accountability can differ in content based on ethnicity, race, age, class, etc. Hurtado argues that white women and women of color experience gender differently because of their relationship to males of different races and that both groups of women have traditionally been used to substantiate male power in different ways.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hurtado | first = A\u00edda | title = Relating to privilege: seduction and rejection in the subordination of white women and women of color | journal = Signs: Women in Culture and Society| volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 833&ndash;855 | doi =  10.1086/494546| jstor = 3174686  | date = Summer 1989 | ref = harv }} [https://www.academia.edu/18709632/Relating_to_privilege_Seduction_and_rejection_in_the_subordination_of_white_women_and_women_of_color|doi=10.1086/494546 Pdf.]</ref> Some women of color are subordinated through rejection, or denial of the \"patriarchal invitation to privilege\".<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\">{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Power, inequality, and the accomplishment of gender: an ethnomethodological view | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PR5 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | page = 52 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref> For instance, some white men may see women of color as workers and objects of sexual aggression; this would allow the men to display power and sexual aggression without the emotional attachment that they have to white women.

West and Fenstermaker conclude that doing gender involves different versions of accountability, depending on women's \"relational position\" to white men.<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\" />\n\n====Gender as accomplishment====\n\nGender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not simply what one is, but what one does \u2013 it is actively produced within social interactions. Gender is an accomplishment : \"the activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex category\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|127}} People do not have to be in mixed gender groups or in groups at all for the performance of gender to occur; the production of gender occurs with others and is even performed alone, in the imagined presence of others. [[Doing gender|\"Doing\" gender]] is not just about conforming to stereotypical gender roles \u2013 it is the active engagement in any behavior that is gendered, or behavior that may be evaluated as gendered.\n\nThe performance of gender varies given the context: time, space, social interaction, etc. The enactment of gender roles is context dependent \u2013 roles  are \"situated identities\" instead of \"master identities\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|131}} The sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself with what people \"know\" as \"reality\" in their everyday, non- or pre-theoretical lives.

In other words, by doing gender, we reinforce the essential categories of gender \u2013 that there are only two categories that are mutually exclusive. The idea that men and women are essentially different is what makes men and women behave in ways that appear essentially different. Though sex categorization is based on biological sex, it is maintained as a category through socially constructed displays of gender (for example, you could identify a transgender person as female when in fact she is assigned male at birth).\n\nInstitutions also create normative conceptions of gender. In other words, gender is simultaneously created and maintained \u2013 \"both a process and a product, medium and outcome of such power relations\".<ref name=\"Mumby\">{{cite journal | last = Mumby | first = Dennis K. | title = Organizing men: power, discourse, and the social construction of masculinity(s) in the workplace | journal = [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 164&ndash;183, 169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2885.1998.tb00216.x | date = May 1998 | ref = harv }}</ref> In his examination of blue and white-collar workers, Mumby<ref name=\"Mumby\"/> argued that hegemonic or dominant masculinity provides a standard of acceptable behavior for men, and at the same time, is the product of men's behavior. This can be said for constructions of any identity in certain contexts (e.g. femininity, race, Black femininity, etc.).\n\n====Accountability====\n\nPeople hold themselves and each other accountable for their presentations of gender (how they 'measure up'). They are aware that others may evaluate and characterize their behavior. This is an interactional process (not just an individual one). Social constructionism asserts that gender is a category that people evaluate as omnirelevant to social life.<ref>{{cite book | last = Garfinkel | first = Harold | title = Studies in ethnomethodology | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | origyear = 1967 | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745600055 }}</ref> Gender as omnirelevant means that people can always be judged by what they do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations.\n\nAccountability can apply to behaviors that do conform to cultural conceptions as well as those behaviors that deviate \u2013 it is the ''possibility'' of being held accountable that is important in social constructionism. For example, Stobbe examined the rationale that people gave for why there were small numbers of women in the auto industry. Men cited the idea that such dirty work was unsuitable for women and women were unable to train because of family duties. Stobbe argues that the male workers created a [[machismo]] masculinity to distinguish themselves from women who might have been qualified to work in the auto shop. Women who do work in male-dominated professions have to carefully maintain and simultaneously balance their femininity and professional credibility.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00265.x |title=Doing Machismo: Legitimating Speech Acts as a Selection Discourse |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=105\u2013123 |year=2005 |last1=Stobbe |first1=Lineke |url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/33804/1/178738.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00263.x |title=The Third Sex: Women Leaders in Australian Agriculture |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |pages=73\u201388 |year=2005 |last1=Pini |first1=Barbara }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/0959353505051728 |title=Making Sense of Gender, Age, Power and Disciplinary Position: Intersecting Discourses in the Academy |journal=Feminism & Psychology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=189\u2013208 |year=2016 |last1=S\u00f8ndergaard |first1=Dorte Marie }}</ref>\n\nEven though gender seems more salient in some situations \u2013 for instance, when a woman enters a male-dominated profession \u2013 gender categories also become salient in contexts in which gender is less obvious.

People have preconceived notions about what particular racial groups look like (although there is no biological component to this categorization). Accountability is interactional because it does not occur solely within the individual. It is also institutional because individuals may be held accountable for their behaviors by institutions or by others in social situations, as a member of any social group (gender, race, class, etc.).<ref name=\"F&W_Institutional\" />{{rp|96}} This notion of accountability makes gender dynamic because what is considered appropriate behavior for men and women changes and is reproduced over time and is reproduced differently depending on context.

This outdated perception, according to Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which she unites the concepts of [[performativity]] and gender. In chapter one of the text, Butler introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in stating that \"gender proves to be performance\u2014that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = [https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 25] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | origyear = 1990 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415924993 | url = https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 }}</ref> In demystifying this concept, Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the terms gender performance and gender performativity. In doing so, Butler states in an interview: \"When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken on a role; we're acting in some way\u2026To say that gender is performative is a little different\u2026For something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and walk and speak and talk that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman\u2026we act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or simply something that is true about us. Actually, it is a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time.\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= 6 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 June 2016 | title= Judith Butler: Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc}}</ref> Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead, what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what produces the individual. Specifically, Butler approvingly quotes Nietzsche's claim that \"there is no 'being' behind doing\u2026 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed \u2013 the deed is everything.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = 25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}</ref> Thus, the emphasis is placed not on the individual producing the deed but on the deed itself. Although a seemingly difficult concept to grasp, gender performativity is realized throughout many aspects of our lives, specifically in our infancy and young childhood, our teen years, and finally our adult lives.\n\nOn Butler's hypothesis, the socially constructed aspect of gender performativity is perhaps most obvious in [[Drag (clothing)#Drag kings and queens|drag]] performance, which offers a rudimentary understanding of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] in its emphasis on gender performance. Butler understands drag cannot be regarded as an example of subjective or singular identity, where \"there is a 'one' who is prior to gender, a one who goes to the wardrobe of gender decides with deliberation which gender it will be today\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\">{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Critically queer | journal = [[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 17&ndash;32 | doi = 10.1215/10642684-1-1-17 | date = November 1993 | ref = harv }}</ref>{{rp|21}} Consequently, drag should not be considered the honest expression of its performer's intent. Rather, Butler suggests that what is performed \"can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\" />{{rp|24}}\n\n[[Amelia Jones]] proposes that this mode of viewing gender offered a way to move beyond the theories of the [[gaze]] and [[sexual fetishism]], which had attained much prominence in academic feminism, but which by the 1980s Jones viewed as outdated methods of understanding women's societal status. Jones believes the performative power to act out gender is extremely useful as a framework, offering new ways to consider images as enactments with embodied subjects rather than inanimate objects for men's viewing pleasure.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Jones | editor-first = Amelia | editor-link = Amelia Jones | title = The feminism and visual culture reader | page = [https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 370] | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415267069 | url = https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 }}</ref>\n\n===Infancy and young childhood===\n\nThe idea around gender performativity, when applied to infancy and young childhood, deals with the idea that from the moment one is conceived, arguably even before that, who they are and who they will become is predetermined. Children learn at a very young age what it means to be a boy or girl in our society. Individuals are either given masculine or feminine names based on their sex, are assigned colors that are deemed appropriate only when utilized by a particular sex and are even given toys that will aid them in recognizing their proper places in society. According to Barbara Kerr and Karen Multon, many parents would be puzzled to know \"the tendency of little children to think that it is their clothing or toys that make them boy or girl\".<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Multon | first2 = Karen D. | title = The development of gender identity, gender roles, and gender relations in gifted students | journal = [[Journal of Counseling & Development]] | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | page = 183 | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00194.x | date = April 2015 | ref = harv }}</ref> Parents are going as far as coordinating their daughter with the color pink because it's feminine, or blue for their son because it's masculine.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Witt |first1=Susan D. |title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles |url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=1997}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm</ref> In discussing these points, Penelope Eckert, in her text titled ''Language and Gender'', states: \"the first thing people want to know about a baby is its sex, and social convention provides a myriad of props to reduce the necessity of asking\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\">{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Penelope | last2 = McConnell-Ginet | first2 = Sally | title = Language and gender | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2013 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781107659360 }}</ref> Thus, this reinforces the importance and emphasis that society places not only on sex but also on ways in which to point towards one's sex without implicitly doing so. Eckert furthers this in stating that determining sex at one's birth is also vital of how one presents themselves in society at an older age because \"sex determination sets the stage for a lifelong process of gendering\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\"/> Eckert's statement points to Judith Butler's view of gender as being performative. Similar to Butler, Eckert is hinting to the fact that gender is not an internal reality that cannot be changed. What Eckert is instead stating is that this is a common misconception that a majority of the population unknowingly reinforces, which sees its emergence during infancy.\n\nButler suggests in both \"Critically Queer\" and \"Melancholy Gender\",<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = The psychic life of power: theories in subjection | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780804728126 }}</ref> that the child/subject's ability to grieve the loss of the same-sex parent as a viable love object is barred. Following from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of [[melancholia]], such a repudiation results in a heightened identification with the Other that cannot be loved, resulting in gender performances which create allegories of, and internalize the lost love that the subject is subsequently unable to acknowledge or grieve. Butler explains that \"a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the fantasy which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through the heightening of feminine identification itself\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\" />{{rp|25}}\n\n===Teen years===\n\nOne's teen years are the prime time in which socialization occurs as well as the time in which how one presents themselves in society is of high concern. Often, this is the time in which one's ability to master their gender performance labels them as successful, and thus normal, or unsuccessful, and thus strange and unfitting. One of the sources that demonstrate how successful performance is acted out is magazines, specifically magazines targeting young girls. According to Eckert, \"When we are teenagers, the teen magazines told girls how to make conversation with boys\u2026\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\" />{{rp|275}} This not only emphasizes the fact that gender is something that is taught to us and is continuously being shaped by society's expectations, but it also points to one of the ways in which individuals are being subconsciously trained to be ideal participants in the gender binary. Thus calling back to Butler's perception that gender is not a fact about us but is something that is taught to us and is being constantly reinforced. This idea that gender is constantly shaped by expectations is relevant in the online community. Teenagers are easily able to formulate relationships and friendships online, thus increasing the probability of a teenager's delicate identity to be manipulated and distorted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valkenburg|first=Patti M.|last2=Peter|first2=Jochen|date=February 2011|title=Online Communication Among Adolescents: An Integrated Model of Its Attraction, Opportunities, and Risks|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=48|issue=2|pages=121\u2013127|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020|pmid=21257109|issn=1054-139X}}</ref> Teenagers often come across situations in real life and online that cause them to question themselves when facing society, including gender performance.\n\n<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=B.

This model diverges from the hegemonic analytical framework of gender that many claim is [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]], contending with the ways in which queer actors problematize the traditional construction of gender. Butler adapts the psychoanalytical term of melancholia to conceptualize homoerotic subtext as it exists in western literature and especially the relationship between women writers, their gender, and their sexuality. Melancholia deals with mourning, but for homosexual couples it is not just mourning the death of the relationship, instead it is the societal disavowal of the relationship itself and the ability to mourn, thus leading to repression of these feelings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McIvor|first=David W.|date=2012|title=Bringing Ourselves to Grief: Judith Butler and the Politics of Mourning|journal=Political Theory|volume=40|issue=4|pages=409\u2013436|jstor=41703076|doi=10.1177/0090591712444841}}</ref> This idea is reflected in the activism of organized by political groups such as [[ACT UP]] during the AIDS crisis.

This serves as a form of gender boundary policing. People who identify as women are expected to conform to stereotypical gendered appearances, as are people who identify as male. Students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through bullying. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students. The practice of male students bullying other male students is explicitly linked to [[machismo]], which is the notion that boys are expected to subscribe to in order to be constructed and related to as 'normal' boys.<ref name=\"Martino\">{{cite book | last1 = Martino | first1 = Wayne | last2 = Pallota-Chiarollo | first2 = Maria | title = Being normal is the only way to be: adolescent perspectives on gender and school | publisher = UNSW Press | location = Sydney, NSW | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780868407708 }}</ref> Many girls report that boys tease and ridicule them on the basis of their appearance, which is linked to boys asserting masculine power through sexist practices of denigrating girls.<ref name=\"Martino\" /> This also serves to perpetuate the idea that appearance is a female's most important asset. In their study, \"Correlates and Consequences of Peer Victimization: Gender Differences in Direct and Indirect Forms of Bullying,\" Lopez, Esbensen & Brick state that \"boys were more likely to experience direct or physical forms of bullying and girls were more likely to report being teased or joked about.\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carbone-Lopez |first1=Kristin |last2=Esbensen |first2=Finn-Aage |last3=Brick |first3=Bradley T. |title=Correlates and Consequences of Peer Victimization: Gender Differences in Direct and Indirect Forms of Bullying |journal=Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice |date=2010 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=343 |doi=10.1177/1541204010362954 }}</ref> This can be interpreted as females typically harassing other females in more of a mental, emotional, and psychological torment while males take more of a physical and aggressive approach.

Overall, gender-based harassment serves to define and enforce gender boundaries of students by students.\n\n===Adolescent view of adulthood===\n\nGender is a [[cultural]] construction which creates an environment where an adolescent's performance in high school is related to their life goals and expectations. Because some young women believe that they want to be mothers and wives, the choice of professions and future goals can be inherently flawed by the gender constraints.  Because a girl may want to be a mother later, her academics in high school can create clear [[gender difference]]s because \"higher occupational expectations, educational expectations, and academic grades were more strongly associated with the expected age of parenthood for girls than for boys\".<ref name=\"Crockett, Lisa J. 2012\">{{cite journal | last1 = Crockett | first1 = Lisa J. | last2 = Beal | first2 = Sarah J. | title = The life course in the making: gender and the development of adolescents' expected timing of adult role transitions | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 1727&ndash;1738 | doi = 10.1037/a0027538 | pmid = 22448985 | date = November 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref> With \"young women recognizing potential conflicts between the demands of work and family\", they will not try as hard in high school allowing males to achieve higher academic achievement then girls.

Women especially are constrained in the way they view their adulthood even at a young age because of [[motherhood]].\n\nMales can also be subject to gender construction due to social expectations of masculinity. According to [[Jack Halberstam]] (under the name Judith), people correlate masculinity with \"maleness and to power to domination\u201d, something that he believes is a result of patriarchy.<ref>{{cite book | last = Halberstam | first = Judith | title = Female masculinity | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 1998 | language = en | url = https://archive.org/details/femalemasculinit00judi | isbn = 9780822322436 | url-access = registration }}</ref> In a 2015 study published in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', researchers stated that gender construct can differ depending on the man's race or ethnicity and stated that for white men there was an emphasis on \"education,employment, and socioeconomic status\" whereas the expectations for black men focused on \"sexual prowess, physical dominance, and gamesmanship\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fields |first=Errol Lamont |last2=Bogart |first2=Laura M. |last3=Smith |first3=Katherine C. |last4=Malebranche |first4=David J. |last5=Ellen |first5=Jonathan |last6=Schuster |first6=Mark A. | title = \"I always felt I had to prove my manhood\": homosexuality, masculinity, gender role strain, and HIV risk among young Black men who have sex with men | journal = [[American Journal of Public Health]] | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 122&ndash;131 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2013.301866 | pmid = 24832150 | date = January 2015 | ref = harv | pmc=4265897}}</ref> These expectations can make it harder for males to display emotions without receiving criticism and being seen as less of a man.\n\nAdolescents view on [[adulthood]] is also determined by their employment in high school. Many boys work during high school and \"unlike young women, young men who had not worked during high school did not quite match their peers\".<ref name=\"Mortimer 2005\">{{cite book | last = Mortimer | first = Jeylan | title = Working and growing up in America | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780674016149 }}</ref> Because many other boys are working, those who don't work may not be as successful after graduation.  In the book ''Working and Growing Up in America'', Jeylan T. Mortimer explains \"youth who work during high school, and those who devote more hours to work, are more [[vocation]]ally successful after leaving high school\".<ref name=\"Mortimer 2005\" /> This creates a distinct gender difference in which men are more likely to be employed after high school than women if they have worked during high school.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Marsh | first = Herbert W. | title = Employment during high school: character building or a subversion of academic goals? | journal = [[Sociology of Education (journal)|Sociology of Education]] | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 172&ndash;189 | doi = 10.2307/2112850 | jstor = 2112850 | date = July 1991 | ref = harv }}</ref> This means women may be at an academic advantage if they do not work in high school and focus on school work.\n\n===Depression===\n\nHigh school continues to become a more high-pressure environment with academic and social triggers increasing the expectations of adolescents. High school is a large transitional period for teenagers causing them to \"cope with these various transitions in different ways; some negotiate the passages easily whereas others develop serious behavioral and psychological problems\".<ref name=\"Negriff, Sonya 2011\">{{cite journal | last1 = Negriff | first1 = Sonya | last2 = Susman | first2 = Elizabeth J. | title = Pubertal timing, depression, and externalizing problems: a framework, review, and examination of gender differences | journal = [[Journal of Research on Adolescence]] | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 717&ndash;746 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00708.x | date = September 2011 | ref = harv }}</ref> One of these psychological problems is [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  While the environment of high school can be stressful biological functions also play a large role is [[psychological well-being]]. Negriff and  Susman explain in their article \"Pubertal Timing, Depression, and Externalizing Problems\" that \"the same [[hormone]]s that increase during [[puberty]] are also related to depression and aggressive tendencies. Higher levels of [[testosterone]] are associated with increased [[aggression]] in boys and girls, whereas higher [[estrogen]] for girls is associated with increased depressive symptoms\".<ref name=\"Negriff, Sonya 2011\"/> The gender differences observed may not just be due to the cultural expectations, but rather a biological function of the sex the individuals are born with. Self-esteem has also been linked to depression in high school students. One study done by James Battle in 1980 took 26 student ages 15\u201318 showed a correlation between depression and self-esteem.<ref name=\"Battle\">{{cite journal | last = Battle | first = James | title = Relationship between self-esteem and depression among high school students | journal = [[Perceptual and Motor Skills]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 157&ndash;158 | doi = 10.2466/pms.1980.51.1.157 | pmid = 7432952 | date = June 1980 | ref = harv }}</ref>  In the 80s, research had not looked past adults and Battle's research was some of the first of its kind which showed a direct correlation between self-esteem and depression.<ref name=\"Battle\" /> [[Self-esteem]] is not a product of our biology but rather is culturally constructed.<ref name=\"Battle\" /> Girls in high school also tend to have lower self-esteem due to body image.<ref name=\"Gram 2000\">{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = Melody A. | last2 = Eich | first2 = Carla | last3 = Kephart | first3 = Becky | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Dawn | title = Relationship among body image, sex, and popularity of high school students | journal = [[Perceptual and Motor Skills]] | volume = 90 | issue = 3s | pages = 1187&ndash;1193 | doi = 10.2466/pms.2000.90.3c.1187 | pmid = 10939068 | date = June 2000 | ref = harv }}</ref> With depression and self-esteem being so closely linked the potential for having the disease can result in an educational experience which can be compromised. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] can be isolating, and without proper academics and societal support, high school can be challenging. Along with higher rates of [[self-esteem]] issues in adolescents, this can adversely affect girls' academics and social life in high school.\n\n===Body image===\n\nThere are many different factors that affect [[body image]], \"including [[sex]], [[mass media|media]], parental relationship, and [[puberty]] as well as weight and popularity\".<ref name=\"Gram 2000\"/> The [[intersectionality]] of these factors causes individualistic experiences for adolescents during this period within their lives. As their body changes, so does the environment in which they live in. Body image is closely linked to [[psychological well-being]] during adolescence and can cause harmful effects when a child has body dissatisfaction.<ref name=\"Winefield\">{{cite journal | last1 = Delfabbro | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = Winefield | first2 = Anthony H. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Sarah | last4 = Hammarstr\u00f6m | first4 = Anne | last5 = Winefield | first5 = Helen | title = Body image and psychological well-being in adolescents: the relationship between gender and school type | journal = [[The Journal of Genetic Psychology]] | volume = 172 | issue = 1 | pages = 67&ndash;83 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.2010.517812 | pmid = 21452753 | date = 2011 | ref = harv }}</ref> In the article \"Body Image and Psychological Well-Being in Adolescents: The Relationship between Gender and School Type\", Helen Winfield explains that an adolescent's high school experience is closely linked to their perceived [[body image]]. She analyzed over 336 teenagers and found \"ratings of [[physical attractiveness]] and body image remain relatively stable across the early teenage years, but become increasingly negative around age 15\u201318 years because of pubertal changes\".<ref name=\"Winefield\" /> This shift during the high school years may cause serious psychological problems for adolescents.  These psychological problems can manifest into eating disorders causing serious lifelong problems.<ref name=\"Winefield\" /> Due to these findings, it is shown that these body image issues are especially prevalent in girls but as boys enter [[puberty]], expectations of height and muscle mass change as well.  Geoffrey H. Cohane, Harrison G. Pope Jr. in their article, \"Body image in boys: A review of the literature,\" claim that \"girls typically wanted to be thinner, boys frequently wanted to be bigger\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohane | first1 = Geoffrey H. | last2 = Pope | first2 =  Harrison G. | title = Body image in boys: A review of the literature | journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 373&ndash;379 | doi = 10.1002/eat.1033 | pmid = 11285574 | date = May 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref> This statistic displays that gender difference in body image cause different beauty ideals.

Women are typically represented as the backbone of the household, the caretaker, and often even as stay at home mothers. Females in media are often given weak, dependent, and passive personalities.

They acknowledge that their own views and findings/results of a study are open to deconstructive critique \u2013 no grand truth can be found because everything is context-specific and has potential to change across time periods and different situations.

People are often convinced that there are inherent differences between men and women, which skews both studies and their findings.

Specifically it asserts that reality exists as the summation of social perceptions and expression; and that the reality which is perceived is the only reality worth consideration. This is accompanied by the corollaries that any perceived reality is valid, that reality is subject to manipulation via control over social perceptions and expressions.\n\nThe social constructionist movement emerged in relation to both criticism and rejection of [[Objectivism]] developed by Russian-American writer [[Ayn Rand]]. Specifically, in the assumption of a positivist basis for knowledge; which is to say that social constructionism rejects the notion that empirical facts can be known about reality, where as objectivism is defined by it. Though not explicitly reliant on it, much literature on the subject of social constructionism focuses on its relationship in many facets to hierarchy and power. This intimacy demonstrates the close inspirational source of [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine, as utilized in the works of Foucault and his writings on discourse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/fouc-pol/|title=Foucault, Michel: Political Thought {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nThe work [[The Blank Slate]] of Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], the demonstrate the existence of socially constructed categories such as \"money, [[tenure]], [[citizenship]], decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States.\" which \"exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist.\" However, they are not a support of the Social Constructionism as the principle lens through which to understand reality, but rather a specific context for particular social phenomena. Instead, the autonomy and biologically informed nature of human existence.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | author-link = Steven Pinker | chapter = In touch with reality | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3_UAeo8Dh0C&pg=PA310 | title = The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature | page = 202 | publisher = Allen Lane, Penguin Books | location = London | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780713996722 }}</ref> In this manner, Pinker explicitly contradicts social constructionist scholars Marecek, Crawford & Popp in \"On the Construction of Gender, Sex, and Sexualities\", who deny the autonomy of the individual, as well as assert a variation of the [[Tabula rasa]] theory of thinking, in that knowledge and meaning are generated exclusively as a collective effort and that the individual is incapable of doing so independently. Which therefore assets that the perception of the creation of independent meaning is an illusion created by manipulation of social perceptions and expressions.\n\nAlsop, Fitzsimmons & Lennon also note that the constructionist accounts of gender creation can be divided into two main streams:<ref name=\"Alsop_Theorizing\">{{cite book | last1 = Alsop | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Fitzsimons | first2 = Annette | last3 = Lennon | first3 = Kathleen | chapter = The social construction of gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zwxuGrcA_RgC | title = Theorizing gender | pages = 64&ndash;93 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745619446 }}</ref>\n# ''Materialist theories'', which underline the structural aspects of the social environment that are responsible for perpetuating certain gender roles;\n# ''Discursive theories'', which stress the creation, through language and culture, of meanings that are associated with gender.\n\nThey also argue that both the materialist and discursive theories of social construction of gender can be either [[Essentialism|essentialist]] or [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]]. This means that some of these theories assume a clear biological division between women and men when considering the social creation of masculinity and femininity, while other contest the assumption of the biological division between the sexes as independent of social construction.\n\n===Gender===\n{{main|Gender}}\nHistorically gender was used as means describing the distinction between the biological sex and socialized aspects of femininity and masculinity.<ref name=\"Marecek, Crawford & Popp\">{{cite book | last1 = Marecek | first1 = Jeanne | last2 = Crawford | first2 = Mary | last3 = Popp | first3 = Danielle | chapter = On the construction of gender, sex, and sexualities | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-009 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 192&ndash;216 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}</ref> According to West and Zimmerman, is not a personal trait; it is \"an emergent feature of social situations: both as an outcome of and a rationale for various social arrangements, and as a means of legitimating one of the most fundamental divisions of society.\"<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\">{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&ndash;151 | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | ref = harv }} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]\n:* {{cite book | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | chapter = Doing gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PA3 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | pages = 3&ndash;25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref>{{rp|126}}\n\nAs a social construct, gender is considered an achieved status by feminist theory, typically (though not exclusively) one which is achieved very early in childhood. The view as achieved is supported by the contemporary constructionist perspective, as proposed by Fenstermaker and West, asserts regarding gender as an activity (\"doing\") of utilizing normative prescriptions and beliefs about sex categories based on situational variables. These \"gender activities\" constitute sets of behavior, such as masculine and feminine, which are associated with their sexual counterpart and thus define concepts such as \"man\" and \"woman\" respectively. It is noted, however, that the perception as masculine or feminine is not limited or guaranteed to match the expression's typical or intended nature. Hence, gender can be understood as external to the individual, consisting of a series of ongoing judgements and evaluations by others, as well as of others.\n[[File:Sushi Rolls not Gender Roles (32945717780).jpg|thumb|alt=|A photo taken during a rally/march that displays a woman holding a sign stating \"Sushi Rolls Not Gender Roles\".]]\n\n====Gender roles====\n[[Gender roles]] are a continuation of the gender status, consisting of other achieved statuses that are associated with a particular gender status.

Intersectionality theorizes how gender intersects with race, ethnicity, social class, sexuality, and nation in variegated and situationally contingent ways\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nDr Berkowitz also asserts that gender at large, especially gender roles, contribute greatly as a prolific and potent avenue by which manipulations of social perceptions and expression manifest reality. Specifically, a reality in which women are typically oppressed by men within a social structure that establishes roles for women, which are of explicitly lesser capacity for accruing and exercising arbitrary power. The system which manifest and exercises this power, is typically reffered to as \"patriarchy\". To clarify, the term arbitrary here is used to denote the source of power as being derived from status as feminist theory describes it. The particular model of patriarchy prescribed, does not make any distinction of stratification or power originating from competence or prestige.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Berkowitz, D., Manohar, N., & Tinkler, J.

The following terms are in common use at this time, and we acknowledge that different cultures and individuals may have different preferred terminology (Table 1). Sex assigned at birth refers to the sex assigned to a newborn by a clinician, generally based on external genitalia at birth or through prenatal diagnostics like ultrasound. Gender identity refers to an individual's psychological sense of one's gender as male, female, or other. Individuals whose sex assigned at birth is opposite to the gender they know themselves to be are often referred to as transgender, although this term is also used as an umbrella term for individuals whose sex assigned at birth does not match their gender identity in a myriad of other ways (Turban, Ferraiolo, Martin, & Olezeski, [113]). An individual assigned male at birth who identifies as female is typically referred to as a transgender woman/girl, and an individual assigned female at birth who identifies as male is typically referred to as a transgender man/boy. In the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM\u20105), the diagnosis of gender dysphoria refers to individuals who experience clinical distress secondary to an incongruence between their sex assigned at birth and their gender identity.

West and Fenstermaker conclude that doing gender involves different versions of accountability, depending on women's \"relational position\" to white men.<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\" />\n\n====Gender as accomplishment====\n\nGender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not simply what one is, but what one does \u2013 it is actively produced within social interactions. Gender is an accomplishment : \"the activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex category\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|127}} People do not have to be in mixed gender groups or in groups at all for the performance of gender to occur; the production of gender occurs with others and is even performed alone, in the imagined presence of others. [[Doing gender|\"Doing\" gender]] is not just about conforming to stereotypical gender roles \u2013 it is the active engagement in any behavior that is gendered, or behavior that may be evaluated as gendered.\n\nThe performance of gender varies given the context: time, space, social interaction, etc. The enactment of gender roles is context dependent \u2013 roles  are \"situated identities\" instead of \"master identities\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|131}} The sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself with what people \"know\" as \"reality\" in their everyday, non- or pre-theoretical lives.

In other words, by doing gender, we reinforce the essential categories of gender \u2013 that there are only two categories that are mutually exclusive. The idea that men and women are essentially different is what makes men and women behave in ways that appear essentially different. Though sex categorization is based on biological sex, it is maintained as a category through socially constructed displays of gender (for example, you could identify a transgender person as female when in fact she is assigned male at birth).\n\nInstitutions also create normative conceptions of gender. In other words, gender is simultaneously created and maintained \u2013 \"both a process and a product, medium and outcome of such power relations\".<ref name=\"Mumby\">{{cite journal | last = Mumby | first = Dennis K. | title = Organizing men: power, discourse, and the social construction of masculinity(s) in the workplace | journal = [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 164&ndash;183, 169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2885.1998.tb00216.x | date = May 1998 | ref = harv }}</ref> In his examination of blue and white-collar workers, Mumby<ref name=\"Mumby\"/> argued that hegemonic or dominant masculinity provides a standard of acceptable behavior for men, and at the same time, is the product of men's behavior.

They are aware that others may evaluate and characterize their behavior. This is an interactional process (not just an individual one). Social constructionism asserts that gender is a category that people evaluate as omnirelevant to social life.<ref>{{cite book | last = Garfinkel | first = Harold | title = Studies in ethnomethodology | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | origyear = 1967 | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745600055 }}</ref> Gender as omnirelevant means that people can always be judged by what they do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations.\n\nAccountability can apply to behaviors that do conform to cultural conceptions as well as those behaviors that deviate \u2013 it is the ''possibility'' of being held accountable that is important in social constructionism. For example, Stobbe examined the rationale that people gave for why there were small numbers of women in the auto industry. Men cited the idea that such dirty work was unsuitable for women and women were unable to train because of family duties. Stobbe argues that the male workers created a [[machismo]] masculinity to distinguish themselves from women who might have been qualified to work in the auto shop. Women who do work in male-dominated professions have to carefully maintain and simultaneously balance their femininity and professional credibility.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00265.x |title=Doing Machismo: Legitimating Speech Acts as a Selection Discourse |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=105\u2013123 |year=2005 |last1=Stobbe |first1=Lineke |url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/33804/1/178738.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00263.x |title=The Third Sex: Women Leaders in Australian Agriculture |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |pages=73\u201388 |year=2005 |last1=Pini |first1=Barbara }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/0959353505051728 |title=Making Sense of Gender, Age, Power and Disciplinary Position: Intersecting Discourses in the Academy |journal=Feminism & Psychology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=189\u2013208 |year=2016 |last1=S\u00f8ndergaard |first1=Dorte Marie }}</ref>\n\nEven though gender seems more salient in some situations \u2013 for instance, when a woman enters a male-dominated profession \u2013 gender categories also become salient in contexts in which gender is less obvious.

People have preconceived notions about what particular racial groups look like (although there is no biological component to this categorization). Accountability is interactional because it does not occur solely within the individual. It is also institutional because individuals may be held accountable for their behaviors by institutions or by others in social situations, as a member of any social group (gender, race, class, etc.).<ref name=\"F&W_Institutional\" />{{rp|96}} This notion of accountability makes gender dynamic because what is considered appropriate behavior for men and women changes and is reproduced over time and is reproduced differently depending on context.

This outdated perception, according to Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which she unites the concepts of [[performativity]] and gender. In chapter one of the text, Butler introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in stating that \"gender proves to be performance\u2014that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = [https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 25] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | origyear = 1990 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415924993 | url = https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 }}</ref> In demystifying this concept, Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the terms gender performance and gender performativity. In doing so, Butler states in an interview: \"When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken on a role; we're acting in some way\u2026To say that gender is performative is a little different\u2026For something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and walk and speak and talk that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman\u2026we act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or simply something that is true about us. Actually, it is a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time.\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= 6 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 June 2016 | title= Judith Butler: Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc}}</ref> Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead, what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what produces the individual. Specifically, Butler approvingly quotes Nietzsche's claim that \"there is no 'being' behind doing\u2026 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed \u2013 the deed is everything.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = 25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}</ref> Thus, the emphasis is placed not on the individual producing the deed but on the deed itself. Although a seemingly difficult concept to grasp, gender performativity is realized throughout many aspects of our lives, specifically in our infancy and young childhood, our teen years, and finally our adult lives.\n\nOn Butler's hypothesis, the socially constructed aspect of gender performativity is perhaps most obvious in [[Drag (clothing)#Drag kings and queens|drag]] performance, which offers a rudimentary understanding of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] in its emphasis on gender performance. Butler understands drag cannot be regarded as an example of subjective or singular identity, where \"there is a 'one' who is prior to gender, a one who goes to the wardrobe of gender decides with deliberation which gender it will be today\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\">{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Critically queer | journal = [[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 17&ndash;32 | doi = 10.1215/10642684-1-1-17 | date = November 1993 | ref = harv }}</ref>{{rp|21}} Consequently, drag should not be considered the honest expression of its performer's intent.

Jones believes the performative power to act out gender is extremely useful as a framework, offering new ways to consider images as enactments with embodied subjects rather than inanimate objects for men's viewing pleasure.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Jones | editor-first = Amelia | editor-link = Amelia Jones | title = The feminism and visual culture reader | page = [https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 370] | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415267069 | url = https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 }}</ref>\n\n===Infancy and young childhood===\n\nThe idea around gender performativity, when applied to infancy and young childhood, deals with the idea that from the moment one is conceived, arguably even before that, who they are and who they will become is predetermined. Children learn at a very young age what it means to be a boy or girl in our society. Individuals are either given masculine or feminine names based on their sex, are assigned colors that are deemed appropriate only when utilized by a particular sex and are even given toys that will aid them in recognizing their proper places in society. According to Barbara Kerr and Karen Multon, many parents would be puzzled to know \"the tendency of little children to think that it is their clothing or toys that make them boy or girl\".<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Multon | first2 = Karen D. | title = The development of gender identity, gender roles, and gender relations in gifted students | journal = [[Journal of Counseling & Development]] | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | page = 183 | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00194.x | date = April 2015 | ref = harv }}</ref> Parents are going as far as coordinating their daughter with the color pink because it's feminine, or blue for their son because it's masculine.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Witt |first1=Susan D. |title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles |url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=1997}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm</ref> In discussing these points, Penelope Eckert, in her text titled ''Language and Gender'', states: \"the first thing people want to know about a baby is its sex, and social convention provides a myriad of props to reduce the necessity of asking\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\">{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Penelope | last2 = McConnell-Ginet | first2 = Sally | title = Language and gender | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2013 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781107659360 }}</ref> Thus, this reinforces the importance and emphasis that society places not only on sex but also on ways in which to point towards one's sex without implicitly doing so. Eckert furthers this in stating that determining sex at one's birth is also vital of how one presents themselves in society at an older age because \"sex determination sets the stage for a lifelong process of gendering\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\"/> Eckert's statement points to Judith Butler's view of gender as being performative. Similar to Butler, Eckert is hinting to the fact that gender is not an internal reality that cannot be changed.

Following from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of [[melancholia]], such a repudiation results in a heightened identification with the Other that cannot be loved, resulting in gender performances which create allegories of, and internalize the lost love that the subject is subsequently unable to acknowledge or grieve. Butler explains that \"a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the fantasy which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through the heightening of feminine identification itself\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\" />{{rp|25}}\n\n===Teen years===\n\nOne's teen years are the prime time in which socialization occurs as well as the time in which how one presents themselves in society is of high concern. Often, this is the time in which one's ability to master their gender performance labels them as successful, and thus normal, or unsuccessful, and thus strange and unfitting. One of the sources that demonstrate how successful performance is acted out is magazines, specifically magazines targeting young girls. According to Eckert, \"When we are teenagers, the teen magazines told girls how to make conversation with boys\u2026\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\" />{{rp|275}} This not only emphasizes the fact that gender is something that is taught to us and is continuously being shaped by society's expectations, but it also points to one of the ways in which individuals are being subconsciously trained to be ideal participants in the gender binary. Thus calling back to Butler's perception that gender is not a fact about us but is something that is taught to us and is being constantly reinforced. This idea that gender is constantly shaped by expectations is relevant in the online community. Teenagers are easily able to formulate relationships and friendships online, thus increasing the probability of a teenager's delicate identity to be manipulated and distorted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valkenburg|first=Patti M.|last2=Peter|first2=Jochen|date=February 2011|title=Online Communication Among Adolescents: An Integrated Model of Its Attraction, Opportunities, and Risks|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=48|issue=2|pages=121\u2013127|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020|pmid=21257109|issn=1054-139X}}</ref> Teenagers often come across situations in real life and online that cause them to question themselves when facing society, including gender performance.\n\n<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=B.

This model diverges from the hegemonic analytical framework of gender that many claim is [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]], contending with the ways in which queer actors problematize the traditional construction of gender. Butler adapts the psychoanalytical term of melancholia to conceptualize homoerotic subtext as it exists in western literature and especially the relationship between women writers, their gender, and their sexuality. Melancholia deals with mourning, but for homosexual couples it is not just mourning the death of the relationship, instead it is the societal disavowal of the relationship itself and the ability to mourn, thus leading to repression of these feelings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McIvor|first=David W.|date=2012|title=Bringing Ourselves to Grief: Judith Butler and the Politics of Mourning|journal=Political Theory|volume=40|issue=4|pages=409\u2013436|jstor=41703076|doi=10.1177/0090591712444841}}</ref> This idea is reflected in the activism of organized by political groups such as [[ACT UP]] during the AIDS crisis. Many of the survivors that participated in this activism were homosexuals whom has lost their partners to the disease.

This serves as a form of gender boundary policing. People who identify as women are expected to conform to stereotypical gendered appearances, as are people who identify as male. Students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through bullying. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students. The practice of male students bullying other male students is explicitly linked to [[machismo]], which is the notion that boys are expected to subscribe to in order to be constructed and related to as 'normal' boys.<ref name=\"Martino\">{{cite book | last1 = Martino | first1 = Wayne | last2 = Pallota-Chiarollo | first2 = Maria | title = Being normal is the only way to be: adolescent perspectives on gender and school | publisher = UNSW Press | location = Sydney, NSW | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780868407708 }}</ref> Many girls report that boys tease and ridicule them on the basis of their appearance, which is linked to boys asserting masculine power through sexist practices of denigrating girls.<ref name=\"Martino\" /> This also serves to perpetuate the idea that appearance is a female's most important asset.

Overall, gender-based harassment serves to define and enforce gender boundaries of students by students.\n\n===Adolescent view of adulthood===\n\nGender is a [[cultural]] construction which creates an environment where an adolescent's performance in high school is related to their life goals and expectations. Because some young women believe that they want to be mothers and wives, the choice of professions and future goals can be inherently flawed by the gender constraints.  Because a girl may want to be a mother later, her academics in high school can create clear [[gender difference]]s because \"higher occupational expectations, educational expectations, and academic grades were more strongly associated with the expected age of parenthood for girls than for boys\".<ref name=\"Crockett, Lisa J. 2012\">{{cite journal | last1 = Crockett | first1 = Lisa J. | last2 = Beal | first2 = Sarah J. | title = The life course in the making: gender and the development of adolescents' expected timing of adult role transitions | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 1727&ndash;1738 | doi = 10.1037/a0027538 | pmid = 22448985 | date = November 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref> With \"young women recognizing potential conflicts between the demands of work and family\", they will not try as hard in high school allowing males to achieve higher academic achievement then girls.

Women especially are constrained in the way they view their adulthood even at a young age because of [[motherhood]].\n\nMales can also be subject to gender construction due to social expectations of masculinity.

Mortimer explains \"youth who work during high school, and those who devote more hours to work, are more [[vocation]]ally successful after leaving high school\".<ref name=\"Mortimer 2005\" /> This creates a distinct gender difference in which men are more likely to be employed after high school than women if they have worked during high school.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Marsh | first = Herbert W. | title = Employment during high school: character building or a subversion of academic goals? | journal = [[Sociology of Education (journal)|Sociology of Education]] | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 172&ndash;189 | doi = 10.2307/2112850 | jstor = 2112850 | date = July 1991 | ref = harv }}</ref> This means women may be at an academic advantage if they do not work in high school and focus on school work.\n\n===Depression===\n\nHigh school continues to become a more high-pressure environment with academic and social triggers increasing the expectations of adolescents.

These psychological problems can manifest into eating disorders causing serious lifelong problems.<ref name=\"Winefield\" /> Due to these findings, it is shown that these body image issues are especially prevalent in girls but as boys enter [[puberty]], expectations of height and muscle mass change as well.

These images often act as an extreme expectation for many developing teenagers.\n\nMen are typically portrayed as assertive, powerful, and strong. Particularly in television, men are usually shown as being nonemotional and detached. Women are often portrayed as the opposite. Gender roles are generally more enforced for women in media than they are for men. Women are typically represented as the backbone of the household, the caretaker, and often even as stay at home mothers. Females in media are often given weak, dependent, and passive personalities. Media presence often perpetuates that men are not allowed to be caring and that women are not allowed to be strong and demanding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Julia|date=1994|title=Gendered Media: The Influence of Media on Views of Gender|url=https://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/causes.of.gender.inequality/Readings/Wood%20-%20Gendered%20Media%20-%2094.pdf|journal=Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, and Culture by Julie|volume=|pages=32|via=}}</ref> These gender influences from the media can mislead a growing child or teenager because while they are still trying to construct their identities and genders in a social environment, they are surrounded by biased influences.\n\n==Research methods==\n\nInclusiveness and acceptance play significant roles in social constructionist practice \u2013 examples include sharing work with others in a cooperative manner, including a diverse sample, being open to other interpretations of data, and blurring the lines between scientific research, participatory research and social activism.<ref name=\"Gergen\">{{cite book|author=Gergen, M.|year=2001|title=Feminist reconstructions in psychology: Narrative, gender, and performance|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.}}</ref> The blurring of scientific research also means incorporating other disciplines into psychological work (e.g. performative psychology includes artistic expression or humor) and thinking in terms that go beyond traditional scientific language.<ref name=\"Gergen\"/> These methods are not currently valued in psychology because they are not seen as scientific.\n\nA social constructionist psychologist can make it explicit that his or her perspective is not universally true in all contexts across historical periods. Social constructionists recognize that every researcher has an opinion and is biased in some way. They acknowledge that their own views and findings/results of a study are open to deconstructive critique \u2013 no grand truth can be found because everything is context-specific and has potential to change across time periods and different situations. Related to this is the idea that social constructionists must constantly question their own work because their work can be constantly reinterpreted and have different meanings at different times.<ref name=\"Gergen\"/>\n\nSocial constructionists argue that the gender dichotomy is so ingrained that it is impossible for research findings to remain unaffected by it.  People are often convinced that there are inherent differences between men and women, which skews both studies and their findings.  That is, research questions are framed in ways that look for a difference between genders, and thus their methods will be constrained by this framework as well.<ref name=\"Language and Gender\" /> Moreover, the actual outcome of the study, even if the claims are dubious or modest at best, often come to be accepted as facts if they support the gender discourse narrative and are often cited and discussed.

The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]], which began in 1854{{where|date=June 2016}}, was a fight for women's rights to education and to the vote by the [[suffragette]]s. This movement was then followed by [[Second-wave feminism]] and [[Third-wave feminism]] which furthered the feminist cause. The feminist movement was not only about fighting for women's rights, but more essentially about earning recognition and respect from the general public acknowledging the fact that they are not inferior than men and thus deserving to be treated equally and granted fair opportunities.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Feminism emerged and started to challenge the idea that a woman's appropriate place was confined to that of the domestic and private sphere. Over time, men and women's attitudes have been becoming more liberalized with regard to gender roles.

If essential differences between the sexes are problematic, a society where gender is omnirelevant could be argued to always uphold gender inequality. The language of \"doing\" gender implies doing difference instead of unraveling it. Most studies that rely on social constructionism explore the ways in which gender is constructed but nevertheless demonstrate how those gender constructions uphold gender as a construct and gender inequality.\n\nHowever, because gender is \"done\" or constructed, it can also be \"undone\" or deconstructed.<ref name=\"Deutsch\"/> The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine: (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered, (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions, (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality, (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change, and (5) interaction as the site of change.<ref name=\"Deutsch\"/>\n\n===Nature versus nurture===\n{{See also|Gender role#Biological factors}}\nTheories that imply that gendered behavior is totally or mostly due to social conventions and culture fall into the nurture end of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate.

\"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus

the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref

SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref

pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.

A related notion is the circuit complexity of a [[recursive language]] that is [[Machine that always halts|decided]] by a '''uniform''' family of circuits <math>C_{1},C_{2},\\ldots</math> (see below).\n\n[[Complexity class]]es defined in terms of Boolean circuits include [[AC0|AC<sup>0</sup>]], [[AC (complexity)|AC]], [[TC0|TC<sup>0</sup>]] and [[NC (complexity)|NC]].\n\n== Size and Depth ==\n\nA Boolean circuit with <math>n</math> input [[bit]]s is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which every node (usually called ''gates'' in this context) is either an input node of [[in-degree]] 0 labelled by one of the <math>n</math> input bits, an [[AND gate]], an [[OR gate]], or a [[NOT gate]]. One of these gates is designated as the output gate. Such a circuit naturally computes a function of its <math>n</math> inputs. The size of a circuit is the number of gates it contains and its depth is the maximal length of a path from an input gate to the output gate.\n\nThere are two major notions of circuit complexity (these are outlined in Sipser (1997)<ref name=Sipser>Sipser, M. (1997). 'Introduction to the theory of computation.' Boston: PWS Pub. Co.</ref>{{rp|324}}). The '''circuit-size complexity''' of a Boolean function <math>f</math> is the minimal size of any circuit computing <math>f</math>. The '''circuit-depth complexity''' of a Boolean function <math>f</math> is the minimal depth of any circuit computing <math>f</math>.\n\nThese notions generalize when one considers the circuit complexity of any language that contains strings with different bit lengths, especially infinite [[formal language|formal languages]].  Boolean circuits, however, only allow a fixed number of input bits. Thus no single Boolean circuit is capable of deciding such a language. To account for this possibility, one considers families of circuits <math>C_{1},C_{2},\\ldots</math> where each <math>C_{n}</math> accepts inputs of size <math>n</math>. Each circuit family will naturally generate the language by circuit <math>C_{n}</math> outputting <math>1</math> when a length <math>n</math> string is a member of the family, and <math>0</math> otherwise. We say that a family of circuits is '''size minimal''' if there is no other family that decides on inputs of any size, <math>n</math>, with a circuit of smaller size than <math>C_n</math> (respectively for '''depth minimal''' families). Thus circuit complexity is meaningful even for [[recursive language|non-recursive languages]].  The notion of a '''uniform family''' (see below) enables variants of circuit complexity to be related to algorithm based complexity measures of recursive languages.  However, the non-uniform variant is helpful to find lower bounds on how complex any circuit family must be in order to decide given languages.\n\nHence, the '''circuit-size complexity''' of a formal language <math>A</math> is defined as the function <math>t:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}</math>, that relates a bit length of an input, <math>n</math>, to the circuit-size complexity of a minimal circuit <math>C_{n}</math> that decides whether inputs of that length are in <math>A</math>. The '''circuit-depth complexity''' is defined similarly.\n\n==Uniformity==\n\nBoolean circuits are one of the prime examples of so-called non-uniform [[abstract machine|models of computation]] in the sense that inputs of different lengths are processed by different circuits, in contrast with uniform models such as [[Turing machine]]s where the same computational device is used for all possible input lengths. An individual [[computational problem]] is thus associated with a particular ''family'' of Boolean circuits <math>C_1, C_2, \\dots </math> where each <math>C_n</math> is the circuit handling inputs of ''n'' bits. A ''uniformity'' condition is often imposed on these families, requiring the existence of some possibly [[computational resource|resource-bounded]] Turing machine that, on input ''n'', produces a description of the individual circuit <math>C_n</math>. When this Turing machine has a running time polynomial in ''n'', the circuit family is said to be P-uniform. The stricter requirement of [[DLOGTIME]]-uniformity is of particular interest in the study of shallow-depth circuit-classes such as AC<sup>0</sup> or TC<sup>0</sup>.  When no resource bounds are specified, a language is recursive (i.e., decidable by a Turing machine) if and only if the language is decided by a uniform family of Boolean circuits.\n\n===Polynomial-time uniform===\nA family of Boolean circuits <math>\\{C_n:n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}</math> is ''polynomial-time uniform'' if there exists a [[deterministic Turing machine]] ''M'', such that\n*''M'' runs in polynomial time\n* For all <math>n \\in \\mathbb{N}</math>, ''M'' outputs a description of <math>C_n</math> on input <math>1^n</math>\n\n===Logspace uniform===\nA family of Boolean circuits <math>\\{C_n:n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}</math> is ''logspace uniform'' if there exists a [[deterministic Turing machine]] ''M'', such that\n*''M'' runs in logarithmic space\n* For all <math>n \\in \\mathbb{N}</math>, ''M'' outputs a description of <math>C_n</math> on input <math>1^n</math>\n\n==History==\n\nCircuit complexity goes back to [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]] (1949), who proved that almost all Boolean functions on ''n'' variables require circuits of size \u0398(2<sup>''n''</sup>/''n''). Despite this fact, complexity theorists have only been able to prove [[Time complexity#Superpolynomial time|superpolynomial]] circuit lower bounds on functions explicitly constructed for the purpose of being hard to calculate.\n\nMore commonly, superpolynomial lower bounds have been proved under certain restrictions on the family of circuits used. The first function for which superpolynomial circuit lower bounds were shown was the [[parity function]], which computes the sum of its input bits modulo 2. The fact that parity is not contained in [[AC0|AC<sup>0</sup>]] was first established independently by Ajtai (1983)<ref>{{cite book | last1=Ajtai | first1=Mikl\u00f3s | last2=Koml\u00f3s | first2=J\u00e1nos  | last3=Szemer\u00e9di | first3=Endre | title=An 0(n log n) sorting network | journal=STOC '83 Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing | pages=1\u20139 | year=1983 | isbn=978-0-89791-099-6 }}</ref> and by Furst, Saxe and Sipser (1984).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Furst | first1 = Merrick | last2 = Saxe | first2 = James B. | author2-link = James B.

Smolensky (1987) proved that this is true even if the circuit is augmented with gates computing the sum of its input bits modulo some odd prime ''p''.\n\nThe [[clique problem|''k''-clique problem]] is to decide whether a given graph on ''n'' vertices has a clique of size ''k''. For any particular choice of the constants ''n'' and ''k'', the graph can be encoded in binary using <math>{n \\choose 2}</math> bits, which indicate for each possible edge whether it is present. Then the ''k''-clique problem is formalized as a function <math>f_k:\\{0,1\\}^{{n \\choose 2}}\\to\\{0,1\\}</math> such that <math>f_k</math> outputs 1 if and only if the graph encoded by the string contains a clique of size ''k''. This family of functions is monotone and can be computed by a family of circuits, but it has been shown that it cannot be computed by a polynomial-size family of monotone circuits (that is, circuits with AND and OR gates but without negation). The original result of [[Alexander Razborov|Razborov]] (1985) was later improved to an exponential-size lower bound by Alon and Boppana (1987). Rossman (2008) shows that constant-depth circuits with AND, OR, and NOT gates require size <math>\\Omega(n^{k/4})</math> to solve the ''k''-clique problem even in the [[average-case complexity|average case]]. Moreover, there is a circuit of size <math>n^{k/4+O(1)}</math> that computes <math>f_k</math>.\n\n[[Ran Raz|Raz]] and [[Pierre McKenzie|McKenzie]] later showed that the monotone NC hierarchy is infinite (1999).\n\nThe Integer Division Problem lies in uniform [[TC0|TC<sup>0</sup>]] (Hesse 2001).\n\n==Circuit lower bounds==\nCircuit lower bounds are generally difficult.

The '''circuit-size complexity''' of a Boolean function <math>f</math> is the minimal size of any circuit computing <math>f</math>.

The stricter requirement of [[DLOGTIME]]-uniformity is of particular interest in the study of shallow-depth circuit-classes such as AC<sup>0</sup> or TC<sup>0</sup>.

We may construct many other circuit complexity classes with the same size and depth restrictions by allowing different sets of gates.\n\n==Relation to time complexity==\nSay that a certain language, <math>A</math>, belongs to the [[Complexity class|time-complexity class]] <math>\\text{TIME}(t(n))</math> for some function <math>t:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}</math>.
