{"title_page": "Sensurround", "text_new": "[[File:Sensurround_logo.png|thumb|Sensurround logo.]]'''Sensurround''' is the brand name for a process developed by [[Cerwin-Vega]] in conjunction with [[Universal Studios]] to enhance the audio experience during film screenings, specifically for the 1974 film ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]''. The process was intended for subsequent use and was adopted for four more films, ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' (1976), ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977), the theatrical version of ''[[Saga of a Star World]]'' (1978), the ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' pilot, as well as the compilation film ''[[List of Battlestar Galactica (1978, 1980) episodes#Feature length films|Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack]]'' (1979). Sensurround worked by adding extended-range bass for [[sound effect]]s. The low-frequency sounds were more felt than heard, providing a vivid complement to onscreen depictions of earth tremors, bomber formations, and amusement park rides. The overall trend toward \"[[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]]\" cinema structures presented challenges that made Sensurround impractical as a permanent feature of cinema.<ref name=in70mm/>\n\nSensurround helped bring wider recognition to established [[loudspeaker]] manufacturer [[Cerwin-Vega]],<ref name=CerwinVega/> and aided in establishing a strong reputation for new [[audio amplifier]] company [[BGW Systems]]. The increased awareness of extended low-frequency sound reproduction that Sensurround brought to film audiences was a factor in the increase in [[subwoofer]] sales and in the rise in the number of subwoofer designs in the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Original design===\nSensurround involved the installation of large, low frequency, horn-loaded speakers which contained specially designed 18-inch Cerwin-Vega Model 189 ES drivers in custom black wood cabinets. Three horn configurations were available, Model-C (Corner), Model-W (Folded Bass Bin) and Model-M (Modular). The Model-C and -M horns required stacking in groups of four, increasing effective horn mouth size to achieve the low frequency target. They came with special extenders used to widen the mouths of the horns and take advantage of the theater walls to further increase low frequency extension. The Model-M horn had a dedicated \"Mouth-Extender\" available when it was used in the front of the theater. While installation was customized and varied in each theater, the Sensurround horns were typically placed beneath the screen in front and in the back corners of the theater. Often, rows or sections of seats would have to be removed to make room for the large Sensurround horns. In large theaters, up to 20 individual horns might be used along with custom-built bat wings and mouth extenders.\n\n[[File:SensurroundRumbleGenerator.jpg|thumb|Sensurround [[pseudorandom number generator]] circuit on the patent, to create low frequency rumble.]]\nThe original Sensurround design used for ''Earthquake'' employed a [[Pseudorandom number generator|pseudorandom noise generator]], designed by D. Broadus \"Don\" Keele, Jr., to create the low-frequency rumble, using recordings of the 1971 [[Sylmar earthquake]] as a reference.<ref name=Volcler2013/> Two low frequency control tones were printed on the film's mono optical or magnetic track; from the projector, the tones entered a control box in the projection booth, which fed low frequency pseudorandom noise to 1,600&nbsp;watt BGW 750 audio amplifiers driving the speakers.<ref name=BGW/> The control box generated a pseudorandom noise signal with energy between 17 and 120&nbsp;Hz. The control track method was employed because there was no way to accurately record bass lower than 40&nbsp;Hz on an optical or magnetic film soundtrack at the time.<ref name=in70mm/> When receiving the noise signal, the amplifier and subwoofers responded with sound pressures ranging from 100&nbsp;dB to 120&nbsp;dB. The resulting rumble could be felt by audience members as well as heard.<ref name=in70mm/>\n\nFor the film ''Earthquake'', Sensurround was activated during the quake scenes to augment the conventional soundtrack.<ref name=WhiteLouie/> In addition, portions of the main soundtrack were redirected to the Sensurround horns to create a partial [[surround sound]] effect. The control tones recorded on the film's optical or magnetic track triggered the rumble or surround sound effects as well as controlling their volume and the overall blend of the main soundtrack and low frequency noise effects. Two tones of 25&nbsp;Hz and 35&nbsp;Hz were used: these two tones allowed different effects to be activated when desired: the rumble could be turned on or off in the Sensurround horns, the main soundtrack could be sent to the Sensurround horns, the level of both the rumble and the soundtrack coming from the horns could be varied by varying the level of the control tones and the theater's main audio system could be increased in level by up to 8&nbsp;dB at select points to create a greater dynamic range (MCA called this the \"Step-Gain\" function.)\n\nFor the original version of Sensurround, prints were available in the following formats:\n\n*'''35mm 4-Track Magnetic with Optical Track (magoptical):''' This type of Sensurround print was <u>not</u> usable as a mono optical print. Unlike standard magoptical prints, in which the optical track was a mono version of the magnetic stereo tracks, the optical track on magnetic Sensurround prints contained <u>only</u> the control tones. If played as a standard optical print, only the 25&nbsp;Hz and 35&nbsp;Hz control tones would be heard.  To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the optical track varied from \u221214 to \u22126&nbsp;dB below 100% modulation and activation of the Sensurround System occurred at \u221216&nbsp;dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, Track-2 (Center Front) was used, with its level and timing controlled by the 25&nbsp;Hz control tone. For magnetic playback in mono, Track-2 (Center Front) could be used because ''Earthquake'' was mixed with mono dialogue, unlike most stereo films up to that time. For 4-Track equipped theaters that wanted to run ''Earthquake'' without Sensurround, the standard 12&nbsp;kHz CinemaScope switching signal was recorded on Track-4 (surround).  Because no noise reduction system was used on magnetic prints at the time, and due to the lower technical performance of the surround channels magnetic track, this switching system was implemented by 20th Century Fox during CinemaScope's development to reduce the hiss and system noise heard from the surround speakers. For ''Earthquake''{{'s}} run in the United States, the surround speakers were disconnected and the Sensurround system was relied upon to produce all the surround sound effects; Track-4 was not used nor even connected to the Sensurround Integrator.  In Europe, the surround track was used in the normal manner, being controlled by the Sensurround Integrator like the other magnetic channels.\n*'''35mm Mono Optical:''' These were dual-purpose prints and could be used either with or without Sensurround. The optical track was a composite mix of the program and the control tones and were compatible with any optical playback system.  All mono mixes of the ''Earthquake'' soundtrack contain the control tones. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the optical track varied from \u221228&nbsp;dB to \u221220&nbsp;dB below 100% modulation.  Activation of the Sensurround System occurred at \u221230&nbsp;dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, the composite mono soundtrack was used, with its volume and timing regulated by the 25&nbsp;Hz control tone.\n*'''70mm 6-Track Magnetic Stereo:''' The Sensurround Control Tones were recorded on Tracks 2 and 4 and are 100&nbsp;Hz instead of 25&nbsp;Hz and 35&nbsp;Hz. This was because the magnetic system could not reproduce the very low-frequency control tones reliably.  The 100&nbsp;Hz tone on Track-2 controls the program effects applied to the Sensurround Horns and the 100&nbsp;Hz tone on Track-4 controls the rumble effect applied to the Sensurround horns.  Like the other systems, the level of the 100&nbsp;Hz tones varies the levels applied to the Sensurround horns and when both control tones are present, the Step/Hi-Gain function is turned on to increase the dynamic range of the main program by 8&nbsp;dB. Track-3 (Center Front) is applied to the Sensurround system for program sounds.  No other signal is recorded on Tracks 2 and 4.  70mm Sensurround prints were issued ONLY outside of the USA.  In addition, ''Earthquake'' was the only Sensurround film recorded in stereo or issued with 70mm prints.  All other Sensurround films were 35mm mono optical in the Sensurround Mod-II or Mod-III format.\n\n===Sensurround Mod-II===\nEven before ''Earthquake'' ended its theatrical run, MCA began a program to re-engineer the Sensurround system to enable the recording of the deep bass on a standard 35mm optical soundtrack, with no external rumble generator being required, as well as improve fidelity and the overall effect and to simplify the system. In addition, [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx Type-II noise reduction]] was incorporated to increase the dynamic range and reduce audible noise created by the optical process. MCA also changed the way the control tones were used, allowing the Sensurround horns in the front and back of the theater to be controlled independently. This allowed for more creative effects, such as a sound being panned from front to back of the theater. Re-engineering the system was important to MCA because there were times during dialogue sequences when the sound mixers wanted the Sensurround running but did not want the dialogue to shift to the back of the theater.  Having separate control of the front and back groups of Sensurround horns allowed this. The drivers in the Sensurround horns were improved to extend their frequency response higher so they could reproduce the low notes in music, thus allowing sound mixers to incorporate music into the Sensurround system (this was used to good effect in ''Rollercoaster''.) Advancements by RCA in optical soundtrack recording led MCA engineers to the realization that an optical track could reliably record and reproduce bass down to 10&nbsp;Hz. As well, removal of the Academy equalization would allow the high frequency response to be extended upward by an additional octave. The addition of dbx Type-II noise reduction and its attendant increase in useful dynamic range created a high-fidelity sound from a conventional optical print. MCA called this re-engineering of the system \"Sensurround Mod-II\" and the market name of the system was changed from just \"Sensurround\" to the \"Sensurround Special Effects System\".\n\nUnlike the original version of Sensurround, Mod-II (and later, Mod-III) were only for use with mono optical soundtracks. Due to the use of dbx Type-II noise reduction, MCA eliminated the standard Academy Filter traditionally used on optical prints, thus giving Sensurround an increased frequency response of 16&nbsp;Hz to 16&nbsp;kHz and a dynamic range of 86&nbsp;dB, superior to 70mm magnetic prints of the time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} It also allowed a mono optical track to have surround sound effects and MCA began to market the system to other studios and producers as a truly high-fidelity sound and special effects system. [[Dolby Stereo]] optical was just beginning to become known in the industry and MCA felt they had a viable competing format.  While Warner Bros. and Paramount seriously considered adopting the system, in the end only Universal Studios ever released films using the process. Both Warner and Paramount later patented their own \"special effects\" systems to create Sensurround-type effects.\n\n===Sensurround Mod-III===\n\nMod-III Sensurround was a further refinement of the system to allow more control over level, timbre and placement of effects. Instead of a simple wide-range rumble that could be felt and heard, Mod-III used more narrow band extended low frequency effects in the 16\u201325&nbsp;Hz range, in addition to the higher frequency program sounds and surround-sound effect. Thus, scenes could have dialogue and other audio at standard levels, plus the effect of movement from the infrasonic rumble, creating sensations that had not been possible in earlier Sensurround films. Mod-III Sensurround was used in [[List of Battlestar Galactica (1978, 1980) episodes#Feature length films|''Battlestar Galactica'']] in 1978.\n\nSensurround was a highly successful theatrical sound system. By 1976, when ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' opened, there were over 800 theaters with Sensurround capability in the USA. Worldwide, there were over 2000 Sensurround theaters. During the initial design of the system MCA figured it would be installed in a limited number of theaters across the USA\u2014perhaps 30 in all\u2014and that smaller theaters, or theaters in small towns, would not want to bother with the installation or the loss of seating capacity necessitated by the large Sensurround horns. This was quickly disproved: ''Earthquake'' premiered with 17 Sensurround installations and by the end of its run over 400 theaters had shown the film in Sensurround. ''Midway'' opened with 300 Sensurround-equipped theaters. At first, MCA only rented Sensurround to theaters at a cost of $500 per week, but by the opening of ''Midway'', theaters could purchase the systems outright and MCA had begun to ship the Model-M horns to theaters un-assembled. Theater owners also had the option of purchasing only the Cerwin-Vega drivers and horn cabinet blueprints, buying the wood and making the horn cabinets themselves. MCA made these changes due to the success of the system and because the shipping costs of the heavy Sensurround horns were becoming very expensive.\n\nThroughout the history of the Sensurround program, RCA Technical Services performed the theater installations and maintenance. If repairs or replacements were required, the RCA technicians contacted MCA Systems to order needed parts. Because control tones were used to trigger the Sensurround horns, theaters could not generally use the system with their standard films unless a rewiring was done.\n\n==History==\n\n===Awards===\nIn 1974, Waldon O. Watson, Richard J. Stumpf, Robert J. Leonard and the Universal City Studios Sound Department received a special [[Academy Award, Scientific or Technical|Scientific and Engineering Academy Award]] for \"the development and engineering of the Sensurround System for motion picture presentation\". The film ''Earthquake'' also won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Sound|Best Sound]] ([[Ronald Pierce (sound engineer)|Ronald Pierce]], [[Melvin M. Metcalfe Sr.]]).<ref name=Franks2004/>\n\nIn 1976, MCA was granted {{us patent|3973839}} for the Sensurround system.\n\n===Drawbacks===\nSensurround speakers involved expense for theater owners. Rental for speakers cost $500 a month in 1974 and their installation involved the removal of some seats. The extra expense was commercially justifiable as long as it appeared to provide an advantage in drawing audiences.\n\nSensurround made ''Earthquake'' a popular \"event\" film in 1974 and one of the year's highest-grossing films. Sensurround presented practical challenges, though, in [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex cinemas]] where separate theater spaces shared walls.<ref name=Gomery/> Audiences for ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', which opened the same month (November 1974) as ''Earthquake'', often complained to theater managers about the Sensurround effect when ''Earthquake'' was shown in an adjoining theater. The low-frequency vibrations rattled tiles and plaster, too, leading to damage in some venues;<ref name=FJI/> a safety net was installed at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]] to catch errant pieces of plaster falling from the ceiling.<ref name=in70mm /> When ''Earthquake'' was screened in Chicago, the head of the Chicago Building and Safety Department demanded that the system be turned down or removed to prevent damage to city theaters. In Germany, Sensurround movies could only be screened in single-screen houses. Subsequent Sensurround films, such as ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'', also tended to play in single-screen cinemas.\n\nThe success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' over [[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|''Rollercoaster'']] in the middle of 1977 demonstrated to theater operators the limits of Sensurround as a guarantor of audience draw. ''Battlestar Galactica: [[Saga of a Star World]]'' (1978) and ''Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack'' (1979) marked the final bows of Sensurround.\n\n===Competing processes===\n\nThe success of Sensurround as an effect led rival studios to develop their own audio enhancements. [[20th Century Fox]] released ''[[Damnation Alley (film)|Damnation Alley]]'' (1977) in {{no wrap|[[Sound 360]]}}, and [[Warner Brothers]] employed their [[Megasound]] process for ''[[Altered States]]'' (1980), ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' (1981) and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1981).\n\n==Cultural references==\nOn their 1977 album ''[[Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols]]'', the punk rock group the [[Sex Pistols]] referenced Sensurround in their song \"[[Holidays in the Sun (song)|Holidays in the Sun]]\" in the opening of the second verse (\"It's in Sensurround sound in a two inch wall, I was waiting for the communist call\").\n\nThe English [[gothic rock]] band [[The Sisters of Mercy]] reference Sensurround in the song \"Body Electric\" from their 1984 EP ''[[Body and Soul (EP)|Body and Soul]]''. (\"Through the cables and the underground now\nThe faceless breathless calls, This is Babel, Sensurround now, This place is death with walls\").\n\nThe alternative pop/rock band [[They Might Be Giants]] released a song titled \"Sensurround\" that was incorporated in the soundtrack to ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]'' and (in a different, faster-paced recording) their [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[S-E-X-X-Y]]''.  The song makes several references to the innovation, especially as used in ''Earthquake''.  \n\nAn early ''[[FoxTrot]]'' comic has Jason presenting his dinosaur movie in Sensurround.\n\nIn the 1993 film ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'', ''Mant!'', Matinee's film-within-a-film, was filmed in \"Rumble-Rama\", a not-so-subtle nod to Sensurround.\n\nThe alternative rock band [[Manic Street Preachers]] references Sensurround in the chorus of the song \"Small Black Flowers That Grow In The Sky\" (\"Want to get out, won't miss you Sensurround\") from the 1996 album [[Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)|Everything Must Go]].\n\n[[Kentucky Fried Movie]] (1979) has a sketch \u2018See You Next Wednesday\u2019 which burlesques the Sensurround process as \u2018Feel-a-Round\u2019, in which a uniformed usher assaults movie viewers.\n\nIn its 1981 anti-materialism song, \"Elevator Muzik,\" The [[Resurrection Band]] references the process in the lyric \"Elevating sales at the speed of sound, soon you'll be shopping in Sensurround\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[5.1 surround sound]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=in70mm>{{cite web |last=Hauersley |first=Thomas |title=In Sensurround |work=in70mm.com |date=May 25, 2011 |url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2011/in_sensurround/english/index.htm |accessdate=2015-02-11}}</ref>\n<ref name=CerwinVega>{{cite web |title=Cerwin-Vega Historical Perspective |website=Cerwin-Vega |url=http://www.cerwinvega.com/cerwin-vega-history.html |accessdate=2015-02-11}}</ref>\n<ref name=BGW>{{cite web |title=About BGW |website=BGW |url=http://www.bgw.com/about/ |accessdate=2015-02-11}}</ref>\n<ref name=Volcler2013>{{cite book |last=Volcler |first=Juliette |title=Extremely Loud: Sound as a Weapon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXARBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 |year=2013 |publisher=New Press |isbn=978-1-59558-873-9 |page=41}}</ref>\n<ref name=Franks2004>{{cite book |last=Franks |first=Don |title=Entertainment Awards: A Music, Cinema, Theatre and Broadcasting Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOKoBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA242 |edition=3rd |year=2004 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-1-4766-0806-8 |pages=242\u2013243}}</ref>\n<ref name=FJI>{{cite journal |url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/technology/e3ia4c13dab488c47ca38ba99fcd041514b |title=Earth-shattering: FJI salutes the 40th anniversary of Sensurround's quakes and battles |last=Fuchs |first=Andreas |journal=[[Film Journal International]] |date=August 15, 2014 |accessdate=2015-02-11}}</ref>\n<ref name=WhiteLouie>{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Glenn |last2=Louie |first2=Gary J|title=The Audio Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DulVm8t88QkC&pg=PA345 |edition=3rd |year=2005 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0-295-98498-8 |pages=345\u2013346}}</ref>\n<ref name=Gomery>{{cite book |last=Gomery |first=Douglas |title=Shared Pleasures: A History of Movie Presentation in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyFQNU_F5DMC&pg=PA227 |year=1992 |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press |isbn=978-0-299-13214-9 |page=227}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.in70mm.com/library/process/sensurround/index.htm In70mm.com's Sensurround Page]\n* [http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/2004/69/sensurround/index.htm Introduction to Sensurround], reproduced from the Sensurround Model II manual at ''in70mm.com''\n\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:Surround sound]]\n[[Category:Loudspeaker technology]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Sensurround_logo.png|thumb|Sensurround logo.]]'''Sensurround''' is the brand name for a process developed by [[Cerwin-Vega]] in conjunction with [[Universal Studios]] to enhance the audio experience during film screenings, specifically for the 1974 film ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]''.

MCA also changed the way the control tones were used, allowing the Sensurround horns in the front and back of the theater to be controlled independently. This allowed for more creative effects, such as a sound being panned from front to back of the theater. Re-engineering the system was important to MCA because there were times during dialogue sequences when the sound mixers wanted the Sensurround running but did not want the dialogue to shift to the back of the theater.  Having separate control of the front and back groups of Sensurround horns allowed this. The drivers in the Sensurround horns were improved to extend their frequency response higher so they could reproduce the low notes in music, thus allowing sound mixers to incorporate music into the Sensurround system (this was used to good effect in ''Rollercoaster''.) Advancements by RCA in optical soundtrack recording led MCA engineers to the realization that an optical track could reliably record and reproduce bass down to 10&nbsp;Hz. As well, removal of the Academy equalization would allow the high frequency response to be extended upward by an additional octave. The addition of dbx Type-II noise reduction and its attendant increase in useful dynamic range created a high-fidelity sound from a conventional optical print. MCA called this re-engineering of the system \"Sensurround Mod-II\" and the market name of the system was changed from just \"Sensurround\" to the \"Sensurround Special Effects System\".\n\nUnlike the original version of Sensurround, Mod-II (and later, Mod-III) were only for use with mono optical soundtracks. Due to the use of dbx Type-II noise reduction, MCA eliminated the standard Academy Filter traditionally used on optical prints, thus giving Sensurround an increased frequency response of 16&nbsp;Hz to 16&nbsp;kHz and a dynamic range of 86&nbsp;dB, superior to 70mm magnetic prints of the time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} It also allowed a mono optical track to have surround sound effects and MCA began to market the system to other studios and producers as a truly high-fidelity sound and special effects system. [[Dolby Stereo]] optical was just beginning to become known in the industry and MCA felt they had a viable competing format.  While Warner Bros. and Paramount seriously considered adopting the system, in the end only Universal Studios ever released films using the process. Both Warner and Paramount later patented their own \"special effects\" systems to create Sensurround-type effects.\n\n===Sensurround Mod-III===\n\nMod-III Sensurround was a further refinement of the system to allow more control over level, timbre and placement of effects. Instead of a simple wide-range rumble that could be felt and heard, Mod-III used more narrow band extended low frequency effects in the 16\u201325&nbsp;Hz range, in addition to the higher frequency program sounds and surround-sound effect. Thus, scenes could have dialogue and other audio at standard levels, plus the effect of movement from the infrasonic rumble, creating sensations that had not been possible in earlier Sensurround films. Mod-III Sensurround was used in [[List of Battlestar Galactica (1978, 1980) episodes#Feature length films|''Battlestar Galactica'']] in 1978.\n\nSensurround was a highly successful theatrical sound system. By 1976, when ''[[Midway (movie)|Midway]]'' opened, there were over 800 theaters with Sensurround capability in the USA. Worldwide, there were over 2000 Sensurround theaters. During the initial design of the system MCA figured it would be installed in a limited number of theaters across the USA\u2014perhaps 30 in all\u2014and that smaller theaters, or theaters in small towns, would not want to bother with the installation or the loss of seating capacity necessitated by the large Sensurround horns. This was quickly disproved: ''Earthquake'' premiered with 17 Sensurround installations and by the end of its run over 400 theaters had shown the film in Sensurround. ''Midway'' opened with 300 Sensurround-equipped theaters. At first, MCA only rented Sensurround to theaters at a cost of $500 per week, but by the opening of ''Midway'', theaters could purchase the systems outright and MCA had begun to ship the Model-M horns to theaters un-assembled. Theater owners also had the option of purchasing only the Cerwin-Vega drivers and horn cabinet blueprints, buying the wood and making the horn cabinets themselves. MCA made these changes due to the success of the system and because the shipping costs of the heavy Sensurround horns were becoming very expensive.\n\nThroughout the history of the Sensurround program, RCA Technical Services performed the theater installations and maintenance. If repairs or replacements were required, the RCA technicians contacted MCA Systems to order needed parts. Because control tones were used to trigger the Sensurround horns, theaters could not generally use the system with their standard films unless a rewiring was done.\n\n==History==\n\n===Awards===\nIn 1974, Waldon O. Watson, Richard J. Stumpf, Robert J. Leonard and the Universal City Studios Sound Department received a special [[Academy Award, Scientific or Technical|Scientific and Engineering Academy Award]] for \"the development and engineering of the Sensurround System for motion picture presentation\". The film ''Earthquake'' also won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Sound|Best Sound]] ([[Ronald Pierce (sound engineer)|Ronald Pierce]], [[Melvin M. Metcalfe Sr.]]).<ref name=Franks2004/>\n\nIn 1976, MCA was granted {{us patent|3973839}} for the Sensurround system.\n\n===Drawbacks===\nSensurround speakers involved expense for theater owners. Rental for speakers cost $500 a month in 1974 and their installation involved the removal of some seats. The extra expense was commercially justifiable as long as it appeared to provide an advantage in drawing audiences.\n\nSensurround made ''Earthquake'' a popular \"event\" film in 1974 and one of the year's highest-grossing films. Sensurround presented practical challenges, though, in [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex cinemas]] where separate theater spaces shared walls.<ref name=Gomery/> Audiences for ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', which opened the same month (November 1974) as ''Earthquake'', often complained to theater managers about the Sensurround effect when ''Earthquake'' was shown in an adjoining theater. The low-frequency vibrations rattled tiles and plaster, too, leading to damage in some venues;<ref name=FJI/> a safety net was installed at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]] to catch errant pieces of plaster falling from the ceiling.<ref name=in70mm /> When ''Earthquake'' was screened in Chicago, the head of the Chicago Building and Safety Department demanded that the system be turned down or removed to prevent damage to city theaters. In Germany, Sensurround movies could only be screened in single-screen houses. Subsequent Sensurround films, such as ''[[Midway (movie)|Midway]]'', also tended to play in single-screen cinemas.\n\nThe success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' over [[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|''Rollercoaster'']] in the middle of 1977 demonstrated to theater operators the limits of Sensurround as a guarantor of audience draw. ''Battlestar Galactica: [[Saga of a Star World]]'' (1978) and ''Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack'' (1979) marked the final bows of Sensurround.\n\n===Competing processes===\n\nThe success of Sensurround as an effect led rival studios to develop their own audio enhancements. [[20th Century Fox]] released ''[[Damnation Alley (film)|Damnation Alley]]'' (1977) in {{no wrap|[[Sound 360]]}}, and [[Warner Brothers]] employed their [[Megasound]] process for ''[[Altered States]]'' (1980), ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' (1981) and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1981).\n\n==Cultural references==\nOn their 1977 album ''[[Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols]]'', the punk rock group the [[Sex Pistols]] referenced Sensurround in their song \"[[Holidays in the Sun (song)|Holidays in the Sun]]\" in the opening of the second verse (\"It's in Sensurround sound in a two inch wall, I was waiting for the communist call\").\n\nThe English [[gothic rock]] band [[The Sisters of Mercy]] reference Sensurround in the song \"Body Electric\" from their 1984 EP ''[[Body and Soul (EP)|Body and Soul]]''. (\"Through the cables and the underground now\nThe faceless breathless calls, This is Babel, Sensurround now, This place is death with walls\").\n\nThe alternative pop/rock band [[They Might Be Giants]] released a song titled \"Sensurround\" that was incorporated in the soundtrack to ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]'' and (in a different, faster-paced recording) their [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[S-E-X-X-Y]]''.  The song makes several references to the innovation, especially as used in ''Earthquake''.  \n\nAn early ''[[FoxTrot]]'' comic has Jason presenting his dinosaur movie in Sensurround.\n\nIn the 1993 film ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'', ''Mant!'', Matinee's film-within-a-film, was filmed in \"Rumble-Rama\", a not-so-subtle nod to Sensurround.\n\nThe alternative rock band [[Manic Street Preachers]] references Sensurround in the chorus of the song \"Small Black Flowers That Grow In The Sky\" (\"Want to get out, won't miss you Sensurround\") from the 1996 album [[Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)|Everything Must Go]].\n\n[[Kentucky Fried Movie]] (1979) has a sketch \u2018See You Next Wednesday\u2019 which burlesques the Sensurround process as \u2018Feel-a-Round\u2019, in which a uniformed usher assaults movie viewers.\n\nIn its 1981 anti-materialism song, \"Elevator Muzik,\" The [[Resurrection Band]] references the process in the lyric \"Elevating sales at the speed of sound, soon you'll be shopping in Sensurround\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[5.1 surround sound]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=in70mm>{{cite web |last=Hauersley |first=Thomas |title=In Sensurround |work=in70mm.com |date=May 25, 2011 |url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2011/in_sensurround/english/index.htm |accessdate=2015-02-11}}</ref>\n<ref name=CerwinVega>{{cite web |title=Cerwin-Vega Historical Perspective |website=Cerwin-Vega |url=http://www.cerwinvega.com/cerwin-vega-history.html |accessdate=2015-02-11}}</ref>\n<ref name=BGW>{{cite web |title=About BGW |website=BGW |url=http://www.bgw.com/about/ |accessdate=2015-02-11}}</ref>\n<ref name=Volcler2013>{{cite book |last=Volcler |first=Juliette |title=Extremely Loud: Sound as a Weapon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXARBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 |year=2013 |publisher=New Press |isbn=978-1-59558-873-9 |page=41}}</ref>\n<ref name=Franks2004>{{cite book |last=Franks |first=Don |title=Entertainment Awards: A Music, Cinema, Theatre and Broadcasting Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOKoBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA242 |edition=3rd |year=2004 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-1-4766-0806-8 |pages=242\u2013243}}</ref>\n<ref name=FJI>{{cite journal |url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/technology/e3ia4c13dab488c47ca38ba99fcd041514b |title=Earth-shattering: FJI salutes the 40th anniversary of Sensurround's quakes and battles |last=Fuchs |first=Andreas |journal=[[Film Journal International]] |date=August 15, 2014 |accessdate=2015-02-11}}</ref>\n<ref name=WhiteLouie>{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Glenn |last2=Louie |first2=Gary J|title=The Audio Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DulVm8t88QkC&pg=PA345 |edition=3rd |year=2005 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0-295-98498-8 |pages=345\u2013346}}</ref>\n<ref name=Gomery>{{cite book |last=Gomery |first=Douglas |title=Shared Pleasures: A History of Movie Presentation in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyFQNU_F5DMC&pg=PA227 |year=1992 |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press |isbn=978-0-299-13214-9 |page=227}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.in70mm.com/library/process/sensurround/index.htm In70mm.com's Sensurround Page]\n* [http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/2004/69/sensurround/index.htm Introduction to Sensurround], reproduced from the Sensurround Model II manual at ''in70mm.com''\n\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:Surround sound]]\n[[Category:Loudspeaker technology]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMidway(link changed toMidway (1976 film); link changed toMidway (1976 film); link changed toMidway (1976 film)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensurround"}

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E.

However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album).

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

An earlier version of the band had been loosely formed for 19&nbsp;October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album).

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.
