During the 2005 elections, Naggar participated in the Brotherhood's electoral campaign in the hopes of mobilizing people in support of Islamist candidates. However, he has since expressed disappointment over the Brothers' poor showing in the elections, and his writing has begun to focus increasingly on how to transform the Brotherhood into a more open movement and a more effective political party. Naggar has been especially critical of the Brotherhood's political platform, released in August 2007, and he has also attacked the approach of the older generation in dealing with local and regional issues. Naggar's blog additionally serves as a clearinghouse for links to other blog-based critiques of the Brotherhood. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713005758/http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=21203 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> reported that Wael Ghonim was alive and detained by the authorities and to be released \"within hours\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/t/confirmation-rt-fustat-mo_33997531130101761.html |title=Confirmation??

However, he has since expressed disappointment over the Brothers' poor showing in the elections, and his writing has begun to focus increasingly on how to transform the Brotherhood into a more open movement and a more effective political party. Naggar has been especially critical of the Brotherhood's political platform, released in August 2007, and he has also attacked the approach of the older generation in dealing with local and regional issues. Naggar's blog additionally serves as a clearinghouse for links to other blog-based critiques of the Brotherhood. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713005758/http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=21203 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> reported that Wael Ghonim was alive and detained by the authorities and to be released \"within hours\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/t/confirmation-rt-fustat-mo_33997531130101761.html |title=Confirmation??

I went to the street because of two things: I hate it when I see people eating from the trash. I work for a corporation, I'm well paid, and a lot of us just sympathized with those people, but they're not willing to pay the price of really helping them out. It's not just me; it's thousands of Egyptians. One of my friends who lost his eye [during the protests] actually drives a Ferrari. He went on the day of 25th. The second was dignity. We wanted our dignity back.

It is focused around a series of [[cross-genre]] video games. The [[Sakura Wars (1996 video game)|first game in the series]] was released in 1996, with five sequels and numerous spin-off titles being released since then. The series\u2014set during a fictionalized version of the [[Taish\u014d period]]\u2014depicts groups of women with magical abilities using steam-powered [[mecha]] to combat demonic threats.\n\nThe original ''Sakura Wars'' was an ambitious title for the then-in-production [[Sega Saturn]]. The first game's overlap of the [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[dating sim]] and [[visual novel]] genres prompted Sega to classify it as a \"dramatic adventure\", a moniker which has endured during the series' lifetime. Both [[Red Entertainment]] and Sega co-developed most of the games until 2008, when the series went on hiatus. Sega rebooted the series as sole developer because of fan demand. Recurring elements include anime cutscenes created by notable studios including [[Production I.G]], and music by composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]].\n\nThe series has sold over 4.5 million copies as of 2010, and garnered both critical and popular acclaim. The original Sega console games have been voted among the most popular for the Saturn and Dreamcast. The ''Sakura Wars'' franchise includes numerous [[anime]] productions, manga, and other media projects such as stage shows. With the exception of ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'' and the 2019 [[Sakura Wars (2019 video game)|soft reboot]], the video game series has not been released in English. Several of the anime series have been localized for English territories.\n\n==Games==\n{{See also|List of Sakura Wars media}}\n\n[[Sakura Wars (1996 video game)|The first installment]] was released on September 27, 1996.

While a few men are capable of using them, women form the main combat units because of their stronger spiritual power. This group is known as the Imperial Assault Force, based in a theater and working undercover as the Imperial Theater Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/> The group to which the protagonists belong is the Flower Division (Hanagumi), the main combat troop. Other groups make cameo appearances in the story if present.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/>\n\nThe first four games follow the military and romantic exploits of Imperial Army officer Ichiro Ogami. Originally assigned to the Imperial Assault Force in Tokyo, he later traveled to Paris and trained the newly-formed Paris Assault Force before returning to Tokyo and commanding the two united Flower Divisions during the events of ''Sakura Wars 4''.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Info\"/> For ''So Long, My Love'', the lead protagonist was changed to Ogami's nephew Shinjiro Taiga, who is sent in place of Ogami to train the New York Combat Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraVinfo\"/> The 2019 soft reboot of ''Sakura Wars'' takes place in 1940, twelve years after an event called the \"Great Demon War\" saw the destruction of all three original Flower Divisions. New divisions were created across the world and began competing with each other, with the newly-reformed Tokyo Flower Division being the main protagonists.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/>\n\n===Gameplay===\nThe gameplay of ''Sakura Wars'' incorporate [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[dating sim]] and [[visual novel]] elements.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2019battleA\"/> This blend of genres and styles resulted in it being labeled as a new genre dubbed \"dramatic adventure\" in its marketing.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewDrama\"/> The original combination of narrative and [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing ]] gameplay was inspired by the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} The gameplay is split between adventure-style segments where the player explores environments and interacts with cast members; and battle sections where choices during the adventure segments come into play. With the main female cast, the protagonist can pursue a romance.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> Romance options can be carried between the first four titles using save data.<ref name=\"Sakura4Gameplay2\"/>\n\nThroughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. The first ''Sakura Wars'' and its sequel made use of a traditional [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based battle system]] on a tilted two-dimensional grid-based battlefield. Each unit has two actions from a selection of five.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGameplay\"/> The sequel expanded the selection to six, and included cinematic attacks. The leader could also issue commands to the entire squad to take specific battle formations.<ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay2\"/> ''Sakura Wars 3'' introduced the \"Active & Realtime Machine System\" (ARMS), which takes place in three-dimensional battle arenas. Under this system, units have an allotment of Action Points (AP). AP are used up by moving around the battlefield. Units can perform one of six actions, with two actions per turn as in earlier titles.<ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/><ref name=\"SW3gameplay2\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Gameplay1\"/> Each unit has special abilities, and attack ranges based on their weaponry.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/><ref name=\"SW3gameplay2\"/> For the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', the battle system was redesigned to use action-based combat, focusing on free movement within large arenas.<ref name=\"Sakura2019battleA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2019battleB\"/>\n\nCentral to all the games and most spin-off titles is the \"Live & Interactive Picture System\" (LIPS). During conversations with characters and key story sections, the player is faced with critical choices with an imposed time limit.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMobile4\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDSinfo\"/> The concept behind LIPS was to maintain player engagement while making narrative rather than freezing time and allowing prolonged time for thought, a trend the staff found annoying.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} The most basic version was established in the first ''Sakura Wars'',<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> then later expanded into \"Double LIPS\" with the incorporation of a personality meter which could indicate a character's feelings towards the player.<ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/> Between ''Is Paris Burning?'' and ''So Long, My Love'', a version called \"Analog LIPS\" was used. This allowed players to alter the intensity of a single response. It also included interacting with the character and environments.<ref name=\"SW3gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Manual\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVPreview\"/> ''So Long, My Love'' expanded it further with [[quick time event|quick time events]] using the control sticks and buttons.<ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/> The 2019 ''Sakura Wars'' continues this use of the LIPS system, featuring Analog LIPS and new free-roaming elements.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraManual\"/> Choices made during LIPS sections directly impact character performance in battle.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"ShinSakuraManual\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Origins and development===\nIn 1990, [[Oji Hiroi]] at [[Red Entertainment]] (formally Red Company) decided to create ''Sakura Wars''. Hiroi drew inspiration from Japanese stage shows when creating the project, initially titled {{Nihongo|\"''Sakura''\"|\u685c|}}.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> Because of lack of interest from publishers, Hiroi shelved the project until he was approached by [[Sega]] vice president [[Shoichiro Irimajiri]] to develop a new project for the Saturn. Successfully pitching his project to Irimajiri, the game began production under the title ''Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"SakuraRomantica\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/> While the scenario and gameplay went through multiple redrafts, ''Sakura Wars'' always made use of a steampunk setting, a female lead and [[mecha]] combat.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> Development lasted three years, double the original estimate, and was Sega's most expensive project at the time.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterviewMusic\"/> Many within both Red Company and Sega were sceptical of the game's success, but Hiroi remained confident.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=180}} Following the critical and commercial success of ''Sakura Wars'', Sega and Red Company expanded the original premise into a franchise, starting with ''Thou Shalt Not Die''.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/> A recurring feature from ''Thou Shalt Not Die'' onwards was the use of subtitles drawn from famous poetry or other types of fiction related to a game's location or mood. A recurring poet was [[Akiko Yosano]], whom Hiroi admired.<ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/><ref name=\"SakuraColdInterview\"/><ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/>\n\nFollowing ''Thou Shalt Not Die'', the team moved onto the Dreamcast to develop ''Sakura Wars 3'', rebuilding the game engine and utilising the console's functions for gameplay elements.<ref name=\"Sakura3Info\"/> Following the release of ''Sakura Wars 3'', Sega discontinued the Dreamcast because of declining console sales, transitioning to a software developer and publisher. Rather than move their planned next entry to the PlayStation 2, the team created a final Dreamcast entry as a celebratory title for series fans.<ref name=\"Sakura4Origins\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Info\"/> This became ''Sakura Wars 4'', which was completed in 10 months as opposed to the usual two year development period of other entries.<ref name=\"Sakura4Steam\"/> The original story planned for ''Sakura Wars 4'' was moved for the team's next entry on the PlayStation 2.<ref name=\"Sakura4Origins\"/>\n\nIn 2005, Red Entertainment split from Sega after it bought back its majority share holding, although it continued to be involved in the ''Sakura Wars'' series.<ref name=\"RedSplitA\"/> The next entry, ''Sakura Wars V'', formed part of a seven-game group dubbed \"Sakura Wars World Project\"; the aim was to release these games overseas.<ref name=\"SakuraWorldAnnounced\"/> In the event, only ''Sakura Wars V'' was published overseas as ''Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love'', and only three of the other planned games were released.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> The remaining three titles were cancelled in 2008.<ref name=\"FamCancelled\"/> Sega and Red Entertainment [[Green-light|greenlit]] ''Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars'' in an attempt to revitalise the franchise using a new gameplay genre.<ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/> In August 2008, Sega decided to end the franchise, with the final ''Sakura Wars''-themed event being a concert that month.<ref name=\"TanakaBlog\"/> Red Entertainment was bought by Chinese company UltaZen in 2011, with Sega retaining the ''Sakura Wars'' property.<ref name=\"RedSplitB\"/><ref name=\"RedSplitC\"/> Fan demand eventually persuaded Sega to greenlight a new title in the series, which would both continue the narrative and feature a new cast.<ref name=\"FamInterviewShin\"/>\n\n===Staff===\nAll titles from 1996 to 2005 were developed by the same central team. These included writer [[Satoru Akahori]], artists [[K\u014dsuke Fujishima]] and [[Hidenori Matsubara]], director and later chief director Tomoyuki Ito, producer and later executive producer [[Noriyoshi Ohba]], and designer Takaharu Terada. Hiroi had contributed to all the projects as a general producer.<ref name=\"SegaSakuraInterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraV0interview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3Interviews\"/><ref name=\"RPGFinfo\"/> Red Entertainment co-developed the games with an internal Sega team which shifted identity over the years\u2014originally known as CS2 R&D during development of the first two ''Sakura Wars'', the team was renamed [[Sega AM1|Overworks]] in 2000 when Sega consolidated its 9 semi-autonomous subsidiaries into six studios; they worked on the series between ''Sakura Wars 3'' and ''Sakura Wars V: Episode 0''.<ref name=\"OverworksHistory\"/><ref name=\"SegaOverworks\"/><ref name=\"SakuraV0infoSega\"/> ''Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love'' was developed by the same team as part of Sega's GE2 R&D division, the same team which would develop ''[[Valkyria Chronicles (video game)|Valkyria Chronicles]]''.<ref name=\"SakuraVStaff\"/><ref name=\"SakuraValkyria\"/> The 2019 ''Sakura Wars'' was developed by a team within Sega's CS2 R&D division, a newer group including [[Sonic Team]].<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraProduction\"/> New team members included character designer [[Tite Kubo]], and writers [[Jiro Ishii]] and Takaaki Suzuki, all famous names in anime and video games respectively. Hiroi remained in a supervisory role, and also wrote the theme song lyrics.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/>\n\nOther developers worked on the series alongside Sega and Red Entertainment, including [[Idea Factory]], who created the Wii port of ''So Long, My Love'';<ref name=\"IdeaWii\"/> [[Jupiter Corporation]], producers of the ''Sakura Wars GB'' duology and the ''Pocket Sakura'' peripheral;<ref name=\"SakuraGB1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGB2\"/><ref name=\"PocketSakura\"/> and [[Neverland (company)|Neverland]], who developed ''Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"SakuraNeverland\"/> A notable feature of the series is its FMV anime sequences.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> The first game's scenes were animated by Sega's animation subsidiary, Kyokuichi Tokyo Movie (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]).<ref name=\"SakuraStaff\"/><ref name=\"TMShistory\"/> From ''Thou Shalt Not Die'' to ''Fall in Love, Maidens'', they were produced by [[Production I.G]].<ref name=\"Sakura4Dorimanga\"/> For ''So Long, My Love'', the scenes were primarily produced by M.S.C.<ref name=\"SakuraVanime\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVStaff\"/> In the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', the anime FMV sequences were produced by [[Sanzigen]].<ref name=\"GemComments\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe ''Sakura Wars'' series features a variety of music, and frequently reuses themes. [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]] is the chief [[composer|music composer]] of the series. Tanaka's first major work in the video game industry, it brought him widespread recognition.<ref name=\"TanakaSakura\"/> Tanaka was among the first to support Hiroi with ''Sakura Wars'', having worked with him during work on an [[original video animation]] (OVA) of ''[[Tengai Makyou: Ziria]]''. Tanaka acted as a teacher figure for the rest of the development team.<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSide\"/> At that time, rhythm and percussion dominated Japanese popular music rather than melody. Both Tanaka and Hiroi wanted to reintroduce younger Japanese to beautiful melodies.<ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> Tanaka has been involved to some degree in most of the ''Sakura Wars'' games, composing the music for all mainline entries, and several spin-off titles.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDSinfo\"/><ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> A recurring theme in the series is a piece called \"Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan\".{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=138}} Tanaka wrote the theme based on Hiroi's request to combine the music of a ''[[Super Sentai]]'' opening theme with the vocal style of the title song for the film ''[[Aoi sanmyaku]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/> Versions of it were included in ''Sakura Wars 2'', ''Sakura Wars 4'', and the 2019 soft reboot of ''Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Dorimanga\"/><ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/>\n\n===Localization===\nWhile Hiroi wanted the series to be released worldwide, nearly all games in the ''Sakura Wars'' series remain exclusive to Asian territories.<ref name=\"RPGinterview\"/> Early efforts at localizing the series were not undertaken because of Sega's uncertainty over whether the game's blend of genres would find a large enough audience outside Japan to be profitable.<ref name=\"SakuraLocalReason\"/> An unspecified attempt by Sega to localize the game stalled during the concept approval stage for unknown reasons.<ref name=\"SakuraVvoices\"/> The PSP ports of ''Sakura Wars'' and ''Thou Shalt Not Die'' scheduled for the North American market were never released because Sony classified ''Sakura Wars'' as a text novel, which made then-future licensing for importation and translation difficult.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/>\n\nA [[Korean language|Korean]] translation of ''So Long, My Love'' was published in [[South Korea]] by Sega in 2006.<ref name=\"SakuraVKorea\"/> The PC CD-ROM versions of ''Sakura Wars'' and its sequel were localized and released in [[Russia]] by [[Akella]] in 2006 and 2008 respectively.<ref name=\"SakuraRussia1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRussia2\"/> Dysin Interactive published the PC versions of ''Sakura Wars'' to ''Is Paris Burning?'' in China,<ref name=\"SakuraPCChin\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3Chin\"/> and ''Fall in Love, Maidens'' was released in the region by Beijing Entertainment All Technology.<ref name=\"Sakura4ChinA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4ChinB\"/>\n\nThe first official English release in the ''Sakura Wars'' series is ''So Long, My Love'', which was translated by NIS America in collaboration with Red Entertainment and [[Idea Factory]].<ref name=\"RPGinterview\"/> The dub was produced at [[Bang Zoom! Entertainment]], and included actors from NIS America's localization of the ''[[Disgaea]]'' series.<ref name=\"SakuraVlocalInterview2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraWii\"/> The team also included the Japanese voice track in the PlayStation 2 version, with a dedicated translation which preserved the original character names being created for it.<ref name=\"SakuraVvoices\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVvoices2\"/> The localization took two years to complete, becoming NIS America's largest localization effort to date.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraWii\"/> For the 2019 reboot, Sega brought on ''[[Yakuza 0]]'' translators Inbound Games to localise the game.<ref name=\"Sakura2020Local\"/> The localised version uses the Japanese audio with subtitles in other languages.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/>\n\n==Reception and sales==\nBetween the series' debut in 1996 and 2010, the series has sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/> Each entry on Sega hardware rank among the best-selling titles for their respective hardware.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDreamSales\"/> The original ''Sakura Wars'' was an immediate success, with several stores being sold out of copies within hours of its release.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> ''Sakura Wars 2'' remains the best-selling title in the series, with over 500,000 copies sold on the Saturn alone, making it one of the console's best-selling titles in Japan.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/><ref name=\"FamSales\"/> ''So Long, My Love'' is the worst-selling mainline entry to date,<ref name=\"FamSales\"/> and was a commercial failure in the West.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/>\n\nJapanese website [[4Gamer.net]] described the series as a \"legendary\" property connected to Sega, citing several elements such as the anime-style presentation and blend of genres that were hardly seen in gaming at the time.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/> Jenni Lada of TechnologyTell wrote a retrospective on the series in 2009, calling ''Sakura Wars'' \"an odd series [...] that defies genres\".<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> In a 1999 [[IGN]] article on the franchise following the announcement of ''Sakura Wars 3'', journalist Anoop Gantayat described it as \"probably the greatest series of games to never make their way stateside\", citing its unprecedented success when compared to other games on Sega hardware at the time.<ref name=\"SakuraIGNretro\"/>\n\nThe series has been popular with both journalists and fans in Japan since the first game's release.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> At the inaugural [[Japan Game Awards|CESA Awards]], ''Sakura Wars'' won the Grand Award, as well as awards in the Best Director, Best Main Character and Best Supporting Character categories.<ref name=\"CESAawards\"/> ''Sakura Wars 2'' won the [[Animation Kobe#Packaged Work Award|Packaged Work Award]] at the 1998 [[Animation Kobe]] event.<ref name=\"Sakura2Award\"/> The soundtrack album of ''Sakura Wars 4''  won in the \"Animation \u2013 Album of the Year\" category at the 2003 [[Japan Gold Disc Award]]s.<ref name=\"Sakura4Award\"/> Prior to release, ''Sakura Wars'' was the second most-wanted game in a ''Famitsu'' poll in 1996, coming in behind ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.<ref name=\"SakuraIGNretro\"/> The first four games all appeared on a public ''Famitsu'' poll from 2006 of the 100 best games of all time.<ref name=\"SakuraRating2006\"/> A second later poll ranked the ''Sakura Wars'' games as among the best on the Saturn and Dreamcast.<ref name=\"KotakuSakura\"/> ''Sakura Wars'' heroine Sakura Shinguji was rated in 2009 by ''Famitsu'' as the 17th best Japanese video game character.<ref name=\"FamPoll1UP\"/>\n\n==Related media==\n[[File:sakura-taisen-cafe.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''Sakura Wars'' series met with considerable success, spawning a multimedia franchise and having its own themed cafe between 1998 and 2008.<ref name=\"SakuraStore\"/>|alt=A view through a doorway into a cafe area; a sign reads Sakura Cafe and the interior is decorated using wood panelling with red and gold elements.]]\nRed Company and Sega have expanded the ''Sakura Wars'' series into various media.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> These include anime, manga, stage shows, several [[light novel]]s, concerts and CD album releases of soundtracks. The latter have met with substantial commercial success.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMediaSales\"/> Despite a shared identity, Hiroi took care to keep each of these elements distinct and separate from each other.<ref name=\"ATsakuraInterview\"/> A dedicated themed cafe and merchandise store based in the [[Ikebukuro]] district of Tokyo, ''Sakura Wars Taisho Romando'', opened in 1998. ''Taisho Romando'' remained open for ten years until it closed in March 2008.<ref name=\"SakuraStore\"/>\n\nA prominent feature was an annual stage show dubbed ''Sakura Wars Kayou Show'' supervised by Hiroi, for which new musical numbers were created by Tanaka.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageTanaka\"/> The show featured the cast reprising their roles and performing stage shows drawn from the series. Each character had songs themed after their characters.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageCast\"/> The cast, which grew to include those of later games, remained for the entire run with the exception of actress [[Michie Tomizawa]] who retired from the series and her role as character Sumire Kanzaki in 2002.<ref name=\"SakuraStageSumire\"/><ref name=\"SakuraTomizawa\"/> Tomizawa appeared as a guest in later revival concerts.<ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageSumire\"/> The original stage shows ran regularly from 1997 to 2006.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageCast\"/> Since then, it has seen irregular revivals with both the first cast and later additions.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRevive2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive3\"/> The stage shows were originally meant to end in 2008 along with the franchise, but fan support allowed future revivals.<ref name=\"TanakaBlog\"/> A new stage play based on the 2019 game will premier in March 2020.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraStage\"/>\n\nHiroi wrote a manga adaptation of the first ''Sakura Wars'', which began serialization in 2002. The original run finished in December 2008, but its popularity led to a second series continuing the narrative.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaA\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaB\"/> Since 2003, the manga has been published as [[tank\u014dbon]] by [[Kodansha]].<ref name=\"SakuraMangaKodansha1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaKodansha2\"/> A comedy manga titled ''Sakura Wars: Show Theater'', which featured comedy skits of characters from each main ''Sakura Wars'' location, was serialised between 2005 and 2009, and published by Kodansha in four volumes between 2006 and 2009.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaTheater\"/> A manga adaptation of the 2019 game, ''Shin Sakura Taisen: The Comic'', began serialization in 2019 by [[Shueisha]]. It was written by Ishii, and illustrated by Koyuri Noguchi.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraManga\"/>\n\nA spin-off manga ''Sakura Wars: Kanadegumi'' was created by Chie Shimada, based on concepts from the ''Sakura Wars'' team, and published in the shojo magazine ''[[Hana to Yume]]'' published by [[Hakusensha]].<ref name=\"SakuraKanade1\"/> In contrast to the main series, it was aimed at a female audience and shifted the narrative to a male harem set-up; main protagonist Neko Miyabi is assigned to the titular Kanadagumi, and develops relationships with its five male members.<ref name=\"SakuraKanade1\"/> Originally a two-chapter special published between November and December 2011,<ref name=\"SakuraKanade1\"/> it was expanded into a full series in February 2012.<ref name=\"SakuraKanade2\"/> The manga ran from 2012 to 2013.

The OVA was released as four 30-minute episodes from 1997 to 1998, following the cast of the first game.<ref name=\"Sakura1OVA\"/> A second OVA series, ''[[Sakura Wars: The Radiant Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms|The Radiant Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms]]'', was released as six 30-minute episodes from 1999 to 2000, relating side stories from between ''Sakura Wars'' and the end of ''Thou Shalt Not Die''.<ref name=\"Sakura2OVAa\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2OVAb\"/> Further OVA series based around the characters of ''Is Paris Burning?'' and ''So Long, My Love'' (''\u00c9cole de Paris''; ''Le Nouveau Paris''; ''Sumire''; ''New York, New York'') were released from 2003 to 2007.<ref name=\"Sakura3OVA1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3OVA2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSumire\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVova\"/> The OVAs were produced by [[Radix Ace Entertainment]] until ''New York, New York'' in 2007, when production shifted by [[Anime International Company]].<ref name=\"Sakura1OVA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2OVAa\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSumire\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVova\"/>\n\nAn [[Sakura Wars (TV series)|anime television series]] based on the first game was co-produced by Red Company, [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] and Studio Matrix. The 25-episode series was broadcast on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] from April 8 to September 23, 2000.<ref name=\"SakuraWhatsB\"/> While based on the first game's narrative and preserving Hiroi's vision, the series changed and added in several events. A major problem was remaining faithful to the source material within a TV format.<ref name=\"OjiInterviewSWanimeB\"/> In 2001, an animated theatrical film, ''[[Sakura Wars: The Movie]]'', was released. The film takes place between ''Is Paris Burning?'' and ''Fall in Love, Maidens'' and features new character Ratchet Altair who would later appear in ''So Long, My Love''.<ref name=\"SakuraVGuidebook\"/><ref name=\"ASCIIproduction\"/><ref name=\"SakuraReleaseInfo\"/> The film was animated by Production I.G; production took three years and was inspired by the wish to expand the series animation beyond what the short cutscenes and OVA projects had achieved.<ref name=\"SakuraMovieInterview\"/> A second anime television series, titled ''Sakura Wars the Animation'' and serving as a sequel to the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', is scheduled to premiere on April 3, 2020.

It is focused around a series of [[cross-genre]] video games.

The series\u2014set during a fictionalized version of the [[Taish\u014d period]]\u2014depicts groups of women with magical abilities using steam-powered [[mecha]] to combat demonic threats.\n\nThe original ''Sakura Wars'' was an ambitious title for the then-in-production [[Sega Saturn]]. The first game's overlap of the [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[dating sim]] and [[visual novel]] genres prompted Sega to classify it as a \"dramatic adventure\", a moniker which has endured during the series' lifetime. Both [[Red Entertainment]] and Sega co-developed most of the games until 2008, when the series went on hiatus. Sega rebooted the series as sole developer because of fan demand. Recurring elements include anime cutscenes created by notable studios including [[Production I.G]], and music by composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]].\n\nThe series has sold over 4.5 million copies as of 2010, and garnered both critical and popular acclaim. The original Sega console games have been voted among the most popular for the Saturn and Dreamcast. The ''Sakura Wars'' franchise includes numerous [[anime]] productions, manga, and other media projects such as stage shows. With the exception of ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'' and the 2019 [[Sakura Wars (2019 video game)|soft reboot]], the video game series has not been released in English. Several of the anime series have been localized for English territories.\n\n==Games==\n{{See also|List of Sakura Wars media}}\n\n[[Sakura Wars (1996 video game)|The first installment]] was released on September 27, 1996.

While a few men are capable of using them, women form the main combat units because of their stronger spiritual power. This group is known as the Imperial Assault Force, based in a theater and working undercover as the Imperial Theater Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/> The group to which the protagonists belong is the Flower Division (Hanagumi), the main combat troop. Other groups make cameo appearances in the story if present.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/>\n\nThe first four games follow the military and romantic exploits of Imperial Army officer Ichiro Ogami. Originally assigned to the Imperial Assault Force in Tokyo, he later traveled to Paris and trained the newly-formed Paris Assault Force before returning to Tokyo and commanding the two united Flower Divisions during the events of ''Sakura Wars 4''.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Info\"/> For ''So Long, My Love'', the lead protagonist was changed to Ogami's nephew Shinjiro Taiga, who is sent in place of Ogami to train the New York Combat Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraVinfo\"/> The 2019 soft reboot of ''Sakura Wars'' takes place in 1940, twelve years after an event called the \"Great Demon War\" saw the destruction of all three original Flower Divisions. New divisions were created across the world and began competing with each other, with the newly-reformed Tokyo Flower Division being the main protagonists.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/>\n\n===Gameplay===\nThe gameplay of ''Sakura Wars'' incorporate [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[dating sim]] and [[visual novel]] elements.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2019battleA\"/> This blend of genres and styles resulted in it being labeled as a new genre dubbed \"dramatic adventure\" in its marketing.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewDrama\"/> The original combination of narrative and [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing ]] gameplay was inspired by the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} The gameplay is split between adventure-style segments where the player explores environments and interacts with cast members; and battle sections where choices during the adventure segments come into play. With the main female cast, the protagonist can pursue a romance.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> Romance options can be carried between the first four titles using save data.<ref name=\"Sakura4Gameplay2\"/>\n\nThroughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. The first ''Sakura Wars'' and its sequel made use of a traditional [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based battle system]] on a tilted two-dimensional grid-based battlefield. Each unit has two actions from a selection of five.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGameplay\"/> The sequel expanded the selection to six, and included cinematic attacks. The leader could also issue commands to the entire squad to take specific battle formations.<ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay2\"/> ''Sakura Wars 3'' introduced the \"Active & Realtime Machine System\" (ARMS), which takes place in three-dimensional battle arenas. Under this system, units have an allotment of Action Points (AP). AP are used up by moving around the battlefield. Units can perform one of six actions, with two actions per turn as in earlier titles.<ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/><ref name=\"SW3gameplay2\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Gameplay1\"/> Each unit has special abilities, and attack ranges based on their weaponry.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/><ref name=\"SW3gameplay2\"/> For the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', the battle system was redesigned to use action-based combat, focusing on free movement within large arenas.<ref name=\"Sakura2019battleA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2019battleB\"/>\n\nCentral to all the games and most spin-off titles is the \"Live & Interactive Picture System\" (LIPS). During conversations with characters and key story sections, the player is faced with critical choices with an imposed time limit.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMobile4\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDSinfo\"/> The concept behind LIPS was to maintain player engagement while making narrative rather than freezing time and allowing prolonged time for thought, a trend the staff found annoying.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} The most basic version was established in the first ''Sakura Wars'',<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> then later expanded into \"Double LIPS\" with the incorporation of a personality meter which could indicate a character's feelings towards the player.<ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/> Between ''Is Paris Burning?'' and ''So Long, My Love'', a version called \"Analog LIPS\" was used. This allowed players to alter the intensity of a single response. It also included interacting with the character and environments.<ref name=\"SW3gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Manual\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVPreview\"/> ''So Long, My Love'' expanded it further with [[quick time event|quick time events]] using the control sticks and buttons.<ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/> The 2019 ''Sakura Wars'' continues this use of the LIPS system, featuring Analog LIPS and new free-roaming elements.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraManual\"/> Choices made during LIPS sections directly impact character performance in battle.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"ShinSakuraManual\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Origins and development===\nIn 1990, [[Oji Hiroi]] at [[Red Entertainment]] (formally Red Company) decided to create ''Sakura Wars''. Hiroi drew inspiration from Japanese stage shows when creating the project, initially titled {{Nihongo|\"''Sakura''\"|\u685c|}}.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> Because of lack of interest from publishers, Hiroi shelved the project until he was approached by [[Sega]] vice president [[Shoichiro Irimajiri]] to develop a new project for the Saturn. Successfully pitching his project to Irimajiri, the game began production under the title ''Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"SakuraRomantica\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/> While the scenario and gameplay went through multiple redrafts, ''Sakura Wars'' always made use of a steampunk setting, a female lead and [[mecha]] combat.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> Development lasted three years, double the original estimate, and was Sega's most expensive project at the time.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterviewMusic\"/> Many within both Red Company and Sega were sceptical of the game's success, but Hiroi remained confident.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=180}} Following the critical and commercial success of ''Sakura Wars'', Sega and Red Company expanded the original premise into a franchise, starting with ''Thou Shalt Not Die''.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/> A recurring feature from ''Thou Shalt Not Die'' onwards was the use of subtitles drawn from famous poetry or other types of fiction related to a game's location or mood. A recurring poet was [[Akiko Yosano]], whom Hiroi admired.<ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/><ref name=\"SakuraColdInterview\"/><ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/>\n\nFollowing ''Thou Shalt Not Die'', the team moved onto the Dreamcast to develop ''Sakura Wars 3'', rebuilding the game engine and utilising the console's functions for gameplay elements.<ref name=\"Sakura3Info\"/> Following the release of ''Sakura Wars 3'', Sega discontinued the Dreamcast because of declining console sales, transitioning to a software developer and publisher. Rather than move their planned next entry to the PlayStation 2, the team created a final Dreamcast entry as a celebratory title for series fans.<ref name=\"Sakura4Origins\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Info\"/> This became ''Sakura Wars 4'', which was completed in 10 months as opposed to the usual two year development period of other entries.<ref name=\"Sakura4Steam\"/> The original story planned for ''Sakura Wars 4'' was moved for the team's next entry on the PlayStation 2.<ref name=\"Sakura4Origins\"/>\n\nIn 2005, Red Entertainment split from Sega after it bought back its majority share holding, although it continued to be involved in the ''Sakura Wars'' series.<ref name=\"RedSplitA\"/> The next entry, ''Sakura Wars V'', formed part of a seven-game group dubbed \"Sakura Wars World Project\"; the aim was to release these games overseas.<ref name=\"SakuraWorldAnnounced\"/> In the event, only ''Sakura Wars V'' was published overseas as ''Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love'', and only three of the other planned games were released.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> The remaining three titles were cancelled in 2008.<ref name=\"FamCancelled\"/> Sega and Red Entertainment [[Green-light|greenlit]] ''Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars'' in an attempt to revitalise the franchise using a new gameplay genre.<ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/> In August 2008, Sega decided to end the franchise, with the final ''Sakura Wars''-themed event being a concert that month.<ref name=\"TanakaBlog\"/> Red Entertainment was bought by Chinese company UltaZen in 2011, with Sega retaining the ''Sakura Wars'' property.<ref name=\"RedSplitB\"/><ref name=\"RedSplitC\"/> Fan demand eventually persuaded Sega to greenlight a new title in the series, which would both continue the narrative and feature a new cast.<ref name=\"FamInterviewShin\"/>\n\n===Staff===\nAll titles from 1996 to 2005 were developed by the same central team. These included writer [[Satoru Akahori]], artists [[K\u014dsuke Fujishima]] and [[Hidenori Matsubara]], director and later chief director Tomoyuki Ito, producer and later executive producer [[Noriyoshi Ohba]], and designer Takaharu Terada. Hiroi had contributed to all the projects as a general producer.<ref name=\"SegaSakuraInterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraV0interview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3Interviews\"/><ref name=\"RPGFinfo\"/> Red Entertainment co-developed the games with an internal Sega team which shifted identity over the years\u2014originally known as CS2 R&D during development of the first two ''Sakura Wars'', the team was renamed [[Sega AM1|Overworks]] in 2000 when Sega consolidated its 9 semi-autonomous subsidiaries into six studios; they worked on the series between ''Sakura Wars 3'' and ''Sakura Wars V: Episode 0''.<ref name=\"OverworksHistory\"/><ref name=\"SegaOverworks\"/><ref name=\"SakuraV0infoSega\"/> ''Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love'' was developed by the same team as part of Sega's GE2 R&D division, the same team which would develop ''[[Valkyria Chronicles (video game)|Valkyria Chronicles]]''.<ref name=\"SakuraVStaff\"/><ref name=\"SakuraValkyria\"/> The 2019 ''Sakura Wars'' was developed by a team within Sega's CS2 R&D division, a newer group including [[Sonic Team]].<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraProduction\"/> New team members included character designer [[Tite Kubo]], and writers [[Jiro Ishii]] and Takaaki Suzuki, all famous names in anime and video games respectively. Hiroi remained in a supervisory role, and also wrote the theme song lyrics.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/>\n\nOther developers worked on the series alongside Sega and Red Entertainment, including [[Idea Factory]], who created the Wii port of ''So Long, My Love'';<ref name=\"IdeaWii\"/> [[Jupiter Corporation]], producers of the ''Sakura Wars GB'' duology and the ''Pocket Sakura'' peripheral;<ref name=\"SakuraGB1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGB2\"/><ref name=\"PocketSakura\"/> and [[Neverland (company)|Neverland]], who developed ''Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"SakuraNeverland\"/> A notable feature of the series is its FMV anime sequences.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> The first game's scenes were animated by Sega's animation subsidiary, Kyokuichi Tokyo Movie (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]).<ref name=\"SakuraStaff\"/><ref name=\"TMShistory\"/> From ''Thou Shalt Not Die'' to ''Fall in Love, Maidens'', they were produced by [[Production I.G]].<ref name=\"Sakura4Dorimanga\"/> For ''So Long, My Love'', the scenes were primarily produced by M.S.C.<ref name=\"SakuraVanime\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVStaff\"/> In the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', the anime FMV sequences were produced by [[Sanzigen]].<ref name=\"GemComments\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe ''Sakura Wars'' series features a variety of music, and frequently reuses themes. [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]] is the chief [[composer|music composer]] of the series. Tanaka's first major work in the video game industry, it brought him widespread recognition.<ref name=\"TanakaSakura\"/> Tanaka was among the first to support Hiroi with ''Sakura Wars'', having worked with him during work on an [[original video animation]] (OVA) of ''[[Tengai Makyou: Ziria]]''. Tanaka acted as a teacher figure for the rest of the development team.<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSide\"/> At that time, rhythm and percussion dominated Japanese popular music rather than melody. Both Tanaka and Hiroi wanted to reintroduce younger Japanese to beautiful melodies.<ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> Tanaka has been involved to some degree in most of the ''Sakura Wars'' games, composing the music for all mainline entries, and several spin-off titles.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDSinfo\"/><ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> A recurring theme in the series is a piece called \"Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan\".{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=138}} Tanaka wrote the theme based on Hiroi's request to combine the music of a ''[[Super Sentai]]'' opening theme with the vocal style of the title song for the film ''[[Aoi sanmyaku]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/> Versions of it were included in ''Sakura Wars 2'', ''Sakura Wars 4'', and the 2019 soft reboot of ''Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Dorimanga\"/><ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/>\n\n===Localization===\nWhile Hiroi wanted the series to be released worldwide, nearly all games in the ''Sakura Wars'' series remain exclusive to Asian territories.<ref name=\"RPGinterview\"/> Early efforts at localizing the series were not undertaken because of Sega's uncertainty over whether the game's blend of genres would find a large enough audience outside Japan to be profitable.<ref name=\"SakuraLocalReason\"/> An unspecified attempt by Sega to localize the game stalled during the concept approval stage for unknown reasons.<ref name=\"SakuraVvoices\"/> The PSP ports of ''Sakura Wars'' and ''Thou Shalt Not Die'' scheduled for the North American market were never released because Sony classified ''Sakura Wars'' as a text novel, which made then-future licensing for importation and translation difficult.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/>\n\nA [[Korean language|Korean]] translation of ''So Long, My Love'' was published in [[South Korea]] by Sega in 2006.<ref name=\"SakuraVKorea\"/> The PC CD-ROM versions of ''Sakura Wars'' and its sequel were localized and released in [[Russia]] by [[Akella]] in 2006 and 2008 respectively.<ref name=\"SakuraRussia1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRussia2\"/> Dysin Interactive published the PC versions of ''Sakura Wars'' to ''Is Paris Burning?'' in China,<ref name=\"SakuraPCChin\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3Chin\"/> and ''Fall in Love, Maidens'' was released in the region by Beijing Entertainment All Technology.<ref name=\"Sakura4ChinA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4ChinB\"/>\n\nThe first official English release in the ''Sakura Wars'' series is ''So Long, My Love'', which was translated by NIS America in collaboration with Red Entertainment and [[Idea Factory]].<ref name=\"RPGinterview\"/> The dub was produced at [[Bang Zoom! Entertainment]], and included actors from NIS America's localization of the ''[[Disgaea]]'' series.<ref name=\"SakuraVlocalInterview2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraWii\"/> The team also included the Japanese voice track in the PlayStation 2 version, with a dedicated translation which preserved the original character names being created for it.<ref name=\"SakuraVvoices\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVvoices2\"/> The localization took two years to complete, becoming NIS America's largest localization effort to date.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraWii\"/> For the 2019 reboot, Sega brought on ''[[Yakuza 0]]'' translators Inbound Games to localise the game.<ref name=\"Sakura2020Local\"/> The localised version uses the Japanese audio with subtitles in other languages.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/>\n\n==Reception and sales==\nBetween the series' debut in 1996 and 2010, the series has sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/> Each entry on Sega hardware rank among the best-selling titles for their respective hardware.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDreamSales\"/> The original ''Sakura Wars'' was an immediate success, with several stores being sold out of copies within hours of its release.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> ''Sakura Wars 2'' remains the best-selling title in the series, with over 500,000 copies sold on the Saturn alone, making it one of the console's best-selling titles in Japan.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/><ref name=\"FamSales\"/> ''So Long, My Love'' is the worst-selling mainline entry to date,<ref name=\"FamSales\"/> and was a commercial failure in the West.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/>\n\nJapanese website [[4Gamer.net]] described the series as a \"legendary\" property connected to Sega, citing several elements such as the anime-style presentation and blend of genres that were hardly seen in gaming at the time.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/> Jenni Lada of TechnologyTell wrote a retrospective on the series in 2009, calling ''Sakura Wars'' \"an odd series [...] that defies genres\".<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> In a 1999 [[IGN]] article on the franchise following the announcement of ''Sakura Wars 3'', journalist Anoop Gantayat described it as \"probably the greatest series of games to never make their way stateside\", citing its unprecedented success when compared to other games on Sega hardware at the time.<ref name=\"SakuraIGNretro\"/>\n\nThe series has been popular with both journalists and fans in Japan since the first game's release.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> At the inaugural [[Japan Game Awards|CESA Awards]], ''Sakura Wars'' won the Grand Award, as well as awards in the Best Director, Best Main Character and Best Supporting Character categories.<ref name=\"CESAawards\"/> ''Sakura Wars 2'' won the [[Animation Kobe#Packaged Work Award|Packaged Work Award]] at the 1998 [[Animation Kobe]] event.<ref name=\"Sakura2Award\"/> The soundtrack album of ''Sakura Wars 4''  won in the \"Animation \u2013 Album of the Year\" category at the 2003 [[Japan Gold Disc Award]]s.<ref name=\"Sakura4Award\"/> Prior to release, ''Sakura Wars'' was the second most-wanted game in a ''Famitsu'' poll in 1996, coming in behind ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.<ref name=\"SakuraIGNretro\"/> The first four games all appeared on a public ''Famitsu'' poll from 2006 of the 100 best games of all time.<ref name=\"SakuraRating2006\"/> A second later poll ranked the ''Sakura Wars'' games as among the best on the Saturn and Dreamcast.<ref name=\"KotakuSakura\"/> ''Sakura Wars'' heroine Sakura Shinguji was rated in 2009 by ''Famitsu'' as the 17th best Japanese video game character.<ref name=\"FamPoll1UP\"/>\n\n==Related media==\n[[File:sakura-taisen-cafe.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''Sakura Wars'' series met with considerable success, spawning a multimedia franchise and having its own themed cafe between 1998 and 2008.<ref name=\"SakuraStore\"/>|alt=A view through a doorway into a cafe area; a sign reads Sakura Cafe and the interior is decorated using wood panelling with red and gold elements.]]\nRed Company and Sega have expanded the ''Sakura Wars'' series into various media.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> These include anime, manga, stage shows, several [[light novel]]s, concerts and CD album releases of soundtracks. The latter have met with substantial commercial success.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMediaSales\"/> Despite a shared identity, Hiroi took care to keep each of these elements distinct and separate from each other.<ref name=\"ATsakuraInterview\"/> A dedicated themed cafe and merchandise store based in the [[Ikebukuro]] district of Tokyo, ''Sakura Wars Taisho Romando'', opened in 1998. ''Taisho Romando'' remained open for ten years until it closed in March 2008.<ref name=\"SakuraStore\"/>\n\nA prominent feature was an annual stage show dubbed ''Sakura Wars Kayou Show'' supervised by Hiroi, for which new musical numbers were created by Tanaka.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageTanaka\"/> The show featured the cast reprising their roles and performing stage shows drawn from the series. Each character had songs themed after their characters.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageCast\"/> The cast, which grew to include those of later games, remained for the entire run with the exception of actress [[Michie Tomizawa]] who retired from the series and her role as character Sumire Kanzaki in 2002.<ref name=\"SakuraStageSumire\"/><ref name=\"SakuraTomizawa\"/> Tomizawa appeared as a guest in later revival concerts.<ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageSumire\"/> The original stage shows ran regularly from 1997 to 2006.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageCast\"/> Since then, it has seen irregular revivals with both the first cast and later additions.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRevive2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive3\"/> The stage shows were originally meant to end in 2008 along with the franchise, but fan support allowed future revivals.<ref name=\"TanakaBlog\"/> A new stage play based on the 2019 game will premier in March 2020.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraStage\"/>\n\nHiroi wrote a manga adaptation of the first ''Sakura Wars'', which began serialization in 2002. The original run finished in December 2008, but its popularity led to a second series continuing the narrative.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaA\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaB\"/> Since 2003, the manga has been published as [[tank\u014dbon]] by [[Kodansha]].<ref name=\"SakuraMangaKodansha1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaKodansha2\"/> A comedy manga titled ''Sakura Wars: Show Theater'', which featured comedy skits of characters from each main ''Sakura Wars'' location, was serialised between 2005 and 2009, and published by Kodansha in four volumes between 2006 and 2009.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaTheater\"/> A manga adaptation of the 2019 game, ''Shin Sakura Taisen: The Comic'', began serialization in 2019 by [[Shueisha]]. It was written by Ishii, and illustrated by Koyuri Noguchi.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraManga\"/>\n\nA spin-off manga ''Sakura Wars: Kanadegumi'' was created by Chie Shimada, based on concepts from the ''Sakura Wars'' team, and published in the shojo magazine ''[[Hana to Yume]]'' published by [[Hakusensha]].<ref name=\"SakuraKanade1\"/> In contrast to the main series, it was aimed at a female audience and shifted the narrative to a male harem set-up; main protagonist Neko Miyabi is assigned to the titular Kanadagumi, and develops relationships with its five male members.<ref name=\"SakuraKanade1\"/> Originally a two-chapter special published between November and December 2011,<ref name=\"SakuraKanade1\"/> it was expanded into a full series in February 2012.<ref name=\"SakuraKanade2\"/> The manga ran from 2012 to 2013.

The OVA was released as four 30-minute episodes from 1997 to 1998, following the cast of the first game.<ref name=\"Sakura1OVA\"/> A second OVA series, ''[[Sakura Wars: The Radiant Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms|The Radiant Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms]]'', was released as six 30-minute episodes from 1999 to 2000, relating side stories from between ''Sakura Wars'' and the end of ''Thou Shalt Not Die''.<ref name=\"Sakura2OVAa\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2OVAb\"/> Further OVA series based around the characters of ''Is Paris Burning?'' and ''So Long, My Love'' (''\u00c9cole de Paris''; ''Le Nouveau Paris''; ''Sumire''; ''New York, New York'') were released from 2003 to 2007.<ref name=\"Sakura3OVA1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3OVA2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSumire\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVova\"/> The OVAs were produced by [[Radix Ace Entertainment]] until ''New York, New York'' in 2007, when production shifted by [[Anime International Company]].<ref name=\"Sakura1OVA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2OVAa\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSumire\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVova\"/>\n\nAn [[Sakura Wars (TV series)|anime television series]] based on the first game was co-produced by Red Company, [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] and Studio Matrix. The 25-episode series was broadcast on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] from April 8 to September 23, 2000.<ref name=\"SakuraWhatsB\"/> While based on the first game's narrative and preserving Hiroi's vision, the series changed and added in several events. A major problem was remaining faithful to the source material within a TV format.<ref name=\"OjiInterviewSWanimeB\"/> In 2001, an animated theatrical film, ''[[Sakura Wars: The Movie]]'', was released. The film takes place between ''Is Paris Burning?'' and ''Fall in Love, Maidens'' and features new character Ratchet Altair who would later appear in ''So Long, My Love''.<ref name=\"SakuraVGuidebook\"/><ref name=\"ASCIIproduction\"/><ref name=\"SakuraReleaseInfo\"/> The film was animated by Production I.G; production took three years and was inspired by the wish to expand the series animation beyond what the short cutscenes and OVA projects had achieved.<ref name=\"SakuraMovieInterview\"/> A second anime television series, titled ''Sakura Wars the Animation'' and serving as a sequel to the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', is scheduled to premiere on April 3, 2020.
