The [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], acting on the night of 4 August 1789, announced, \"The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely.\"<ref>Stewart, p 107 for full text</ref> It abolished both the [[Manorialism|seigneurial]] rights of the [[Estates of the realm#Second Estate|Second Estate]] (the nobility) and the [[tithe]]s gathered by the [[Estates of the realm#First Estate|First Estate]] (the Catholic clergy).<ref>Furet, 1989</ref><ref>Markoff,</ref> The old judicial system, founded on the 13 regional [[parlement]]s, was suspended in November 1789, and finally abolished in 1790.<ref>Paul R.

On the evening of 4 August, the [[Louis-Marie, vicomte de Noailles|Viscount de Noailles]] proposed to abolish the privileges of the nobility to restore calm in French provinces.\n\nMembers of the First Estate were at first reluctant to enter into the patriotic fervour of the night but eventually the Bishops of [[Anne Louis Henri de La Fare|Nancy]] and [[Chartres]] sacrificed their titles.<ref name=lefebv/> Guy Le Guen de Kerangal, the [[Alexandre de Beauharnais|Viscount de Beauharnais]], Jean-Baptiste-Joseph de Lubersac, the [[Anne Louis Henri de La Fare|Bishop de La Fare]] proposed to suppress the [[Banalit\u00e9]]s, seigneurial jurisdictions, game-laws and ecclesiastic privileges.\n\n==Analysis by historians==\nHistorian [[Georges Lefebvre]] summarizes the night's work:\n:Without debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude \u2013 which were to be abolished without indemnification. Other proposals followed with the same success: the equality of legal punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of venality in office [the purchase of an office], conversion of the tithe into payments subject to redemption, freedom of worship, prohibition of plural holding of benefices, suppression of [[annates]] (the year's worth of income owed the Pope and the bishop upon investiture).... Privileges of provinces and towns were offered as a last sacrifice.<ref name=lefebv>{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=Georges|title=The French Revolution: Vol. 1, from Its Origins To 1793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-JDOw8v5QC&pg=PA130|year=1962|publisher=Columbia U.P|page=130}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of a few hours, France abolished game-laws, manorial courts, [[venal office]]s (especially judgeships), the purchase and sale of pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, of [[surplice]] money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions. Towns, provinces, companies, and cities also sacrificed their special privileges. A medal was struck to commemorate the day, and the Assembly declared Louis XVI the \"Restorer of French Liberty.\"<ref>J.M. Thompson, ''The French Revolution'' (1943), pp 90\u2013111</ref> Furet emphasizes that the decisions of August 1789 survived and became an integral part of the founding texts of modern France.  \n:They destroyed aristocratic society from top to bottom, along with its structure of dependencies and privileges.  For this structure they substituted the modern, autonomous individual, free to do whatever was not prohibited by law.... The Revolution thus distinguished itself quite early by its radical individualism.<ref>Furet,  ''Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution, '' p 112</ref>\n\nThis \"[[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre|Saint Bartholomew]] of abuses,\" as [[Fran\u00e7ois Mignet]] calls it, has often been the subject of hyperbole in the analyses of contemporaries and historians. The atmosphere inside the Assembly was so heady that confusion reigned in the provinces for months afterwards as to the true meaning of the laws. The real product of the night was not formalised until the Feudal Committee reported back on 5 March 1790. The Committee reintroduced the ''[[mainmorte]]'' (explicitly outlawed by the original decrees) and set a rate of redemption for real interests (those connected to the land) that was impossible for the majority of peasants to pay (30 times the annual rent).\n\nThe Russian [[anarchism|anarchist]] Prince [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote:\n:The Assembly was carried away by its enthusiasm, and in this enthusiasm nobody remarked the clause for redeeming the feudal rights and tithes, which the two nobles and the two bishops had introduced into their speeches \u2013 a clause terrible even in its vagueness, since it might mean all or nothing, and did, in fact, postpone\u2026 the abolition of feudal rights for five years \u2013 until August 1793.<ref>[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin, P]].

There were 18 decrees or articles adopted concerning the abolition of feudalism, other privileges of the nobility, and seigneurial rights.<ref>See also in the French Wikipedia: [[:fr:D\u00e9crets des 4, 6, 7, 8 et 11 ao\u00fbt 1789]]</ref>\n\n===Background===\nThe [[storming of the Bastille|fall of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 was followed by a mass uproar spreading from Paris to the countryside. Noble families were attacked and many aristocratic manors were burned. Abbeys and castles were also attacked and destroyed. The season of ''La Grande Peur'' \u2013 the [[Great Fear]] \u2013 was characterised by social hysteria and anxiety over who was going to be the next victim. In many cases, the violence was begun not by homeless people or hunger-driven peasants but by settled countrymen who took this opportunity to further their own cause.\n\nThe Great Fear opened up the vulnerability of the French government \u2013 there was a lack of authority at the very center of it. The prolonged riots and massacres led to a general anxiety that things might get out of control, and they did. It was an experience that the country had never undergone before.\n\nBy late July 1789, as the peasant revolt reports poured into Paris from every part of the country, the Assembly decided to reform the social pattern of the country in order to pacify the outraged peasants and encourage them towards peace and harmony. The discussion continued through the night of the fourth of August, and on the morning of the fifth the Assembly abolished the [[feudal system]], and eliminated many clerical and noble rights and privileges. The August decrees were finally completed a week later.\n\n===The Decrees===\nThere were nineteen decrees in all, with a revised list published on 11 August.<ref name=JHRobinson>{{Cite book |title=Readings in European History |last=Robinson |first=James Harvey |year=1906 |publisher=Ginn |location=Boston |pages=435ff. |oclc=870461 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yl4AAAAAYAAJ&dq=J.H.%20Robinson%20(1906).%20Readings%20in%20European%20History&pg=PA435#v=onepage&q=August%20Decrees&f=false |accessdate=16 January 2011 }}</ref>\n \n;Article One:The Assembly declared the feudal system abolished thereafter. Within the \"existing rights and dues, both feudal and censuel (this refers to the cens, a perpetual due similar to the payments made by English [[copyhold]]ers), all those originating in or representing real or personal serfdom shall be abolished without indemnification\".<ref name=\"JHRobinson\"/> All other dues were redeemable, but the terms and mode of redemption was to be fixed by the Assembly. Those dues that were not removed by this decree were to be collected as usual until indemnification took place.\n\n;Article Two: The exclusive right of ''fuies'' [allowing birds to graze] and [[Dovecote#Colombiers and pigeonniers in medieval France|dovecote]]s is abolished. The pigeons will be locked up during times determined by the communities. During these periods, they will be considered prey, and anyone will be allowed to kill them on their properties..\n\n;Article Three: The exclusive rights of keeping unenclosed warrens were abolished as well. Every landowner shall have the rights to destroy all kinds of game in their own land. However, public safety regulations must be maintained by them. All hunting spaces, including the royal forest, and all hunting rights were similarly abolished as well. There were provisions made for the king's hunting, however, for his personal pleasure in it. The president of the Assembly was commissioned to ask of the king the release of those people who were sent to prison or exiled for the violation of the previously existing hunting rights.\n\n;Article Four: All the Manorial Courts were suppressed, but the judges and other officials of justice were allowed to continue with their duties until further instructions from the Assembly.\n\n;Article Five: Any kind of [[tithe]]s, as well as any substitution for them were abolished. Whosoever possessed them,\u201c\u2026secular or regular congregations, by holders of benefices, members of corporations (including the Order of Malta and other religious and military orders), as well as those devoted to the maintenance of churches, those impropriated to lay persons, and those substituted for the portion congrue (this expression refers to the minimum remuneration fixed for the priests), are abolished, on condition, however, that some other method be devised to provide for the expenses of divine worship, the support of the officiating clergy, for the assistance of the poor, for repairs and rebuilding of churches and parsonages, and for the maintenance of all institutions, seminaries, schools, academies, asylums, and organizations to which the present funds are devoted\".<ref name=\"JHRobinson\"/> Until these provisions were made, the Assembly allowed the priests to collect the tithes. All the other tithes, which were not abolished under this law, were to be collected as usual.\n\n;Article Six: All sorts of ground rents were redeemable at a price the Assembly fixed. No dues were to be created in the future that were irredeemable.\n\n;Article Seven: The sale of judicial and municipal offices was abolished. Justice should be dispensed freely. However, all such magistrates were to do their duty until further instructions from the Assembly.\n\n;Article Eight: As soon as the portion congrue was increased, the fees of all parish priests and curates were abolished.\n\n;Article Nine: Fiscal privileges in the payment of taxes were abolished forever. Taxes were to be collected from all the citizens, in exactly the same manner, and plans were to be considered to set up a new method of tax collection.\n\n;Article Ten: All particular privileges given to certain provinces, district, cities, cantons and communes, financial or otherwise, were abolished because under the new rules, every part of France was equal.\n\n;Article Eleven: All citizens, no matter what class or birth he might be, were eligible for any office in civil and military service.\n\n;Article Twelve: No allowances were to be made for \u201c\u2026annates or for any other purpose to the court of Rome, the vice legation at Avignon, or to the nunciature at Lucerne\".<ref name=\"JHRobinson\"/> The clergy should apply to their bishops for financial donations and benefits, which shall be given free to any church of France.\n\n;Article Thirteen: Various ecclesiastical dues were thereby abolished by the Assembly.\n\n;Article Fourteen: The revenue limited to the clergies were restricted to the sum of three thousand livres. Any individual could not enjoy the benefits of several pensions at the same time, if the pensions that he already enjoyed was more than three thousand livres.\n\n;Article Fifteen: The King and the Assembly would together consider all the reports that were to be presented with regards to pensions, favors and salaries, and would have a right to suppress or reduce that which was undeserved.\n\n;Article Sixteen: A medal was to be struck in the memory of the important deliberations for the welfare of France, and \u201c\u2026a [[Te Deum]] shall be chanted in gratitude in all the parishes and the churches of France\".<ref name=\"JHRobinson\"/>\n\n;Article Seventeen: [[King Louis XVI]] was proclaimed the Restorer of French Liberty.\n\n;Article Eighteen: The Assembly was to present itself as a body before the king and submit this important set of decrees, and Te Deum was to be sung in the chapel of the king.\n\n;Article Nineteen: As soon as possible, the Assembly was to give grave consideration to the drawing up of the laws that would help carry out these decrees.\n\n==Impact==\nThe August Decrees were declared with the idea of calming the populace and encouraging them towards civility. However, the August Decrees revised itself over and over again during the next two years.

On the evening of 4 August, the [[Louis-Marie, vicomte de Noailles|Viscount de Noailles]] proposed to abolish the privileges of the nobility to restore calm in French provinces.\n\nMembers of the First Estate were at first reluctant to enter into the patriotic fervour of the night but eventually the Bishops of [[Anne Louis Henri de La Fare|Nancy]] and [[Chartres]] sacrificed their titles.<ref name=lefebv/> Guy Le Guen de Kerangal, the [[Alexandre de Beauharnais|Viscount de Beauharnais]], Jean-Baptiste-Joseph de Lubersac, the [[Anne Louis Henri de La Fare|Bishop de La Fare]] proposed to suppress the [[Banalit\u00e9]]s, seigneurial jurisdictions, game-laws and ecclesiastic privileges.\n\n==Analysis by historians==\nHistorian [[Georges Lefebvre]] summarizes the night's work:\n:Without debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude \u2013 which were to be abolished without indemnification. Other proposals followed with the same success: the equality of legal punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of venality in office [the purchase of an office], conversion of the tithe into payments subject to redemption, freedom of worship, prohibition of plural holding of benefices, suppression of [[annates]] (the year's worth of income owed the Pope and the bishop upon investiture).... Privileges of provinces and towns were offered as a last sacrifice.<ref name=lefebv>{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=Georges|title=The French Revolution: Vol. 1, from Its Origins To 1793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bd-JDOw8v5QC&pg=PA130|year=1962|publisher=Columbia U.P|page=130}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of a few hours, France abolished game-laws, manorial courts, [[venal office]]s (especially judgeships), the purchase and sale of pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, of [[surplice]] money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions. Towns, provinces, companies, and cities also sacrificed their special privileges. A medal was struck to commemorate the day, and the Assembly declared Louis XVI the \"Restorer of French Liberty.\"<ref>J.M. Thompson, ''The French Revolution'' (1943), pp 90\u2013111</ref> Furet emphasizes that the decisions of August 1789 survived and became an integral part of the founding texts of modern France.  \n:They destroyed aristocratic society from top to bottom, along with its structure of dependencies and privileges.  For this structure they substituted the modern, autonomous individual, free to do whatever was not prohibited by law.... The Revolution thus distinguished itself quite early by its radical individualism.<ref>Furet,  ''Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution, '' p 112</ref>\n\nThis \"[[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre|Saint Bartholomew]] of abuses,\" as [[Fran\u00e7ois Mignet]] calls it, has often been the subject of hyperbole in the analyses of contemporaries and historians. The atmosphere inside the Assembly was so heady that confusion reigned in the provinces for months afterwards as to the true meaning of the laws. The real product of the night was not formalised until the Feudal Committee reported back on 5 March 1790. The Committee reintroduced the ''[[mainmorte]]'' (explicitly outlawed by the original decrees) and set a rate of redemption for real interests (those connected to the land) that was impossible for the majority of peasants to pay (30 times the annual rent).\n\nThe Russian [[anarchism|anarchist]] Prince [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote:\n:The Assembly was carried away by its enthusiasm, and in this enthusiasm nobody remarked the clause for redeeming the feudal rights and tithes, which the two nobles and the two bishops had introduced into their speeches \u2013 a clause terrible even in its vagueness, since it might mean all or nothing, and did, in fact, postpone\u2026 the abolition of feudal rights for five years \u2013 until August 1793.<ref>[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin, P]].

There were 18 decrees or articles adopted concerning the abolition of feudalism, other privileges of the nobility, and seigneurial rights.<ref>See also in the French Wikipedia: [[:fr:D\u00e9crets des 4, 6, 7, 8 et 11 ao\u00fbt 1789]]</ref>\n\n===Background===\nThe [[storming of the Bastille|fall of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 was followed by a mass uproar spreading from Paris to the countryside. Noble families were attacked and many aristocratic manors were burned. Abbeys and castles were also attacked and destroyed. The season of ''La Grande Peur'' \u2013 the [[Great Fear]] \u2013 was characterised by social hysteria and anxiety over who was going to be the next victim. In many cases, the violence was begun not by homeless people or hunger-driven peasants but by settled countrymen who took this opportunity to further their own cause.\n\nThe Great Fear opened up the vulnerability of the French government \u2013 there was a lack of authority at the very center of it. The prolonged riots and massacres led to a general anxiety that things might get out of control, and they did. It was an experience that the country had never undergone before.\n\nBy late July 1789, as the peasant revolt reports poured into Paris from every part of the country, the Assembly decided to reform the social pattern of the country in order to pacify the outraged peasants and encourage them towards peace and harmony. The discussion continued through the night of the fourth of August, and on the morning of the fifth the Assembly abolished the [[feudal system]], and eliminated many clerical and noble rights and privileges. The August decrees were finally completed a week later.\n\n===The Decrees===\nThere were nineteen decrees in all, with a revised list published on 11 August.<ref name=JHRobinson>{{Cite book |title=Readings in European History |last=Robinson |first=James Harvey |year=1906 |publisher=Ginn |location=Boston |pages=435ff. |oclc=870461 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yl4AAAAAYAAJ&dq=J.H.%20Robinson%20(1906).%20Readings%20in%20European%20History&pg=PA435#v=onepage&q=August%20Decrees&f=false |accessdate=16 January 2011 }}</ref>\n \n;Article One:The Assembly declared the feudal system abolished thereafter. Within the \"existing rights and dues, both feudal and censuel (this refers to the cens, a perpetual due similar to the payments made by English [[copyhold]]ers), all those originating in or representing real or personal serfdom shall be abolished without indemnification\".<ref name=\"JHRobinson\"/> All other dues were redeemable, but the terms and mode of redemption was to be fixed by the Assembly. Those dues that were not removed by this decree were to be collected as usual until indemnification took place.\n\n;Article Two: The exclusive right of ''fuies'' [allowing birds to graze] and [[Dovecote#Colombiers and pigeonniers in medieval France|dovecote]]s is abolished. The pigeons will be locked up during times determined by the communities. During these periods, they will be considered prey, and anyone will be allowed to kill them on their properties..\n\n;Article Three: The exclusive rights of keeping unenclosed warrens were abolished as well. Every landowner shall have the rights to destroy all kinds of game in their own land. However, public safety regulations must be maintained by them. All hunting spaces, including the royal forest, and all hunting rights were similarly abolished as well. There were provisions made for the king's hunting, however, for his personal pleasure in it. The president of the Assembly was commissioned to ask of the king the release of those people who were sent to prison or exiled for the violation of the previously existing hunting rights.\n\n;Article Four: All the Manorial Courts were suppressed, but the judges and other officials of justice were allowed to continue with their duties until further instructions from the Assembly.\n\n;Article Five: Any kind of [[tithe]]s, as well as any substitution for them were abolished. Whosoever possessed them,\u201c\u2026secular or regular congregations, by holders of benefices, members of corporations (including the Order of Malta and other religious and military orders), as well as those devoted to the maintenance of churches, those impropriated to lay persons, and those substituted for the portion congrue (this expression refers to the minimum remuneration fixed for the priests), are abolished, on condition, however, that some other method be devised to provide for the expenses of divine worship, the support of the officiating clergy, for the assistance of the poor, for repairs and rebuilding of churches and parsonages, and for the maintenance of all institutions, seminaries, schools, academies, asylums, and organizations to which the present funds are devoted\".<ref name=\"JHRobinson\"/> Until these provisions were made, the Assembly allowed the priests to collect the tithes. All the other tithes, which were not abolished under this law, were to be collected as usual.\n\n;Article Six: All sorts of ground rents were redeemable at a price the Assembly fixed. No dues were to be created in the future that were irredeemable.\n\n;Article Seven: The sale of judicial and municipal offices was abolished. Justice should be dispensed freely. However, all such magistrates were to do their duty until further instructions from the Assembly.\n\n;Article Eight: As soon as the portion congrue was increased, the fees of all parish priests and curates were abolished.\n\n;Article Nine: Fiscal privileges in the payment of taxes were abolished forever. Taxes were to be collected from all the citizens, in exactly the same manner, and plans were to be considered to set up a new method of tax collection.\n\n;Article Ten: All particular privileges given to certain provinces, district, cities, cantons and communes, financial or otherwise, were abolished because under the new rules, every part of France was equal.\n\n;Article Eleven: All citizens, no matter what class or birth he might be, were eligible for any office in civil and military service.\n\n;Article Twelve: No allowances were to be made for \u201c\u2026annates or for any other purpose to the court of Rome, the vice legation at Avignon, or to the nunciature at Lucerne\".<ref name=\"JHRobinson\"/> The clergy should apply to their bishops for financial donations and benefits, which shall be given free to any church of France.\n\n;Article Thirteen: Various ecclesiastical dues were thereby abolished by the Assembly.\n\n;Article Fourteen: The revenue limited to the clergies were restricted to the sum of three thousand livres. Any individual could not enjoy the benefits of several pensions at the same time, if the pensions that he already enjoyed was more than three thousand livres.\n\n;Article Fifteen: The King and the Assembly would together consider all the reports that were to be presented with regards to pensions, favors and salaries, and would have a right to suppress or reduce that which was undeserved.\n\n;Article Sixteen: A medal was to be struck in the memory of the important deliberations for the welfare of France, and \u201c\u2026a [[Te Deum]] shall be chanted in gratitude in all the parishes and the churches of France\".<ref name=\"JHRobinson\"/>\n\n;Article Seventeen: [[King Louis XVI]] was proclaimed the Restorer of French Liberty.\n\n;Article Eighteen: The Assembly was to present itself as a body before the king and submit this important set of decrees, and Te Deum was to be sung in the chapel of the king.\n\n;Article Nineteen: As soon as possible, the Assembly was to give grave consideration to the drawing up of the laws that would help carry out these decrees.\n\n==Impact==\nThe August Decrees were declared with the idea of calming the populace and encouraging them towards civility. However, the August Decrees revised itself over and over again during the next two years. [[King Louis XVI]], in a letter, on the one hand expressed deep satisfaction with \u201c\u2026the noble and generous demarche of the first two orders of the state\u2026\u201d who, according to him had \u201c\u2026made great sacrifices for the general reconciliation, for their patrie and for their king\".

Scotti]] of the [[University of Arizona]]'s [[Spacewatch Project]], the asteroid was predicted to make an exceptionally close approach to [[Earth]] on 28 October 2028. Additional [[precovery]] observations of the [[asteroid]] from 1990 were quickly found that refined the orbit and it is now known the asteroid will pass the Earth on 26 October 2028, at a distance of {{convert|0.0062|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}}, about 2.4 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Earth\u2013Moon distance]].<ref name=Sormano /><ref name=neodys /><ref name=jpl-close /> During the close approach, the asteroid should peak at about [[apparent magnitude]] 8.2,<ref name=\"NEODyS2028\" /> and will be visible in [[Binoculars#Astronomical|binoculars]].<ref name=\"nasa-news\" />\n\n{{mp|1997 XF|11}} measures between 0.7 and 1.4 kilometers in diameter.<ref name=\"lcdb\" /><ref name=\"Masiero-2017\" /><ref name=\"Trilling-2016\" />\n\nThis asteroid also regularly comes near the large asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]].<ref name=neodys />\n\n=== IAU Circular ===\n\nOn 11 March 1998, using a three-month observation arc, a faulty [[International Astronomical Union]] circular and press information sheet were put out that incorrectly concluded \"that the asteroid was 'virtually certain' to pass within 80% of the distance to the Moon and stood a 'small...not entirely out of the question' possibility of hitting the Earth in 2028.\"<ref name=\"SwRI\"/> But by 23 December 1997, it should have been clear that XF11 had no reasonable possibility of an Earth impact.<ref name=\"SwRI\"/> Within hours of the announcement, independent calculations by Paul Chodas, Don Yeomans, and Karri Muinonen had calculated that the probability of Earth impact was essentially zero, and vastly less than the probability of impact from as-yet-undiscovered asteroids.<ref name=\"SwRI\"/> Chodas (1999) concurs with Marsden (1999) that there was about 1 chance in a hundred thousand that XF11 could have passed through a keyhole\u2014that is, until the 1990 precovery observations eliminated such possibilities.<ref name=\"ncar799\"/> During the October 2002 close approach, the asteroid was observed by the 70-meter [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] [[Radar astronomy|radar]] dish, further refining the orbit.<ref name=\"nasa-news\"/>\n\n{{Large near earth asteroid flybys 5LD}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"MPEC1997-Y11\">{{Cite web\n  |title=MPEC 1997-Y11 : 1997 XF11\n  |publisher=[[IAU Minor Planet Center]]\n  |date=1997-12-23\n  |url=https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/mpec/J97/J97Y11.html\n  |accessdate=2012-02-08}} (J97X11F)</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"jpldata\">{{cite web\n  |type       = 2017-01-21 last obs.\n  |title      = JPL Small-Body Database Browser: 35396 (1997 XF11)\n  |url        = https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2035396\n  |publisher  = [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]\n  |accessdate = 18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-object\">{{cite web\n  |title      = 35396 (1997 XF11)\n  |work       = [[Minor Planet Center]]\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=35396\n  |accessdate = 18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Sormano>{{cite web\n |title=Sormano Astronomical Observatory: Table of Next Closest Approaches to the Earth by Asteroids \n |publisher=Astronomical Observatory of Brera \n |author=Piero Sicoli \n |author2=Francesco Manca \n |url=http://www.brera.mi.astro.it/sormano/teca.html \n |accessdate=2008-02-04 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201202009/http://www.brera.mi.astro.it/sormano/teca.html \n |archivedate=1 December 2007 \n |url-status=live \n }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=neodys>{{cite web\n |title       = NEODyS (35396) 1997XF11 Close Approaches\n |publisher   = Department of Mathematics, University of Pisa, ITALY\n |url         = https://newton.spacedys.com/neodys/index.php?pc=1.1.8&n=1997XF11\n |accessdate  = 2008-02-04\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182605/http://newton.dm.unipi.it/neodys/index.php?pc=1.1.8&n=1997xf11\n |archivedate = 2016-03-03\n |url-status     = dead}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=jpl-close>{{cite web\n  |type=last observation: 2012-02-02; [[Observation arc|arc]]: 21.87 years\n  |title=JPL Close-Approach Data: 35396 (1997 XF11)\n  |url=https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=1997XF11;cad=1#cad\n  |accessdate=2012-02-08}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NEODyS2028\">{{cite web\n  |title=1997XF11 Ephemerides for 26 Oct 2028\n  |publisher=NEODyS (Near Earth Objects{{Snd}} Dynamic Site)\n  |url=https://newton.spacedys.com/neodys/index.php?pc=1.1.3.1&n=35396&oc=500&y0=2028&m0=10&d0=25&h0=0&mi0=0&y1=2028&m1=10&d1=28&h1=0&mi1=0&ti=1.0&tiu=hours\n  |accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SwRI\">{{cite web\n  |date=5 April 1998 |type= last update: 3 September 1998\n  |title=The Asteroid Impact Scare of Mid-March 1998\n  |publisher=Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)\n  |author=Clark R.

XF|11}}''', provisional designation {{mp|1997 XF|11}}, is a kilometer-sized [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]], [[Mars-crosser]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]].<ref name=\"MPC-object\" />\n\n== Description ==\n\nThree months after its discovery on 6 December 1997 by [[James V. Scotti]] of the [[University of Arizona]]'s [[Spacewatch Project]], the asteroid was predicted to make an exceptionally close approach to [[Earth]] on 28 October 2028. Additional [[precovery]] observations of the [[asteroid]] from 1990 were quickly found that refined the orbit and it is now known the asteroid will pass the Earth on 26 October 2028, at a distance of {{convert|0.0062|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}}, about 2.4 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Earth\u2013Moon distance]].<ref name=Sormano /><ref name=neodys /><ref name=jpl-close /> During the close approach, the asteroid should peak at about [[apparent magnitude]] 8.2,<ref name=\"NEODyS2028\" /> and will be visible in [[Binoculars#Astronomical|binoculars]].<ref name=\"nasa-news\" />\n\n{{mp|1997 XF|11}} measures between 0.7 and 1.4 kilometers in diameter.<ref name=\"lcdb\" /><ref name=\"Masiero-2017\" /><ref name=\"Trilling-2016\" />\n\nThis asteroid also regularly comes near the large asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]].<ref name=neodys />\n\n=== IAU Circular ===\n\nOn 11 March 1998, using a three-month observation arc, a faulty [[International Astronomical Union]] circular and press information sheet were put out that incorrectly concluded \"that the asteroid was 'virtually certain' to pass within 80% of the distance to the Moon and stood a 'small...not entirely out of the question' possibility of hitting the Earth in 2028.\"<ref name=\"SwRI\"/> But by 23 December 1997, it should have been clear that XF11 had no reasonable possibility of an Earth impact.<ref name=\"SwRI\"/> Within hours of the announcement, independent calculations by Paul Chodas, Don Yeomans, and Karri Muinonen had calculated that the probability of Earth impact was essentially zero, and vastly less than the probability of impact from as-yet-undiscovered asteroids.<ref name=\"SwRI\"/> Chodas (1999) concurs with Marsden (1999) that there was about 1 chance in a hundred thousand that XF11 could have passed through a keyhole\u2014that is, until the 1990 precovery observations eliminated such possibilities.<ref name=\"ncar799\"/> During the October 2002 close approach, the asteroid was observed by the 70-meter [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] [[Radar astronomy|radar]] dish, further refining the orbit.<ref name=\"nasa-news\"/>\n\n{{Large near earth asteroid flybys 5LD}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"MPEC1997-Y11\">{{Cite web\n  |title=MPEC 1997-Y11 : 1997 XF11\n  |publisher=[[IAU Minor Planet Center]]\n  |date=1997-12-23\n  |url=https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/mpec/J97/J97Y11.html\n  |accessdate=2012-02-08}} (J97X11F)</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"jpldata\">{{cite web\n  |type       = 2017-01-21 last obs.\n  |title      = JPL Small-Body Database Browser: 35396 (1997 XF11)\n  |url        = https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2035396\n  |publisher  = [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]\n  |accessdate = 18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-object\">{{cite web\n  |title      = 35396 (1997 XF11)\n  |work       = [[Minor Planet Center]]\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=35396\n  |accessdate = 18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Sormano>{{cite web\n |title=Sormano Astronomical Observatory: Table of Next Closest Approaches to the Earth by Asteroids \n |publisher=Astronomical Observatory of Brera \n |author=Piero Sicoli \n |author2=Francesco Manca \n |url=http://www.brera.mi.astro.it/sormano/teca.html \n |accessdate=2008-02-04 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201202009/http://www.brera.mi.astro.it/sormano/teca.html \n |archivedate=1 December 2007 \n |url-status=live \n }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=neodys>{{cite web\n |title       = NEODyS (35396) 1997XF11 Close Approaches\n |publisher   = Department of Mathematics, University of Pisa, ITALY\n |url         = https://newton.spacedys.com/neodys/index.php?pc=1.1.8&n=1997XF11\n |accessdate  = 2008-02-04\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182605/https://newton.spacedys.com/neodys/index.php?pc=1.1.8&n=1997xf11\n |archivedate = 2016-03-03\n |url-status     = dead}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=jpl-close>{{cite web\n  |type=last observation: 2012-02-02; [[Observation arc|arc]]: 21.87 years\n  |title=JPL Close-Approach Data: 35396 (1997 XF11)\n  |url=https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=1997XF11;cad=1#cad\n  |accessdate=2012-02-08}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NEODyS2028\">{{cite web\n  |title=1997XF11 Ephemerides for 26 Oct 2028\n  |publisher=NEODyS (Near Earth Objects{{Snd}} Dynamic Site)\n  |url=https://newton.spacedys.com/neodys/index.php?pc=1.1.3.1&n=35396&oc=500&y0=2028&m0=10&d0=25&h0=0&mi0=0&y1=2028&m1=10&d1=28&h1=0&mi1=0&ti=1.0&tiu=hours\n  |accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SwRI\">{{cite web\n  |date=5 April 1998 |type= last update: 3 September 1998\n  |title=The Asteroid Impact Scare of Mid-March 1998\n  |publisher=Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)\n  |author=Clark R.

These roads were first gravelled in 1930-31 and 1933. This made for safer driving in rainy weather, but very dusty in dry weather. Sometimes these clouds of dust were the cause of accidents on the highways. Next these roads were re-built for oiled surfaces - No. 9 to the lakes in 1956, and south of town in 1964-65....The oiled surface reduced the dust hazard, but kept breaking up under heavy loads...When potash was discovered...better surfacing was requited.

Walking plows could loosen up earth, then two horse scrapers called [[Fresno scraper|fresnos]] could grade the low places. These projects could be undertaken by pioneer settlers who wished to work to help pay homestead taxes. Two horse teams were replaced by fours horse teams and larger scrapers. Crawler tractors eventually replaced horse teams to pull larger scrapers and graders. <blockquote>No. 9 was surveyed in 1929 and graded in 1930-31. These roads were first gravelled in 1930-31 and 1933. This made for safer driving in rainy weather, but very dusty in dry weather. Sometimes these clouds of dust were the cause of accidents on the highways. Next these roads were re-built for oiled surfaces - No. 9 to the lakes in 1956, and south of town in 1964-65....The oiled surface reduced the dust hazard, but kept breaking up under heavy loads...When potash was discovered...better surfacing was requited. So the highway were once again built up to make them wider, and No. 9 got heavy-duty paving to withstand the heavy loads.

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles' directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

It's a tremendous preparation for the boardinghouse ... and the terrible walk of George Minafer when he gets his comeuppance. And without that, there wasn't any plot. It's all about some rich people fighting in their house.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\">{{cite book |first=Barbara|last=Leaming |title=Orson Welles, A Biography |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=New York City|date=1985 |isbn=978-0-618-15446-3}}</ref>{{Rp|244\u2013245}}\n\nWelles said he would not have gone to South America without the studio's guarantee that he could finish editing ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' there. \"And they absolutely betrayed me and never gave me a shot at it. You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column, \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name were not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The only credits shown onscreen are the RKO logo, \"A Mercury Production by Orson Welles\", and the film's title, shown at the beginning of the picture.

The truth is, I was just speaking to a public who knew me from [[The Mercury Theatre on the Air|the radio]] in a way they were used to hearing on our shows.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles' directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column, \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name were not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

As he speaks each technical credit, a machine is shown performing that function.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> Welles reads his own credit \u2014 \"My name is Orson Welles\" \u2014 over top of an image of a microphone which then recedes into the distance.<ref>The footage of the microphone is taken from the [[Citizen Kane trailer|trailer for ''Citizen Kane'']] in which Welles similarly narrated the key acting credits for the film.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-magnificent-ambersons/ |title=The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)  |publisher=[[Art of the Title]] |accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n\"I got a lot of hell because of that,\" Welles later said of his verbal sign-off. \"People think it's egotistic.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.
