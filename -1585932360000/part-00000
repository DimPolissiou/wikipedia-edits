As the Royal staff descend on Downton, an assassin has also arrived and attempts to kill the monarch. The family and servants are pitted against the royal entourage, including the Queen's [[lady-in-waiting]], who has fallen out with the Crawleys, especially the Dowager Countess, over an inheritance issue.\n\n[[Gareth Neame]] and Fellowes started planning a feature adaptation in 2016, shortly after the series ended. It was officially confirmed in July 2018 and filming began later that month, lasting through November. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 13 September 2019, and in the United States on 20 September 2019. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $192 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1927, about a year and a half after the TV series ended. [[Buckingham Palace]] informs Robert and Cora Crawley, the Earl and Countess of Grantham, that [[George V|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] will visit Downton Abbey during a royal tour through [[Yorkshire]]. Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, is perturbed that Maud, Lady Bagshaw, Queen Mary's lady-in-waiting, is included in the tour. Robert is Maud's cousin and closest relative, and the two families have long disputed who should inherit Maud's estate.\n\nThe [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|royal household staff]] arrive, including Mr Wilson, the Royal [[Page of the Backstairs]]; Mrs Webb, the Royal Housekeeper; Miss Lawton, the Queen's Royal Dresser; Monsieur Courbet, the Royal Chef; and Richard Ellis, the King's Royal Dresser. All but Ellis are dismissive and arrogant to the Downton servants. Upstairs, eldest Crawley daughter Lady Mary Talbot, the estate manager, constantly worries about keeping Downton afloat in a fast-changing world. Believing Mr Barrow cannot manage a royal visit, Mary asks Mr Carson, Downton's retired butler, to temporarily resume his duties. Barrow, strongly protesting, steps aside.\n\nMajor Chetwode arrives in Downton Village seeking out the Granthams' Irish son-in-law, Tom Branson. Tom assumes Chetwode is a detective assessing security for the royal visit. Prior to the royal parade starting through Downton Village, Chetwode stations himself near where the King is awaiting the Royal Artillery, unaware that Tom has grown suspicious. As Chetwode aims a pistol at King George, Tom tackles Chetwode, pinning him to the ground. The real royal detectives apprehend Chetwode, an Irish Republican sympathizer who erroneously believed Tom was an ally.\n\nThe royal entourage has completely displaced the Downton household. Meanwhile, Tom and Lucy Smith, Lady Maud's maid, form a mutual attraction. Bertie and Edith Pelham, the Marquess and Marchioness of Hexham, also arrive at Downton. The King asks Bertie to accompany the [[Edward VIII|Prince of Wales]] on a three-month African tour. The news distresses Edith, the younger Crawley daughter, who tells Bertie she is pregnant and is due just as Bertie would depart. In the garden, Tom encounters a sobbing woman, unaware she is [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary]]. He initiates a conversation which inspires the Princess to remain with her [[Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood|husband]]. Meanwhile, Anna discovers Miss Lawton is stealing small objects from Downton Abbey. She demands their return, then blackmails Lawton into [[dress fitting|altering]] an over-sized ballgown to fit Lady Edith after the wrong dress was mistakenly delivered to Downton.\n\nAnna and John Bates unite the staff into retaking control downstairs to defend Downton's honour. Barrow and Mr Ellis trick some royal household staff into returning to London. Anna slips a strong sleeping aid into Courbet's tea, and Mr Wilson is \"accidentally\" locked inside his room, allowing Mrs Patmore and Daisy to cook the dinner, and Mr Carson and the Downton footmen to wait at table. When the King praises the revised menu, Molesley impulsively blurts out that the Downton staff prepared the meal and are serving it. Robert apologises for Molesley's inappropriate outburst, but the Queen says they are accustomed to people behaving strangely around them.\n\nThat same evening, Barrow and Ellis go to [[York]]. While Ellis visits his parents, Barrow waits at a local pub. A man there invites Barrow to a hidden gay nightclub. Shortly after Barrow arrives, police raid the club. Ellis, who is secretly gay, discovers what happened and uses his royal connection to secure Barrow's release. Afterwards, the two men develop a bond, indicating they will meet again.\n\nBack at Downton, as the inheritance conflict escalates, Isobel, Lady Merton, surmises correctly that Lucy is Maud's secret illegitimate daughter, which is the reason she is Maud's heir. She tells Maud she must inform Violet. The next morning, assistant cook Daisy, who doubted if footman Andy was the right man for her, realizes she does love him and begins planning their wedding. Henry Talbot, Mary's husband, returns from abroad in time to accompany the family to [[Harewood House]] with the royal party.\n\nDuring the ball at Harewood, Princess Mary informs her parents that Tom inspired her to save her marriage, prompting the King to personally thank him. Also, the Queen has persuaded the King to release Bertie from the imminent tour. Maud tells Violet about Lucy. Violet does not approve but understands, and immediately schemes to unite the two households through Lucy and Tom when told they plan to write to one another. Mary privately queries her grandmother regarding her recent trip to [[London]]. Violet confides that medical tests reveal she may die soon, but she assures a distraught Mary that Downton's legacy is safe in her hands. Tom later seeks out Lucy on the terrace and dances with her.\n\nMr Carson and Mrs Hughes ponder Downton's future in the modern era. Carson asserts it will stand for another hundred years with the Crawley family still in residence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Downton Abbey characters}}\n{{cast list|\n* [[Hugh Bonneville]] as Robert Crawley, 7th Earl of Grantham\n* [[Laura Carmichael]] as Edith Pelham (n\u00e9e Crawley), Marchioness of Hexham\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Charles Carson\n* [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Phyllis Baxter\n* [[Brendan Coyle]] as John Bates\n* [[Michelle Dockery]] as Lady Mary Talbot (n\u00e9e Crawley)\n* [[Kevin Doyle (actor)|Kevin Doyle]] as Joseph Molesley\n* [[Michael C.

As the Royal staff descend on Downton, an assassin has also arrived and attempts to kill the monarch. The family and servants are pitted against the royal entourage, including the Queen's [[lady-in-waiting]], who has fallen out with the Crawleys, especially the Dowager Countess, over an inheritance issue.\n\n[[Gareth Neame]] and Fellowes started planning a feature adaptation in 2016, shortly after the series ended. It was officially confirmed in July 2018 and filming began later that month, lasting through November. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 13 September 2019, and in the United States on 20 September 2019. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $192 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1927, about a year and a half after the TV series ended. [[Buckingham Palace]] informs Robert and Cora Crawley, the Earl and Countess of Grantham, that [[George V|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] will visit Downton Abbey during a royal tour through [[Yorkshire]]. Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, is perturbed that Maud, Lady Bagshaw, Queen Mary's lady-in-waiting, is included in the tour. Robert is Maud's cousin and closest relative, and the two families have long disputed who should inherit Maud's estate.\n\nThe [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|royal household staff]] arrive, including Mr Wilson, the Royal [[Page of the Backstairs]]; Mrs Webb, the Royal Housekeeper; Miss Lawton, the Queen's Royal Dresser; Monsieur Courbet, the Royal Chef; and Richard Ellis, the King's Royal Dresser. All but Ellis are dismissive and arrogant to the Downton servants. Upstairs, eldest Crawley daughter Lady Mary Talbot, the estate manager, constantly worries about keeping Downton afloat in a fast-changing world. Believing Mr Barrow cannot manage a royal visit, Mary asks Mr Carson, Downton's retired butler, to temporarily resume his duties. Barrow, strongly protesting, steps aside.\n\nMajor Chetwode arrives in Downton Village seeking out the Granthams' Irish son-in-law, Tom Branson. Tom assumes Chetwode is a detective assessing security for the royal visit. Prior to the royal parade starting through Downton Village, Chetwode stations himself near where the King is awaiting the Royal Artillery, unaware that Tom has grown suspicious. As Chetwode aims a pistol at King George, Tom tackles Chetwode, pinning him to the ground. The real royal detectives apprehend Chetwode, an Irish Republican sympathizer who erroneously believed Tom was an ally.\n\nThe royal entourage has completely displaced the Downton household. Meanwhile, Tom and Lucy Smith, Lady Maud's maid, form a mutual attraction. Bertie and Edith Pelham, the Marquess and Marchioness of Hexham, also arrive at Downton. The King asks Bertie to accompany the [[Edward VIII|Prince of Wales]] on a three-month African tour. The news distresses Edith, the younger Crawley daughter, who tells Bertie she is pregnant and is due just as Bertie would depart. In the garden, Tom encounters a sobbing woman, unaware she is [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary]]. He initiates a conversation which inspires the Princess to remain with her [[Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood|husband]]. Meanwhile, Anna discovers Miss Lawton is stealing small objects from Downton Abbey. She demands their return, then blackmails Lawton into [[dress fitting|altering]] an over-sized ballgown to fit Lady Edith after the wrong dress was mistakenly delivered to Downton.\n\nAnna and John Bates unite the staff into retaking control downstairs to defend Downton's honour. Barrow and Mr Ellis trick some royal household staff into returning to London. Anna slips a strong sleeping aid into Courbet's tea, and Mr Wilson is \"accidentally\" locked inside his room, allowing Mrs Patmore and Daisy to cook the dinner, and Mr Carson and the Downton footmen to wait at table. When the King praises the revised menu, Molesley impulsively blurts out that the Downton staff prepared the meal and are serving it. Robert apologises for Molesley's inappropriate outburst, but the Queen says they are accustomed to people behaving strangely around them.\n\nThat same evening, Barrow and Ellis go to [[York]]. While Ellis visits his parents, Barrow waits at a local pub. A man there invites Barrow to a hidden gay nightclub. Shortly after Barrow arrives, police raid the club. Ellis, who is secretly gay, discovers what happened and uses his royal connection to secure Barrow's release. Afterwards, the two men develop a bond, indicating they will meet again.\n\nBack at Downton, as the inheritance conflict escalates, Isobel, Lady Merton, surmises correctly that Lucy is Maud's secret illegitimate daughter, which is the reason she is Maud's heir. She tells Maud she must inform Violet. The next morning, assistant cook Daisy, who doubted if footman Andy was the right man for her, realizes she does love him and begins planning their wedding. Henry Talbot, Mary's husband, returns from abroad in time to accompany the family to [[Harewood House]] with the royal party.\n\nDuring the ball at Harewood, Princess Mary informs her parents that Tom inspired her to save her marriage, prompting the King to personally thank him. Also, the Queen has persuaded the King to release Bertie from the imminent tour. Maud tells Violet about Lucy. Violet does not approve but understands, and immediately schemes to unite the two households through Lucy and Tom when told they plan to write to one another. Mary privately queries her grandmother regarding her recent trip to [[London]]. Violet confides that medical tests reveal she may die soon, but she assures a distraught Mary that Downton's legacy is safe in her hands. Tom later seeks out Lucy on the terrace and dances with her.\n\nMr Carson and Mrs Hughes ponder Downton's future in the modern era. Carson asserts it will stand for another hundred years with the Crawley family still in residence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Downton Abbey characters}}\n{{cast list|\n* [[Hugh Bonneville]] as Robert Crawley, 7th Earl of Grantham\n* [[Laura Carmichael]] as Edith Pelham (n\u00e9e Crawley), Marchioness of Hexham\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Charles Carson\n* [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Phyllis Baxter\n* [[Brendan Coyle]] as John Bates\n* [[Michelle Dockery]] as Lady Mary Talbot (n\u00e9e Crawley)\n* [[Kevin Doyle (actor)|Kevin Doyle]] as Joseph Molesley\n* [[Michael C.

It was conceived and directed by [[Debbie Isitt]] and stars many acclaimed British comedians, including [[Jessica Stevenson]], [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Martin Freeman]], [[Mark Heap]], [[Julia Davis]], [[Robert Webb (actor)|Robert Webb]] and [[Olivia Colman]]. It follows a bridal magazine competition for the most original wedding, the ultimate prize being a house, and the three couples who are chosen to compete. The film follows the contestants in a [[fly-on-the-wall]] documentary style, akin to ''[[The Office]]''. The script is entirely improvised.\n\n==Plot==\nThe prestigious bridal [[magazine]] ''[[Confetti]]'', owned by the arrogant, suave Antoni Clarke ([[Jimmy Carr]]) and managed by the long-suffering, uptight chief editor Vivienne ([[Felicity Montagu]]), is holding a competition to see who can hold the most original [[wedding]], with the winners being presented with a new house and a [[cover shoot]] for the magazine. Three couples and their proposals are selected to participate: Sam and Matt ([[Jessica Stevenson]] and [[Martin Freeman]]), a [[middle class]] couple of old-fashioned romantics who have elected to hold their wedding in the style of [[Busby Berkeley]] musicals of the 1930s and 1940s, despite the fact that Sam can barely hold a tune; Isabelle and Josef ([[Meredith MacNeill]] and [[Stephen Mangan]]), a pair of hyper-competitive professional [[tennis]] players holding a tennis-themed wedding; and Joanna and Michael ([[Olivia Colman]] and [[Robert Webb (actor)|Robert Webb]]), a [[naturist]] couple who intend to hold their wedding entirely [[Nudism|naked]]. All three weddings are planned using the services of Gregory and Archie ([[Vincent Franklin]] and [[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]]), wedding planners and partners in both business and love.\n\nThe film follows their planning, and the various crises that each couple faces over the three-month planning period. As well as learning to sing and dance, Sam and Matt must contend with Sam's dominating mother ([[Alison Steadman]]) and attention-seeking sister ([[Sarah Hadland]]), who appear intent on hijacking the proceedings and constantly browbeat and undermine the shy and easily  cowed Sam such as preventing her from inviting her beloved but estranged Sam's father ([[Ron Cook]]), much to Matt's growing irritation. The couple must also deal with Matt's oldest friend and [[best man]] Snoopy ([[Marc Wootton]]), a musician who nurses a bitter resentment towards Sam for coming between him and Matt that he expresses in not-so-subtle lyrics that he intends to sing at the wedding. Despite the constant support and encouragement the couple receive from Archie and Gregory, the gradual tension eventually builds to a bitter argument between Matt and Sam's mother and sister which sees him kicked out of the house where he is staying with them; this prompts Sam, however, to finally stand up for herself and put her mother and sister in place.\n\nIsabelle and Josef, meanwhile, are intensely determined to win, owing to unexplained financial difficulties. Suspicious and competitive, they become increasingly paranoid that the competition is being 'fixed' against them in favour of Matt and Sam, eventually resorting to the extreme measure of having Isabelle's nose \u2013 and her extremely large nostrils \u2013 altered by plastic surgery (with the result being that the nose she ends up with is much longer than her original one). In the process, however, they find themselves combatting their own anxieties; Josef, in particular, finds himself confronting his jealousy over Isabelle's friendship with their tennis coach, Jesus (Jes\u00fas de Miguel), and insecurity over his largely finished tennis career and that he will not be able to be a worthy husband to Isabelle. Joanna and Michael, however, find their plans challenged at every turn by Vivienne, who has no intention of putting a naked couple on the front of the magazine should they win. Michael, an experienced naturist, angrily resists Vivienne's efforts to make him dress up for the wedding, but Joanna, a recent convert and still insecure about revealing her body to strangers, finds herself of mixed minds about the issue. The pressure of the magazine and the tension between the two becomes so great that it briefly looks like the marriage will not even take place at all.\n\nThe big day finally arrives, amid much jitters and anxiety on all sides. All three weddings go off largely without a hitch, although Michael and Joanna raise eyebrows when, in defiance of Vivienne's rulings, they bare all (literally) in their wedding service.

It was conceived and directed by [[Debbie Isitt]] and stars many acclaimed British comedians, including [[Jessica Stevenson]], [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Martin Freeman]], [[Mark Heap]], [[Julia Davis]], [[Robert Webb (actor)|Robert Webb]] and [[Olivia Colman]]. It follows a bridal magazine competition for the most original wedding, the ultimate prize being a house, and the three couples who are chosen to compete. The film follows the contestants in a [[fly-on-the-wall]] documentary style, akin to ''[[The Office]]''. The script is entirely improvised.\n\n==Plot==\nThe prestigious bridal [[magazine]] ''[[Confetti]]'', owned by the arrogant, suave Antoni Clarke ([[Jimmy Carr]]) and managed by the long-suffering, uptight chief editor Vivienne ([[Felicity Montagu]]), is holding a competition to see who can hold the most original [[wedding]], with the winners being presented with a new house and a [[cover shoot]] for the magazine. Three couples and their proposals are selected to participate: Sam and Matt ([[Jessica Stevenson]] and [[Martin Freeman]]), a [[middle class]] couple of old-fashioned romantics who have elected to hold their wedding in the style of [[Busby Berkeley]] musicals of the 1930s and 1940s, despite the fact that Sam can barely hold a tune; Isabelle and Josef ([[Meredith MacNeill]] and [[Stephen Mangan]]), a pair of hyper-competitive professional [[tennis]] players holding a tennis-themed wedding; and Joanna and Michael ([[Olivia Colman]] and [[Robert Webb (actor)|Robert Webb]]), a [[naturist]] couple who intend to hold their wedding entirely [[Nudism|naked]]. All three weddings are planned using the services of Gregory and Archie ([[Vincent Franklin]] and [[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]]), wedding planners and partners in both business and love.\n\nThe film follows their planning, and the various crises that each couple faces over the three-month planning period. As well as learning to sing and dance, Sam and Matt must contend with Sam's dominating mother ([[Alison Steadman]]) and attention-seeking sister ([[Sarah Hadland]]), who appear intent on hijacking the proceedings and constantly browbeat and undermine the shy and easily  cowed Sam such as preventing her from inviting her beloved but estranged Sam's father ([[Ron Cook]]), much to Matt's growing irritation. The couple must also deal with Matt's oldest friend and [[best man]] Snoopy ([[Marc Wootton]]), a musician who nurses a bitter resentment towards Sam for coming between him and Matt that he expresses in not-so-subtle lyrics that he intends to sing at the wedding. Despite the constant support and encouragement the couple receive from Archie and Gregory, the gradual tension eventually builds to a bitter argument between Matt and Sam's mother and sister which sees him kicked out of the house where he is staying with them; this prompts Sam, however, to finally stand up for herself and put her mother and sister in place.\n\nIsabelle and Josef, meanwhile, are intensely determined to win, owing to unexplained financial difficulties. Suspicious and competitive, they become increasingly paranoid that the competition is being 'fixed' against them in favour of Matt and Sam, eventually resorting to the extreme measure of having Isabelle's nose \u2013 and her extremely large nostrils \u2013 altered by plastic surgery (with the result being that the nose she ends up with is much longer than her original one). In the process, however, they find themselves combatting their own anxieties; Josef, in particular, finds himself confronting his jealousy over Isabelle's friendship with their tennis coach, Jesus (Jes\u00fas de Miguel),, and insecurity over his largely finished tennis career and that he will not be able to be a worthy husband to Isabelle. Joanna and Michael, however, find their plans challenged at every turn by Vivienne, who has no intention of putting a naked couple on the front of the magazine should they win. Michael, an experienced naturist, angrily resists Vivienne's efforts to make him dress up for the wedding, but Joanna, a recent convert and still insecure about revealing her body to strangers, finds herself of mixed minds about the issue. The pressure of the magazine and the tension between the two becomes so great that it briefly looks like the marriage will not even take place at all.\n\nThe big day finally arrives, amid much jitters and anxiety on all sides. All three weddings go off largely without a hitch, although Michael and Joanna raise eyebrows when, in defiance of Vivienne's rulings, they bare all (literally) in their wedding service. The winners are soon decided \u2013 Matt and Sam, which prompts a display of sour grapes on part of Josef and Isabelle. The movie then briefly glimpses at the three couples a few months later, all of whom are adjusting to married life relatively happily.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jimmy Carr]] as Antoni Clarke\n* [[Felicity Montagu]] as Vivienne\n* [[Jessica Hynes]] as Sam\n* [[Martin Freeman]] as Matt\n* [[Meredith MacNeill]] as Isabelle\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Josef\n* [[Olivia Colman]] as Joanna\n* [[Robert Webb (actor)|Robert Webb]] as Michael\n* [[Vincent Franklin]] as Archie\n* [[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]] as Gregory\n* [[Marc Wootton]] as Snoopy\n* [[Alison Steadman]] as Sam's mother\n* [[Sarah Hadland]] as Sam's sister\n* [[Selina Cadell]] as Joanna's mother\n* [[Ron Cook]] as Sam's father\n* Jes\u00fas de Miguel as Tennis coach\n* [[Julia Davis]] as Marriage counselor\n* [[Mark Heap]] as Registrar\n* Kate Smallwood as Sophie\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nOne of the three couples whose story is followed opts for a naturist wedding.

The silent film, with English inter-titles, is primarily noted for its handling of the contentious issue of inter-racial relationships, using [[avant-garde]] [[experimental film]]-making techniques, and is today very much part of the curriculum of the study of modern cinematography.\n\nThe film, which features [[Paul Robeson]], [[Eslanda Goode Robeson|Eslanda Robeson]], [[Bryher (novelist)|Bryher]] and [[Hilda Doolittle|HD]], was originally believed to have been lost, but was discovered, by chance, in Switzerland in 1983. An original 16mm copy of this film is now held in the Donnell Media Center, New York City Public Library. In 2006, the British Film Institute sponsored the film's restoration by The George Eastman House and eventual DVD release with a soundtrack, composed by [[Courtney Pine]]. Its premiere at the Tate Modern gallery in London attracted 2,000 people. In 2010, the film was released with a soundtrack composed by Mallory Johns, and performed by the Southern Connecticut State University Creative Music Orchestra.\n\n==Cast==\n{|\n|-\n|[[Paul Robeson]] as Pete Marond (an African-American)\n|-\n|[[Eslanda Robeson]] as Adah (Pete's wife)\n|-\n|[[Gavin Arthur]] as Thorne<br>\n|-\n|Helga Doorn ([[Hilda Doolittle|HD]]) as Astrid (Thorn's wife)<br>\n|-\n|[[Bryher (novelist)|Bryher]] as The Manageress<br>\n|-\n|Charlotte Arthur as The Barmaid<br>\n|-\n|[[Robert Herring (poet)|Robert Herring]] as The Pianist<br>\n|-\n|Blanche Lewin as The Old Lady<br>\n|}\n\n==Storyline==\nThe film revolves around an inter-racial love triangle and its effects on the local townsfolk. The story is based in a guesthouse occupied  by a set of liberal, hedonistic young people sympathetic to the emerging black American culture. In what would have been completely frowned upon at the time, the manageress has let out a room to a black couple, Pete Marond and his wife, Adah. Adah has an affair with Thorne, a white man, much to the dismay of the prejudiced townsfolk and Thorne's wife, Astrid. Pete attempts a reconciliation with Adah, but she eventually decides to leave him and the town. Astrid confronts Thorne on the affair and attacks him with a knife. In the scuffle, Astrid is killed. The film concludes with the aftermath of Thorne's trial for murder and the townsfolk's resolution of the issue.\n\n==Cinematic Techniques==\n[[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] was particularly influenced by the [[cinematic techniques]] of [[G.W. Pabst]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein]], whom he first met in 1929. In ''Borderline'', he uses avant-garde experimental film-making techniques, blending [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]\u2019s montage innovation and [[G.W. Pabst|Pabst]]\u2019s psycho-analytical approach, to identify the emotional and psychological states of the film\u2019s characters. These techniques called for unconventional post-production editing, the use of light and shadow, and exaggerated movement on the part of the actors. \"[[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]]\u2019s brilliance lies in his ability to photograph small movements as nuanced, meaning-producing gestures\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lost+and+Found%3A+RICHARD+DEMING+ON+KENNETH+MACPHERSON'S+MONKEYS'+MOON.-a0203139479 |title=Richard Deming |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-28}}</ref>\n\n\"Taking heed from the Soviet montage school of thought, [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] incites action and reaction through a bravura demonstration of editing that wilfully distorts the viewer\u2019s grasp of his visual rhetoric. The film bemuses with its expeditious cutting rates and its excisional framing \u2013 the latter\u2019s reduction of human figures to dissected body parts powerfully accentuating the characters\u2019 physical detachment from their internal desires. Together, these core tenets invoke an overwhelming tsunami of kineticism that obliterates the audience's understanding of the film's {{sic|nolink=y|spacial}} and temporal dimensions until all that's left for us to cling to is an immediate, raw visceralism; the ultimate purification of the cinematic experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reehanmiah.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/borderline/ |title=Distant Voices \u2013 Reehan \u2013 Top 100 Films |publisher=Reehanmiah.wordpress.com |date=2010-12-26 |accessdate=2015-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\n\"Judged on its own merits, ''Borderline'' is a ground-breaking work, dealing as it does with issues of race and sexuality at a time when such subject matter was still largely taboo and had only been previously tackled cinematically through oblique inference\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6085279-close-up-look-at-kenneth-macphersons-borderline |title=AllVoices \u2013 Close up Look at Kenneth Macpherson's ''Borderline'' |publisher=Allvoices.com |accessdate=2015-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214234900/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6085279-close-up-look-at-kenneth-macphersons-borderline |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nIt would be decades before the cinematic community would once again tackle the subject matter raised in ''Borderline''. At the time of its release, ''Borderline'' was a film that confused and bewildered critics leading the London Evening Standard's Clive MacManus to advise [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] \"to spend a year in a commercial studio\" before attempting something as difficult again. Deeply upset by its hostile reception, [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] archived his film and withdrew from film directing. [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]]\u2019s work would go on to influence future film-makers such as [[Nathaniel Dorsky]] and [[Robert Beavers]].\n\n==Film and legacy details==\nFor many years, ''Borderline'' was largely inaccessible to film scholars, with rare copies in a few archives around the world. It was seldom screened in public. Many film historians of avant garde and experimental film-making, feel that it represents one of the last examples of modernism of the 1920s, when many artists had hoped that artistic experimentation and commercial viability need not be mutually exclusive.\n\nA anonymous 'libretto', 'The Borderline Pamphlet,' credited to H.D., was written to accompany  \u2013  and explain  \u2013  the film.<ref>Close up, 1927-1933: Cinema and Modernism \u2013 James Donald, Anne Friedberg, Laura Marcus [https://books.google.com/books?id=joAbufAs9ZMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Close+up,+1927-1933:+Cinema+and+Modernism+-+James+Donald,+Anne+Friedberg,+Laura+Marcus&source=bl&ots=yibQFz571X&sig=SWvO4jiSkM7X2tzL9nSsdLOS728&hl=en&ei=5JyXTbjHDoOAhQfd5tTjCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Debo, Annette (2001).

Pete attempts a reconciliation with Adah, but she eventually decides to leave him and the town. Astrid confronts Thorne on the affair and attacks him with a knife. In the scuffle, Astrid is killed. The film concludes with the aftermath of Thorne's trial for murder and the townsfolk's resolution of the issue.\n\n==Cinematic Techniques==\n[[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] was particularly influenced by the [[cinematic techniques]] of [[G.W. Pabst]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein]], whom he first met in 1929. In ''Borderline'', he uses avant-garde experimental film-making techniques, blending [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]\u2019s montage innovation and [[G.W. Pabst|Pabst]]\u2019s psycho-analytical approach, to identify the emotional and psychological states of the film\u2019s characters. These techniques called for unconventional post-production editing, the use of light and shadow, and exaggerated movement on the part of the actors. \"[[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]]\u2019s brilliance lies in his ability to photograph small movements as nuanced, meaning-producing gestures\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lost+and+Found%3A+RICHARD+DEMING+ON+KENNETH+MACPHERSON'S+MONKEYS'+MOON.-a0203139479 |title=Richard Deming |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-28}}</ref>\n\n\"Taking heed from the Soviet montage school of thought, [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] incites action and reaction through a bravura demonstration of editing that wilfully distorts the viewer\u2019s grasp of his visual rhetoric. The film bemuses with its expeditious cutting rates and its excisional framing \u2013 the latter\u2019s reduction of human figures to dissected body parts powerfully accentuating the characters\u2019 physical detachment from their internal desires. Together, these core tenets invoke an overwhelming tsunami of kineticism that obliterates the audience's understanding of the film's {{sic|nolink=y|spacial}} and temporal dimensions until all that's left for us to cling to is an immediate, raw visceralism; the ultimate purification of the cinematic experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reehanmiah.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/borderline/ |title=Distant Voices \u2013 Reehan \u2013 Top 100 Films |publisher=Reehanmiah.wordpress.com |date=2010-12-26 |accessdate=2015-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\n\"Judged on its own merits, ''Borderline'' is a ground-breaking work, dealing as it does with issues of race and sexuality at a time when such subject matter was still largely taboo and had only been previously tackled cinematically through oblique inference\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6085279-close-up-look-at-kenneth-macphersons-borderline |title=AllVoices \u2013 Close up Look at Kenneth Macpherson's ''Borderline'' |publisher=Allvoices.com |accessdate=2015-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214234900/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6085279-close-up-look-at-kenneth-macphersons-borderline |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nIt would be decades before the cinematic community would once again tackle the subject matter raised in ''Borderline''. At the time of its release, ''Borderline'' was a film that confused and bewildered critics leading the London Evening Standard's Clive MacManus to advise [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] \"to spend a year in a commercial studio\" before attempting something as difficult again. Deeply upset by its hostile reception, [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]] archived his film and withdrew from film directing. [[Kenneth Macpherson|Macpherson]]\u2019s work would go on to influence future film-makers such as [[Nathaniel Dorsky]] and [[Robert Beavers]].\n\n==Film and legacy details==\nFor many years, ''Borderline'' was largely inaccessible to film scholars, with rare copies in a few archives around the world. It was seldom screened in public. Many film historians of avant garde and experimental film-making, feel that it represents one of the last examples of modernism of the 1920s, when many artists had hoped that artistic experimentation and commercial viability need not be mutually exclusive.\n\nA anonymous 'libretto', 'The Borderline Pamphlet,' credited to H.D., was written to accompany  \u2013  and explain  \u2013  the film.<ref>Close up, 1927-1933: Cinema and Modernism \u2013 James Donald, Anne Friedberg, Laura Marcus [https://books.google.com/books?id=joAbufAs9ZMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Close+up,+1927-1933:+Cinema+and+Modernism+-+James+Donald,+Anne+Friedberg,+Laura+Marcus&source=bl&ots=yibQFz571X&sig=SWvO4jiSkM7X2tzL9nSsdLOS728&hl=en&ei=5JyXTbjHDoOAhQfd5tTjCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Debo, Annette (2001).

It is a voluntary youth group which is part of the [[Royal Air Force Air Cadets]]. The ATC is largely composed of individual units known as [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]]. These squadrons are organised into several different ''Wings'', which in turn are organised into six different ''Regions''. Together the ''Regions'' make up the ''Corps''.\n\nHeadquarters Air Cadets (HQAC) is located at [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell]], [[Lincolnshire]] and headed by [[Commandant Air Cadets]] Air Commodore [[Dawn McCafferty]].\n\n{{TOC right|limit=2}}\n\n== Founder Squadrons and Detached Flights ==\nThe first 50 squadrons formed have their squadron numbers followed by an F to show they are \"founder\" squadrons (e.g. No 45F(Worthing) Squadron). Only 30 are still in existence, as the other 20 have disbanded over time. Founder Squadrons that have reformed after being disbanded do not retain the F status.\n\nIn towns not large enough to sustain a squadron of 30 cadets, or as a supplement to an existing squadron in a larger town or city, a Detached Flight may be formed. This operates much like any other unit, but is technically a component part of a nearby larger squadron. There are currently approximately 48 Detached Flights, denoted by the letters \"DF\" after a squadron number. \n<!--\n* \n* NOTES TO EDITORS:\n* When adding squadrons to the list, please keep the lists sorted in numerical order!\n* Please do not add links to squadron websites.\n* \n-->\n\n== Central & East Region ==\n;Region HQ [[RAF Wyton]]\n\n=== Bedfordshire & Cambridgeshire Wing ===\n\n;Wing HQ RAF Wyton\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* 10F ([[Luton]])\n* 22 ([[Sandy, Bedfordshire|Sandy]])\n* 51 ([[Orton, Peterborough|Orton]])\n* 73 ([[Huntingdon]])\n* 104 (City of [[Cambridge]])\n* 105 ([[Cambourne]])\n* 115 ([[Peterborough]])\n* 134 ([[Bedford]])\n* 207 ([[Cranfield]])\n* 272 ([[Wisbech]])\n* 460 ([[Dunstable]])\n* 511 ([[Ramsey, Cambridgeshire|Ramsey]])\n* 1003 ([[Leighton Buzzard]])\n* 1094 ([[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]])\n* 1220 ([[March, Cambridgeshire|March]])\n* 1406 ([[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]])\n* 1451 ([[Haverhill, Suffolk|Haverhill]])\n* 1985 ([[Flitwick]])\n* 2065 ([[Biggleswade]])\n* 2331 ([[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]])\n* 2417 ([[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]])\n* 2430 ([[Holbeach]])\n* 2461 ([[Sawston]])\n* 2462 ([[Oakley, Bedfordshire|Oakley]])\n* 2465 ([[Luton]] [[Icknield High School|Icknield]])\n* 2482 ([[Henlow]])\n* 2484 ([[Bassingbourn Barracks|Bassingbourn]])\n* 2500 ([[St Neots]])\n* 2523 ([[Linton, Cambridgeshire|Linton]])\n* 2524 ([[Oakington]])\n}}\n\n=== Hertfordshire & Buckinghamshire Wing ===\n;Wing HQ [[RAF Halton]]\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* 2F ([[Watford]])\n* 57 ([[Potters Bar]])\n* 220 ([[St Albans]])\n* 248 ([[Letchworth]])\n* 332 ([[High Wycombe]])\n* 606 ([[Beaconsfield]])\n* 795 ([[Harpenden]])\n* 871 ([[Penn, Buckinghamshire|Penn]])\n* 936 ([[Hertford]] & [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]])\n* 955 ([[Stevenage]])\n* 1066 ([[Hitchin]])\n* 1113 ([[Berkhamsted]])\n* 1166 ([[Welwyn Garden City]])\n* 1187 ([[Hemel Hempstead]])\n* 1239 ([[Broxbourne]] & [[Hoddesdon]])\n* 1365 ([[Aylesbury]])\n* 1372 ([[Elstree]] & [[Borehamwood]])\n* 1563 ([[Buckingham]])\n* 1811 ([[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]])\n* 1875 ([[Towcester]])\n* 2203 ([[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] & [[de Havilland]])\n* 2204 ([[Chesham & Amersham]])\n* 2313 ([[Rickmansworth]] and [[Chalfont St Peter|Chalfont]])\n* 2366 ([[Bletchley Park]])\n* 2370 ([[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]])\n* 2384 ([[Bushey]] & [[Oxhey]])\n* 2409 ([[Halton, Buckinghamshire|Halton]])\n* 2457 ([[Tring]])\n* 2532 ([[Milton Keynes]])\n}}\n\n=== Norfolk & Suffolk Wing ===\n;Wing HQ Norwich\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* 2 Overseas ([[Gibraltar]])\n* 42F ([[Kings Lynn]])\n* 188 ([[Ipswich]])\n* 221 ([[Great Yarmouth]])\n* 222 ([[Broadland High School|Broadlands]])\n* 231 ([[Norwich]])\n* 301 ([[Bury St Edmunds]])\n*:301DF ([[Culford School]])\n* 356 ([[Felixstowe]])\n* 432 ([[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]])\n* 469 ([[Lowestoft]])\n* 759 ([[Beccles]])\n* 863 ([[Thurston, Suffolk|Thurston]])\n* 864 ([[Watton, Norfolk|Watton]])\n*:864DF ([[Marham]]) -

It is a voluntary youth group which is part of the [[Royal Air Force Air Cadets]]. The ATC is largely composed of individual units known as [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]]. These squadrons are organised into several different ''Wings'', which in turn are organised into six different ''Regions''. Together the ''Regions'' make up the ''Corps''.\n\nHeadquarters Air Cadets (HQAC) is located at [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell]], [[Lincolnshire]] and headed by [[Commandant Air Cadets]] Air Commodore [[Dawn McCafferty]].\n\n{{TOC right|limit=2}}\n\n== Founder Squadrons and Detached Flights ==\nThe first 50 squadrons formed have their squadron numbers followed by an F to show they are \"founder\" squadrons (e.g. No 45F(Worthing) Squadron). Only 30 are still in existence, as the other 20 have disbanded over time. Founder Squadrons that have reformed after being disbanded do not retain the F status.\n\nIn towns not large enough to sustain a squadron of 30 cadets, or as a supplement to an existing squadron in a larger town or city, a Detached Flight may be formed. This operates much like any other unit, but is technically a component part of a nearby larger squadron. There are currently approximately 48 Detached Flights, denoted by the letters \"DF\" after a squadron number. \n<!--\n* \n* NOTES TO EDITORS:\n* When adding squadrons to the list, please keep the lists sorted in numerical order!\n* Please do not add links to squadron websites.\n* \n-->\n\n== Central & East Region ==\n;Region HQ [[RAF Wyton]]\n\n=== Bedfordshire & Cambridgeshire Wing ===\n\n;Wing HQ RAF Wyton\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* 10F ([[Luton]])\n* 22 ([[Sandy, Bedfordshire|Sandy]])\n* 51 ([[Orton, Peterborough|Orton]])\n* 73 ([[Huntingdon]])\n* 104 (City of [[Cambridge]])\n* 105 ([[Cambourne]])\n* 115 ([[Peterborough]])\n* 134 ([[Bedford]])\n* 207 ([[Cranfield]])\n* 272 ([[Wisbech]])\n* 460 ([[Dunstable]])\n* 511 ([[Ramsey, Cambridgeshire|Ramsey]])\n* 1003 ([[Leighton Buzzard]])\n* 1094 ([[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]])\n* 1220 ([[March, Cambridgeshire|March]])\n* 1406 ([[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]])\n* 1451 ([[Haverhill, Suffolk|Haverhill]])\n* 1985 ([[Flitwick]])\n* 2065 ([[Biggleswade]])\n* 2331 ([[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]])\n* 2417 ([[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]])\n* 2430 ([[Holbeach]])\n* 2461 ([[Sawston]])\n* 2462 ([[Oakley, Bedfordshire|Oakley]])\n* 2465 ([[Luton]] [[Icknield High School|Icknield]])\n* 2482 ([[Henlow]])\n* 2484 ([[Bassingbourn Barracks|Bassingbourn]])\n* 2500 ([[St Neots]])\n* 2523 ([[Linton, Cambridgeshire|Linton]])\n* 2524 ([[Oakington]])\n}}\n\n=== Hertfordshire & Buckinghamshire Wing ===\n;Wing HQ [[RAF Halton]]\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* 2F ([[Watford]])\n* 57 ([[Potters Bar]])\n* 220 ([[St Albans]])\n* 248 ([[Letchworth]])\n* 332 ([[High Wycombe]])\n* 606 ([[Beaconsfield]])\n* 795 ([[Harpenden]])\n* 871 ([[Penn, Buckinghamshire|Penn]])\n* 936 ([[Hertford]] & [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]])\n* 955 ([[Stevenage]])\n* 1066 ([[Hitchin]])\n* 1113 ([[Berkhamsted]])\n* 1166 ([[Welwyn Garden City]])\n* 1187 ([[Hemel Hempstead]])\n* 1239 ([[Broxbourne]] & [[Hoddesdon]])\n* 1365 ([[Aylesbury]])\n* 1372 ([[Elstree]] & [[Borehamwood]])\n* 1563 ([[Buckingham]])\n* 1811 ([[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]])\n* 1875 ([[Towcester]])\n* 2203 ([[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] & [[de Havilland]])\n* 2204 ([[Chesham & Amersham]])\n* 2313 ([[Rickmansworth]] and [[Chalfont St Peter|Chalfont]])\n* 2366 ([[Bletchley Park]])\n* 2370 ([[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]])\n* 2384 ([[Bushey]] & [[Oxhey]])\n* 2409 ([[Halton, Buckinghamshire|Halton]])\n* 2457 ([[Tring]])\n* 2532 ([[Milton Keynes]])\n}}\n\n=== Norfolk & Suffolk Wing ===\n;Wing HQ Norwich\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* 2 Overseas ([[Gibraltar]])\n* 42F ([[Kings Lynn]])\n* 188 ([[Ipswich]])\n* 221 ([[Great Yarmouth]])\n* 222 ([[Broadland High School|Broadlands]])\n* 231 ([[Norwich]])\n* 301 ([[Bury St Edmunds]])\n*:301DF ([[Culford School]])\n* 356 ([[Felixstowe]])\n* 432 ([[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]])\n* 469 ([[Lowestoft]])\n* 759 ([[Beccles]])\n* 863 ([[Thurston, Suffolk|Thurston]])\n* 864 ([[Watton, Norfolk|Watton]])\n*:864DF ([[Marham]]) -
