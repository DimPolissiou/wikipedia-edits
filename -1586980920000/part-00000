{"title_page": "Promotional recording", "text_new": "{{short description|Audio or video recording distributed for free, for promotional purposes}}\n{{Distinguish|Single (music)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}\nA '''promotional recording''', or '''promo''', or '''plug copy''', is an audio or video recording distributed free, usually in order to promote a recording that is or soon will be commercially available. Promos are normally sent directly to broadcasters, such as [[music radio]] and [[music television|television]] stations, and to tastemakers, such as DJs and [[music journalism|music journalists]], in advance of the release of commercial editions, in the hope that airplay, reviews, and other forms of exposure will result and stimulate the public's interest in the commercial release.\n\nPromos are often distributed in plain packaging, without the text or artwork that appears on the commercial version. Typically a promo is marked with some variation of the following text: \"Licensed for promotional use only. Sale is prohibited.\" It may also state that the promo is still the property of the distributor and is to be \"returned upon demand.\" However, it is not illegal to sell promotional recordings,<ref>...at least not in the U.S., where the ''UMG v.

Note the text saying \"PROMOTIONAL NOT FOR SALE\"]] -->\nA ''promotional single'' is a single that is made available to [[radio station]]s, [[nightclub]]s, music publications, and other media outlets by a [[record label]] to promote a commercial [[single (music)|single]] or [[album]]. A song may be released as a promotional single even if no commercial version of the single is available to buy. While intended specifically for use by professional [[disc jockey]]s and not for resale, they are frequently sought out by music collectors nonetheless.\n\nThe promo single is usually recognized by its limited liner notes and cover artwork as well as its unique catalog number (or the occasional lack thereof). Quite often, [[vinyl record]]s will be issued in a generic cardboard jacket or white paper sleeve while [[Compact disc|CDs]] will be issued in a slimline [[jewel case]] or cardboard sleeve.\n\nThere may also be promotion-specific terms stamped on the disc or its cover, most notably \"For Promotional Use Only\" and \"Not For Resale\".\n\nThe ''advance promo single'' is furnished to DJs sometimes weeks or months in advance of a domestic release to give record labels an opportunity to build interest in the single and gauge response to the single. Unlike a finished promo single, these are commonly test pressings or [[white label]]s and thus are manufactured in limited runs. Traditionally, these promotional copies were supplied to DJs through [[music pool]]s. Despite the good intention, there has been some dispute within the industry whether an advanced promotion is a good thing or not. Building interest is naturally a good thing, but it may have the opposite effect when interested persons are unable to find a new song in the record stores for quite some time.\n\n== Promo Only Chart Radio #1== \n# [[Lloyd Banks]] feat.

The song(s) are released in order to bring attention to an album's release.  Buzz singles are not typically issued to radio as promotional singles, due to the fact that they are only intended to attract minor attention compared to a regular single.\n\n== Acetates and test pressings ==\nOn rare occasions a special type of demonstration record known as an [[acetate disc]] has been distributed to radio stations as a promo. Instead of being mass-produced these records are cut one at a time in the recording studio from a master tape source.  They were generally made in very low quantity with hand-written labels. The soft acetate surface of these discs can be played no more than about 10 times before they start to wear out.\n\nAnother type of rare item which has occasionally been used as a promo is a \"test pressing\" or [[white label]].  These are the first disc copies pressed at the factory. They are used to check manufacturing quality before mass production begins.\n\n== Countdown to album release programs ==\n[[iTunes]] and other markets distribute songs for a price on a pre-set schedule; such as one a week in a 'Countdown' to the parent album's release. These pre-sales of album tracks are often called 'promotional singles' by many.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/b/2010/11/17/black-eyed-peas-release-do-it-like-this-announce-single-a-week-until-the-beginning.htm|title=Black Eyed Peas Release \"Do It Like This\" - Announce Single a Week Until The Beginning|author=|first=Bill|last=Lamb|date=17 November 2010|accessdate=2 April 2011|work=[[About.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/blog/2010/11/30/black-eyed-peas-the-beginning-new-album/|title=Black Eyed Peas, 'The Beginning' -- New Album|author=AOL Music Staff|date=2010-11-30|accessdate=2 April 2011|work=[[AOL Music]]|publisher=[[AOL|AOL inc.]]}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution ==\n=== Radio outlets ===\nPromotional recordings are distributed to commercial [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio stations for airplay. These singles typically feature just the [[radio edit]] of the song, but may also include alternate remix edits, the original album version, or even call-out hooks\n\n=== Nightclub outlets ===\nWhen it comes to [[electronic dance music]], 12-inch records and CDs still remain the more popular media by which promotional recordings may be distributed to DJs in the nightclub industry.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} These singles typically feature one or more extended remixes (sometimes dubbed a \"club mix\") of the title track that are not generally available to the public as well as the original extended version, which in many cases is itself club-friendly. In some cases, the disc may have anonymous track labeling or lack labels altogether. Often the corresponding CD may also carry radio edits and other alternate cuts that did not make it onto the 12-inch record itself, in which case the CD is referred to as a [[maxi-single]] CD. Promotional recordings may also include digital recordings in [[MP3]], [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]], or [[Windows Media Audio]] formats to discourage illegal copying and enable effective recall when the promotional period has expired.\n\nIt is not unusual for a promo single to have no commercially available counterpart particularly in those genres that are predominantly oriented to nightclub applications.\n\n=== Promotional compilations ===\nMany companies currently offer promotional compilations to DJs, radio use and nightclubs alike. The format is growing on the CD format, but some companies still offer promotional compilations in vinyl also.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Most of the compilations are genre-specific (like most of CD Pools' compilations) but there are also compilations that offer a combination of different genres (like compilations from DMC and Music Factory). Such compilations are normally released monthly. In addition to companies that work internationally, there are also many companies that offer national promotions material in the form of compilations.\n\nVersions in the compilation are usually either radio edits or extended / 12\" remixes of the song, depending a bit on the targeted audience. Club scene music is usually in the longer and easier to play format of extended remix, whereas more street targeted music is usually released as radio edits. It normally takes a couple of weeks after the release of the original promo single to be available on promotional compilations. This has the added benefit of having the songs when they're already had some airtime and are thus not the bleeding edge no-one has heard from, but still have usually not been released to the mass markets yet.\n\nSome of the internationally established companies are [[CD Pool]] and [[Disco Mix Club|DMC]]. Many fledgling companies are also available offering both well-known and lesser known releases.\n\n=== Online promotional distribution ===\nSince the advent of broad-bandwidth Internet access and professional tools such as iPool or Haulix, the online promotional distribution of music has been established. Record companies make their music available as audio files and use the Internet as a distribution channel. In contrast to the conventional way of distributing promotional recordings, this kind of promotional distribution is faster and cheaper.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Music industry}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Music industry]]\n[[Category:Single types]]\n[[Category:Promotion and marketing communications]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Audio or video recording distributed for free, for promotional purposes}}\n{{Distinguish|Single (music)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}\nA '''promotional recording''', or '''promo''', or '''plug copy''', is an audio or video recording distributed free, usually in order to promote a recording that is or soon will be commercially available.

The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Comayagua|The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua]] was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. Another attraction is the Plaza de San Francisco, which has a park, the colonial church and is located a few meters from the main square. The houses of the city still preserve their original Spanish colonial architecture from the XVIII century, many of them have been turned into museums. The most important examples are the museum of colonial religious art, the archeological museum that contains relics of the [[Lenca]] people of the prehispanic era, and the republican museum. Another square in the old town is the Plaza de la Merced, it is known for having a monument known as the obelisk and in front of it is the Iglesia de la Merced. Which was the first cathedral of the city before the current one was completed in 1711. Another atraction is the Caxa real, a colonial house that was built between 1739 and 1741 and developed by the architect Bartolom\u00e9 de Maradiaga as a center where the tributes for the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]] were stored, within it Gold, silver and plaster extracted from the mines of Honduras were processed, to later be shipped to Europe. On the ground floor of the building, introduce some elements that were not in common use in Central American architecture; It makes a very good difference between the purely official area, the Courtroom, the Accounting Office, the Treasury, the Azogues room, the piece of fifth silver; This sector was entered through a large hall called by the men on horseback and which were on the street that the Chiquito River rises to the Plaza Mayor. In 1774, an earthquake that caused serious damage to the structure, however, was repaired within a few months, although the house was weaker. In 1809 another earthquake damaged the building. It was rebuilt in 2013 and is currently an events center that has hosted important international political figures, such as [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Queen Leticia of Spain]], and the former President of Mexico on his visit to Honduras. \n\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n==Soto Cano Air Base==\n{{Main|Soto Cano Air Base}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Soto Cano.jpg|thumb|Soto Cano Air Base is home to apx. 550 US military personnel and more than 650 US and Honduran civilians.]] -->\n[[Soto Cano Air Base]] (formerly Palmerola Air Base) is a Honduran military installation located less than {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} from Comayagua.

To the west Comayagua limits with the municipalities of Ajuterique, Lejaman\u00ed and the [[department of La Paz]]. \n\n\n<br />\n==Places of note==\n[[File:Iglesia de la merced de Comayagua.jpg|left|thumb|Iglesia de la merced in 2018]][[File:PlazaCentralComayagua.jpg|left|thumb|218x218px|Comayagua's Central Plaza.]]Right in front of the plaza is located City Hall, which has been reconstructed a couple of times. The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Comayagua|The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua]] was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. Another attraction is the Plaza de San Francisco, which has a park, the colonial church and is located a few meters from the main square. The houses of the city still preserve their original Spanish colonial architecture from the XVIII century, many of them have been turned into museums. The most important examples are the museum of colonial religious art, the archeological museum that contains relics of the [[Lenca]] people of the prehispanic era, and the republican museum. Another square in the old town is the Plaza de la Merced, it is known for having a monument known as the obelisk and in front of it is the Iglesia de la Merced. Which was the first cathedral of the city before the current one was completed in 1711. Another atraction is the Caxa real, a colonial house that was built between 1739 and 1741 and developed by the architect Bartolom\u00e9 de Maradiaga as a center where the tributes for the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]] were stored, within it Gold, silver and plaster extracted from the mines of Honduras were processed, to later be shipped to Europe. On the ground floor of the building, introduce some elements that were not in common use in Central American architecture; It makes a very good difference between the purely official area, the Courtroom, the Accounting Office, the Treasury, the Azogues room, the piece of fifth silver; This sector was entered through a large hall called by the men on horseback and which were on the street that the Chiquito River rises to the Plaza Mayor. In 1774, an earthquake that caused serious damage to the structure, however, was repaired within a few months, although the house was weaker. In 1809 another earthquake damaged the building. It was rebuilt in 2013 and is currently an events center that has hosted important international political figures, such as [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Queen Leticia of Spain]], and the former President of Mexico on his visit to Honduras. \n\n<br />\n<br />\n==Soto Cano Air Base==\n{{Main|Soto Cano Air Base}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Soto Cano.jpg|thumb|Soto Cano Air Base is home to apx. 550 US military personnel and more than 650 US and Honduran civilians.]] -->\n[[Soto Cano Air Base]] (formerly Palmerola Air Base) is a Honduran military installation located less than {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} from Comayagua.

The club obtained its first promotion to the National League in 2004\u20132005. Nevertheless, after only their first season in the soccer league; they were relegated to second division once again. For this reason the board of directors, bought the first division franchise from Club Municipal-Valencia of Choluteca.  The Club plays its home games at the municipal stadium 'Carlos Miranda' which currently holds about 10,000 spectators.\n\nComayagua was host to the first International Fellowship of Christian Athletes Motocross camp in September 2012. 60 men and women participated in the camp which was instructed by professional riders from the United States, Jimmy Povolny, Shawn Clark and Ryan Meyung among others.

''FreeCol'' is [[free and open source software]] released under the [[GNU General Public License]] v2.\n\n''FreeCol'' is mostly programmed in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and should thus be [[Cross-platform|platform-independent]]. In practice, it is known to run on [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], as well as [[Mac OS X]] (with some limitations).\n\nWhile remaining faithful to the original in terms of mechanics and gameplay, ''FreeCol'' sports a new set of redesigned graphics. Moreover, in addition to the classical ''Colonization'' rules, it features an additional ruleset that incorporates ideas that didn't make it to the final version of Meier's game, requests by fans and original concepts like new European players with new national bonuses.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Freecol 095 03.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of the unit selection screen.]]\nIn ''FreeCol'' the player leads the colony of a European power from the arrival on the shore of the [[New World]] into the future, achieving victory by one of two possible victory conditions: either gaining independence by declaring [[independence]] and subsequently defeating the dispatched royal expeditionary force or by defeating the colonies of all the competing European powers by the year 1600. To be allowed to declare independence, at least 50% of the player's colonists must support independence. This is achieved by producing liberty bells; 200 liberty bells turn one colonist from being a royalist into being a rebel. To be able to defeat the royal expeditionary force the player must train and build a strong enough army of their own.\n\nAnother important factor are the numerous settlements of different [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] nations. Native settlements can be traded with to gain gold or they can be conquered for treasure. Native settlements can also teach the player's colonists and turn them into specialist. Specialists are considerably more productive when assigned in their trade. Most specialists can be trained for gold in Europe or come as settlers for free, but certain specialists can only be trained at certain native settlements.\n\n''FreeCol'' starts in 1492 with two [[settler|colonists]] on a caravel on the ocean at the player's disposal. The player is the king's proxy and is supposed to lead the caravel to the shore and found a colony in the [[New World]] consisting of multiple settlements. The player gets additional colonists by producing food (200 food units in a settlement generates a new unit), by immigration from Europe, by converting the natives or by capturing unarmed units of competing European colonies.\n\nThe player may trade with Europe using various natural resources which are produced in [[Human settlement|settlements]] or acquired from trade with [[Indigenous peoples|natives]]. In each settlement the player can also build up industrial buildings to convert raw materials into processed goods, which sell for more in Europe, providing a significant economic advance.\n\n== Reception ==\nIn February 2007 FreeCol was [[SourceForge]]'s Project of the Month.<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/potm/potm-2007-02.php SourceForge.net: Project of the Month]</ref> In 2008 [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'s game journalist Alec Meer had mixed feelings about FreeCol but still called it: \"it's an (sic) remarkable accomplishment, and I'm very glad it's out there.\" and \"FreeCol, though, is here right now, it's free, it's stable, it's pretty much feature-complete and unlike its parent it has multiplayer\".<ref>[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/06/12/get-ur-freecol/ Get Ur FreeCol] by Alec Meer on [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] (June 12, 2008)</ref> In 2010 Alec Meer named FreeCol in [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] as a better alternative when he was confronted with the later commercial remake ''[[Civilization IV: Colonization]]''.<ref>[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/03/01/a-brief-history-of-modern-retro/ A Brief History Of Modern Retro] by Alec Meer on [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] \"You may be better off with the open source fan remake, FreeCol.\" (March 01, 2010)</ref>\n\nFreeCol became a popular [[freeware]] title, which was for instance downloaded over 1,900,000 times on [[SourceForge]] alone, between January 2002 and April 2017.<ref>[https://sourceforge.net/projects/freecol/files/stats/timeline?dates=2000-04-16+to+2017-04-22 dates=2000-04-16+to+2017-04-22 download stats] on [[Sourceforge.net]]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software|Video games}}\n* [[List of open source games]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|FreeCol}}\n*[http://www.freecol.org/ Official website]\n*[[translatewiki:FreeCol|FreeCol]] on [[translatewiki.net]]\n*[[wikia:civilization:FreeCol|FreeCol]] on the [[wikia:civilization|Civilization]] [[Wikia]]\n*{{openhub|freecol}}\n\n{{Civilization}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freecol}}\n[[Category:2003 video games]]\n[[Category:Age of Discovery video games]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in Java (programming language)]]\n[[Category:Open-source strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Java platform games]]\n[[Category:Turn-based strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Video game clones]]\n[[Category:Video games with isometric graphics]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox software\n| name                   = \n| title                  = \n| logo                   = File:Freecol Ship.png\n| logo caption           = Challenge the New World...\n| logo size              = \n| logo alt               = \n| screenshot             = FreeCol0 5 2 mapboard.jpg\n| caption                = Screenshot from FreeCol 0.5.2\n| screenshot size        = \n| screenshot alt         = \n| collapsible            = \n| author                 = The Freecol Team\n| developer              = [[SourceForge]] project [http://sourceforge.net/projects/freecol FreeCol]\n| released               = {{Start date and age|2003|01|02}}\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = 0.11.6\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2015|10|17}}\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| status                 = \n| programming language   = [[Java (programming language)|Java]]\n| operating system       = \n| platform               = [[Java (software platform)|Java platform]] 1.8 or later, display 1024&times;768 or more\n| size                   = \n| language               = af ang ar arz be bg br bs ca cs-CZ da de el en-GB eo es et eu fa fi fr gl grc he hsb hu ia id it-IT ja km ko lt mk ms nb nds nl nl-BE nn oc pl-PL pms pt-BR pt-PT qqq ru sq sv ta tl tr uk zh-CN\n| language count         = 54\n| language footnote      = &nbsp;([[translatewiki:FreeCol|translatewiki.net]])\n| genre                  = [[Turn-based strategy|Turn-based]] [[:Category:Open-source strategy video games|strategy video games]]\n| license                = [[GNU General Public License#Version 2|GPLv2]]\n| website                = {{URL|http://www.freecol.org/}}\n}}\n'''''FreeCol''''' is a [[4X video game]], a [[Video game clone|clone]] of ''[[Sid Meier's Colonization]]''.
