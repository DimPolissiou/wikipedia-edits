On March 15, 1942, [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] personnel engaged in censorship activities moved from the War Department and Navy Department to the Office of Censorship. There they monitored the 350,000 overseas cables and telegrams and 25,000 international telephone calls each week.

The voluntary nature of censorship relieved many broadcasters, which had expected that war would cause the government to seize all stations and draft their employees into the army. Such authority existed; [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Francis Biddle]] issued an opinion to Price in early 1942 that gave him almost unlimited authority over broadcasting. As an experienced journalist who disliked having to act as censor, he feared that a nationwide takeover of radio would result in a permanent government monopoly. Price believed that voluntary cooperation must be tried first with mandatory censorship only if necessary, and persuaded other government officials and the military to agree.<ref name=\":02\" />{{rp|200}}{{rp|7\u201315}}\n\n=== End of the agency ===\nAs the military situation improved, plans for adjustment and eventual cessation of censorship were devised.

While the majority of reporters supported voluntarily censoring themselves over such travel, Roosevelt also used the code to hide frequent weekend trips to [[Springwood Estate]] and, some believed, the meetings with former lover [[Lucy Rutherford]] that began again in 1944. During the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 presidential election]], he may have used his ability to avoid press reports to hide evidence of worsening health.

Perhaps the worst press violation occurred in August 1944, when due to procedural errors a nationwide [[Mutual Network]] broadcast mentioned the military creating a weapon in Pasco, Washington involving atom splitting. The Office of Censorship asked all recordings of the broadcast to be destroyed. As with radar, officials sometimes disclosed information to the press without authorization.<ref name=\":02\" />{{rp|201\u2013203}} That was not the first request for voluntary censorship of atomic-related information. Price noted in comments to reporters after the end of censorship that some 20,000 news outlets had been delivered similar requests. For the most part censors were able to keep sensitive information about the Manhattan Project from being published or broadcast. Slips of the tongue occurred with individuals knowledgeable about the project.\n\nAnother serious breach of secrecy occurred in March 1944, when John Raper of the ''[[Cleveland Press]]'' published \"Forbidden City\". The reporter, who had heard rumors while vacationing in New Mexico, described a secret project in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]], calling it \"Uncle Sam's mystery town directed by '2nd [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'\", [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. It speculated that the project was working on [[chemical warfare]], powerful new explosives, or a beam that would cause German aircraft engines to fail. Manhattan Project leaders called the article \"a complete lack of responsibility, compliance with national censorship code and cooperation with the Government in keeping an important project secret\", and considered drafting Raper into the military, but the article apparently did not cause [[Axis powers|Axis]] spies to investigate the project.<ref name=\"wellerstein20130920\">{{cite web | url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/09/20/worst-manhattan-project-leaks/ | title=The worst of the Manhattan Project leaks | publisher=Restricted Data | date=2013-09-20 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Wellerstein, Alex}}</ref> After Hiroshima ''[[The New York Times]]'' was first to report on the specifics of the Manhattan Project on August 7, 1945, saying the bomb was built in \"three 'hidden cities' with a total population of 100,000 inhabitants\"; Los Alamos, [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and [[Hanford site|Hanford, Washington]]. \"None of the people, who came to these developments from homes all the way from Maine to California, had the slightest idea of what they were making in the gigantic Government plants they saw around them,\" the ''New York Times'' said.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Postal censorship]]\n*[[Censorship in the United States]]\n*[[Military history of the United States during World War II]]\n*[[United States home front during World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Henry T.

In response to the threat of war, branches in the United States government that explicitly regulated censorship popped up within the Military and Navy. These branches were the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, which began in September 1939, and the Censorship Branch in the Military Intelligence Division which formed in June 1941.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/216.html#216.2.1|title=Records of the office of Censorship|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> A Joint Board was also established in September 1939 to facilitate censorship planning between the Military and Navy departments of the US government.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe [[bombing of Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941 caused the official entry of America into World War II and the reorganizing of government activities responsible for censoring communication in and out of the United States. The [[First War Powers Act]], passed on December 18, 1941, contained broad grants of Executive authority, including a provision on censorship.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Executive Order 8985 ===\nOn December 19, 1941, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed Executive Order 8985, which established the Office of Censorship and conferred on its director the power to censor international communications in \"his absolute discretion.\"<ref name=\":42\" /> The order set up a Censorship Policy Board to advise the director on policy coordination and integration of censorship activities. It also authorized the director to establish a Censorship Operating Board that would bring together other government agencies to deal with issues of communication interception.

They also created a central clearinghouse of information within the headquarters of the Office of Censorship.\n\nPrice utilized existing facilities of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] wherever possible. On March 15, 1942, [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] personnel engaged in censorship activities moved from the War Department and Navy Department to the Office of Censorship. There they monitored the 350,000 overseas cables and telegrams and 25,000 international telephone calls each week. Offices in Los Angeles, New York City, and [[Rochester, New York]] reviewed films.<ref name=\":6\">Kennett, Lee (1985). ''For the duration... : the United States goes to war, Pearl Harbor-1942''. New York: Scribner. {{ISBN|0-684-18239-4}}.</ref>\n\nRadio was especially vulnerable to government control under the [[Communications Act of 1934]]. The voluntary nature of censorship relieved many broadcasters, which had expected that war would cause the government to seize all stations and draft their employees into the army. Such authority existed; [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Francis Biddle]] issued an opinion to Price in early 1942 that gave him almost unlimited authority over broadcasting. As an experienced journalist who disliked having to act as censor, he feared that a nationwide takeover of radio would result in a permanent government monopoly.

The government made a general announcement on radar in April 1943, and government and military officials frequently leaked information on the subject, but restrictions did not end until the day after Japan's surrender in August 1945.<ref name=\":02\" />{{rp|195\u2013197}}\n\nFrom mid-1943 until the [[bombing of Hiroshima]] in August 1945, the Office of Censorship helped keep the Manhattan Project secret by asking the press and broadcasters to voluntarily censor information they learned about atomic energy or the project. Perhaps the worst press violation occurred in August 1944, when due to procedural errors a nationwide [[Mutual Network]] broadcast mentioned the military creating a weapon in Pasco, Washington involving atom splitting. The Office of Censorship asked all recordings of the broadcast to be destroyed. As with radar, officials sometimes disclosed information to the press without authorization.<ref name=\":02\" />{{rp|201\u2013203}} That was not the first request for voluntary censorship of atomic-related information. Price noted in comments to reporters after the end of censorship that some 20,000 news outlets had been delivered similar requests. For the most part censors were able to keep sensitive information about the Manhattan Project from being published or broadcast. Slips of the tongue occurred with individuals knowledgeable about the project.\n\nAnother serious breach of secrecy occurred in March 1944, when John Raper of the ''[[Cleveland Press]]'' published \"Forbidden City\". The reporter, who had heard rumors while vacationing in New Mexico, described a secret project in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]], calling it \"Uncle Sam's mystery town directed by '2nd [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'\", [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. It speculated that the project was working on [[chemical warfare]], powerful new explosives, or a beam that would cause German aircraft engines to fail. Manhattan Project leaders called the article \"a complete lack of responsibility, compliance with national censorship code and cooperation with the Government in keeping an important project secret\", and considered drafting Raper into the military, but the article apparently did not cause [[Axis powers|Axis]] spies to investigate the project.<ref name=\"wellerstein20130920\">{{cite web | url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/09/20/worst-manhattan-project-leaks/ | title=The worst of the Manhattan Project leaks | publisher=Restricted Data | date=2013-09-20 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Wellerstein, Alex}}</ref> After Hiroshima ''[[The New York Times]]'' was first to report on the specifics of the Manhattan Project on August 7, 1945, saying the bomb was built in \"three 'hidden cities' with a total population of 100,000 inhabitants\"; Los Alamos, [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and [[Hanford site|Hanford, Washington]]. \"None of the people, who came to these developments from homes all the way from Maine to California, had the slightest idea of what they were making in the gigantic Government plants they saw around them,\" the ''New York Times'' said.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Postal censorship]]\n*[[Censorship in the United States]]\n*[[Military history of the United States during World War II]]\n*[[United States home front during World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Henry T.

Officers in the INA distrusted the Japanese. Leaders of the first INA sought formal assurances from Japan before committing to war. When these did not arrive, Mohan Singh resigned after ordering his army to disband; he expected to be sentenced to death. After Bose established ''Azad Hind'', he tried to establish his political independence from the regime that supported him. (He had led protests against the [[Mukden Incident|Japanese expansion into China]], and supported [[Chiang Kai-shek]] during the 1930s) ''Azad Hind'' depended on Japan for arms and material but sought to be as financially independent as possible, levying taxes and raising donations from Indians in Southeast Asia\".<ref name=Belle200>{{Harvnb|Belle|2014|p=200}}</ref> On the Japanese side, members of the high command had been personally impressed by Bose and were willing to grant him some latitude; more importantly, the Japanese were interested in maintaining the support of a man who had been able to mobilise large numbers of Indian expatriates&nbsp;\u2013 including, most importantly, 40,000 of the 45,000 Indians captured by the Japanese at Singapore.<ref>{{cite press_release | url=http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/burma.html | title=Capture of INA | accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref> However, Faye notes that interactions between soldiers in the field was different. Attempts to use Shah Nawaz's troops in road building and as porters angered the troops, forcing Bose to intervene with Mutaguchi. After the withdrawal from Imphal, the relations between both junior non-commissioned officers and between senior officers had deteriorated. INA officers accused the Japanese Army high command of trying to deceive INA troops into fighting for Japan. Conversely, Japanese soldiers often expressed disdain for INA soldiers for having changed their oath of loyalty. This mutual dislike was especially strong after the withdrawal from Imphal began; Japanese soldiers, suspicious that INA defectors had been responsible for their defeat, addressed INA soldiers as \"shameless one\" instead of \"comrade\" as previously had been the case.<ref name=Toye203>{{Harvnb|Toye|1959|p=203}}</ref> ''Azad Hind'' officials in Burma reported difficulties with the Japanese military administration in arranging supply for troops and transport for wounded men as the armies withdrew.

As the situation in Burma became hopeless for the Japanese, Bose refused requests to use INA troops against Aung San's [[Burma National Army]], which had turned against Japan and was now allied with Commonwealth forces.<ref name=Toye1959p231>{{Harvnb|Toye|1959|p=231}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Destruction of INA Memorial 1945.jpg|right|thumb|200px|INA memorial in Singapore after demolition by British Indian Army [[sapper]]s.

The morale of ''Sepoys'' during this time was low and knowledge about the INA was minimal. The INA's special services agents led a successful operation during this time in encouraging the Indian troops to defect to the INA. By the end of March 1945, however, the ''Sepoys'' in the British-Indian Army were reinvigorated and perceived the men of the INA to be savage turncoats and cowards. Senior British officers in the Indian Army considered them \"rabble\".<ref name=Toyexix/> Historians [[Christopher Bayly]] and Tim Harper mention that sepoys in field units shot captured or wounded INA men, relieving their British officers of the complex task of formulating a formal plan for captured men.<ref name=Marston2014p118>{{Harvnb|Marston|2014|p=118}}</ref> After Singapore was retaken, Mountbatten ordered the INA's war memorial to its fallen soldiers to be blown up.<ref name=Fayp523>{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=523}}</ref>\n\nAs the story of the INA unfolded in post-war India, the view of Indian soldiers on the INA&nbsp;\u2013 and on their own position during the war&nbsp;\u2013 also changed.<ref name=Edwards93>{{Harvnb|Edwards|1963|p=93}}</ref> The Raj observed with increasing disquiet and unease the spread of pro-INA sympathies within the troops of the British-Indian forces.<ref name=Sarkar419/> In February 1946, while the trials were still going on, a general strike by ratings of the Royal Indian Navy rapidly [[Bombay Mutiny|deteriorated into a mutiny]] incorporating ships and shore establishments of the RIN throughout India.

[[Claude Auchinleck]], the [[Commander-in-Chief, India|Commander-in-Chief]] of the British-Indian army, hoped that by holding public trials in the Red Fort, public opinion would turn against the INA if the media reported stories of torture and collaborationism, helping him settle a political as well as military question.<ref name=Singh42-43>{{harvnb|Singh|2003|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> Those to stand trials were accused variously of murder, torture and \"waging war against the King-Emperor\".

The accusations against them included the alleged murder of their comrades-in-arms in the INA whilst in Burma. Peter Fay highlights in his book ''The Forgotten Army'' that the murders alleged were, in fact, courts-martial of captured deserters the defendants had presided over.

Officers in the INA distrusted the Japanese. Leaders of the first INA sought formal assurances from Japan before committing to war. When these did not arrive, Mohan Singh resigned after ordering his army to disband; he expected to be sentenced to death. After Bose established ''Azad Hind'', he tried to establish his political independence from the regime that supported him. (He had led protests against the [[Mukden Incident|Japanese expansion into China]], and supported [[Chiang Kai-shek]] during the 1930s) ''Azad Hind'' depended on Japan for arms and material but sought to be as financially independent as possible, levying taxes and raising donations from Indians in Southeast Asia\".<ref name=Belle200>{{Harvnb|Belle|2014|p=200}}</ref> On the Japanese side, members of the high command had been personally impressed by Bose and were willing to grant him some latitude; more importantly, the Japanese were interested in maintaining the support of a man who had been able to mobilise large numbers of Indian expatriates&nbsp;\u2013 including, most importantly, 40,000 of the 45,000 Indians captured by the Japanese at Singapore.<ref>{{cite press_release | url=http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/burma.html | title=Capture of INA | accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref> However, Faye notes that interactions between soldiers in the field was different. Attempts to use Shah Nawaz's troops in road building and as porters angered the troops, forcing Bose to intervene with Mutaguchi. After the withdrawal from Imphal, the relations between both junior non-commissioned officers and between senior officers had deteriorated. INA officers accused the Japanese Army high command of trying to deceive INA troops into fighting for Japan. Conversely, Japanese soldiers often expressed disdain for INA soldiers for having changed their oath of loyalty. This mutual dislike was especially strong after the withdrawal from Imphal began; Japanese soldiers, suspicious that INA defectors had been responsible for their defeat, addressed INA soldiers as \"shameless one\" instead of \"comrade\" as previously had been the case.<ref name=Toye203>{{Harvnb|Toye|1959|p=203}}</ref> ''Azad Hind'' officials in Burma reported difficulties with the Japanese military administration in arranging supply for troops and transport for wounded men as the armies withdrew.

As the situation in Burma became hopeless for the Japanese, Bose refused requests to use INA troops against Aung San's [[Burma National Army]], which had turned against Japan and was now allied with Commonwealth forces.<ref name=Toye1959p231>{{Harvnb|Toye|1959|p=231}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Destruction of INA Memorial 1945.jpg|right|thumb|200px|INA memorial in Singapore after demolition by British Indian Army [[sapper]]s.

The INA's special services agents led a successful operation during this time in encouraging the Indian troops to defect to the INA. By the end of March 1945, however, the ''Sepoys'' in the British-Indian Army were reinvigorated and perceived the men of the INA to be savage turncoats and cowards. Senior British officers in the Indian Army considered them \"rabble\".<ref name=Toyexix/> Historians [[Christopher Bayly]] and Tim Harper mention that sepoys in field units shot captured or wounded INA men, relieving their British officers of the complex task of formulating a formal plan for captured men.<ref name=Marston2014p118>{{Harvnb|Marston|2014|p=118}}</ref> After Singapore was retaken, Mountbatten ordered the INA's war memorial to its fallen soldiers to be blown up.<ref name=Fayp523>{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=523}}</ref>\n\nAs the story of the INA unfolded in post-war India, the view of Indian soldiers on the INA&nbsp;\u2013 and on their own position during the war&nbsp;\u2013 also changed.<ref name=Edwards93>{{Harvnb|Edwards|1963|p=93}}</ref> The Raj observed with increasing disquiet and unease the spread of pro-INA sympathies within the troops of the British-Indian forces.<ref name=Sarkar419/> In February 1946, while the trials were still going on, a general strike by ratings of the Royal Indian Navy rapidly [[Bombay Mutiny|deteriorated into a mutiny]] incorporating ships and shore establishments of the RIN throughout India.

After completion of a secondary school diploma, students may go on to post-secondary studies.\n\nExceptions to the aforementioned length of study include the provinces of Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec, as well as the Northwest Territories.

For each district, board members (trustees) are elected only by its supporters within the district (voters receive a ballot for just one of the boards in their area).  Normally, all publicly funded schools are under the authority of their local district school board. These school boards would follow a common curriculum set up by the province the board resides in. Only [[Alberta]] allows public [[Alberta charter schools|charter schools]], which are independent of any district board.  Instead, they each have their own board, which reports directly to the province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://education.alberta.ca/charter-schools/about-alberta-charter-schools/|title=About Alberta Charter Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=education.alberta.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925202150/https://education.alberta.ca/charter-schools/about-alberta-charter-schools/|archive-date=25 September 2016|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of education in Canada}}\n\n==Primary and secondary education==\n[[Primary education]], [[Intermediate education]], and [[secondary education]] combined are sometimes referred to as K-12 (Kindergarten through Grade 12). [[Secondary schooling]], known as high school, [[collegiate institute]], ''\u00e9cole secondaire'' or secondary school, consists of different grades depending on the province in which one resides. Furthermore, grade structure may vary within a province or even within a school division; as to whether or not they operate middle or junior high schools.\n\nKindergarten programs are available for children in all provinces in Canada and are typically offered as one-year programs for students who turn five in that year. However, the provinces of Nova Scotia, the Northwest Territories, Ontario, and Quebec operate two-year kindergarten programs, with the first year beginning at the age of four. The names of these programs, provincial funding, and the number of hours provided varies widely. For example, the Department of Education in Nova Scotia refers to Kindergarten as Grade Primary.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ednet.ns.ca/index.php?t=sub_pages&cat=382|title = Learning Outcomes by GRADE|work = Learning Outcomes Framework documents|author = |publisher = Province of Nova Scotia|year =2008}}</ref> Full-day kindergarten programs are offered in all provinces except [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]], [[Nunavut]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Yukon]]. Students in the Prairie provinces are not required by statute to attend kindergarten. As a result, kindergarten often is not available in smaller towns.\n\nSince the 1940s, Ontario's kindergarten program has consisted of two years: junior kindergarten for four-year-olds and senior kindergarten for five-year-olds. At Francophone schools in Ontario, these programs are called ''Maternelle'' and ''Jardin''.<ref>[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/fre/educationFacts.html Education Facts]. Retrieved November 1, 2009.</ref> In 2016, Nova Scotia began to implement a two-year kindergarten program (pre-primary, and primary), with provincial-wide service expected by 2020.<ref name=nsjk/> In 2017, the Northwest Territories introduced its junior kindergarten program throughout the territory.<ref name=nwjk/> Quebec offers heavily subsidized preschool programs and introduced an early kindergarten program for children from low-income families in 2013.\n\nGrade 12 presently serves as the final grade in all provincial secondary curriculums, except Quebec, whose secondary schools ends after Secondary V/Grade 11 (age 16 by 31 December); after which, students who wish to pursue further studies may attend a post-secondary institution. Quebec is currently the only province where it treats Grade 12 as a part of the tertiary level of education. Grade 11 also served as the end of secondary education in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], until the province implemented Grade 12 in 1983. Conversely, from 1921 to 2003, Ontario's secondary curriculum lasted a year longer, with secondary schooling ending after [[Grade 13]]/[[Ontario Academic Credit]] (OAC). Grade 13 was reformed into OAC in 1988, and was offered in secondary schools until 2003, after which the grade was discontinued.\n\nStudents may continue to receive publicly-funded secondary schooling until the ages of 19 to 21 (the cut-off age for secondary school varies between provinces). Dependent on the province, those who are the [[age of majority]] may continue to attend a standard secondary school, or may be required to attend an [[adult high school]].\n\nStudents of secondary school age who have received long-term suspensions or have been expelled, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to attend conventional schools may be offered alternative learning options to complete their secondary education, such as drop-in programs, night school, or distance/online classes. An increasing number of [[international students in Canada|international students]] are attending pre-tertiary courses at Canadian secondary schools.\n\n==Tertiary education==\n{{See also|Higher education in Canada|U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities|List of universities in Canada|List of colleges in Canada}}\n[[Image:Enrolmentbysubject.jpg|thumb|right|2005-2006 Canadian university enrollment in various subjects <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/educ54a.htm |title=Statistics Canada education data |access-date=February 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020065114/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/educ54a.htm |archive-date=October 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>]]\n\nPost-secondary education in Canada is provided by universities (research universities, undergraduate universities, and university colleges) and vocational institutions (vocational colleges, career colleges, community colleges, institutes of technology or science, colleges of applied arts or applied technology, and in Quebec, coll\u00e8ges d\u2019enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et professionnel).<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web | url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/enrol-school/post-secondary.html | title=Post-secondary education | publisher=Government of Canada | date=17 May 2017 | accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://higheredstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HESA_SPEC_2018_final.pdf | title=The State of Post-Secondary Education in Canada, 2018.

Generally speaking, universities grant degrees (e.g., bachelor's, master's, professional or doctorate degrees) while colleges, which typically offer vocationally oriented programs, grant diplomas, associate degrees, and certificates. However, some colleges offer applied arts degrees that lead to or are equivalent to degrees from a university. Private career colleges are overseen by legislative acts for each province. For example, in British Columbia training providers will be registered and accredited with the (PCTIA) Private Career Training Institutions Agency regulated under the Private Career Training Institutions Act (SBC 2003) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://pctia.bc.ca/contact.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706165312/http://pctia.bc.ca/contact.htm |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> Each province with their own correlating agency. Unlike the United States, there is no \"accreditation body\" that oversees the universities in Canada. Universities in Canada have degree-granting authority via an Act or Ministerial Consent from the Ministry of Education of the particular province. Tertiary and post-secondary education in Canada is also the responsibility of the individual provinces and territories. Those governments provide the majority of funding to their public post-secondary institutions, with the remainder of funding coming from tuition fees, the federal government, and research grants. Compared to other countries in the past, Canada has had the highest tertiary school enrollment as a percentage of their graduating population.<ref>Glen A. Jones, ed., ''Higher education in Canada: Different systems, different perspectives.'' (Routledge, 2012).</ref>\n\n===University===\nThe traditional path to Canadian higher education is typically through university, as it is by far the most prestigious form of higher education in the country. There is no universally prescribed set definition to what constitutes a \"university\" in Canada as they come in various forms that serve the different educational needs of various Canadians. Each province has its own legislative meaning of the term but universities do intersect in terms of the types of degrees that they offer, research, competitiveness, location, and global institutional reputation. Canadian universities require students' senior secondary school transcript along with an application for admission. [[University and college admission#Canada|Admissions criteria]] to a university in Canada involve the grades earned in core senior secondary school courses taken, and an admission GPA based on their senior secondary school courses calculated in the form of a percentage. Applications for admission outline additional academic and extra-curricular achievements that cannot be expressed through a student's secondary school transcript. In the case of more prestigious and selective university programs, an essay, statement of intent, or personal statement of experience must be submitted directly to the university. In addition, letters of reference, examples of extracurricular activities, volunteering and community service endeavours, athletic participation, student awards, and scholarships are also required for acceptance to some of Canada's most prestigious university programs. Generally, Canadian universities base admission around a student's academic performance in senior secondary school courses taken during their grade 11 and 12 years. In addition, most universities in Canada also establish a GPA or an admission average cutoff. This admissions cut off is established based on the competitiveness of applicants applying to individual programs offered at specific universities. A more competitive program at an esteemed university could have an admissions cutoff of 90 percent or higher, while mid-tier universities have programs that maintain cut-offs around 80 percent. Lower tier and lesser-known Canadian universities with more liberal application processes could have admission cut offs as low as 65 to 70 percent.\n\nAmong the country's most prominent institutions are national research universities that are [[Rankings of universities in Canada|domestically]] and internationally ranked such as the [[University of Toronto]], the [[University of British Columbia]], [[McGill University]], and the [[University of Alberta]]. Other types of universities across Canada include denomination universities (e.g., [[Redeemer University College]], [[Yorkville University]]), undergraduate universities (e.g., [[Acadia University]], [[MacEwan University]], [[Mount Saint Vincent University]], [[St. Francis Xavier University]], [[University of Winnipeg]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]]), liberal arts colleges (e.g., [[Bishop's University]], [[Mount Allison University]], [[Nipissing University]], [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]], [[Trinity Western University]]), art schools ([[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]], [[LaSalle College Vancouver]], [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]], [[Ontario College of Art and Design]], [[Vancouver College of Art and Design]]), online universities with distance education ([[Athabasca University]], [[University of Fredericton]]), and military schools ([[Royal Military College of Canada]], which is the [[military academy]] of the [[Canadian Forces]], a full degree-granting university, and the only federal institution with degree-granting powers) as well as institutions that serve people in more rural and remote parts of the country such as [[Brandon University]], [[Royal Roads University]], [[Thompson Rivers University]], the [[University of Northern British Columbia]], [[University of Prince Edward Island]], [[University of the Fraser Valley]], and [[Vancouver Island University]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://higheredstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HESA_SPEC_2018_final.pdf | title=The State of Post-Secondary Education in Canada, 2018.

There are 26 Canadian universities ranked in the 2020 [[QS World University Rankings]], with the University of Toronto ranked 29th, McGill University ranked 35th, and the University of British Columbia ranked 51st.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020 | title=QS World University Rankings - 2020 | publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds Limited | accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Vocational===\nVocational education in Canada is delivered through vocational [[college (Canada)|college]]s, [[Vocational school#Canada|career college]]s, [[Community college#Canada|community college]]s, [[Institute of technology#Canada|institutes of technology or science]], [[technical school]]s, colleges of applied arts or applied technology, and in Quebec through coll\u00e8ges d\u2019enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et professionnel. Though it is cheaper in terms of tuition, less competitive to get into, and not as prestigious as going to a four-year university, vocational schools are another post-secondary option for students seeking to enter the realm of Canadian higher education. Admissions to vocational schools in Canada have requirements that are less stringent than a university and vary more significantly, but unlike universities, vocational institutions do not have admission cut-offs and as long as students meet the minimum average requirements and have the required courses, they can gain admission to most vocational institutions across the country. Many vocational institutes such as [[George Brown College]] and [[Mohawk College]] accept a very high proportion of students with averages above 70 percent, although they may place no limiting minimum for acceptance, and consequently take students with averages below 60 percent.\n\nThe typical Canadian vocational institute is similar to that of an American [[Junior college#United States|junior college]] or [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]] where it offers specialized vocational oriented certifications in an area of training. However, there are some institutions in Canada that offer both vocational training as well as undergraduate university degrees such as [[Seneca College]], [[Sheridan College]], [[Centennial College of Applied Arts and Technology]], [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University]], [[Vancouver Island University]], and [[Thompson Rivers University]]. There are over 200 community colleges in Canada. They are less competitive to get into compared with universities and are generally found in remote and rural parts of the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://higheredstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HESA_SPEC_2018_final.pdf | title=The State of Post-Secondary Education in Canada, 2018.

After graduating from a vocational institution, some students continue their education by transferring to a university to complete a bachelor's degree, while others choose to enter the workforce. [[Apprenticeship#Canada|Apprenticeship]]s are another form of post-secondary vocational education training in Canada, as students combine in class instruction with practical workforce training for careers related to the skilled trades. In addition, a series of exams have to be passed before the student is certified as a [[Journeyman|journeyperson]]. Skilled trades programs in Canada typically take four years to complete and by finishing the last level, the person is granted a trades certificate and can work anywhere in Canada if a set known as the [[Interprovincial Standards|Red Seal]] exams are passed.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://higheredstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HESA_SPEC_2018_final.pdf | title=The State of Post-Secondary Education in Canada, 2018.

A Statistics Canada study from 2015 found that these students tend to have higher test scores and future educational attainment than their public school counterparts.

In 2002, [[British Columbia]]'s [[Quest University]] became the first privately funded [[liberal arts]] university without a denominational affiliation (although it is not the first private liberal arts university). Many provinces, including Ontario and Alberta, have passed legislation allowing private degree-granting institutions (not necessarily universities) to operate there.\n\nMany Canadians remain polarized on the issue of permitting private universities into the Canadian market. On the one hand, Canada's top universities find it difficult to compete with the private American powerhouses because of funding, but on the other hand, the fact that the price of private universities tends to exclude those who cannot pay that much for their education could prevent a significant portion of Canada's population from being able to attend these schools.\n\nIn addition to the issue of access, some Canadians take issue with protections instituted within the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] as ruled by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2001 and consistent with federal and provincial law that (private) faith-based universities in Canada based on the long-established principles of freedom of conscience and religion can exempt itself from more recent human rights legislation when they insist in their \"community covenant\" code signed by staff, faculty and students that they act in accordance with the faith of the school.

In Ontario, the Catholic system continues to be fully publicly funded while other faiths are not. Ontario has several private Islamic, Christian and Jewish schools all funded through tuition fees. Since the Catholic schools system is entrenched in the constitution, the Supreme Court has ruled that this system is constitutional. However, the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] has ruled that Ontario's system is discriminatory, suggesting that Ontario either fund no faith-based schools, or all of them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/11/05/schools991105.html|title=UN says funding of Catholic schools discriminatory|last=|first=|date=1999-11-05|website=|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612014455/http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/11/05/schools991105.html|archive-date=2008-06-12|accessdate=2008-03-31}}</ref> In 2002 the government of [[Mike Harris]] introduced a controversial program to partially fund all private schools, but this was criticized for undermining the public education system and the program was eliminated after the Liberals won the 2003 provincial election.\n\nIn other provinces, privately operated religious schools are funded. In British Columbia the government pays independent schools that meet rigorous provincial standards up to 50% of the per-student operating cost of public schools. The province has a number of Sikh, Hindu, Christian, and Islamic schools. Alberta also has a network of [[Alberta charter schools|charter schools]], which are fully funded schools offering distinct approaches to education within the public school system. Alberta charter schools are not private and the province does not grant charters to religious schools.  These schools have to follow the provincial curriculum and meet all standards but are given considerable freedom in other areas. In all other provinces, private religious schools receive some funding, but not as much as the public system.\n\n==Levels in education==\n\n===Canada outside Quebec===\nAs the education system in Canada is managed by the varying provincial governments in Canada, the way the educational stages are grouped and named may differ from each region, or even between districts and individual schools.

These are post-secondary institutions granting [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diplomas]] and in some cases, [[bachelor's degrees]].\n**University: A university is an institution of higher education and research, which grants academic degrees in a variety of subjects. A university provides undergraduate (bachelor's degree), graduate (master's degree), and postgraduate (Ph.D) education.\n\n===Quebec===\n{{main|Education in Quebec}}\n\n*Pre-school ({{in lang|fr}}:''Garderie''); under 5\n*[[Kindergarten]] ({{in lang|fr}}:''Maternelle''); 5-6\n*Grade School ({{in lang|fr}}:''\u00e9cole primaire'', literally ''Primary school'', equivalent to ''Elementary School'')\n**Grade 1; 6-7\n**Grade 2; 7-8\n**Grade 3; 8-9\n**Grade 4; 9-10\n**Grade 5; 10-11\n**Grade 6; 11-12\n*secondary school ({{in lang|fr}}: ''\u00e9cole secondaire'', literally ''Secondary school''){{notetag|In most English high schools, the different terms are used interchangeably. In some English high schools, as well as in most French schools, high school students will refer to secondary 1\u20135 as year one through five. So if someone in Secondary three is asked \"what grade/year are you in?\" they will reply \"three\" or \"sec 3\", or \"grade 9\". It is presumed that the person asking the question knows that they are referring not to \"Grade 3\" but \"Secondary 3\".

For example, \"elementary school\" is not called \"\u00e9cole primaire\" in an English school, but has the same grading system.\n\n===Grade structure by province===\nThe following table shows how grades are organized in various provinces.

and lower Secondary Grades. These schools are referred to as Middle Schools or Jr. Secondary Schools. Some Elementary Schools consist solely of grades K-5. Likewise, some Secondary Schools may only have grades 11 and 12. In addition, some school districts may use just elementary (K-7) and secondary (8-12) schools. British Columbia informally subcategorizes the Elementary level into \"Primary\" (K-3) and \"Intermediate\" (4-6 or 7).\n*In Ontario, the terms used in French schooling consist of ''Maternelle'' in regard to Junior Kindergarten and ''Jardin'' in regard to Kindergarten. This differs from Quebec's ''Maternelle'', which is the equivalent of Ontario's Kindergarten.\n*In Manitoba, grade 9 to grade 12 was for a short time referred to as Senior 1 to Senior 4.\n*In Newfoundland and Labrador, Level IV is used to collect missed grades that prevented a student from getting their graduation.\n*In Nova Scotia the terms for groups, and grades they apply to varies significantly throughout the province. A common, but not universal, organization is shown.\n*In Quebec college is two or three years, depending on what a student selects, based usually on what their post-secondary plans are. College in Quebec overlaps what other provinces consider the boundary between secondary education (high school) and post-secondary education (college and university). E.g. \"Sec I\" = \"Secondary Year One\" = \"Grade 7\"\n*In Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, schools are now set up as elementary schools with grades K-5, middle schools with grades 6\u20138, and high schools with grades 9-12; however, high school graduation requirements only include courses taken in grades 10\u201312.\n*In Saskatchewan Elementary school is most often from K-8 and high school from 9-12. High school graduation requirements only taken grades 10-12 and require 24 credits to graduate.\n\n==Provincial and Territorial Departments and Ministries==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Provincial and Territorial Departments and Ministries\n|-\n!

The issue of separate schools is also addressed in [[Section 29 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 29]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', which reaffirms the rights of separate schools found in the ''Constitution Act, 1867''.\n\n[[Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 23]] of the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' guarantees the right of citizens who were educated in the minority language in a particular province to have their children educated in the minority language in publicly funded schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art23.html|title=Charterpedia - Section 23 \u2013 Minority language educational rights|last=Government of Canada|first=Department of Justice|date=1999-11-09|website=www.justice.gc.ca|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref> In practice, this guarantee means that there are publicly funded English schools in Quebec, and publicly funded French schools in the other provinces and the territories.\n\nQuebec students must attend a French school up until the end of secondary school unless one of their parents qualifies as a rights-holder under s.23 of the Charter.[http://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-11#se:73 - Charter of the French language]  In Ontario, French-language schools automatically admit students recognized under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and may admit non-francophone students through the board's admissions committee consisting of the school principal, a school superintendent, and a teacher.\n\nAn example of how schools can be divided by language and religion is visible in [[Toronto]], which has four public school boards operating in the city. They include two English [[first language]] school boards, the separate [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] and [[secular education|secular]] [[Toronto District School Board]]; and two French boards, the separate [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]] and secular [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]].\n\n===Length of study===\nAs education is a provincial matter, the length of study varies depending on the province, although the majority of public early childhood, elementary, and secondary education programs in Canada begin in kindergarten (age five typically by 31 December) and end after Grade 12 (age 17 by 31 December). After completion of a secondary school diploma, students may go on to post-secondary studies.\n\nExceptions to the aforementioned length of study include the provinces of Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec, as well as the Northwest Territories. As opposed to the other provinces, the Kindergarten programs in the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec consist of two years, with the first year open to students age four by 31 December.

For each district, board members (trustees) are elected only by its supporters within the district (voters receive a ballot for just one of the boards in their area).  Normally, all publicly funded schools are under the authority of their local district school board. These school boards would follow a common curriculum set up by the province the board resides in. Only [[Alberta]] allows public [[Alberta charter schools|charter schools]], which are independent of any district board.  Instead, they each have their own board, which reports directly to the province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://education.alberta.ca/charter-schools/about-alberta-charter-schools/|title=About Alberta Charter Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=education.alberta.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925202150/https://education.alberta.ca/charter-schools/about-alberta-charter-schools/|archive-date=25 September 2016|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of education in Canada}}\n\n==Primary and secondary education==\n[[Primary education]], [[Intermediate education]], and [[secondary education]] combined are sometimes referred to as K-12 (Kindergarten through Grade 12). [[Secondary schooling]], known as high school, [[collegiate institute]], ''\u00e9cole secondaire'' or secondary school, consists of different grades depending on the province in which one resides. Furthermore, grade structure may vary within a province or even within a school division; as to whether or not they operate middle or junior high schools.\n\nKindergarten programs are available for children in all provinces in Canada and are typically offered as one-year programs for students who turn five in that year. However, the provinces of Nova Scotia, the Northwest Territories, Ontario, and Quebec operate two-year kindergarten programs, with the first year beginning at the age of four. The names of these programs, provincial funding, and the number of hours provided varies widely. For example, the Department of Education in Nova Scotia refers to Kindergarten as Grade Primary.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ednet.ns.ca/index.php?t=sub_pages&cat=382|title = Learning Outcomes by GRADE|work = Learning Outcomes Framework documents|author = |publisher = Province of Nova Scotia|year =2008}}</ref> Full-day kindergarten programs are offered in all provinces except [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]], [[Nunavut]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Yukon]]. Students in the Prairie provinces are not required by statute to attend kindergarten. As a result, kindergarten often is not available in smaller towns.\n\nSince the 1940s, Ontario's kindergarten program has consisted of two years: junior kindergarten for four-year-olds and senior kindergarten for five-year-olds. At Francophone schools in Ontario, these programs are called ''Maternelle'' and ''Jardin''.<ref>[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/fre/educationFacts.html Education Facts].

Quebec is currently the only province where it treats Grade 12 as a part of the tertiary level of education. Grade 11 also served as the end of secondary education in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], until the province implemented Grade 12 in 1983. Conversely, from 1921 to 2003, Ontario's secondary curriculum lasted a year longer, with secondary schooling ending after [[Grade 13]]/[[Ontario Academic Credit]] (OAC). Grade 13 was reformed into OAC in 1988, and was offered in secondary schools until 2003, after which the grade was discontinued.\n\nStudents may continue to receive publicly-funded secondary schooling until the ages of 19 to 21 (the cut-off age for secondary school varies between provinces). Dependent on the province, those who are the [[age of majority]] may continue to attend a standard secondary school, or may be required to attend an [[adult high school]].\n\nStudents of secondary school age who have received long-term suspensions or have been expelled, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to attend conventional schools may be offered alternative learning options to complete their secondary education, such as drop-in programs, night school, or distance/online classes. An increasing number of [[international students in Canada|international students]] are attending pre-tertiary courses at Canadian secondary schools.\n\n==Tertiary education==\n{{See also|Higher education in Canada|U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities|List of universities in Canada|List of colleges in Canada}}\n[[Image:Enrolmentbysubject.jpg|thumb|right|2005-2006 Canadian university enrollment in various subjects <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/educ54a.htm |title=Statistics Canada education data |access-date=February 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020065114/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/educ54a.htm |archive-date=October 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>]]\n\nPost-secondary education in Canada is provided by universities (research universities, undergraduate universities, and university colleges) and vocational institutions (vocational colleges, career colleges, community colleges, institutes of technology or science, colleges of applied arts or applied technology, and in Quebec, coll\u00e8ges d\u2019enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et professionnel).<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web | url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/enrol-school/post-secondary.html | title=Post-secondary education | publisher=Government of Canada | date=17 May 2017 | accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://higheredstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HESA_SPEC_2018_final.pdf | title=The State of Post-Secondary Education in Canada, 2018.

However, some colleges offer applied arts degrees that lead to or are equivalent to degrees from a university. Private career colleges are overseen by legislative acts for each province. For example, in British Columbia training providers will be registered and accredited with the (PCTIA) Private Career Training Institutions Agency regulated under the Private Career Training Institutions Act (SBC 2003) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://pctia.bc.ca/contact.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706165312/http://pctia.bc.ca/contact.htm |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> Each province with their own correlating agency. Unlike the United States, there is no \"accreditation body\" that oversees the universities in Canada. Universities in Canada have degree-granting authority via an Act or Ministerial Consent from the Ministry of Education of the particular province. Tertiary and post-secondary education in Canada is also the responsibility of the individual provinces and territories. Those governments provide the majority of funding to their public post-secondary institutions, with the remainder of funding coming from tuition fees, the federal government, and research grants. Compared to other countries in the past, Canada has had the highest tertiary school enrollment as a percentage of their graduating population.<ref>Glen A. Jones, ed., ''Higher education in Canada: Different systems, different perspectives.'' (Routledge, 2012).</ref>\n\n===University===\nThe traditional path to Canadian higher education is typically through university, as it is by far the most prestigious form of higher education in the country. There is no universally prescribed set definition to what constitutes a \"university\" in Canada as they come in various forms that serve the different educational needs of various Canadians. Each province has its own legislative meaning of the term but universities do intersect in terms of the types of degrees that they offer, research, competitiveness, location, and global institutional reputation. Canadian universities require students' senior secondary school transcript along with an application for admission. [[University and college admission#Canada|Admissions criteria]] to a university in Canada involve the grades earned in core senior secondary school courses taken, and an admission GPA based on their senior secondary school courses calculated in the form of a percentage. Applications for admission outline additional academic and extra-curricular achievements that cannot be expressed through a student's secondary school transcript. In the case of more prestigious and selective university programs, an essay, statement of intent, or personal statement of experience must be submitted directly to the university. In addition, letters of reference, examples of extracurricular activities, volunteering and community service endeavours, athletic participation, student awards, and scholarships are also required for acceptance to some of Canada's most prestigious university programs. Generally, Canadian universities base admission around a student's academic performance in senior secondary school courses taken during their grade 11 and 12 years. In addition, most universities in Canada also establish a GPA or an admission average cutoff. This admissions cut off is established based on the competitiveness of applicants applying to individual programs offered at specific universities. A more competitive program at an esteemed university could have an admissions cutoff of 90 percent or higher, while mid-tier universities have programs that maintain cut-offs around 80 percent. Lower tier and lesser-known Canadian universities with more liberal application processes could have admission cut offs as low as 65 to 70 percent.\n\nAmong the country's most prominent institutions are national research universities that are [[Rankings of universities in Canada|domestically]] and internationally ranked such as the [[University of Toronto]], the [[University of British Columbia]], [[McGill University]], and the [[University of Alberta]]. Other types of universities across Canada include denomination universities (e.g., [[Redeemer University College]], [[Yorkville University]]), undergraduate universities (e.g., [[Acadia University]], [[MacEwan University]], [[Mount Saint Vincent University]], [[St. Francis Xavier University]], [[University of Winnipeg]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]]), liberal arts colleges (e.g., [[Bishop's University]], [[Mount Allison University]], [[Nipissing University]], [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]], [[Trinity Western University]]), art schools ([[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]], [[LaSalle College Vancouver]], [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]], [[Ontario College of Art and Design]], [[Vancouver College of Art and Design]]), online universities with distance education ([[Athabasca University]], [[University of Fredericton]]), and military schools ([[Royal Military College of Canada]], which is the [[military academy]] of the [[Canadian Forces]], a full degree-granting university, and the only federal institution with degree-granting powers) as well as institutions that serve people in more rural and remote parts of the country such as [[Brandon University]], [[Royal Roads University]], [[Thompson Rivers University]], the [[University of Northern British Columbia]], [[University of Prince Edward Island]], [[University of the Fraser Valley]], and [[Vancouver Island University]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://higheredstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HESA_SPEC_2018_final.pdf | title=The State of Post-Secondary Education in Canada, 2018.

Though it is cheaper in terms of tuition, less competitive to get into, and not as prestigious as going to a four-year university, vocational schools are another post-secondary option for students seeking to enter the realm of Canadian higher education. Admissions to vocational schools in Canada have requirements that are less stringent than a university and vary more significantly, but unlike universities, vocational institutions do not have admission cut-offs and as long as students meet the minimum average requirements and have the required courses, they can gain admission to most vocational institutions across the country. Many vocational institutes such as [[George Brown College]] and [[Mohawk College]] accept a very high proportion of students with averages above 70 percent, although they may place no limiting minimum for acceptance, and consequently take students with averages below 60 percent.\n\nThe typical Canadian vocational institute is similar to that of an American [[Junior college#United States|junior college]] or [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]] where it offers specialized vocational oriented certifications in an area of training. However, there are some institutions in Canada that offer both vocational training as well as undergraduate university degrees such as [[Seneca College]], [[Sheridan College]], [[Centennial College of Applied Arts and Technology]], [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University]], [[Vancouver Island University]], and [[Thompson Rivers University]]. There are over 200 community colleges in Canada. They are less competitive to get into compared with universities and are generally found in remote and rural parts of the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://higheredstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HESA_SPEC_2018_final.pdf | title=The State of Post-Secondary Education in Canada, 2018.

After graduating from a vocational institution, some students continue their education by transferring to a university to complete a bachelor's degree, while others choose to enter the workforce. [[Apprenticeship#Canada|Apprenticeship]]s are another form of post-secondary vocational education training in Canada, as students combine in class instruction with practical workforce training for careers related to the skilled trades. In addition, a series of exams have to be passed before the student is certified as a [[Journeyman|journeyperson]]. Skilled trades programs in Canada typically take four years to complete and by finishing the last level, the person is granted a trades certificate and can work anywhere in Canada if a set known as the [[Interprovincial Standards|Red Seal]] exams are passed.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://higheredstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HESA_SPEC_2018_final.pdf | title=The State of Post-Secondary Education in Canada, 2018.

In 2002, [[British Columbia]]'s [[Quest University]] became the first privately funded [[liberal arts]] university without a denominational affiliation (although it is not the first private liberal arts university). Many provinces, including Ontario and Alberta, have passed legislation allowing private degree-granting institutions (not necessarily universities) to operate there.\n\nMany Canadians remain polarized on the issue of permitting private universities into the Canadian market. On the one hand, Canada's top universities find it difficult to compete with the private American powerhouses because of funding, but on the other hand, the fact that the price of private universities tends to exclude those who cannot pay that much for their education could prevent a significant portion of Canada's population from being able to attend these schools.\n\nIn addition to the issue of access, some Canadians take issue with protections instituted within the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] as ruled by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2001 and consistent with federal and provincial law that (private) faith-based universities in Canada based on the long-established principles of freedom of conscience and religion can exempt itself from more recent human rights legislation when they insist in their \"community covenant\" code signed by staff, faculty and students that they act in accordance with the faith of the school. The covenant may require restraint from those acts considered in contradiction with the tenets of their faith such as homosexual relationships, sex outside marriage or more broadly abstain from consuming alcohol on campus or viewing pornography.<ref>{{cite news|last=Todd|first=Douglas|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119212901/https://vancouversun.com/life/Proposed+Christian+school+Trinity+Western+under+fire+because+university+anti+rules/7830354/story.html|title=Proposed Christian law school at Trinity Western under fire because of university's anti-gay rules|date=January 16, 2013|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, private-Christian based schools do not preclude homosexual or lesbian students from attending.<ref>{{cite news|title=Trinity Western University law school proponents fire back at critics|last=Tamminga|first=Monique|date= March 27, 2013|newspaper=Langley Times|url=http://www.langleytimes.com/news/200277801.html}}</ref> Some faith-based universities have been known to fire staff and faculty which refused to adhere or whose actions were in opposition with the tenets of the faith, although in some provinces, their dismissals have been successfully challenged in court based on the circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline - Same-Sex Rights in Canada (See 1991)|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/01/12/f-same-sex-rights.html|publisher=CBC|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Religious schools===\nEach province deals differently with private religious schools. In Ontario, the Catholic system continues to be fully publicly funded while other faiths are not. Ontario has several private Islamic, Christian and Jewish schools all funded through tuition fees. Since the Catholic schools system is entrenched in the constitution, the Supreme Court has ruled that this system is constitutional. However, the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] has ruled that Ontario's system is discriminatory, suggesting that Ontario either fund no faith-based schools, or all of them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/11/05/schools991105.html|title=UN says funding of Catholic schools discriminatory|last=|first=|date=1999-11-05|website=|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612014455/http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/11/05/schools991105.html|archive-date=2008-06-12|accessdate=2008-03-31}}</ref> In 2002 the government of [[Mike Harris]] introduced a controversial program to partially fund all private schools, but this was criticized for undermining the public education system and the program was eliminated after the Liberals won the 2003 provincial election.\n\nIn other provinces, privately operated religious schools are funded. In British Columbia the government pays independent schools that meet rigorous provincial standards up to 50% of the per-student operating cost of public schools. The province has a number of Sikh, Hindu, Christian, and Islamic schools. Alberta also has a network of [[Alberta charter schools|charter schools]], which are fully funded schools offering distinct approaches to education within the public school system. Alberta charter schools are not private and the province does not grant charters to religious schools.  These schools have to follow the provincial curriculum and meet all standards but are given considerable freedom in other areas. In all other provinces, private religious schools receive some funding, but not as much as the public system.\n\n==Levels in education==\n\n===Canada outside Quebec===\nAs the education system in Canada is managed by the varying provincial governments in Canada, the way the educational stages are grouped and named may differ from each region, or even between districts and individual schools.

and lower Secondary Grades. These schools are referred to as Middle Schools or Jr. Secondary Schools. Some Elementary Schools consist solely of grades K-5. Likewise, some Secondary Schools may only have grades 11 and 12. In addition, some school districts may use just elementary (K-7) and secondary (8-12) schools. British Columbia informally subcategorizes the Elementary level into \"Primary\" (K-3) and \"Intermediate\" (4-6 or 7).\n*In Ontario, the terms used in French schooling consist of ''Maternelle'' in regard to Junior Kindergarten and ''Jardin'' in regard to Kindergarten. This differs from Quebec's ''Maternelle'', which is the equivalent of Ontario's Kindergarten.\n*In Manitoba, grade 9 to grade 12 was for a short time referred to as Senior 1 to Senior 4.\n*In Newfoundland and Labrador, Level IV is used to collect missed grades that prevented a student from getting their graduation.\n*In Nova Scotia the terms for groups, and grades they apply to varies significantly throughout the province. A common, but not universal, organization is shown.\n*In Quebec college is two or three years, depending on what a student selects, based usually on what their post-secondary plans are. College in Quebec overlaps what other provinces consider the boundary between secondary education (high school) and post-secondary education (college and university). E.g. \"Sec I\" = \"Secondary Year One\" = \"Grade 7\"\n*In Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, schools are now set up as elementary schools with grades K-5, middle schools with grades 6\u20138, and high schools with grades 9-12; however, high school graduation requirements only include courses taken in grades 10\u201312.\n*In Saskatchewan Elementary school is most often from K-8 and high school from 9-12. High school graduation requirements only taken grades 10-12 and require 24 credits to graduate.\n\n==Provincial and Territorial Departments and Ministries==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Provincial and Territorial Departments and Ministries\n|-\n!
