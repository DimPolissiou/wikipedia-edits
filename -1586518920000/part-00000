Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer [[Trent Reznor]] was the only permanent member of the band until the official addition of English musician [[Atticus Ross]] in 2016.\n\nReznor recorded the band's debut album, ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989), while working overnight as a janitor at a Cleveland recording studio. After feuding with the label [[TVT Records]] about promotion, Reznor signed with [[Interscope Records]] and released the EP [[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|''Broken'']] (1992). The following albums, ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994) and [[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|''The Fragile'']] (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album, ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005). Following the release of [[Year Zero (album)|''Year Zero'']] (2007), Reznor left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'' (2008) and [[The Slip (album)|''The Slip'']] (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, ''[[Hesitation Marks]]'' (2013), was followed by a trilogy consisting of the EPs ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016) and ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017) and their ninth album ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails released two further installments in the ''Ghosts'' series, ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' and ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]].''\n\nReznor and Ross typically assemble [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band to perform with them]]. Not including sporadic band hiatuses, the band has varied over the decades, with the most recent lineup consisting of [[Robin Finck]] (initially joined in 1994), [[Alessandro Cortini]] (initially joined in 2005), and [[Ilan Rubin]] (initially joined in 2009). Nine Inch Nails concerts since 2005 often employ thematic visual elements, extensive use of special effects, and elaborate light shows; songs are often rearranged for performance, and elements of songs that are not scheduled to be performed in their entirety are occasionally assimilated into other songs.\n\nNine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and have been nominated for 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning for the songs [[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|\"Wish\"]] (1992) and \"[[Happiness in Slavery]]\" (1996). In 1997, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] named Reznor one of the most influential people, and ''Spin'' has described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]]. They were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2014 (their first year of eligibility), nominated again in 2015, and are scheduled for induction in 2020.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1988\u20131989)===\n[[File:Nine Inch Nails logo.svg|thumb|right|alt=The letters N, I, and a backwards N set in a strong typeface within a simple black border.|The band's logo, designed by Reznor and [[Gary Talpas]]]]\n\nIn 1987 in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Trent Reznor]] played keyboards in the [[Exotic Birds]], a [[synthpop]] band managed by [[John Malm Jr.]]<ref name=\"NIN Spin 1996\">{{Cite magazine|last=Weisbard|first=Eric|date=February 1996|title=Sympathy for the Devil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=td2yO_T3DPEC&pg=PA34|publisher=Spin Media LLC|volume=11|issue=11|pages=34\u201342, 96|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=August 27, 2018|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|via=Google Books}}</ref>{{rp|38}} Reznor became friends with Malm,{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=33}} who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music.<ref>''Reznor v.

He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.'

Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer [[Trent Reznor]] was the only permanent member of the band until the official addition of English musician [[Atticus Ross]] in 2016.\n\nReznor recorded the band's debut album, ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989), while working overnight as a janitor at a Cleveland recording studio. After feuding with the label [[TVT Records]] about promotion, Reznor signed with [[Interscope Records]] and released the EP [[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|''Broken'']] (1992). The following albums, ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994) and [[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|''The Fragile'']] (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album, ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005). Following the release of [[Year Zero (album)|''Year Zero'']] (2007), Reznor left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'' (2008) and [[The Slip (album)|''The Slip'']] (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, ''[[Hesitation Marks]]'' (2013), was followed by a trilogy consisting of the EPs ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016) and ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017) and their ninth album ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails released two further installments in the ''Ghosts'' series, ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' and ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]].''\n\nReznor and Ross typically assemble [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band to perform with them]]. Not including sporadic band hiatuses, the band has varied over the decades, with the most recent lineup consisting of [[Robin Finck]] (initially joined in 1994), [[Alessandro Cortini]] (initially joined in 2005), and [[Ilan Rubin]] (initially joined in 2009). Nine Inch Nails concerts since 2005 often employ thematic visual elements, extensive use of special effects, and elaborate light shows; songs are often rearranged for performance, and elements of songs that are not scheduled to be performed in their entirety are occasionally assimilated into other songs.\n\nNine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and have been nominated for 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning for the songs [[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|\"Wish\"]] (1992) and \"[[Happiness in Slavery]]\" (1996). In 1997, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] named Reznor one of the most influential people, and ''Spin'' has described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]]. They were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2014 (their first year of eligibility), nominated again in 2015, and are scheduled for induction in 2020.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1988\u20131989)===\n[[File:Nine Inch Nails logo.svg|thumb|right|alt=The letters N, I, and a backwards N set in a strong typeface within a simple black border.|The band's logo, designed by Reznor and [[Gary Talpas]]]]\n\nIn 1987 in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Trent Reznor]] played keyboards in the [[Exotic Birds]], a [[synthpop]] band managed by [[John Malm Jr.]]<ref name=\"NIN Spin 1996\">{{Cite magazine|last=Weisbard|first=Eric|date=February 1996|title=Sympathy for the Devil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=td2yO_T3DPEC&pg=PA34|publisher=Spin Media LLC|volume=11|issue=11|pages=34\u201342, 96|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=August 27, 2018|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|via=Google Books}}</ref>{{rp|38}} Reznor became friends with Malm,{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=33}} who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music.<ref>''Reznor v.

As Reznor explains in an interview with ''Convulsion Magazine'':\n\n<blockquote>There was a scene w[h]ere I was lying on the ground, appearing to be dead, in a ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it&nbsp;... the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere&nbsp;... the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.'

Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property.<ref name = \"Shock\" /> Ultimately, Nine Inch Nails entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=81\u201382}} In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Court Holds Reznor/Malm Contract Not Unconscionable|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1413034/court-holds-reznormalm-contract-not-unconscionable|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005155/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1413034/court-holds-reznormalm-contract-not-unconscionable|archivedate=June 13, 2015}}</ref> Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.<ref name = \"E!

Since its 1950 creation it returns one Member of Parliament (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]].{{#tag:ref|A [[borough constituency]] (for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer)|group= n}}{{#tag:ref|As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.|group= n}}  The affiliation of the winning candidate for Cardiff North was that of the winning party nationally for the years 1979-2015 &ndash; a [[bellwether]] seat.\n\nThe seat has been relative to others a [[marginal seat]] since 2001 as well as a swing seat as its winner's majority has not exceeded 8% of the vote since the 14.3% majority won in that year. The seat has changed political allegiance twice since that year.\n\n==History==\nThis seat is the residential quarter of Wales' capital, over half of northern Cardiff consists of owner-occupied housing, with a higher number of a middle class population than other sections. Historically it has mainly elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs, but with new housing development [[Welsh Labour]] has overturned the nominal majority more recently, turning the seat into a national target swing-constituency. By 2004, the Conservatives held a majority of councillors within the district (13, against five Liberal Democrats, three independents and no Labour), but in the following 2005 general election Welsh Labour's [[Julie Morgan]] retained the seat but with a reduced majority.\n\n[[BBC News]] political editor [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]] profiled the constituency as part of the BBC's build-up to the 2010 general election:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2010/02/taking_pulse.html|title=BBC - Nick Robinson's Newslog: Taking The Pulse: Cardiff|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> saying:\n{{cquote|The Tories are hopeful of winning the seat, having topped the Euro poll not just here but in Wales as a whole. They have 13 councillors in this constituency as against Labour's none and the Lib Dems' five \u2013 even though in Cardiff as a whole, the Lib Dems control the city council. Labour hopes depend on stressing the independence and hard work of the local MP \u2013 Julie (wife of [[Rhodri Morgan|Rhodri) Morgan]] \u2013 and persuading those Lib Dems not to switch to the Tories.}}\n\nMorgan stood again for Welsh Labour in 2010, whilst the Conservatives chose [[Jonathan Evans (politician)|Jonathan Evans]] MEP, who had previously been the MP for [[Brecon and Radnorshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnor]]. Evans won by 194 votes.\n\nIn 2015, Labour attempted to take the seat back but new candidate, [[Craig Williams (politician)|Craig Williams]], took it with a surprising majority of 2,137. Many had expected it to be very close run again. Labour retook the seat in 2017 on a 6.1% swing, producing a majority of 4,174; this was the first time in the seat's history it had voted for a Labour candidate in an election they did not win and the first time it elected an MP who is not a member of the largest party in the House of Commons since [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]].\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1950\u20131974''': The County Borough of Cardiff wards of Cathays, Central, Gabalfa, Penylan, and Plasnewydd.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The County Borough of Cardiff wards of Cathays, Central, Penylan, and Plasnewydd.\n\n'''1983\u20132010''': The City of Cardiff wards of Gabalfa, [[Heath (electoral ward)|Heath]], [[Lisvane and St Mellons]], Llandaff North, [[Llanishen (electoral ward)|Llanishen]], [[Rhiwbina (electoral ward)|Rhiwbina]], and [[Whitchurch & Tongwynlais|Whitchurch and Tongwynlais]].\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Cardiff electoral divisions of Gabalfa, Heath, Lisvane, Llandaff North, Llanishen, Pontprennau and Old St Mellons, Rhiwbina, and Whitchurch and Tongwynlais.\n\nCardiff city centre was in this constituency from its creation in 1950 until 1983, since when it has been in Cardiff Central.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{cite web|title=Cardiff North

Since its 1950 creation it returns one Member of Parliament (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]].{{#tag:ref|A [[borough constituency]] (for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer)|group= n}}{{#tag:ref|As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.|group= n}}  The affiliation of the winning candidate for Cardiff North was that of the winning party nationally for the years 1979-2015 &ndash; a [[bellwether]] seat.\n\nThe seat has been relative to others a [[marginal seat]] since 2001 as well as a swing seat as its winner's majority has not exceeded 8% of the vote since the 14.3% majority won in that year. The seat has changed political allegiance twice since that year.\n\n==History==\nThis seat is the residential quarter of Wales' capital, over half of northern Cardiff consists of owner-occupied housing, with a higher number of a middle class population than other sections. Historically it has mainly elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs, but with new housing development [[Welsh Labour]] has overturned the nominal majority more recently, turning the seat into a national target swing-constituency. By 2004, the Conservatives held a majority of councillors within the district (13, against five Liberal Democrats, three independents and no Labour), but in the following 2005 general election Welsh Labour's [[Julie Morgan]] retained the seat but with a reduced majority.\n\n[[BBC News]] political editor [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]] profiled the constituency as part of the BBC's build-up to the 2010 general election:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2010/02/taking_pulse.html|title=BBC - Nick Robinson's Newslog: Taking The Pulse: Cardiff|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> saying:\n{{cquote|The Tories are hopeful of winning the seat, having topped the Euro poll not just here but in Wales as a whole. They have 13 councillors in this constituency as against Labour's none and the Lib Dems' five \u2013 even though in Cardiff as a whole, the Lib Dems control the city council. Labour hopes depend on stressing the independence and hard work of the local MP \u2013 Julie (wife of [[Rhodri Morgan|Rhodri) Morgan]] \u2013 and persuading those Lib Dems not to switch to the Tories.}}\n\nMorgan stood again for Welsh Labour in 2010, whilst the Conservatives chose [[Jonathan Evans (politician)|Jonathan Evans]] MEP, who had previously been the MP for [[Brecon and Radnorshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnor]]. Evans won by 194 votes.\n\nIn 2015, Labour attempted to take the seat back but new candidate, [[Craig Williams (politician)|Craig Williams]], took it with a surprising majority of 2,137. Many had expected it to be very close run again. Labour retook the seat in 2017 on a 6.1% swing, producing a majority of 4,174; this was the first time in the seat's history it had voted for a Labour candidate in an election they did not win and the first time it elected an MP who is not a member of the largest party in the House of Commons since [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]].\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1950\u20131974''': The County Borough of Cardiff wards of Cathays, Central, Gabalfa, Penylan, and Plasnewydd.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The County Borough of Cardiff wards of Cathays, Central, Penylan, and Plasnewydd.\n\n'''1983\u20132010''': The City of Cardiff wards of Gabalfa, [[Heath (electoral ward)|Heath]], [[Lisvane and St Mellons]], Llandaff North, [[Llanishen

Gabalfa, Heath, Lisvane, Llandaff North, Llanishen, Pontprennau and Old St Mellons, Rhiwbina, and Whitchurch and Tongwynlais.\n\nCardiff city centre was in this constituency from its creation in 1950

Over the next month, 28 similar cases were reported in [[Zhongshan]] alone, and on January 21, 2003, Zhong and other doctors and researchers in related fields reported this disease at an emergency meeting and gave it the name [[atypical pneumonia]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=\u53f6|first=\u4f9d|script-title=zh:\u949f\u5357\u5c71\u4f20|publisher=\u4f5c\u5bb6\u51fa\u7248\u793e|year=2010|isbn=978-7-5063-5267-3|location=Beijing|pages=49\u201352}}</ref> This marked the beginning of the fight against SARS.\n\nOn January 28, 2003, Zhong felt sick and discovered that he had caught [[pneumonia]]. Concerned that the news that a leading researcher and doctor for respiratory diseases falling ill during the SARS outbreak would cause fear and panic for the general public, Zhong decided to not receive treatment in the hospital.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Instead he returned home, hoping that it was not caused by SARS and that he could recover without treatment. With care from his wife, [[:zh:\u674e\u5c11\u82ac|Li Shaofen]], he managed to recover after eight days. After recovery he immediately returned to the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases to direct the fight against SARS. On February 11, 2003, at a press conference held by the [[Guangdong Department of Health]], Zhong explained the disease and its symptoms, and calmed the public by asserting that it was \"preventable\" and \"curable\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nZhong, for the first time while treating SARS patients, employed [[non-invasive ventilation]] methods that increased the amount of oxygen that the patients could take in and alleviated pain. Zhong also insisted on proposing the use of [[cortisone]] for the treating of patients experiencing severe conditions, which significantly lowered the death rate of severe patients to 13% and decreased the total treatment time.\n\nThe decision to use cortisone was politically controversial at the time. In February 2003 the [[Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] had already published the authoritative view that normal [[Chlamydiae]] was the direct cause of atypical pneumonia and, as a result, the only legally prescribed way of treating SARS patients was to use [[antibiotic]]s. Based on observations of hundreds of patients in [[Guangdong]], Zhong was determined to advocate for the moderate usage of cortisone. Zhong said later in an interview that he knew this might bring dishonor and defamation, but he persisted because he trusted in his observations and scientific judgements regarding the disease.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the support of the Guangdong government and the positive results in Guangdong in the treating of SARS disease, Zhong's method was later used as the standard protocol for treating all [[SARS]] patients in China.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhen delegates led by Dr. Evans from the [[World Health Organization]] visited China in early April, Zhong presented the characteristics of SARS as well as the treatment and prevention method in China. Zhong's presentation was well-received and his methods were adopted around the world.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Honors ==\n\n; Awards and Prizes\n:* 2016: Guanghua Engineering Science and Technology Prize<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20160601/48894213_0.shtml|language=zh-cn |script-title=zh:\u653f\u89e3{{!}}\u4e2d\u56fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u9662\u5149\u534e\u201c\u6210\u5c31\u5956\u201d\u4e3a\u4f55\u4e24\u5ea6\u7a7a\u7f3a\uff1f|last1=Wang |first1=Shuo (\u738b\u7855) |date=2016-06-01|work=Ifeng News|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:* National Award for Advances in Science and Technology, China (1997)<ref name=\":02\">Curriculum Vitae of Nan-Shan ZHONG (PDF). \u6fb3\u9580\u79d1\u6280\u5927\u5b78. 2013 [2020-02-09].</ref>\n:* National Role Model of Labors (2005)<ref name=\":02\" />\n:* WAO Awards for Distinguished Recognition (2007)<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n; Paper of the Year\n:*''The Lancet''; 2008: The editorial board praised Zhong and his team, as they \"clarified that [[carbocisteine]] can prevent the worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and can improve life at an affordable price, which is of great significance to developing countries.\" (Note: The editorial board selected six papers for readers to vote, and announced two winners, one selected by the editorial board and one with the highest reader votes.

Over the next month, 28 similar cases were reported in [[Zhongshan]] alone, and on January 21, 2003, Zhong and other doctors and researchers in related fields reported this disease at an emergency meeting and gave it the name [[atypical pneumonia]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=\u53f6|first=\u4f9d|script-title=zh:\u949f\u5357\u5c71\u4f20|publisher=\u4f5c\u5bb6\u51fa\u7248\u793e|year=2010|isbn=978-7-5063-5267-3|location=Beijing|pages=49\u201352}}</ref> This marked the beginning of the fight against SARS.\n\nOn January 28, 2003, Zhong felt sick and discovered that he had caught [[pneumonia]]. Concerned that the news that a leading researcher and doctor for respiratory diseases falling ill during the SARS outbreak would cause fear and panic for the general public, Zhong decided to not receive treatment in the hospital.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Instead he returned home, hoping that it was not caused by SARS and that he could recover without treatment. With care from his wife, [[:zh:\u674e\u5c11\u82ac|Li Shaofen]], he managed to recover after eight days. After recovery he immediately returned to the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases to direct the fight against SARS. On February 11, 2003, at a press conference held by the [[Guangdong Department of Health]], Zhong explained the disease and its symptoms, and calmed the public by asserting that it was \"preventable\" and \"curable\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nZhong, for the first time while treating SARS patients, employed [[non-invasive ventilation]] methods that increased the amount of oxygen that the patients could take in and alleviated pain. Zhong also insisted on proposing the use of [[cortisone]] for the treating of patients experiencing severe conditions, which significantly lowered the death rate of severe patients to 13% and decreased the total treatment time.\n\nThe decision to use cortisone was politically controversial at the time. In February 2003 the [[Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] had already published the authoritative view that normal [[Chlamydiae]] was the direct cause of atypical pneumonia and, as a result, the only legally prescribed way of treating SARS patients was to use [[antibiotic]]s. Based on observations of hundreds of patients in [[Guangdong]], Zhong was determined to advocate for the moderate usage of cortisone. Zhong said later in an interview that he knew this might bring dishonor and defamation, but he persisted because he trusted in his observations and scientific judgements regarding the disease.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the support of the Guangdong government and the positive results in Guangdong in the treating of SARS disease, Zhong's method was later used as the standard protocol for treating all [[SARS]] patients in China.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhen delegates led by Dr. Evans from the [[World Health Organization]] visited China in early April, Zhong presented the characteristics of SARS as well as the treatment and prevention method in China.

His company, [[subLOGIC|subLOGIC Corporation]], initially distributed it for various personal computers.<ref name=msnews5/> In 1981, Artwick was approached by Microsoft's [[Alan M. Boyd]] who was interested in creating a \"definitive game\" that would graphically demonstrate the difference between older 8-bit computers, such as the Apple II, and the new 16-bit computers, such as the IBM PC, still in development. In 1982, Artwick's company licensed a version of ''Flight Simulator'' for the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] to Microsoft, which marketed it as ''Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.00''.\n\nIn 2009, Microsoft [[#Closure of the ACES Game Studio|closed down]] [[Aces Game Studio]], which was the department responsible for creating and maintaining the ''Flight Simulator'' series. In 2014, [[Dovetail Games]] were granted the rights by Microsoft to port the Gold Edition of Microsoft's ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator X|Flight Simulator X]]'' to [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and publish ''Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition''.\n\nMicrosoft announced a new installment at E3 in 2019, simply titled ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020 video game)|Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'', to be released initially on PC and ported over to the Xbox at a later date.<ref>https://kotaku.com/new-microsoft-flight-simulator-looks-uncannily-like-rea-1835359010</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Microsoft Flight Simulator}}\n{{Timeline of release years\n| title = \n| 1982 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0|Flight Simulator 1.0]]''\n| 1984 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2.0|Flight Simulator 2.0]]''\n| 1988 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0|Flight Simulator 3.0]]''\n| 1989 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 4.0|Flight Simulator 4.0]]''\n| 1993 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.0|Flight Simulator 5.0]]''\n| 1995 = ''[[History of Microsoft Flight Simulator#Flight Simulator 5.1|Flight Simulator 5.1]]''\n| 1996 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator '95|Flight Simulator 95]]''\n| 1997 = ''[[Flight Simulator 98]]''\n| 1999 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000|Flight Simulator 2000]]''\n| 2001 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002|Flight Simulator 2002]]''\n| 2003 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight|Flight Simulator 2004]]''\n| 2006 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator X|Flight Simulator X]]''\n| 2014 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator X#Steam Edition|Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition]]''\n| 2020 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020 video game)|Flight Simulator]]''\n<!-- MS Flight is a separate product, please do not include it in the timeline -->\n}}\n\n''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' began as a set of articles written by [[Bruce Artwick]] in 1976 about a [[3D computer graphics]] program. When the magazine editor said that subscribers wanted to buy the program, Artwick set to work to create it and incorporated a company called [[subLOGIC]] Corporation in 1977.  The company began selling flight simulators for several computer platforms, including the [[Intel 8080|8080]], [[Altair 8800]], and [[IMSAI 8080]]. In 1979 subLOGIC released ''[[FS1 Flight Simulator]]'' for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]]. In 1980, subLOGIC released a version for the [[TRS-80]], and in 1982 they licensed an [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] version with [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] graphics to Microsoft, which was released as ''Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.00''. It was unusual in that it was not an [[Application software|application program]] requiring an [[operating system]], but contained its own operating system, which displaced the installed one as long as the program was running. In the early days of less-than-100% [[IBM PC compatible]] systems, ''Flight Simulator'' and [[Lotus 1-2-3]] were used as unofficial compatibility test software for new PC clone models.<ref name=\"runway-usa\">{{cite book|last=Gulick|first=Charles|title=Runway U.S.A.|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|year=1987|isbn=978-1-55615-002-9|url=http://www.flightsimbooks.com/runwayusa/foreword.php|accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref>\n\nsubLOGIC continued to develop for other platforms and ported ''[[Flight Simulator II (subLOGIC)|Flight Simulator II]]'' to the Apple II in 1983; the [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]], and [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]] in 1984; and to the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] in 1986. Meanwhile, Bruce Artwick left subLOGIC and founded [[The Bruce Artwick Organization Ltd.|The Bruce Artwick Organization]] to continue his work on subsequent Microsoft releases, beginning with ''Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0'' in 1988. ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' reached commercial maturity with version 3.1, and went on to encompass the use of 3D graphics and graphic hardware acceleration.\n\n[[Microsoft]] continued to produce newer versions of the flight simulation software, adding features, such as new aircraft types and augmented scenery. The ''2000'' and ''2002'' versions were available in \"Standard\" and \"Professional\" editions, where the latter included more aircraft, tools and scenery options. The ''2004'' release (version 9) marked the celebration of one hundred years of powered flight and had only one edition. ''Flight Simulator X'', released in 2006, returned to dual versions with a \"Standard\" and a \"Deluxe\" edition.\n\nThe flying area encompasses planet Earth with varying degrees of detail and includes over 24,000 airports. There is an ever-growing list of scenery representing major landmarks and popular cities. Landscape details become sparse as gameplay moves away from population centers within the flight simulator, particularly outside the United States, although a variety of Web sites offer scenery add-ons to remedy this.\n\nThe three latest versions incorporate sophisticated weather simulation, along with the ability to download real-world weather data (first available with ''Flight Simulator 2000''). Additional features in these newer versions include air traffic environments with interactive [[air traffic control]] functions, new aircraft models from the historical [[Douglas DC-3]] to the modern [[Boeing 777]], interactive lessons, challenges, and aircraft checklists. The two latest versions of ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' have a \"kiosk mode\", which allows the application to be run in electronic [[kiosk software|kiosks]] located in public places like shopping malls. ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' has a wide selection of upgrades and add-ons, both free and commercial, official and fan-made.\n\n===''Microsoft Flight Simulator X''===\n{{Main|Microsoft Flight Simulator X}}\n\n''Microsoft Flight Simulator X'' is the most recent major release of ''Microsoft Flight Simulator''. It includes a graphics engine upgrade and compatibility with preview [[DirectX 10]] and [[Windows Vista]]. It was released on October 17, 2006, in North America. There are two versions of the game, both on two DVDs.  The \"Deluxe\" edition contains the new [[Garmin G1000]] integrated flight instrument system in three cockpits, additional aircraft, and missions; Tower Control capability in multiplayer mode; higher detail scenery for cities and airports; and a Software Development Kit (SDK) for development. The main improvements are graphical.\n\nMicrosoft has also released a ''Flight Simulator X'' demo, which contains three aircraft, two airports, and two missions. It is compatible with Windows XP SP2 and Windows Vista.\n\n===Closure of the Aces Game Studio===\n{{Seealso|Aces Game Studio}}\n\nOn January 22, 2009, it was reported that the development team was heavily affected by Microsoft's ongoing job cuts, with indications that the entire ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' team had been laid off.<ref name=msnews1>{{cite web | last = Remo| first = Chris| title = Report: Microsoft Makes Big Cuts At Flight Sim Studio| website = [[Gamasutra]]| date = 2009-01-22| url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21981| accessdate = 2009-01-22}}</ref><ref name=msnews2>{{cite news | last = Plunkett| first = Luke| title = Flight Simulator Devs Grounded By Microsoft Job Cuts| publisher = Kotaku| date = 2009-01-22| url = http://kotaku.com/5137519/flight-simulator-devs-grounded-by-microsoft-job-cuts| accessdate = 2009-01-22}}</ref>  Microsoft confirmed the closure of the [[Aces Game Studio]] on January 26, 2009, in a post on the official FSInsider Web site.<ref>{{cite web| title = About the Aces Team| publisher = FS Insider| date = 2009-01-26| url = http://www.microsoft.com/Products/Games/FSInsider/news/Pages/AMessageFromAces.aspx | accessdate = 2009-01-09}}</ref> stating ''\"This difficult decision was made to align Microsoft's resources with our strategic priorities.

Following the closure of the Aces Game Studio in January 2009, [[Lockheed Martin]] announced in late 2009 that they had negotiated with Microsoft a licensing agreement to purchase the intellectual property (including source code) for the Microsoft ESP product. It is the commercial-use version of ''Flight Simulator X'' SP2.  On May 17, 2010,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2010/05172010Prepar3d.html |title=Lockheed Martin Announces Prepar3D |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713125615/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2010/05172010Prepar3d.html |archivedate=2010-07-13 }}</ref> Lockheed announced that the new product based upon the ESP source code would be called '''''Prepar3D''''' (P3D). Lockheed hired members of the original Aces Game Studio team to continue development of the product.\n\nIn November 2010, Lockheed Martin debuted ''Prepar3D'' version 1.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.prepar3d.com/product-overview/ |title=Prepar3D Product Overview |website=Lockheed Martin - Prepar3D |access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> Version 1.1 was released in April 2011, with a retail license cost of US$499.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prepar3d.com/ |title=Prepar3D website |publisher=Prepar3d.com |date= |accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref> A developer license is also available for a monthly fee of US$9.95. In March 2012, along with the release of version 1.3, the pricing strategy was revised. The Professional edition is now available for US$199, with an Academic License available for US$59.95.\n\nAfter releasing version 2 in 2013 and version 3 in 2015, the team released 64-bit version 4 in May 2017.\n\n====Dovetail Games====\n\n=====''Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition''=====\nOn July 9, 2014, [[Dovetail Games]] announced that Microsoft had granted them rights to develop the next ''Flight Simulator'' in the series. Dovetail Games also announced the release of ''Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition'' on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] for late 2014, titled ''Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition''. It was released on December 18, 2014. It is a re-release and includes content that was provided with the original ''FSX: Gold Edition'' which includes ''FSX: Deluxe Edition'', the ''Acceleration'' expansion pack, and both official Service Packs and repackages them in one bundle and a single installation. The ''Steam Edition'' includes \"all standard Steam functionality\", including an overhaul of the multiplayer support to go through Steam rather than the now-defunct [[GameSpy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsxinsider.com/faqs/ |title=FSX Insider FAQs |publisher=FSX Insider |date=2014-12-18 |accessdate=2014-12-18}}</ref> improved stability on [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows 8|8]], and features minor performance tweaks including a complete recompile using [[Microsoft Visual Studio#Visual Studio 2013|VS2013]].<ref name=\"steamcommunity.com\">{{cite web|title=Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition Change Log |url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/314160/discussions/1/626329820729615790/|website=Steam Community|author=Dovetail Games|date=18 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Dovetail Games has worked with existing developers and publishers to distribute their content on Steam as DLC.

While claiming to be simpler to use for inexperienced users, it is incompatible with ''Flight Simulator'' and does not allow the use of existing ''Flight Simulator'' add-ons (including aircraft, objects, and photographic scenery). On July 26, 2012, Microsoft cancelled further development of ''Flight''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/microsoft-cancels-flight-and-project-columbia-development-26240324/ |title=Microsoft cancels Flight and Project Columbia development |publisher=SlashGear |date= |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' (2020 reboot)===\n{{Main|Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020 video game)}}\nOn June 9, 2019, Microsoft revealed that they will be bringing back the ''Flight Simulator'' series with an updated release, simply titled ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020 video game)|Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'', as part of their E3 conference and with a teaser video on their Xbox YouTube channel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReDDgFfWlS4 |title=Microsoft Flight Simulator - E3 2019 - Announce Trailer |date=9 June 2019 |work=[[Xbox]] |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=9 June 2019}}</ref> On the same day, Microsoft launched a new website for the title and opened registration for a public alpha and early forum access for members of the Xbox Insider Program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fsi.microsoftstudios.com/insider-program-faq/ |title=Insider Program Faq |accessdate=9 June 2019}}</ref> The new version features tight integration of ground satellite data and Microsoft's own Azure AI into the simulator's engine to generate near photorealistic graphics.\n\nThis is Microsoft's first simulator since ''Flight Simulator X'' in 2006 and ''Microsoft Flight'' in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/e3-microsoft-flight-simulator-coming-to-pc/|title=E3: Microsoft Flight Simulator coming to PC|last=Keane|first=Sean|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref> This will also be the first of the ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' series to not be PC exclusive, as this installment is also launching on the Xbox One.

A formal [[software development kit]] and other tools for the simulator exist to further facilitate third-party efforts, and some third parties have also learned to 'tweak' the simulator in various ways by trial and error. As for number of add-ons, tweaks, and modifications ''Flight Simulator'' can accommodate solely depends on the user's hardware setup. The number is not limited by the simulator, and when multiple computers are linked together with multiple monitors and third party software and controls, ''Flight Simulator'' enthusiasts can build their own realistic home cockpits.\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[File:AFA Beech in Flight Simulator.jpg|thumb|A PMDG [[Beechcraft 1900|Beech 1900D]] of \"American Flight Airways\"; in AFA Express colors]]\nIndividual attributes of ''Flight Simulator'' aircraft that can be customized include: cockpit layout, cockpit image, aircraft model, aircraft model textures, aircraft flight characteristics, scenery models, scenery layouts, and scenery textures, often with simple-to-use programs, or only a text editor such as 'Notepad'. Dedicated 'flightsimmers' have taken advantage of ''Flight Simulator's'' vast add-on capabilities, having successfully linked ''Flight Simulator'' to homebuilt hardware, some of which approaches the complexity of commercial full-motion flight simulators.\n\nThe simulator's aircraft are made up of five parts:\n\n* The '''model''', which is a 3D CAD-style model of the aircraft's exterior and virtual cockpit, if applicable. Models consist of two distinct sections - the main chassis or \"core\", and accessories or dynamic parts, such as the landing gear or ailerons.\n* The '''textures''', bitmap images which the game layers onto the model. These can be easily edited (known as ''repainting''), so that a model can adopt any paint scheme imaginable, real or fictional.\n* The '''sounds''', literally what the aircraft sounds like. This is determined by defining which WAV files the aircraft uses as its sound-set.\n* The '''panel''', a representation of the aircraft's cockpit. This includes one or more bitmap images of the panel, instrument gauge files, and sometimes its own sounds.\n* The '''FDE''', or ''Flight Dynamics Engine''. This consists of the '''airfile''' (a *.air file), which contains hundreds of parameters that define the aircraft's flight characteristics, and the '''aircraft.cfg''' file, which contains more and easier-to-edit parameters.\n\nMost versions of ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' include some of the world's most popular aircraft from different categories, such as the Mooney Bravo and Beechcraft Baron 58, which fall into the general aviation category; the Airbus A321 and Boeing 737, which fall into the civil jets category; the Robinson R22, which falls into the helicopter category; the Air Scheffel 738, which falls into the general aviation category again; and many other planes commonly used around the world.\n\nNot being limited to using the default aircraft, add-on planes can be downloaded from many sources for free or purchased, which can then be installed into ''Microsoft Flight Simulator''. The Beechcraft 1900D pictured above, is an add-on aircraft. Similarly, add-on repaints can be added to default aircraft; these repaints are usually downloaded for free.\n\n====AI traffic====\nA growing add-on category for the series is AI ([[artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]]) traffic. AI traffic is the simulation of other vehicles in the ''FS'' landscape. This traffic plays an important role in the simulator, as it is possible to crash into traffic (this can be disabled), thus ending your session, and to interact with the traffic via the radio and ATC. This feature is active even with third-party traffic. Microsoft introduced AI traffic in MSFS 2002 with several airliners and private aircraft. This has since been supplemented with many files created by third-party developers. Typically, third-party aircraft models have multiple levels of detail, which allow the AI traffic to be better on frame rates, while still being detailed during close looks. There are several prominent freeware developers.  Some third-party AI traffic can even be configured for \"real time\" departures.\n\n===Scenery===\n[[File:FS2004-lakes.jpg|thumb|''FS2004'' in the UK [[Lake District]] with VFR ([[visual flight rules]]) photo scenery and terrain additional components]]\nScenery add-ons usually involve replacements for existing airports, with enhanced and more accurate detail, or large expanses of highly detailed ground scenery for specific regions of the world.  Some types of scenery add-on replace or add structures to the simulator.  Both freeware and payware scenery add-ons are very widely available.  Airport enhancements, for example, range from simple add-ons that update runways or taxiways to very elaborate packages that reproduce every lamp, pavement marking, and structure at an airport with near-total accuracy, including animated effects such as baggage cars or marshalling agents.  Wide-area scenery enhancements may use detailed satellite photos and 3-D structures to closely reproduce real-world regions, particularly those including large cities, landmarks, or spectacular natural wonders.\n\n===Flight networks===\nVirtual flight networks such as [[International Virtual Aviation Organisation|IVAO]], [[Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network|VATSIM]], and [[Pilot Edge]] as well as [[VSN.aero|Virtual Skies]], and Mindstar Aviation's AirspaceVR <ref>https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2015/april/09/mindstar</ref>use special, small add-on modules for ''Flight Simulator'' to enable connection to their proprietary networks in multiplayer mode, and to allow for voice and text communication with other virtual pilots and controllers over the network. These networks allow players to enjoy and enhance realism in their game. These networks are for ATC (air traffic control).\n\n===Miscellanea===\nSome utilities, such as FSUIPC, merely provide useful tweaks for the simulator to overcome design limitations or bugs, or to allow more extensive interfacing with other third-party add-ons.  Sometimes certain add-ons require other utility add-ons in order to work correctly with the simulator.\n\nOther add-ons provide navigation tools, simulation of passengers, and cameras that can view aircraft or scenery from any angle, more realistic instrument panels and gauges, and so on.\n\nSome software add-ons provide operability with specific hardware, such as game controllers and optical motion sensors.\n\n[[FSDeveloper.com]] is one website that host a forum style knowledge base aimed at the development of add-on items, tools, and software.\n\n===Availability===\nA number of websites are dedicated to providing users with add-on files (such as airplanes from actual airlines, airport utility cars, actual buildings located in specific cities, textures, and city files). The wide availability over the internet of freeware add-on files for the simulation package has encouraged the development of a large and diverse virtual community, linked up by design group and enthusiast message boards, online multiplayer flying, and '[[virtual airline (hobby)|virtual airlines]]'. The internet has also facilitated the distribution of 'payware' add-ons for the simulator, with the option of downloading the files, which reduces distribution costs.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[PC Magazine]]'' in January 1983 called ''Flight Simulator'' \"extraordinarily realistic ... a classic program, unique in the market\". It praised the graphics and detailed scenery, and concluded \"I think it's going to [[killer app|sell its share of IBM PCs]], and will certainly sell some [[Color Graphics Adapter|color/graphics adapters]]\".<ref name=\"fastie198301\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vy3cBZkjbZgC&lpg=PP1&pg=RA2-PA303#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Flight Of The 5150: The PC Takes Off | work=PC Magazine | date=January 1983 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Fastie, Will | page=303}}</ref> ''[[BYTE]]'' in December 1983 wrote that \"this amazing package does an incredible job of making you think you're actually flying a small plane\".

His company, [[subLOGIC|subLOGIC Corporation]], initially distributed it for various personal computers.<ref name=msnews5/> In 1981, Artwick was approached by Microsoft's [[Alan M. Boyd]] who was interested in creating a \"definitive game\" that would graphically demonstrate the difference between older 8-bit computers, such as the Apple II, and the new 16-bit computers, such as the IBM PC, still in development. In 1982, Artwick's company licensed a version of ''Flight Simulator'' for the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] to Microsoft, which marketed it as ''Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.00''.\n\nIn 2009, Microsoft [[#Closure of the ACES Game Studio|closed down]] [[Aces Game Studio]], which was the department responsible for creating and maintaining the ''Flight Simulator'' series. In 2014, [[Dovetail Games]] were granted the rights by Microsoft to port the Gold Edition of Microsoft's ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator X|Flight Simulator X]]'' to [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and publish ''Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition''.\n\nMicrosoft announced a new installment at E3 in 2019, simply titled ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020 video game)|Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'', to be released initially on PC and ported over to the Xbox at a later date.<ref>https://kotaku.com/new-microsoft-flight-simulator-looks-uncannily-like-rea-1835359010</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Microsoft Flight Simulator}}\n{{Timeline of release years\n| title = \n| 1982 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0|Flight Simulator 1.0]]''\n| 1984 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2.0|Flight Simulator 2.0]]''\n| 1988 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0|Flight Simulator 3.0]]''\n| 1989 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 4.0|Flight Simulator 4.0]]''\n| 1993 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.0|Flight Simulator 5.0]]''\n| 1995 = ''[[History of Microsoft Flight Simulator#Flight Simulator 5.1|Flight Simulator 5.1]]''\n| 1996 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator '95|Flight Simulator 95]]''\n| 1997 = ''[[Flight Simulator 98]]''\n| 1999 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000|Flight Simulator 2000]]''\n| 2001 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002|Flight Simulator 2002]]''\n| 2003 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight|Flight Simulator 2004]]''\n| 2006 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator X|Flight Simulator X]]''\n| 2014 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator X#Steam Edition|Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition]]''\n| 2020 = ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020 video game)|Flight Simulator]]''\n<!-- MS Flight is a separate product, please do not include it in the timeline -->\n}}\n\n''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' began as a set of articles written by [[Bruce Artwick]] in 1976 about a [[3D computer graphics]] program. When the magazine editor said that subscribers wanted to buy the program, Artwick set to work to create it and incorporated a company called [[subLOGIC]] Corporation in 1977.  The company began selling flight simulators for several computer platforms, including the [[Intel 8080|8080]], [[Altair 8800]], and [[IMSAI 8080]]. In 1979 subLOGIC released ''FS1 Flight Simulator'' for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]]. In 1980, subLOGIC released a version for the [[TRS-80]], and in 1982 they licensed an [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] version with [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] graphics to Microsoft, which was released as ''Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.00''. It was unusual in that it was not an [[Application software|application program]] requiring an [[operating system]], but contained its own operating system, which displaced the installed one as long as the program was running. In the early days of less-than-100% [[IBM PC compatible]] systems, ''Flight Simulator'' and [[Lotus 1-2-3]] were used as unofficial compatibility test software for new PC clone models.<ref name=\"runway-usa\">{{cite book|last=Gulick|first=Charles|title=Runway U.S.A.|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|year=1987|isbn=978-1-55615-002-9|url=http://www.flightsimbooks.com/runwayusa/foreword.php|accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref>\n\nsubLOGIC continued to develop for other platforms and ported ''[[Flight Simulator II (subLOGIC)|Flight Simulator II]]'' to the Apple II in 1983; the [[Commodore 64]], [[MSX]], and [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]] in 1984; and to the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] in 1986. Meanwhile, Bruce Artwick left subLOGIC and founded [[The Bruce Artwick Organization Ltd.|The Bruce Artwick Organization]] to continue his work on subsequent Microsoft releases, beginning with ''Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0'' in 1988. ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' reached commercial maturity with version 3.1, and went on to encompass the use of 3D graphics and graphic hardware acceleration.\n\n[[Microsoft]] continued to produce newer versions of the flight simulation software, adding features, such as new aircraft types and augmented scenery. The ''2000'' and ''2002'' versions were available in \"Standard\" and \"Professional\" editions, where the latter included more aircraft, tools and scenery options. The ''2004'' release (version 9) marked the celebration of one hundred years of powered flight and had only one edition. ''Flight Simulator X'', released in 2006, returned to dual versions with a \"Standard\" and a \"Deluxe\" edition.\n\nThe flying area encompasses planet Earth with varying degrees of detail and includes over 24,000 airports. There is an ever-growing list of scenery representing major landmarks and popular cities. Landscape details become sparse as gameplay moves away from population centers within the flight simulator, particularly outside the United States, although a variety of Web sites offer scenery add-ons to remedy this.\n\nThe three latest versions incorporate sophisticated weather simulation, along with the ability to download real-world weather data (first available with ''Flight Simulator 2000''). Additional features in these newer versions include air traffic environments with interactive [[air traffic control]] functions, new aircraft models from the historical [[Douglas DC-3]] to the modern [[Boeing 777]], interactive lessons, challenges, and aircraft checklists. The two latest versions of ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' have a \"kiosk mode\", which allows the application to be run in electronic [[kiosk software|kiosks]] located in public places like shopping malls. ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' has a wide selection of upgrades and add-ons, both free and commercial, official and fan-made.\n\n===''Microsoft Flight Simulator X''===\n{{Main|Microsoft Flight Simulator X}}\n\n''Microsoft Flight Simulator X'' is the most recent major release of ''Microsoft Flight Simulator''. It includes a graphics engine upgrade and compatibility with preview [[DirectX 10]] and [[Windows Vista]]. It was released on October 17, 2006, in North America. There are two versions of the game, both on two DVDs.  The \"Deluxe\" edition contains the new [[Garmin G1000]] integrated flight instrument system in three cockpits, additional aircraft, and missions; Tower Control capability in multiplayer mode; higher detail scenery for cities and airports; and a Software Development Kit (SDK) for development. The main improvements are graphical.\n\nMicrosoft has also released a ''Flight Simulator X'' demo, which contains three aircraft, two airports, and two missions. It is compatible with Windows XP SP2 and Windows Vista.\n\n===Closure of the Aces Game Studio===\n{{Seealso|Aces Game Studio}}\n\nOn January 22, 2009, it was reported that the development team was heavily affected by Microsoft's ongoing job cuts, with indications that the entire ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' team had been laid off.<ref name=msnews1>{{cite web | last = Remo| first = Chris| title = Report: Microsoft Makes Big Cuts At Flight Sim Studio| website = [[Gamasutra]]| date = 2009-01-22| url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21981| accessdate = 2009-01-22}}</ref><ref name=msnews2>{{cite news | last = Plunkett| first = Luke| title = Flight Simulator Devs Grounded By Microsoft Job Cuts| publisher = Kotaku| date = 2009-01-22| url = http://kotaku.com/5137519/flight-simulator-devs-grounded-by-microsoft-job-cuts| accessdate = 2009-01-22}}</ref>  Microsoft confirmed the closure of the [[Aces Game Studio]] on January 26, 2009, in a post on the official FSInsider Web site.<ref>{{cite web| title = About the Aces Team| publisher = FS Insider| date = 2009-01-26| url = http://www.microsoft.com/Products/Games/FSInsider/news/Pages/AMessageFromAces.aspx | accessdate = 2009-01-09}}</ref> stating ''\"This difficult decision was made to align Microsoft's resources with our strategic priorities.

A formal [[software development kit]] and other tools for the simulator exist to further facilitate third-party efforts, and some third parties have also learned to 'tweak' the simulator in various ways by trial and error. As for number of add-ons, tweaks, and modifications ''Flight Simulator'' can accommodate solely depends on the user's hardware setup. The number is not limited by the simulator, and when multiple computers are linked together with multiple monitors and third party software and controls, ''Flight Simulator'' enthusiasts can build their own realistic home cockpits.\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[File:AFA Beech in Flight Simulator.jpg|thumb|A PMDG [[Beechcraft 1900|Beech 1900D]] of \"American Flight Airways\"; in AFA Express colors]]\nIndividual attributes of ''Flight Simulator'' aircraft that can be customized include: cockpit layout, cockpit image, aircraft model, aircraft model textures, aircraft flight characteristics, scenery models, scenery layouts, and scenery textures, often with simple-to-use programs, or only a text editor such as 'Notepad'. Dedicated 'flightsimmers' have taken advantage of ''Flight Simulator's'' vast add-on capabilities, having successfully linked ''Flight Simulator'' to homebuilt hardware, some of which approaches the complexity of commercial full-motion flight simulators.\n\nThe simulator's aircraft are made up of five parts:\n\n* The '''model''', which is a 3D CAD-style model of the aircraft's exterior and virtual cockpit, if applicable. Models consist of two distinct sections - the main chassis or \"core\", and accessories or dynamic parts, such as the landing gear or ailerons.\n* The '''textures''', bitmap images which the game layers onto the model. These can be easily edited (known as ''repainting''), so that a model can adopt any paint scheme imaginable, real or fictional.\n* The '''sounds''', literally what the aircraft sounds like. This is determined by defining which WAV files the aircraft uses as its sound-set.\n* The '''panel''', a representation of the aircraft's cockpit. This includes one or more bitmap images of the panel, instrument gauge files, and sometimes its own sounds.\n* The '''FDE''', or ''Flight Dynamics Engine''. This consists of the '''airfile''' (a *.air file), which contains hundreds of parameters that define the aircraft's flight characteristics, and the '''aircraft.cfg''' file, which contains more and easier-to-edit parameters.\n\nMost versions of ''Microsoft Flight Simulator'' include some of the world's most popular aircraft from different categories, such as the Mooney Bravo and Beechcraft Baron 58, which fall into the general aviation category; the Airbus A321 and Boeing 737, which fall into the civil jets category; the Robinson R22, which falls into the helicopter category; the Air Scheffel 738, which falls into the general aviation category again; and many other planes commonly used around the world.\n\nNot being limited to using the default aircraft, add-on planes can be downloaded from many sources for free or purchased, which can then be installed into ''Microsoft Flight Simulator''. The Beechcraft 1900D pictured above, is an add-on aircraft. Similarly, add-on repaints can be added to default aircraft; these repaints are usually downloaded for free.\n\n====AI traffic====\nA growing add-on category for the series is AI ([[artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]]) traffic. AI traffic is the simulation of other vehicles in the ''FS'' landscape. This traffic plays an important role in the simulator, as it is possible to crash into traffic (this can be disabled), thus ending your session, and to interact with the traffic via the radio and ATC. This feature is active even with third-party traffic. Microsoft introduced AI traffic in MSFS 2002 with several airliners and private aircraft. This has since been supplemented with many files created by third-party developers. Typically, third-party aircraft models have multiple levels of detail, which allow the AI traffic to be better on frame rates, while still being detailed during close looks. There are several prominent freeware developers.  Some third-party AI traffic can even be configured for \"real time\" departures.\n\n===Scenery===\n[[File:FS2004-lakes.jpg|thumb|''FS2004'' in the UK [[Lake District]] with VFR ([[visual flight rules]]) photo scenery and terrain additional components]]\nScenery add-ons usually involve replacements for existing airports, with enhanced and more accurate detail, or large expanses of highly detailed ground scenery for specific regions of the world.  Some types of scenery add-on replace or add structures to the simulator.  Both freeware and payware scenery add-ons are very widely available.  Airport enhancements, for example, range from simple add-ons that update runways or taxiways to very elaborate packages that reproduce every lamp, pavement marking, and structure at an airport with near-total accuracy, including animated effects such as baggage cars or marshalling agents.  Wide-area scenery enhancements may use detailed satellite photos and 3-D structures to closely reproduce real-world regions, particularly those including large cities, landmarks, or spectacular natural wonders.\n\n===Flight networks===\nVirtual flight networks such as [[International Virtual Aviation Organisation|IVAO]], [[Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network|VATSIM]], and [[Pilot Edge]] as well as [[VSN.aero|Virtual Skies]], and Mindstar Aviation's AirspaceVR <ref>https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2015/april/09/mindstar</ref>use special, small add-on modules for ''Flight Simulator'' to enable connection to their proprietary networks in multiplayer mode, and to allow for voice and text communication with other virtual pilots and controllers over the network. These networks allow players to enjoy and enhance realism in their game. These networks are for ATC (air traffic control).\n\n===Miscellanea===\nSome utilities, such as FSUIPC, merely provide useful tweaks for the simulator to overcome design limitations or bugs, or to allow more extensive interfacing with other third-party add-ons.  Sometimes certain add-ons require other utility add-ons in order to work correctly with the simulator.\n\nOther add-ons provide navigation tools, simulation of passengers, and cameras that can view aircraft or scenery from any angle, more realistic instrument panels and gauges, and so on.\n\nSome software add-ons provide operability with specific hardware, such as game controllers and optical motion sensors.\n\n[[FSDeveloper.com]] is one website that host a forum style knowledge base aimed at the development of add-on items, tools, and software.\n\n===Availability===\nA number of websites are dedicated to providing users with add-on files (such as airplanes from actual airlines, airport utility cars, actual buildings located in specific cities, textures, and city files). The wide availability over the internet of freeware add-on files for the simulation package has encouraged the development of a large and diverse virtual community, linked up by design group and enthusiast message boards, online multiplayer flying, and '[[virtual airline (hobby)|virtual airlines]]'. The internet has also facilitated the distribution of 'payware' add-ons for the simulator, with the option of downloading the files, which reduces distribution costs.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[PC Magazine]]'' in January 1983 called ''Flight Simulator'' \"extraordinarily realistic ... a classic program, unique in the market\". It praised the graphics and detailed scenery, and concluded \"I think it's going to [[killer app|sell its share of IBM PCs]], and will certainly sell some [[Color Graphics Adapter|color/graphics adapters]]\".<ref name=\"fastie198301\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vy3cBZkjbZgC&lpg=PP1&pg=RA2-PA303#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Flight Of The 5150: The PC Takes Off | work=PC Magazine | date=January 1983 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Fastie, Will | page=303}}</ref> ''[[BYTE]]'' in December 1983 wrote that \"this amazing package does an incredible job of making you think you're actually flying a small plane\".

In the United States he also became active in the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] and other social justice campaigns. His sympathies for the [[Soviet Union]] and for [[communism]], and his criticism of the United States government and its foreign policies, caused him to be [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]].\n\nIn 1915, Robeson won an academic scholarship to Rutgers College, where he was twice named a consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] in football, and was the class valedictorian. Almost 80 years later, he was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]. He received his LL.B. from Columbia Law School while playing in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). At Columbia, he sang and acted in off-campus productions. After graduating, he became a figure in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] with performances in ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'' and ''[[All God's Chillun Got Wings (play)|All God's Chillun Got Wings]]''.\n\nBetween 1925 and 1961, Robeson recorded and released some 276 distinct songs, many of which were recorded several times. The first of these were the [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] \"[[Steal Away]]\" backed with \"[[Were You There]]\" in 1925. Robeson's recorded repertoire spanned many styles, including Americana, popular standards, classical music, European folk songs, political songs, poetry and spoken excerpts from plays.<ref>[http://www.cpsr.cs.uchicago.edu/robeson/links/discography.html \"Resources About Paul Robeson (1898\u20131976)\"], Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration. Retrieved June 12, 2017.</ref>\n\nRobeson performed in Britain in a touring melodrama, ''Voodoo'', in 1922, and in ''Emperor Jones'' in 1925, and scored a major success in the London premiere of ''[[Show Boat]]'' in 1928, settling in London for several years with his wife [[Eslanda Goode Robeson|Eslanda]]. While continuing to establish himself as a concert artist, Robeson also starred in a London production of ''[[Othello]]'', the first of three productions of the play over the course of his career. He also gained attention in the film production of ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1936) and other films such as ''[[Sanders of the River]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Proud Valley]]'' (1940). During this period, Robeson became increasingly attuned to the sufferings of people of other cultures, notably the British working class and the colonized peoples of the British Empire. He advocated for Republican forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and became active in the [[Council on African Affairs]] (CAA).\n\nReturning to the United States in 1939, during World War II Robeson supported the American and Allied war efforts. However, his history of supporting civil rights causes and pro-Soviet policies brought scrutiny from the [[FBI]]. After the war ended, the CAA was placed on the [[Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations]] and Robeson was investigated during the age of [[McCarthyism]]. Due to his decision not to recant his public advocacy, he was denied a passport by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], and his income, consequently, plummeted. He moved to [[Harlem]] and from 1950 to 1955 published a periodical called ''Freedom'' which was critical of United States policies. His right to travel was eventually restored as a result of the 1958 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Kent v. Dulles]]''. In the early 1960s he retired and lived the remaining years of his life privately in Philadelphia.\n\n{{Infobox NFL biography\n|name=\n|image=PRobeson.jpg\n|image_size=200px\n|caption=Robeson in football uniform at Rutgers, c. 1919\n|number=21, 17\n|position=[[End (American football)|End]] / [[Tackle (American football)|tackle]]\n|height_ft=6\n|height_in=3\n|weight_lbs=219\n|high_school=[[Somerville High School (New Jersey)|Somerville (NJ)]]\n|college=[[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]]\n|teams=\n* [[Akron Pros]] ({{NFL Year|1921}})\n* [[Milwaukee Badgers]] ({{NFL Year|1922}})\n|highlights=\n* 2\u00d7 Consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] ([[1917 College Football All-America Team|1917]], [[1918 College Football All-America Team|1918]])\n|statlabel1=Games played\n|statvalue1=15\n|statlabel2=Games started\n|statvalue2=15\n|statlabel3=[[Touchdowns]]\n|statvalue3=2<ref>{{cite news|title=Thorpe\u2013M'Millan Fight Great Duel: Robeson Scores Both Touchdowns for Locals Against Indians|date=November 20, 1922|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gP5PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vgoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6937%2C3801262|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Sentinel]]|page=7}}; cf.

both for his cultural accomplishments and for his political activism. Educated at [[Rutgers University|Rutgers College]] and [[Columbia University]], he was also a star athlete in his youth. He also studied [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]], London in 1934.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem92596.html|title=Paul Robeson SOAS tribute with the late Tony Benn now available on YouTube {{!}} SOAS University of London|website=www.soas.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref> His political activities began with his involvement with unemployed workers and anti-imperialist students whom he met in Britain and continued with support for the Loyalist cause in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and his opposition to [[fascism]]. In the United States he also became active in the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] and other social justice campaigns. His sympathies for the [[Soviet Union]] and for [[communism]], and his criticism of the United States government and its foreign policies, caused him to be [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]].\n\nIn 1915, Robeson won an academic scholarship to Rutgers College, where he was twice named a consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] in football, and was the class valedictorian. Almost 80 years later, he was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]. He received his LL.B. from Columbia Law School while playing in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). At Columbia, he sang and acted in off-campus productions. After graduating, he became a figure in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] with performances in ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'' and ''[[All God's Chillun Got Wings (play)|All God's Chillun Got Wings]]''.\n\nBetween 1925 and 1961, Robeson recorded and released some 276 distinct songs, many of which were recorded several times. The first of these were the [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] \"[[Steal Away]]\" backed with \"[[Were You There]]\" in 1925. Robeson's recorded repertoire spanned many styles, including Americana, popular standards, classical music, European folk songs, political songs, poetry and spoken excerpts from plays.<ref>[http://www.cpsr.cs.uchicago.edu/robeson/links/discography.html \"Resources About Paul Robeson (1898\u20131976)\"], Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration. Retrieved June 12, 2017.</ref>\n\nRobeson performed in Britain in a touring melodrama, ''Voodoo'', in 1922, and in ''Emperor Jones'' in 1925, and scored a major success in the London premiere of ''[[Show Boat]]'' in 1928, settling in London for several years with his wife [[Eslanda Goode Robeson|Eslanda]]. While continuing to establish himself as a concert artist, Robeson also starred in a London production of ''[[Othello]]'', the first of three productions of the play over the course of his career. He also gained attention in the film production of ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1936) and other films such as ''[[Sanders of the River]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Proud Valley]]'' (1940). During this period, Robeson became increasingly attuned to the sufferings of people of other cultures, notably the British working class and the colonized peoples of the British Empire. He advocated for Republican forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and became active in the [[Council on African Affairs]] (CAA).\n\nReturning to the United States in 1939, during World War II Robeson supported the American and Allied war efforts. However, his history of supporting civil rights causes and pro-Soviet policies brought scrutiny from the [[FBI]]. After the war ended, the CAA was placed on the [[Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations]] and Robeson was investigated during the age of [[McCarthyism]]. Due to his decision not to recant his public advocacy, he was denied a passport by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], and his income, consequently, plummeted. He moved to [[Harlem]] and from 1950 to 1955 published a periodical called ''Freedom'' which was critical of United States policies.

The series had one season with 26 episodes.\n\n==Synopsis==\nGeorge Martin lives in a regular neighbourhood with his family and applies for a job in the apparently [[Monopoly|monopolistic]] company, Krach Industries. Although they do not intend to hire him, his application is accidentally blown by the wind to the heap of selected candidates. This leads to George being hired as director of a secret [[orbital station]] (Operation SOS) housing sub-development, where he and his family have to live as an experiment started by Krach. When the Martins arrive at the station, they meet other people who have also been sent by Krach to live there. To their surprise, their neighbour and teacher who taught the Martins' kids on [[Earth]] is also on the station with her son. Later, they save a [[Russia]]n [[cosmonaut]] who decides to live with them. And so, they continue living on the space station, occasionally having personal disputes, meeting aliens and being monopolised by Krach.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Mark Camacho]] as George Martin, director of the space station. He is in charge of running the station and changing it from night to day. He denies the existence of extraterrestrial life, and even when there's proof in front of him, he's always skeptical and holds by his theory. Even when they took over the station on his birthday, he only believes Monica hired a bunch of actors to give him a sort of role-playing adventure as a present.\n* [[Ellen David]] as Monica Martin, George's wife who loves order in her house. She also believes in aliens.\n* [[Eleanor Noble]] as Betty Martin, George's teenage daughter and a manic depressive. She likes music and seems to only enjoy catching up with friends which she has been completely deprived of upon arriving in the station. She's hinted to be very intelligent and sometimes shows rare compassion to her family.\n* [[Daniel Brochu]] as Benjamin Martin, George's plump son and a cosmic super-hero fanatic. He is also fond of computers and technology. He shows a more rebellious side of him when he got sent to prison on the station once for stealing a comic his parents promised to buy him for his birthday, even if he did regret it.\n* [[Sonja Ball]] as Gran, George's mother and the Martin kids' grandmother. Monica and her have an antagonistic relationship and she is a fitness fanatic.\n* [[Rick Jones (voice actor)|Rick Jones]] as Fax and Goodgrief, the Martin kids' dog and cat, they almost always end up talking about the events that happened during the episode at the end of it, it is also hinted they may be aliens themselves; and Guy, Dumped by Krach to live on the station. He does all the work except those done by George. It is hinted most of the time that he's either a clone or a brainwashed individual sent to the station by Krach as a prototype for the \"perfect multi-functional worker\".\n* [[Susan Glover]] as Mrs. Schuman, the Martin children's neighbour and teacher back on Earth and on the station.\n* [[Ricky Mabe]] as Bobby Schuman, Mrs. Schuman's son. Although he keeps a friendly facade in front of the adults, he shows a very sadistic and manipulative side when he's with the other kids and sometimes his mother. As shown when he discreetly bullies Benjamin on earth. Relations with him and Benjamin have greatly improved since he was almost abducted on the station.\n* [[Bruce Dinsmore]] as Boris Malakoff, a Russian/Soviet cosmonaut who decides to live on the station after crashing there. He becomes the new pilot of the Earth station shuttle. Boris is the only member of the principal cast who does not appear in all episodes, being introduced in episode 2.\n\n==Episodes==\n''Note'': This list includes the original airdates of the Pan-European Cartoon Network.

Terror strikes in the Martin home: an alien has just entered the space lock!!  George forges ahead on a reconnaissance tour and discovers Boris who saves him from being sucked out into space.  The \"alien\" starts to meet the inhabitants of this station.  The only problem is that Krach Industries refuse to house a new inhabitant for free.  They kick him off with no further ado.  The Martins are wracked with guilt but Boris, a superbly trained professional, manages to survive and make his way back to the station. Will he wreak revenge?  No! Rather, he offers Krach Industries to become their new pilot of the Earth station shuttle free of charge!  Deal!  Boris can stay!\n|-\n|3 || Invasion || Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Henry ||  October 8, 2003 || 103\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Betty hears voices.  Nobody pays any attention as they are too busy trying to get rid of the cockroaches that have overrun the station.

It's a cockroach!  Betty persists nonetheless.  Love overcomes the war between the two clans.  Monica works out a truce.  The engagement ceremony is quite the event!

Benjamin saves him by starting up the automatic pilot.  That's when the problems start!  Boris had bought the wrong record for Betty, Benjamin is in admiration of Boris, \"the alien destroyer\" (alien which has hidden itself on the station) and George, jealous of their friendship, is irascible!  In Benjamin's eyes, Boris is a hero!  He can prove it too - with the flight video.  Only then do we discover that the alien is nothing more than a teensy weensy spider!  Benjamin is crushed!  Boris and George go together to excuse themselves; while the spider is mutating into a real monster, who immediately leaves the planet, record in hand.  That's what brought it here in the first place!\n|-\n|5 || George the Magnificent || Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Henry ||  October 13, 2003 || 105\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| As the Station Chief, George literally controls the skies.  The day he realizes this, thanks to Gran's prodding, he imposes his point of view and ends up believing that he is God!  There are those that are with him, those that are against him and the converted!  Official portraits, ceremonies in honor of her son, rigged-up magic tricks, Gran does everything she can to maintain faith and fear.  George's power is, after all, a little bit of her own.  Monica puts up with her husband's excesses until he closes the school down to punish Ms. Schuman.  It's their children who are suffering after all!  With the help of Boris and Guy, Monica heads up a commando maneuver against Gran and George the Magnificent goes back to being simply George Martin!\n|-\n|6 || I wanna go Home ||  Yves Coulon and B\u00e9atrice Marthouret ||  October 14, 2003 || 106\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Monica is bored.

George, with Benjamin's help, comes up with a thousand stratagems to keep his wife on the station.  One evening, George comes home to find that Monica has gone!  How is this possible?  The shuttle is in the garage!  Monica is living the close encounter of her dreams: encounters of the third kind that is!  For \"him\", she agrees to stay on the station for a few more years.

The next day, the theft is discovered.  George puts on his detective outfit and starts investigating.  Meanwhile, Bobby, armed with incriminating photos, is making Benjamin sing.

In the evening, when she gets home, there are still the children, dinner, etc. to take care of!  Nobody seems to notice all of her efforts.  Monica optimizes the station little by little though.  Everybody notices except for George, who is jealous.  Aliens are attracted to this harmonious environment and want to purify the station even further!  What a catastrophe!  Only Mrs. Schuman seems to be happy and she even prolongs George's lumbago with a secret starch potion!  When Monica realizes what is going on, she sends everybody off home with a dose ten times as strong of the same potion!\n|-\n|9 || The Robinsons || Marie-Christine and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lenoir || October 20, 2003 || 109\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| A new family has just moved onto the station, right next door to the Martins: the Robinsons!

He brings back a specimen to the station.  George's main worry is that the plant might be dangerous.  The vegetables are delicious though.  Noticing that there is a slump in their sales, Krach Industries come out to investigate.  Catastrophe!  Monica, Boris and the children have just left for the other planet where they meet the Garden Gnome gardener of the giant vegetable patch.  George tries to impersonate everybody but Krach Industries cannot be fooled.  They obtain the location of the abundant plant and confiscate it.  The Giant Garden Gnome is forced to expatriate himself but not before giving Monica the seeds of the forbidden fruit that she grows behind George's back!\n|-\n|11 || A Question of Time || {{TableTBA}} || October 22, 2003 || 111\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Bobby steals a remote control that Benjamin has just tinkered together.  It is capable of slowing down and even reversing the flow of time!  Very quickly, a few amusing experiments become dangerous events when Bobby, the pest, is at the controls of this powerful tool.  He makes himself a few years older and bullies not only Benjamin but also, Betty, Guy, even Mrs. Schuman \u2013 his own mother!  The station is no longer enough!  Bobby wants to control the world!  Monica no longer recognizes him, he's so old and she had always thought that he was such a nice boy!  Bobby is however, really ready to go to the Earth.  Cornered by Boris and George, the Martin children finally take care of Bobby themselves.  But the remote control has drifted off into space.\n|-\n|12 || The Thing || {{TableTBA}} || October 23, 2003 || 112\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| George has taken quite a liking to a sort of orange egg, the 'Thing'.  George is convinced that it's a cosmic being, not an extra terrestrial but a far removed ancestor!  When the egg hatches, Monica and the children are very surprised.  The thing babbles like a baby!  However, it develops much more quickly than a human being and as it grows, so does its paranoia.  Will George face up to the ugly truth about his adoptive son?  After a horrible battle, George is forced to disconnect his protege himself.  It was in fact an intelligent toy that Krach Industries had been \"testing\" before marketing it!\n|-\n|13 || The Unteachables || {{TableTBA}} ||  October 27, 2003 || 113\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| The Martin children have disastrous grades.  Doubtful of Mrs. Schuman's methods, Monica opens her own school.  Playing up to her emotional side to the hilt, Betty, Benjamin and Bobby raise the stakes higher and higher.  The get classes about television; on how to take naps; finally, they manage to obtain no school at all!  All anarchy has broken loose!  Even more so that bio-ads (contagious publicity slogans) have polluted the station.  In fact, it's playing hooky that winds up getting the children back to school.  While dissecting a bio-ad, Benjamin persuades himself to do better in school and winds up infecting the other children with the same illness!\n|-\n|14 || All About Gran || {{TableTBA}} ||  October 28, 2003 || 114\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| This is where we find out that Gran has dentures, practices Kung-fu and rides scooters.  We learn all sorts of other stuff as well.  While George is preparing Springtime down to the smallest details (he's pollinating for cripes sakes!) he discovers a box that Gran had stashed away.  He glimpses the headlines of an article that convinces him that he is not her real son.  Gran's obstinate silence only confirms his worst fears.  After the failure of a commando mission to steal the box, George sees only one solution, going to Earth to look for his real mother.  Gran prevents him at the last minute from getting into a shuttle accident.  The situation as it stands forces her to tell him the truth.  George is a test-tube baby! The ultimate in in-vitro technology!  George keels over.  It takes all of Gran's skills to get George to come round: test tube babies are so fragile!\n|-\n|15 || Holiday Madness || {{TableTBA}} || October 29, 2003 || 115\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Using the feeble excuse of wanting to film the first family Christmas in space, Krach Industries exiles an employee onto the station.  Wanting to impress the film director, the inhabitants outdo each other in decoration, regional traditions, the works!  George even decides to set off fireworks.  The explosion however produces such a shock wave that a meteorite is deviated from its trajectory and aims itself directly at the station!  Panic on board!  George tries to remedy the situation.  The director takes off in his shuttle leaving the inhabitants to their dire fate.  In his rush to get away, he crashes into the meteorite and deviates it once again.  The station is saved.  After all the excitement and stress, the Martins really do deserve to meet Santa Claus!  And here he is with a sled filled to the brim with presents (all from Krach industries obviously!)  A true Christmas tale!\n|-\n|16 || Pigs in Space || {{TableTBA}} || October 30, 2003 || 116\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| How does one recycle space station trash?  Krach Industries hadn't thought of that did they?  They therefor, insist that George find the answer.  Each encourages George in his own way: reprimands, protests!  Will the Martins continue to be pigs in space?  An unknown and mysterious \"Robin Space\" refuses to allow this to happen.  He demands a clean station!  George has no choice in the matter, Robin is trailing him - even into his own bed!  George has got to change his position!  Robin Space is in fact no other than Benjamin, Betty, and Bobby who have formed an activist group.  With the trash, they build a huge message denouncing Krach Industries - a message that can be seen all the way from Earth.  There's a good chance that Krach Industries is going to get down to cleaning very soon!\n|-\n|17 || Desperately Seeking Schuman || {{TableTBA}} || November 3, 2003 || 117\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mrs. Schuman doesn't have a man in her life and this is a source of suffering.  To such an extent that Monica has decided that it is her mission in life to find one for her friend.  Mrs. Schuman's personal tragedy rapidly becomes a burlesque comedy when all of the station's inhabitants decide to help her out!

Although they do not intend to hire him, his application is accidentally blown by the wind to the heap of selected candidates. This leads to George being hired as director of a secret [[orbital station]] (Operation SOS) housing sub-development, where he and his family have to live as an experiment started by Krach. When the Martins arrive at the station, they meet other people who have also been sent by Krach to live there. To their surprise, their neighbour and teacher who taught the Martins' kids on [[Earth]] is also on the station with her son. Later, they save a [[Russia]]n [[cosmonaut]] who decides to live with them. And so, they continue living on the space station, occasionally having personal disputes, meeting aliens and being monopolised by Krach.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Mark Camacho]] as George Martin, director of the space station. He is in charge of running the station and changing it from night to day. He denies the existence of extraterrestrial life, and even when there's proof in front of him, he's always skeptical and holds by his theory.

She also believes in aliens.\n* [[Eleanor Noble]] as Betty Martin, George's teenage daughter and a manic depressive.

Monica and her have an antagonistic relationship and she is a fitness fanatic.\n* [[Rick Jones (voice actor)|Rick Jones]] as Fax and Goodgrief, the Martin kids' dog and cat, they almost always end up talking about the events that happened during the episode at the end of it, it is also hinted they may be aliens themselves; and Guy, Dumped by Krach to live on the station.

It is hinted most of the time that he's either a clone or a brainwashed individual sent to the station by Krach as a prototype for the \"perfect multi-functional worker\".\n* [[Susan Glover]] as Mrs. Schuman, the Martin children's neighbour and teacher back on Earth and on the station.\n* [[Ricky Mabe]] as Bobby Schuman, Mrs. Schuman's son.

After the failure of a commando mission to steal the box, George sees only one solution, going to Earth to look for his real mother.  Gran prevents him at the last minute from getting into a shuttle accident.  The situation as it stands forces her to tell him the truth.  George is a test-tube baby! The ultimate in in-vitro technology!  George keels over.

The director takes off in his shuttle leaving the inhabitants to their dire fate.  In his rush to get away, he crashes into the meteorite and deviates it once again.  The station is saved.

What would George have wanted under such circumstances?  George meanwhile has met his guardian angel, sent to accompany him through his \"transfer\" to Heaven.  George doesn't want to go!  Like a kid who refuses to go to bed, he invariably finds something that he needs to do, stealing those precious extra minutes.  Time enough to find a way to get back to life.\n|-\n|22 || Black Hole || Patrick Galliano || November 11, 2003 || 122\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Benjamin walks into a black hole and finds himself jettisoned onto an orbital space station where a family lives: the Martins.  What's changed, you asked?  Well these Martins don't have a son!  Being a stranger, Benjamin is faced with the prospect of being thrown to Big Buhbones, a dog six times bigger than Fax!\n|-\n|23 || Downsized || {{TableTBA}} || November 12, 2003 || 123\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Operation SOS (secret orbital station) is a success.  In order to make ever more profits, Krach Industries has decided to reduce the number of employees on the station.  The first to go is Guy!  George finds himself obliged to take over his duties along with his own!  Things get worse when George must also take over the responsibilities of his best friend, Boris.\n|-\n|24 || The Learning Machine || {{TableTBA}} || November 13, 2003 || 124\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| At school, Benjamin is coming up with straight A's.  Betty is suspicious of his new intellect. She discovers his secret: a black, rectangular stone that can increase knowledge while one sleeps: the philosopher's stone.  The children however ignore that this learning machine was brought there by a super-evolved dog to thank Fax for having conquered outer space!  The control box must be found for no one yet knows the side effects on the human brain.\n|-\n|25 || Hostile Takeover || {{TableTBA}} || November 17, 2003 || 125\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| The station has definitely never been so populated \u2013 if only the inhabitants were human!  Aliens have invaded, subjugated and annexed the Martin's platform thinking that it is really Earth!  George mustn't find out that they are really extra terrestrials: it could kill him!  As for the Aliens, they must never know that the real Earth is that blue planet over there!  The situation is critical but filled with misunderstandings and mayhem -  a regular alien comedy.\n|-\n|26 || Incubated || {{TableTBA}} || November 18, 2003 || 126\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| A fluorescent gelatinous substance has infiltrated the station.  It is looking for a prey, sneaks up.  Whoosh!  It has just streamed into Guy through his ears.  He first becomes cynical then noticeably nasty and mean!  But Guy has far too much self-control.  George on the other hand is an ideal victim!  Whoosh!  The gelatinous substance takes over George's brain and he becomes downright dangerous!!  Evil has crept onto the station.  How does one get rid of it now without harming George?  Monica and the others barricade themselves against the onslaught.\n|}\n==Broadcasting==\nthe series was broadcasted on [[Toon Disney]] in The United States from October 4, 2002 to September 17, 2003\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0882136}}\n*[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Other_Studios/C/Cookie_Jar_Entertainment/Spaced_Out/ BCDB page on the show]\n*[http://www.gaumontanimation.com/catalogues/spaced-out/ Official page at Gaumont Animation]\n\n{{Cartoon Network}}\n{{Cartoon Network co-productions}}\n\n[[Category:2001 French television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2005 French television series endings]]\n[[Category:2001 Canadian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2005 Canadian television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated space adventure television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated comic science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:Canadian children's animated space adventure television series]]\n[[Category:Canadian children's animated comic science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:Cartoon Network original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian comic science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:Canal+ original programming]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "broadcasted > broadcast", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_Out"}
