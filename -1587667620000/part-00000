(It is often referred to as \"Roman Catholic\", occasionally as \"Catholic High\", and most commonly as \"Roman\".) The \"Catholic Girls High School\" was founded in 1912. Mary McMichan, one of the school's founders, requested in her last will that the school be renamed in honor of her brother.  The school became \"John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School\" after her death. Both schools are still in existence.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1927 West Catholic Boys and Girls and Northeast Catholic were opened. Despite the economic hardships of the 1930s and 1940s, seven more diocesan high schools were founded.

As such, its presiding officer was called a \"provost\", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer [[Raymond B. Allen]] was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of [[Franklin David Murphy]] to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:\n\n<blockquote>\nI picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, \"University of California.\" And I said, \"Is this Berkeley?\" She said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, who have I gotten to?\" \"UCLA.\" I said, \"Why didn't you say UCLA?\" \"Oh\", she said, \"we're instructed to say University of California.\" So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, \"Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA.{{'\"}} And they said, \"You know they won't like it at Berkeley.\" And I said, \"Well, let's just see.

As such, its presiding officer was called a \"provost\", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer [[Raymond B. Allen]] was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of [[Franklin David Murphy]] to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:\n\n<blockquote>\nI picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, \"University of California.\" And I said, \"Is this Berkeley?\" She said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, who have I gotten to?\" \"UCLA.\" I said, \"Why didn't you say UCLA?\" \"Oh\", she said, \"we're instructed to say University of California.\" So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, \"Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA.{{'\"}} And they said, \"You know they won't like it at Berkeley.\" And I said, \"Well, let's just see.

In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The \"services and enterprises\" portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 staff and 2,000 student employees.\n\nThe Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 13,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |title=UCLA Graduate Student Association |publisher=Gsa.asucla.ucla.edu |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610183026/http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |archive-date=June 10, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC) is the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student.<ref name=usac>{{cite web |url=https://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/usac.php |title=UCLA Undergraduate Students Association |publisher=UCLA |accessdate=September 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720073752/http://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/usac.php |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  {{as of|2015}}, the student body had two major political slates: Bruins United and Let's Act.

All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the elected officers, minus the USAC President may vote.\n\nAlong with the council, the student government also includes a seven-member Judicial Board, which similar to the Supreme Court, serves as the judicial branch of government and reviews actions of the council. These seven students are appointed by the student body president and confirmed by the council.\n\nUSAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the [[UCLA Campus Events Commission|Campus Events Commission]], including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers.

She knows it's a relationship that her father, Don Bruno Flores Riquelme ([[Eric del Castillo]]), would never approve, but when he learns that Renata is in love with Pablo, he threatens to kill him, not knowing that Renata is already pregnant with Pablo's daughter. Bruno banishes Renata and Macaria Rios ([[Alejandra Garc\u00eda (actress)|Alejandra Garc\u00eda]]), the [[servant]], to Real de San Andres, ([[San Miguel de Allende]]), the [[Guanajuato]] capital, to have the baby there. By the management of Fausto Lopez Guerra ([[Sergio Goyri]]), little Abigail ([[Zuria Vega]]) comes back to the hacienda as Macaria's daughter.\n\nYears pass and Renata, in order to be with her daughter, is forced to marry Fausto, an ambitious and cruel man who claims to love her. From then on, she acts as Abigail's [[godparent|godmother]]. Fausto provokes an accident in which Renata tries to escape with Abigail, causing Renata to lose her eyesight, and also takes command of Renata's fortune. Fausto is happy about the arrival of his nephew Mateo ([[Mark Tacher]]) to the hacienda. He is a young, handsome, and daring man who has recently completed his studies of [[medicine]] overland from [[Canada]].\n\nMateo falls in love with Diana Montero ([[Alta\u00edr Jarabo]]), without knowing that she is the lover of his uncle. When Fausto finds out about this relationship, he opposes it and separates Diana from his nephew. Meanwhile, from the moment she meets Mateo, Abigail falls in love with him; the two end up together, provoking hate in Diana who, along with Fausto, tries to separate the young couple. They achieve the separation of the two lovers, but they aren't able to destroy the love that Abigail and Mateo feel for each other.\n\nMateo finally has his teacher, friend, and specialist in [[ophthalmology]] review Renata's case of blindness to see if he can operate on her. Dr. Patricio Duarte ([[Rene Strickler]]) secretly falls in love with Renata and has a great interest in helping Renata recover her sight again. The two form a very special friendship and love despite Renata's marriage to Fausto.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main cast ===\n*[[Zuria Vega]] as Abigail \n*[[Mark Tacher]] as Mateo Lopez Guerra Fuentes\n*[[Sergio Goyri]] as Fausto Lopez Guerra\n*[[Rebecca Jones]] as Renata Flores del Angel de Lopez Guerra\n*[[Sabine Moussier]] as Macaria Rios\n*[[Maria Sorte]] as Helena Fuentes \n*[[Rene Strickler]] as Dr. Patricio Duarte\n*[[Altair Jarabo]] as Diana Montero\n\n=== Also as main cast ===\n=== Special participation ===\n*[[Ricardo Franco (actor)|Ricardo Franco]] as Gerardo Lopez Guerra\n*Erik Diaz as Young Fausto\n*Regina Blandon as Young Helena\n*Christian Vega as Young Lucio\n\n== Ratings ==\n=== Univision rating ===\nWill premiere on 19 January 2015 on Univision with a total of 3.0 million viewers.<ref name=\"rating1\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/01/20/univisions-premiere-of-que-te-perdone-dios-was-the-top-broadcast-program-among-adults-18-34-in-the-time-period/353227/|title=Univision's Premiere of 'Que Te Perdone Dios' Was the Top Broadcast Program Among Adults 18-34 In The Time Period|author=Sara Bibel |date= |website= |publisher=tvbythenumbers|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Mexico rating ===\nOn Mexico will premiere February 16, 2015 with a total of 19.2 viewers.<ref name=\"ref34\">{{cite web | url=http://entretenimiento.starmedia.com/telenovelas/gran-final-yo-no-creo-en-hombres-telenovela-con-gabriel-soto-sera-en-febrero.html | title=Gran final de Yo no creo en los hombres, telenovela con Gabriel Soto, ser\u00e1 en febrero | publisher=starMedia | work=Marie Palma F | accessdate=16 January 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=\"ra1\" />\n<!--Edits with unreliable sources will be removed -->\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:28%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Timeslot ([[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]])\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:7%;\" rowspan=\"2\"| No. of<br />episodes\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=2| Premiered\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=2| Ended\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" span style=\"width:7%; font-size:smaller; line-height:100%;\"|Premiere<br/>Ratings\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" span style=\"width:10%; font-size:smaller; line-height:100%;\"| Finale<br/>Ratings\n|-\n| Monday to Friday 7:15PM\n|116\n| style=\"font-size:11px;line-height:110%\"|February 16, 2015\n! 19.2<ref name=\"ra1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.secretvida.com/2015/02/rating-del-primer-capitulo-de-que-te.html | title=Rating del primer capitulo de \"Que te Perdone Dios\" en Mexico | publisher= | work= | accessdate=March 14, 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n| style=\"font-size:11px;line-height:110%\"|July 26, 2015<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.radioformula.com.mx/notas.asp?Idn=509455&idFC=2015 | title=\"Que te perdone Dios\" concluir\u00e1 26 de julio: Ferdinando Valencia.| author=Maxine Woodside | work=Grupo F\u00f3mrula | accessdate=July 5, 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n!19.1<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espectaculosatiempo.com/2015/07/28/final-de-que-te-perdone-dios-con-buena-audiencia/| title=Final de Que Te Perdone Dios con buena audiencia| author= | work=Espectaculostiempo  | accessdate=August 2, 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Artist(s)\n\n| title1   =Aunque ahora est\u00e9s con \u00e9l\n| writer1  = \n| extra1   =Calibre 50\n| length1  =\n\n| title2   =Contigo\n| writer2  = \n| extra2   =Calibre 50\n| length2  =\n\n| title3   =Mi mujer\n| writer3  = \n| extra3   =Ernesto D'Alessio\n| length3  = \n}}\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

She knows it's a relationship that her father, Don Bruno Flores Riquelme ([[Eric del Castillo]]), would never approve, but when he learns that Renata is in love with Pablo, he threatens to kill him, not knowing that Renata is already pregnant with Pablo's daughter. Bruno banishes Renata and Macaria Rios ([[Alejandra Garc\u00eda (actress)|Alejandra Garc\u00eda]]), the [[servant]], to Real de San Andres, ([[San Miguel de Allende]]), the [[Guanajuato]] capital, to have the baby there. By the management of Fausto L\u00f3pez Guerra ([[Sergio Goyri]]), little Abigail ([[Zuria Vega]]) comes back to the hacienda as Macaria's daughter.\n\nYears pass and Renata, in order to be with her daughter, is forced to marry Fausto, an ambitious and cruel man who claims to love her. From then on, she acts as Abigail's [[godparent|godmother]]. Fausto provokes an accident in which Renata tries to escape with Abigail, causing Renata to lose her eyesight, and also takes command of Renata's fortune. Fausto is happy about the arrival of his nephew Mateo ([[Mark Tacher]]) to the hacienda. He is a young, handsome, and daring man who has recently completed his studies of [[medicine]] overland from [[Canada]].\n\nMateo falls in love with Diana Montero ([[Alta\u00edr Jarabo]]), without knowing that she is the lover of his uncle. When Fausto finds out about this relationship, he opposes it and separates Diana from his nephew. Meanwhile, from the moment she meets Mateo, Abigail falls in love with him; the two end up together, provoking hate in Diana who, along with Fausto, tries to separate the young couple. They achieve the separation of the two lovers, but they aren't able to destroy the love that Abigail and Mateo feel for each other.\n\nMateo finally has his teacher, friend, and specialist in [[ophthalmology]] review Renata's case of blindness to see if he can operate on her. Dr. Patricio Duarte ([[Rene Strickler]]) secretly falls in love with Renata and has a great interest in helping Renata recover her sight again. The two form a very special friendship and love despite Renata's marriage to Fausto.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main cast ===\n*[[Zuria Vega]] as Abigail \n*[[Mark Tacher]] as Mateo Lopez Guerra Fuentes\n*[[Sergio Goyri]] as Fausto Lopez Guerra\n*[[Rebecca Jones]] as Renata Flores del Angel de Lopez Guerra\n*[[Sabine Moussier]] as Macaria Rios\n*[[Maria Sorte]] as Helena Fuentes \n*[[Rene Strickler]] as Dr. Patricio Duarte\n*[[Altair Jarabo]] as Diana Montero\n\n=== Also as main cast ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n<!-- Please do not change the order of the cast, the cast is organized according to the opening theme of Televisa. -->\n*[[Ana Bertha Esp\u00edn]] as Do\u00f1a Constanza del \u00c1ngel de Flores\n*[[Ferdinando Valencia]] as Diego M\u00fa\u00f1oz\n*[[Alejandro \u00c1vila]] as Lucio Ram\u00edrez<ref>{{cite web |url=http://novelasyseries.univision.com/chismes/article/2014-11-10/alejandro-avila-y-ferdinando-valencia-se-integran-al-elenco-de-que-te-perdone-dios |title=Alejandro \u00c1vila y Ferdinando Valencia se integran al elenco de \"Que Te Perdone Dios\"|author= |date= |website= |publisher=Univision |accessdate=November 23, 2014|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n*[[Manuel Ojeda]] as Melit\u00f3n\n*Dacia Gonz\u00e1lez as Vicenta M\u00fa\u00f1oz\n*[[Zaide Silvia Guti\u00e9rrez]] as Simona S\u00e1nchez\n*[[Ana Patricia Rojo]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Woodside|first1=Maxine|title=Encarnar\u00e1 Ana Patricia mujer de doble moral en \"Que te perdone\u2026\"|url=http://www.radioformula.com.mx/notas.asp?Idn=458914&idFC=2014|website=Grupo Formula|accessdate=November 30, 2014|language=Spanish}}</ref> as Efigenia de la Cruz y Ferreria\n*[[Fabi\u00e1n Robles]] as Julio Acosta / Juli\u00e1n Montero\n*[[Laisha Wilkins]] as Ximena / Daniela \n*[[Ir\u00e1n Castillo]]<ref name=\"tvnotas1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvnotas.com.mx/2014/11/25/C-67931-iran-castillo-y-brandon-peniche-en-que-te-perdone-dios.php|title=Ir\u00e1n Castillo y Brandon Peniche en 'Que te perdone Dios'|author= |date= |website= |publisher=TVnotas|accessdate=January 4, 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref> as Young Renata Flores del \u00c1ngel\n*[[Eric del Castillo]] as Don Bruno Flores Riquelme<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radioformula.com.mx/notas.asp?Idn=448754&idFC=2014 |title=Eric del Castillo participar\u00e1 en remake de \"Abr\u00e1zame muy fuerte\".|author=Maxine Woodside |date= |website= |publisher=Grupo F\u00f3rmula |accessdate=October 21, 2014|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n*[[Brandon Peniche]] as Pablo Ramos<ref name=\"tvnotas1\" />  \n*[[Alejandra \u00c1valos]] as M\u00eda Montero \n*Moises Arizmendi as Porfirio Ramirez <!-- From episode 30. -->\n*Antonio Medell\u00edn as Padre Francisco Ojeda Bernal\n*[[Alejandra Garc\u00eda (actress)|Alejandra Garc\u00eda]] as Young Macaria Rios\n*[[Alejandra Procuna]] as Eduviges de la Cruz y Ferreria \n*[[Ra\u00fal Olivo]] as Jaime D\u00edaz \"Motor\"\n*\u00d3scar Bonfiglio as Marcelino\n*[[Julio Mannino]] as Benito\n*Myrrha Saavedra as Amanda Rios\n*[[Carlos Athi\u00e9]] as Maximiliano \"Max\" Ram\u00edrez Zaraz\u00faa <!-- From episode 30. -->\n*H\u00e9ctor Saez as Comandante Efrain Barrag\u00e1n\n*[[Adriano Zendejas]] as Antonio \"To\u00f1o\" S\u00e1nchez\n*Santiago Hern\u00e1ndez as Alfredo \"Fredy\" S\u00e1nchez\n*Rafael Amador as Cantinero\n*Iv\u00e1n Caraza as Mano Negra\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Galeano]] as Padre Tom\u00e1s \n*[[Alejandra Robles Gil]] as Teodora\n*Daniela Basso as Juanita\n*Lakshmi Picazo as Nieves\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Special participation ===\n*[[Ricardo Franco (actor)|Ricardo Franco]] as Gerardo L\u00f3pez Guerra\n*Erik D\u00edaz as Young Fausto\n*Regina Blandon as Young Helena\n*Christian Vega as Young Lucio\n\n== Ratings ==\n=== Univision rating ===\nWill premiere on 19 January 2015 on Univision with a total of 3.0 million viewers.<ref name=\"rating1\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/01/20/univisions-premiere-of-que-te-perdone-dios-was-the-top-broadcast-program-among-adults-18-34-in-the-time-period/353227/|title=Univision's Premiere of 'Que Te Perdone Dios' Was the Top Broadcast Program Among Adults 18-34 In The Time Period|author=Sara Bibel |date= |website= |publisher=tvbythenumbers|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Mexico rating ===\nOn Mexico will premiere February 16, 2015 with a total of 19.2 viewers.<ref name=\"ref34\">{{cite web | url=http://entretenimiento.starmedia.com/telenovelas/gran-final-yo-no-creo-en-hombres-telenovela-con-gabriel-soto-sera-en-febrero.html | title=Gran final de Yo no creo en los hombres, telenovela con Gabriel Soto, ser\u00e1 en febrero | publisher=starMedia | work=Marie Palma F | accessdate=16 January 2015|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=\"ra1\" />\n<!--Edits with unreliable sources will be removed -->\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

It uses a proprietary backup format <tt>(BKF)</tt> to back up files. Files can be backed up to [[Tape drive|tape]], [[Iomega Zip drive|ZIP drives]], [[floppy disk]]s, and hard drives. It also features integration with [[Task Scheduler]] and has several command line switches for scheduled automated backups.<ref>[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490952.aspx NTBackup command line Reference]</ref>\n\nIn [[Windows Vista]] and later operating systems, NTBackup was replaced by [[Backup and Restore|Windows Backup and Restore]], which uses the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] (VHD) file format, supports backup to modern media such as DVDs and image-based full system backups.\n\nFor server operating systems, Microsoft has replaced NTBackup with Windows Server Backup beginning with [[Windows Server 2008]], which includes the new <code>[[wbadmin]]</code> command.<ref>[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754572.aspx NTBackup replaced in Windows Server 2008]</ref> This new backup application, wbadmin, no longer supports tape drives, which means that users have to install third-party applications to back up to tape on these new operating systems.\n\nFor reading/restoring older backups, Microsoft has made available the NTBackup Restore utility for [[Windows Vista]]/Windows Server 2008 <ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7da725e2-8b69-4c65-afa3-2a53107d54a7&DisplayLang=en Windows NT Backup - Restore Utility]</ref> and for [[Windows 7]]/[[Windows Server 2008 R2]]<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/974674 Description of the Windows NT Backup Restore Utility for Windows 7 and for Windows Server 2008 R2]</ref> which can only read <tt>BKF</tt> files.\n\nWhen used with tape drives, NTBackup uses the [[Microsoft Tape Format]] (MTF),<ref>[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178062.aspx Media Sets, Media Families, and Backup Sets: MSDN]</ref> which is also used by [[BackupAssist]] and [[Backup Exec]] and [[Veeam Backup & Replication]]<ref>http://helpcenter.veeam.com/backup/70/bp_vsphere/hiw_tape_archiving.html</ref> and is compatible with BKF.<ref>[http://www.fpns.net/willy/msbackup.htm Win9x & XP & NT MSBackUp File Format and Data Recovery]</ref>\n\n==Features==\nNTBackup supports several operating system features including backing up the computer's ''System State''.

The [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Filchenhard forms part of Cronheim.\n__TOC__\n\n== Location ==\nCronheim is situated in the [[Franconian Lake District]] (in German: Fr\u00e4nkisches Seenland), approximately seven kilometres west of [[Gunzenhausen]].  Bavarian [[Landesstra\u00dfe|state road]] 2218 lies north of the village.\n\n== History ==\n=== Prehistoric and Protohistoric Time ===\nThe area around Cronheim was already populated in [[prehistoric]] and [[protohistoric]] time, proven by a circular [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] in the north and two grave mounds in the south part of the village.\nThere where also many gays in this village. the surrounding towns would call it gou villiga meaning the gay village.\n=== Hallstatt culture ca. 600 BC to 100 AC ===\nThe human population that occupied the region during around 600 BC and 100 AC belonged to the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Hallstatt culture]]. By the 6th century BC, the Hallstatt culture had expanded to include wide territories, falling into two zones, east and west, between them covering much of western and central Europe down to the Alps, and extending into northern Italy. In the neighbor village Kleinlellenfeld, north west from Cronheim, remainings of a Celtic settlement along with a [[Viereckschanze]] were found.\n\n=== [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] 90 to 259 ===\n[[File:Wp 14-4 - Auf dem Vorderen Schlo\u00dfbuck.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the Roman [[Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes]]]]\nIn the year 90 the Romans expelled the Celts, occupied the inhabited areas north of the Donau River and expanded into the area. The Celtic population wasn't banished from the region by the Romans but made [[Tributary state|tributary]] to them. To protect and getting control over the borders, the Roman started back in 138 under the Roman Caesar [[Antoninus Pius]] to extend the Roman boundary wall, [[Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes]], and also included now the area north of Cronheim. Thanks to [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] investigations of the wood used for the construction for the part of the Limes passing Cronheim, we now know that it was cut in 162, at the time when [[Marcus Aurelius]] was the Roman emperor, when this particular section of the Limes was built. In the second century two Roman military roads crossed at the location where Cronheim is now situated.\n\n=== [[Alemanni]] 259 to 496 ===\n[[File:Panorama-Wohnstallhaus.jpg|miniaturpx|thumb|Reconstruction of an Alemanni Home in [[V\u00f6rstetten]]]]\nAfter occupying the region for over 150 years, the [[Germanic peoples|German tribe]] [[Alemanni]] invaded the area and destroyed the Roman [[fortress]] in nearby [[Gunzenhausen]] in 241. Between the year 259 and 260 the Alemmani finally overran the Limes and occupied the land. Also the Alemmani neither banished the old Celtic nor their Roman invaders from the land. Like the Romans before the Alemmani allowed the people to stay under the condition to accept bondage to the conquerors. As a signal of bondage men where not allowed to wear beards or weapons. The Alemanni preferred to live in wooden houses and avoided the stone buildings the Romans constructed. The abandoned Roman constructions were collapsing over the years. Thanks to that still Roman monuments can be marveled in the [http://www.gunzenhausen.info/sehenswertes/burgstallwald-7121/ \"Burgstallwald\"] in nearby Gunzenhausen and many other location in the region, whereas Alemanni inheritances are rather rare. Villages ending with \"ingen\" that are in the direct neighborhood of Cronheim such as Oberschwaningen, Unterschwaningen, Altentr\u00fcdingen, Wassertr\u00fcdingen etc. were most likely founded by the Alemanni. After the loss of the [[Battle of Tolbiac]] in 496, the Alemanni were partly conquered by [[Clovis I]], leader of the German tribe [[Franks]] and incorporated into his dominions along with the Christian religion. This caused that parts of the Alemanni population moved, under the [[protectorate]] of the [[Ostrogoths]] emperor [[Theoderic the Great]], further south. Even after the Alemanni lost the decisive Battle of Tolbiac against their German sister tribe the Franks, they mainly managed to keep their autonomous status. The roots of noble family of the [[Agilolfings]] that from this time on ruled the Duchy of Bavaria is not quite clear. Some see their roots in the Frank dynasty, others in the Alemanni dynasty.\n\n=== [[Middle Ages]] 5th to 15th century  ===\n[[File:Siebmacher111-Kronhein.jpg|thumb|left|Coat of Arms - Knights of Kronheim]]\n[[File:Friedhofstor und Kirchturm in Cronheim.JPG|thumb|right|Church with parts of the medieval protection wall and gate.

Historic Monument # D-5-77-136-156]]\nThe location was mentioned for the first time in the year 800 as the foundation of a man named \u201cCracho.\u201d In medieval times Cronheim was a free and independent manor. That included the full authority over the village including the ordinary jurisdiction.<ref>Kreisverband der Arbeiterwohlfahrt Roth-Schwabach: Mikrokosmos Cronheim: ein Dorf, drei Religionen, 2000, S. 38</ref> A stone with the coat of arms of the knights of ''Kronheim'' that used to be in the old castle is dated 1111 that indicates the time when the first castle, the Allodium, was built. If the knights of Cronheim were constructing the Castle Cronheim and named it after themselves or the other way around isn't documented. At the beginning of the 13th century a new, more representative castle was constructed nearby. It was changed and enlarged various times until it finally burned down in 1403. The old castle, the Allodium, was rented out to the church that used it as the priest house. Thanks to that circumstance large parts of the old construction could be preserved until today.\n\nIn a document dated June 9, 1272 a ''Ludwig von Craigenheim'' (Cronheim) was mentioned. He exchanged the churches St. Peter and St. Walburg in the village Stetten for properties in ''Norsteten'' (Nordstetten (Gunzenhausen)) with bishop Hildebrand of M\u00f6hren<ref>. Ein Dorf zwischen Altm\u00fchl und Hahnenkamm, Hrsg. Obst- u. Gartenbauverein Stetten-Maicha, von H. Schlund 1983</ref> Hans von Cronheim (\u2020 around 1427) was a helper of the at the 15th of Mai 1381 executed robber-knight [[Eppelein von Gailingen]],<ref>Historische Nachricht von dem Ursprunge und Wachsthum des Heil. R\u00f6m. Reichsfreier Stadt N\u00fcrnberg, S. 173, Frankfurt und Leipzig, 1752</ref> who had his hide-out in [[Wald (Gunzenhausen)|Wald]].\n\nMost likely due to the fire at the castle in Cronheim in 1403 Hans von Cronheim and his wife Anna were selling four properties in [[Aha (Gunzenhausen)|Aha]] to the [[Teutonic Order]] in Nuremberg<ref>StArchiv-N, Rep. 205-0 Ritterorden Urkunden, Nr. 3100</ref> along with a grange in Sachsenhofen to Kuntz von Eschenbach zu Obern-Eschenbach and Margretha, his wife.<ref>StArchiv-N, Rep. 205-0 Ritterorden Urkunden, Nr. 3099</ref>\n\nIn 1406 they sold their part of the castle Burleswagen near Crailsheim that they were previously buying from Weiprecht of Wolmershausen, to J\u00f6rg Lankwarter.<ref>W\u00fcrttembergische Oberamtsbeschreibungen, Crailsheim, 1884, S</ref> A Jakob  ''of Kronheim'' was married with Anna von Habsberg.<ref>Kindler von Knobloch, Julius  ; Badische Historische Kommission   [Hrsg.]\nOberbadisches Geschlechterbuch (Band 1): A - Ha \u2014 Heidelberg, 1898, S. 501</ref> A Wilhelm of Cronheim (\u20201485) was a member of the brotherhood ''Pr\u00e4monstratenser-Order St. Marien auf dem Harlunger Berg''.<ref>Johann David K\u00f6hler: Gesellschafft Unser Lieben Frauen auf den Berg bey Alt-Brandenburg</ref> That might be seen as an indicator of an allegiance with [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg]]. A Hans Georg of Kronheim is mentioned May 11, 1551 as a witness in a shepherd contract between the shepherds in the district of the knights of Absperg.<ref>Charter: N\u00fcrnberg: Heilig-Geist-Spital, Urkunden 719 - http://monasterium.net/mom/DE-StAN/hlgeistspital/719/charter</ref>\n\n=== [[Modern History]] ===\nWith Hans Georg of Kronheim the dynasty of the Cronheims ended in the male line. Due to his daughter Barbara, she was married to the caretaker of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Eichst\u00e4tt]], Matthias of Leonrod, the manor went 1560 to the knights of Leonrod. Barbara is buried in the Church of Herrieden. The knights of Leonrod began 1564 with the construction of today's [[Water castle]] in Cronheim where the reeve was located. Another daughter of Hans Georg of Kronheim, Ester, was married with Ernst of Rechenberg, whose common daughter married Sebastian Neust\u00e4dter genannt St\u00fcrmer son of Elisabeth of Wolmershausen. If also Walpurg von Kronheim, who was married with the marshal Hugo Vogt of Alten-Sumerau zu Prasberg, was a daughter of Hans Georg is unclear. If so, Hans Georg's wife was Maria Jacobe of Schinen.<ref>Kindler von Knobloch, Julius  ; Badische Historische Kommission [Hrsg.]: Oberbadisches Geschlechterbuch (Band 1): A - Ha \u2014 Heidelberg, 1898, S. 369</ref> Cronheim has been a catholic community. That changed 1560 with the implementation of the Brandanburgian [[Church Order (Lutheran)]]. Already in 1558 the catholic priest at this time in Cronheim, Georg Hass, married, violating the Catholic rule of [[Celibacy]], his housekeeper under the protection of the dukes of Brandenburg-Onolzbach.<ref>Martin von Schaumberg: F\u00fcrstbischof von Eichst\u00e4tt 1560-1590, und die Trienter Reform, Aschendorff, 1965, S. 29,</ref>\n\nIn 1580 the manor Cronheim went to Sir Sebastian Neust\u00e4dter genannt St\u00fcrmer, before he sold it 1595 for 47.000 [[Guilder]] to his brother in law Sir Friedrich von Eyb zu Eybburg, including the [[prebendary]] in Cronheim that he bought back in 1592.<ref>Karl Heinrich von Lang: Historisches Netz des Rezatkreises: das ist: die Stadtgeb\u00e4ude, Land- und Herrschaftsgerichte des Rezatkreises, N\u00fcrnberg 1834, S. 31</ref> Sir Veit Erasmus von Eyb sold the manor 1617 to Sir Johann Phillipp von Bimbach. When 1626 the German Emperor Ferdiand II. called out the [[imperial ban]] on Sir Johann Phillipp von Bimbach the manor went to the emperor who than handed it over to Duke Nikolaus [[Fugger]] under the condition that the village has to be catholic \"forever\". Already in 1630 Duke Nikolaus Fugger sold the manor to the [[Prince-Bishop]] of [[Eichst\u00e4tt]], [[Johann Christoph von Westerstetten]], with the nickname \"Witch Bishop\", who than forced the community to become catholic again and banished the Jewish of the village. The Protestant priest, Johann Boeckler, father of [[Johann Heinrich Boeckler|Johann Heinrich]] and [[Georg Andreas Boeckler|Georg Andreas]] who both later became famous academics, was forced 1628 to resign from his position as priest and finally banished in 1634. Both sons of him were born in the previous priest house of Cronheim that has been re-built in 1749 and today is a listed historic [[monument]], next to other buildings in Cronheim. From 1629, other sources refer to 1634, the community in Cronheim again was catholic.\n\nIn 1635, during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618 to 1648), the only buildings in Cronheim still standing were the Church, the priest-house, the house of the blacksmith and a tile house. The majority of the surrounding farms were destroyed. In 1652, after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648), the Diocese of Eichst\u00e4tt had to return the manor to its initial owners, the Sirs  of Fuchs von Bimmbach. The protest of the Prince-Bishop Marquard II. Schenk von Castell was rejected and so the manor went to Karl Fuchs as his brother had died in the meantime. The prebendary in Cronheim remained with the Diocese of Eichst\u00e4tt. When Karl Fuchs was selling the manor to Duke Johann Heinrich Notthafft, the Prince-Bishop of Eichst\u00e4tt managed to get the preemption right on the manor. From 1658 onwards the new owner, Duke Johann Heinrich, allowed the Jewish community to return. After only ten years of ownership, 1661, he offered the manor to the [[Teutonic Order]] in Nuremberg. However, the deal was delayed so finally Prince-Bishop Marquard II. Schenk von Castell stepped into the contract and bought the manor Cronheim on August 2, 1661 for the Diocese. The new owner began 1666 with the extension of the church, renovated it and added a new top on the church tower. He continued and even expanded the Jewish immigration politics of the previous owner. He offered Jewish to settle down in Cronheim under the condition that they re-build the houses and re-activate the farming business. This politics led into an investment boom. 55 new houses and 30 barns were built. The Jewish were allowed to build a school and a synagogue. Further they were allowed to nominate a speaker who had the authority to negotiate with the local government. Back in 1658 Cronheim was the only community in the territory of the Diocese Eichst\u00e4tt that allowed Jewish to settle. In 1816 the Jewish community built a new synagogue in Cronheim, further the [[N\u00f6rdlingen\u2013Gunzenhausen railway]] was built in 1848 and Cronheim had a railway station.\n\nThe flourishing Jewish community in Cronheim ended in October 1938 with the housebreaking into the synagogue where the interior was destroyed. The building was sold shortly afterwards and the Jewish sanctuaries were given to the Jewish community in Munich where they were destroyed during [[Kristallnacht]].\n\nIn 1961 504 residents lived in 103 houses plus 57 residents in the neighbor village Filchenhard in 14 houses.\n\nOn April 1, 1971 Cronheim lost its independence status and became part of the community in Gunzenhausen. November 29, 1985 the German railway, Deutsche Bundesbahn, discontinued the railway service in Cronheim. However, currently there are plans to re-activate it as the area of the \"[[Franconian Lake District]]\" becomes more and more attractive for tourists due to its close location to the [[Altm\u00fchlsee]] that was artificially created in 1985 as part of a water regulation project among other lakes in the area. Leisure time facilities such as bike trails, wind-surfing, sailing, hiking and others are making the area very attractive for tourism that since then is growing rapidly. The  association \"AWO Kreisverband Roth-Schwabach e.V.\" is running a therapy center in the Castle of Cronheim where they also maintain the public museum \"Mikrokosmos Cronheim, ein Dorf - drei Religionen\" - \"Microcosm Cronheim, one Village - three Religions\" living next to each other. It shows next to the unresistant history of the castles the challenges of the three religions, Catholics, Protestants and Jewish - \"The Three Crowns of Cro(w)nheim\".\n\n== Notable residents ==\n* [[Johann Heinrich Boeckler]], born 13 December 1611 in Cronheim\n* [[Georg Andreas Boeckler]], born around 1617 in Cronheim\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101005015311/http://www.gunzenhausen.de/ortsteile/cronheim.html Der Ort auf www.gunzenhausen.de] (in German)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101018053239/http://www.altmuehltal.de/gunzenhausen/cronheim.htm Das Schloss] (in German)\n* [http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/cronheim_synagoge.htm The Synagogue] (in German)\n* [http://geoportal.bayern.de/bayernatlas-klassik/DsOsNYLl0KKkflbKBLZnz42HRzSdPqdN0zcFnya26FS9NL-z5Ih2g927EER6ZLlYA7E4B6m0BLX7RvduyoJgTdTDgXOtLJjqCHsGY7bzRxSnRdlcmIhQfcivXH8DFiUH740YPqaHw4Ckjerc0tnlCw/DsO5f/Ll0ff/4B637 Map with historical monuments]\n* {{wikivoyage-inline}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Bavaria]]\n[[Category:Wei\u00dfenburg-Gunzenhausen]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=April 2015}}\n\n{{Infobox German location\n|type= Stadtteil\n|Town = Gunzenhausen\n|image_photo        = S\u00fcdseite des Wasserschlosses.JPG\n|imagesize          = 250px\n|image_caption     = [[Cronheim Castle]] Historic Monument # D-5-77-136-149\n|image_coa             = Wappen Cronheim.png\n|Wappengr\u00f6\u00dfe        = <!-- No longer supported -->\n|coordinates = {{coord|49|05|48|N|10|39|50|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|state = Bayern\n|region = Mittelfranken\n|district = Wei\u00dfenburg-Gunzenhausen\n|population =  526\n|website = [http://www.gunzenhausen.de/ www.gunzenhausen.de]\n}}\n\n'''Cronheim''' is a [[village]] in the municipality of [[Gunzenhausen]] in the [[Wei\u00dfenburg-Gunzenhausen]] district which forms part of the [[Bavaria]]n Government district (in German: ''Regierungbezirk'') of [[Mittelfranken]]. The [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Filchenhard forms part of Cronheim.\n__TOC__\n\n== Location ==\nCronheim is situated in the [[Franconian Lake District]] (in German: Fr\u00e4nkisches Seenland), approximately seven kilometres west of [[Gunzenhausen]].  Bavarian [[Landesstra\u00dfe|state road]] 2218 lies north of the village.\n\n== History ==\n=== Prehistoric and Protohistoric Time ===\nThe area around Cronheim was already populated in [[prehistoric]] and [[protohistoric]] time, proven by a circular [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] in the north and two grave mounds in the south part of the village.\n\n=== Hallstatt culture ca. 600 BC to 100 AC ===\nThe human population that occupied the region during around 600 BC and 100 AC belonged to the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Hallstatt culture]]. By the 6th century BC, the Hallstatt culture had expanded to include wide territories, falling into two zones, east and west, between them covering much of western and central Europe down to the Alps, and extending into northern Italy. In the neighbor village Kleinlellenfeld, north west from Cronheim, remainings of a Celtic settlement along with a [[Viereckschanze]] were found.\n\n=== [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] 90 to 259 ===\n[[File:Wp 14-4 - Auf dem Vorderen Schlo\u00dfbuck.jpg|thumb|left|Model of the Roman [[Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes]]]]\nIn the year 90 the Romans expelled the Celts, occupied the inhabited areas north of the Donau River and expanded into the area. The Celtic population wasn't banished from the region by the Romans but made [[Tributary state|tributary]] to them. To protect and getting control over the borders, the Roman started back in 138 under the Roman Caesar [[Antoninus Pius]] to extend the Roman boundary wall, [[Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes]], and also included now the area north of Cronheim. Thanks to [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] investigations of the wood used for the construction for the part of the Limes passing Cronheim, we now know that it was cut in 162, at the time when [[Marcus Aurelius]] was the Roman emperor, when this particular section of the Limes was built. In the second century two Roman military roads crossed at the location where Cronheim is now situated.\n\n=== [[Alemanni]] 259 to 496 ===\n[[File:Panorama-Wohnstallhaus.jpg|miniaturpx|thumb|Reconstruction of an Alemanni Home in [[V\u00f6rstetten]]]]\nAfter occupying the region for over 150 years, the [[Germanic peoples|German tribe]] [[Alemanni]] invaded the area and destroyed the Roman [[fortress]] in nearby [[Gunzenhausen]] in 241. Between the year 259 and 260 the Alemmani finally overran the Limes and occupied the land. Also the Alemmani neither banished the old Celtic nor their Roman invaders from the land. Like the Romans before the Alemmani allowed the people to stay under the condition to accept bondage to the conquerors. As a signal of bondage men where not allowed to wear beards or weapons. The Alemanni preferred to live in wooden houses and avoided the stone buildings the Romans constructed. The abandoned Roman constructions were collapsing over the years. Thanks to that still Roman monuments can be marveled in the [http://www.gunzenhausen.info/sehenswertes/burgstallwald-7121/ \"Burgstallwald\"] in nearby Gunzenhausen and many other location in the region, whereas Alemanni inheritances are rather rare. Villages ending with \"ingen\" that are in the direct neighborhood of Cronheim such as Oberschwaningen, Unterschwaningen, Altentr\u00fcdingen, Wassertr\u00fcdingen etc. were most likely founded by the Alemanni. After the loss of the [[Battle of Tolbiac]] in 496, the Alemanni were partly conquered by [[Clovis I]], leader of the German tribe [[Franks]] and incorporated into his dominions along with the Christian religion. This caused that parts of the Alemanni population moved, under the [[protectorate]] of the [[Ostrogoths]] emperor [[Theoderic the Great]], further south. Even after the Alemanni lost the decisive Battle of Tolbiac against their German sister tribe the Franks, they mainly managed to keep their autonomous status. The roots of noble family of the [[Agilolfings]] that from this time on ruled the Duchy of Bavaria is not quite clear. Some see their roots in the Frank dynasty, others in the Alemanni dynasty.\n\n=== [[Middle Ages]] 5th to 15th century  ===\n[[File:Siebmacher111-Kronhein.jpg|thumb|left|Coat of Arms - Knights of Kronheim]]\n[[File:Friedhofstor und Kirchturm in Cronheim.JPG|thumb|right|Church with parts of the medieval protection wall and gate.

Historic Monument # D-5-77-136-156]]\nThe location was mentioned for the first time in the year 800 as the foundation of a man named \u201cCracho.\u201d In medieval times Cronheim was a free and independent manor. That included the full authority over the village including the ordinary jurisdiction.<ref>Kreisverband der Arbeiterwohlfahrt Roth-Schwabach: Mikrokosmos Cronheim: ein Dorf, drei Religionen, 2000, S. 38</ref> A stone with the coat of arms of the knights of ''Kronheim'' that used to be in the old castle is dated 1111 that indicates the time when the first castle, the Allodium, was built. If the knights of Cronheim were constructing the Castle Cronheim and named it after themselves or the other way around isn't documented. At the beginning of the 13th century a new, more representative castle was constructed nearby. It was changed and enlarged various times until it finally burned down in 1403. The old castle, the Allodium, was rented out to the church that used it as the priest house. Thanks to that circumstance large parts of the old construction could be preserved until today.\n\nIn a document dated June 9, 1272 a ''Ludwig von Craigenheim'' (Cronheim) was mentioned. He exchanged the churches St. Peter and St. Walburg in the village Stetten for properties in ''Norsteten'' (Nordstetten (Gunzenhausen)) with bishop Hildebrand of M\u00f6hren<ref>. Ein Dorf zwischen Altm\u00fchl und Hahnenkamm, Hrsg. Obst- u. Gartenbauverein Stetten-Maicha, von H. Schlund 1983</ref> Hans von Cronheim (\u2020 around 1427) was a helper of the at the 15th of Mai 1381 executed robber-knight [[Eppelein von Gailingen]],<ref>Historische Nachricht von dem Ursprunge und Wachsthum des Heil. R\u00f6m. Reichsfreier Stadt N\u00fcrnberg, S. 173, Frankfurt und Leipzig, 1752</ref> who had his hide-out in [[Wald (Gunzenhausen)|Wald]].\n\nMost likely due to the fire at the castle in Cronheim in 1403 Hans von Cronheim and his wife Anna were selling four properties in [[Aha (Gunzenhausen)|Aha]] to the [[Teutonic Order]] in Nuremberg<ref>StArchiv-N, Rep. 205-0 Ritterorden Urkunden, Nr. 3100</ref> along with a grange in Sachsenhofen to Kuntz von Eschenbach zu Obern-Eschenbach and Margretha, his wife.<ref>StArchiv-N, Rep. 205-0 Ritterorden Urkunden, Nr. 3099</ref>\n\nIn 1406 they sold their part of the castle Burleswagen near Crailsheim that they were previously buying from Weiprecht of Wolmershausen, to J\u00f6rg Lankwarter.<ref>W\u00fcrttembergische Oberamtsbeschreibungen, Crailsheim, 1884, S</ref> A Jakob  ''of Kronheim'' was married with Anna von Habsberg.<ref>Kindler von Knobloch, Julius  ; Badische Historische Kommission   [Hrsg.]\nOberbadisches Geschlechterbuch (Band 1): A - Ha \u2014 Heidelberg, 1898, S. 501</ref> A Wilhelm of Cronheim (\u20201485) was a member of the brotherhood ''Pr\u00e4monstratenser-Order St. Marien auf dem Harlunger Berg''.<ref>Johann David K\u00f6hler: Gesellschafft Unser Lieben Frauen auf den Berg bey Alt-Brandenburg</ref> That might be seen as an indicator of an allegiance with [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg]]. A Hans Georg of Kronheim is mentioned May 11, 1551 as a witness in a shepherd contract between the shepherds in the district of the knights of Absperg.<ref>Charter: N\u00fcrnberg: Heilig-Geist-Spital, Urkunden 719 - http://monasterium.net/mom/DE-StAN/hlgeistspital/719/charter</ref>\n\n=== [[Modern History]] ===\nWith Hans Georg of Kronheim the dynasty of the Cronheims ended in the male line. Due to his daughter Barbara, she was married to the caretaker of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Eichst\u00e4tt]], Matthias of Leonrod, the manor went 1560 to the knights of Leonrod. Barbara is buried in the Church of Herrieden. The knights of Leonrod began 1564 with the construction of today's [[Water castle]] in Cronheim where the reeve was located. Another daughter of Hans Georg of Kronheim, Ester, was married with Ernst of Rechenberg, whose common daughter married Sebastian Neust\u00e4dter genannt St\u00fcrmer son of Elisabeth of Wolmershausen. If also Walpurg von Kronheim, who was married with the marshal Hugo Vogt of Alten-Sumerau zu Prasberg, was a daughter of Hans Georg is unclear. If so, Hans Georg's wife was Maria Jacobe of Schinen.<ref>Kindler von Knobloch, Julius  ; Badische Historische Kommission [Hrsg.]: Oberbadisches Geschlechterbuch (Band 1): A - Ha \u2014 Heidelberg, 1898, S. 369</ref> Cronheim has been a catholic community. That changed 1560 with the implementation of the Brandanburgian [[Church Order (Lutheran)]]. Already in 1558 the catholic priest at this time in Cronheim, Georg Hass, married, violating the Catholic rule of [[Celibacy]], his housekeeper under the protection of the dukes of Brandenburg-Onolzbach.<ref>Martin von Schaumberg: F\u00fcrstbischof von Eichst\u00e4tt 1560-1590, und die Trienter Reform, Aschendorff, 1965, S. 29,</ref>\n\nIn 1580 the manor Cronheim went to Sir Sebastian Neust\u00e4dter genannt St\u00fcrmer, before he sold it 1595 for 47.000 [[Guilder]] to his brother in law Sir Friedrich von Eyb zu Eybburg, including the [[prebendary]] in Cronheim that he bought back in 1592.<ref>Karl Heinrich von Lang: Historisches Netz des Rezatkreises: das ist: die Stadtgeb\u00e4ude, Land- und Herrschaftsgerichte des Rezatkreises, N\u00fcrnberg 1834, S. 31</ref> Sir Veit Erasmus von Eyb sold the manor 1617 to Sir Johann Phillipp von Bimbach. When 1626 the German Emperor Ferdiand II. called out the [[imperial ban]] on Sir Johann Phillipp von Bimbach the manor went to the emperor who than handed it over to Duke Nikolaus [[Fugger]] under the condition that the village has to be catholic \"forever\". Already in 1630 Duke Nikolaus Fugger sold the manor to the [[Prince-Bishop]] of [[Eichst\u00e4tt]], [[Johann Christoph von Westerstetten]], with the nickname \"Witch Bishop\", who than forced the community to become catholic again and banished the Jewish of the village. The Protestant priest, Johann Boeckler, father of [[Johann Heinrich Boeckler|Johann Heinrich]] and [[Georg Andreas Boeckler|Georg Andreas]] who both later became famous academics, was forced 1628 to resign from his position as priest and finally banished in 1634. Both sons of him were born in the previous priest house of Cronheim that has been re-built in 1749 and today is a listed historic [[monument]], next to other buildings in Cronheim. From 1629, other sources refer to 1634, the community in Cronheim again was catholic.\n\nIn 1635, during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618 to 1648), the only buildings in Cronheim still standing were the Church, the priest-house, the house of the blacksmith and a tile house. The majority of the surrounding farms were destroyed. In 1652, after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648), the Diocese of Eichst\u00e4tt had to return the manor to its initial owners, the Sirs  of Fuchs von Bimmbach. The protest of the Prince-Bishop Marquard II. Schenk von Castell was rejected and so the manor went to Karl Fuchs as his brother had died in the meantime. The prebendary in Cronheim remained with the Diocese of Eichst\u00e4tt. When Karl Fuchs was selling the manor to Duke Johann Heinrich Notthafft, the Prince-Bishop of Eichst\u00e4tt managed to get the preemption right on the manor. From 1658 onwards the new owner, Duke Johann Heinrich, allowed the Jewish community to return. After only ten years of ownership, 1661, he offered the manor to the [[Teutonic Order]] in Nuremberg. However, the deal was delayed so finally Prince-Bishop Marquard II. Schenk von Castell stepped into the contract and bought the manor Cronheim on August 2, 1661 for the Diocese. The new owner began 1666 with the extension of the church, renovated it and added a new top on the church tower. He continued and even expanded the Jewish immigration politics of the previous owner. He offered Jewish to settle down in Cronheim under the condition that they re-build the houses and re-activate the farming business. This politics led into an investment boom. 55 new houses and 30 barns were built. The Jewish were allowed to build a school and a synagogue. Further they were allowed to nominate a speaker who had the authority to negotiate with the local government. Back in 1658 Cronheim was the only community in the territory of the Diocese Eichst\u00e4tt that allowed Jewish to settle. In 1816 the Jewish community built a new synagogue in Cronheim, further the [[N\u00f6rdlingen\u2013Gunzenhausen railway]] was built in 1848 and Cronheim had a railway station.\n\nThe flourishing Jewish community in Cronheim ended in October 1938 with the housebreaking into the synagogue where the interior was destroyed. The building was sold shortly afterwards and the Jewish sanctuaries were given to the Jewish community in Munich where they were destroyed during [[Kristallnacht]].\n\nIn 1961 504 residents lived in 103 houses plus 57 residents in the neighbor village Filchenhard in 14 houses.\n\nOn April 1, 1971 Cronheim lost its independence status and became part of the community in Gunzenhausen. November 29, 1985 the German railway, Deutsche Bundesbahn, discontinued the railway service in Cronheim. However, currently there are plans to re-activate it as the area of the \"[[Franconian Lake District]]\" becomes more and more attractive for tourists due to its close location to the [[Altm\u00fchlsee]] that was artificially created in 1985 as part of a water regulation project among other lakes in the area.
