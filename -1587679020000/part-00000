In 2002, they achieved breakthrough success with their second album, ''[[The Young and the Hopeless]]''. Featuring the hit singles [[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous (Good Charlotte song)|Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]], [[The Anthem (Good Charlotte song)|The Anthem]] and [[Girls & Boys (Good Charlotte song)|Girls & Boys]], ''The Young and the Hopeless'' sold 3.5 million copies in the US and was certified triple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], for a total of almost 5 million copies sold worldwide.

Rashi's version already includes the fox, the wolf, the [[water well|well]] and the Moon that are seen in later versions. [[Petrus Alphonsi]], a Spanish Jewish convert to Christianity, popularized this tale in Europe in his collection ''[[Disciplina Clericalis#The Oxen Which the Countryman had Promised to the Wolf, and the Judgment of the Fox|Disciplina Clericalis]]''.<ref name=\"McKnight\"/>\n\n[[File:Le loup et le renard Chauveau.jpg|thumb|The wolf is tempted by the Moon's reflection.]]\nThe variation featuring [[Reynard]] the Fox appeared soon after Petrus Alphonsi in the French classic ''Le Roman de Renart'' (as \"Renart et Ysengrin dans le puits\" in Branch IV); the Moon/cheese element is absent (it is replaced by a promise of Paradise at the bottom of the well), but such a version is alluded to in another part of the collection. This was the first Reynard tale to be adapted into English (as the Middle English \"\u00fee Vox and \u00fee Wolf\"), preceding Chaucer's \"[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]\" and the much later work of [[William Caxton]].<ref name=\"McKnight\"/> Later still, the Middle Scots [[The Fox, the Wolf and the Husbandman]] does include the Moon/cheese element. La Fontaine includes the story in the French classic compilation ''[[La Fontaine's Fables|Fables]]'' (\"Le Loup et le Renard\" in Book XI).  The German tale of [[The Wolf and the Fox]] in Grimm replaces the well with a well-stocked cellar, where a newly satiated wolf is trapped and subject to the farmer's revenge, being now too overstuffed to escape through the exit.\n{{wikisource|The Original Fables of La Fontaine/The Wolf and the Fox in the Well}}\n\nOne of the facets of this morphology is grouped as \"The Wolf Dives into the Water for Reflected Cheese\" (Type 34) of the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system|Aarne\u2013Thompson classification]] of folktales, where the Moon's reflection is mistaken for cheese, in the section devoted to tales of [[Foxes in popular culture|The Clever Fox]].

La Fontaine includes the story in the French classic compilation ''[[La Fontaine's Fables|Fables]]'' (\"Le Loup et le Renard\" in Book XI).  The German tale of [[The Wolf and the Fox]] in Grimm replaces the well with a well-stocked cellar, where a newly satiated wolf is trapped and subject to the farmer's revenge, being now too overstuffed to escape through the exit.\n{{wikisource|The Original Fables of La Fontaine/The Wolf and the Fox in the Well}}\n\nOne of the facets of this morphology is grouped as \"The Wolf Dives into the Water for Reflected Cheese\" (Type 34) of the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system|Aarne\u2013Thompson classification]] of folktales, where the Moon's reflection is mistaken for cheese, in the section devoted to tales of [[Foxes in popular culture|The Clever Fox]].

{"title_page": "Angle (astrology)", "text_new": "The '''angle'''s are the four [[Cardinal sign (astrology)|Cardinal points]] of an [[natal chart|astrological chart]]:  the [[Ascendant]], the [[Midheaven]], the [[Descendant (astrology)|Descendant]] and the [[Imum Coeli]].\n\nThe astrological chart is a schematic representation of the sky at any given moment of time, projected upon the [[ecliptic]]--or the apparent path of the [[Sun (astrology)|Sun]] as seen from the Earth\u2014which forms the circle in which the chart is enclosed.  The longitudinal positions of the planets are plotted onto this circle, because the planets (except [[Pluto]]) and many stars, lie very close to the Sun's path in celestial latitude.\n\nHow this map of the sky is seen from the Earth is determined by where the [[horizon]] is at the time for which the chart is cast.  The horizon forms the boundary between what can be seen, or the visible sky, and sky which exists on the opposite side of the earth, which exists at the same time and space, but cannot be seen.\n\nThe line of the horizon cuts across the circle of the chart horizontally, and forms the most important '''angle''' of the chart:  the [[Ascendant]], or the exact place where the Sun's path crosses the horizon in the East.  It is at this point that all planets and many stars appears to rise up out of what cannot be seen and become apparent to the observer.  This is because the Earth's daily rotation reveals sky objects from East to West, and makes them appear to be moving from the eastern horizon across the sky to the western horizon, where they disappear again to the observer, dipping down again to the unseen sky.  The western horizon, where the Sun's path meets the horizon in the West, is called the [[Descendant (astrology)|Descendant]].\n\nThe other very important ''angle'' of the chart is the [[Midheaven]] (also called the M.C. for the Latin ''Medium coeli'', or \"middle of the sky.\")  The Midheaven represents the highest point in the sky reached by the Sun, or its ''culmination'', as it crosses from one horizon to the other\u2014the noon point in a chart which is plotted for dawn.  At the Earth's [[equator]], it is the point on the ecliptic which is directly overhead from the observer; as the observer moves north or south from the Equator, the midheaven appears to withdraw, so that from points north of the equator, the noon point of the Sun appears to lie in the southern sky, and south of the equator, it appears in the northern sky.  \n\nThe point opposite the Midheaven, which is in the unseen sky, and would be the midnight point in a chart cast for dawn, is the ''anticulmination'' of the Sun, or the [[Imum Coeli]], which is Latin for the \"bottom of the sky.\"  This is the last of the four ''angles.''\n\nThe angles are crucial to the understanding of the meaning of the sky map to the individual or event for which it was cast.  There are no more individual points in chart.  Much has been made by astrologers (deriving from the [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] tradition that is closely linked to much of modern astrological practice) of the quality of \"coming into being\" that they represent, as they represent going from the unseen to the seen.  Since Theosophical astrology was tied to the idea of manifesting from the spiritual to the bodily form, the angles have come to symbolize this connection.  However, even if this theory is discounted, as Bernadette Brady{{Ref|Brady}} has noted, to all ancient peoples, the horizon was the place where the gods came into contact with the earth and became available to human supplication.  Without this connection, the spiritual realm and the world had nothing to do with one another, and for that reason, astrology, which seeks to communicate between the two spheres, must use this place of connection to derive significance for the world from the sky.\n\nFor delineation of each of the angles, see:\n*[[Ascendant]]\n**[[Accidental Ascendant]]\n**[[Equatorial Ascendant]]\n*[[Midheaven]]\n*[[Descendant (astrology)|Descendant]]\n*[[Imum Coeli]]\n*[[Angular house]]\n*[[Succedent house]]\n*[[Cadent house]]\n\n==References==\n# {{note|Brady}}Bernadette Brady.

The horizon forms the boundary between what can be seen, or the visible sky, and sky which exists on the opposite side of the earth, which exists at the same time and space, but cannot be seen.\n\nThe line of the horizon cuts across the circle of the chart horizontally, and forms the most important '''angle''' of the chart:  the [[Ascendant]], or the exact place where the Sun's path crosses the horizon in the East.  It is at this point that all planets and many stars appears to rise up out of what cannot be seen and become apparent to the observer.  This is because the Earth's daily rotation reveals sky objects from East to West, and makes them appear to be moving from the eastern horizon across the sky to the western horizon, where they disappear again to the observer, dipping down again to the unseen sky.  The western horizon, where the Sun's path meets the horizon in the West, is called the [[Descendant (astrology)|Descendant]].\n\nThe other very important ''angle'' of the chart is the [[Midheaven]] (also called the M.C. for the Latin ''Medium coeli'', or \"middle of the sky.\")  The Midheaven represents the highest point in the sky reached by the Sun, or its ''culmination'', as it crosses from one horizon to the other\u2014the noon point in a chart which is plotted for dawn.  At the Earth's [[equator]], it is the point on the ecliptic which is directly overhead from the observer; as the observer moves north or south from the Equator, the midheaven appears to withdraw, so that from points north of the equator, the noon point of the Sun appears to lie in the southern sky, and south of the equator, it appears in the northern sky.  \n\nThe point opposite the Midheaven, which is in the unseen sky, and would be the midnight point in a chart cast for dawn, is the ''anticulmination'' of the Sun, or the [[Imum Coeli]], which is Latin for the \"bottom of the sky.\"  This is the last of the four ''angles.''\n\nThe angles are crucial to the understanding of the meaning of the sky map to the individual or event for which it was cast.  There are no more individual points in chart.  Much has been made by astrologers (deriving from the [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] tradition that is closely linked to much of modern astrological practice) of the quality of \"coming into being\" that they represent, as they represent going from the unseen to the seen.  Since Theosophical astrology was tied to the idea of manifesting from the spiritual to the bodily form, the angles have come to symbolize this connection.  However, even if this theory is discounted, as Bernadette Brady{{Ref|Brady}} has noted, to all ancient peoples, the horizon was the place where the gods came into contact with the earth and became available to human supplication.  Without this connection, the spiritual realm and the world had nothing to do with one another, and for that reason, astrology, which seeks to communicate between the two spheres, must use this place of connection to derive significance for the world from the sky.\n\nFor delineation of each of the angles, see:\n*[[Ascendant]]\n**[[Accidental Ascendant]]\n**[[Equatorial Ascendant]]\n*[[Midheaven]]\n*[[Descendant (astrology)|Descendant]]\n*[[Imum Coeli]]\n*[[Angular house]]\n*[[Succedent house]]\n*[[Cadent house]]\n\n\n==References==\n# {{note|Brady}}Bernadette Brady.

Likewise, '''permanent daylight saving time''' refers to the year-round observation of [[daylight saving time]] (DST). Both permanent standard time and permanent DST eliminate the practice of biannual clock changes, specifically the advancement of clocks by one hour from standard time to DST in [[Spring (season)|spring]] (commonly called \"spring forward\") and the retraction of clocks by one hour from DST to standard time in [[Autumn|fall]] (\"fall back\"). In the [[United States]], [[Arizona]] (with the exception of the [[Navajo Nation]]), [[Hawaii]], and all [[Territories of the United States|territories]] observe permanent standard time. Observation of permanent DST is forbidden by the [[Uniform Time Act]].\n\nThe Uniform Time Act of 1966 formalized the specification of [[time zone]]s and the [[Daylight saving time in the United States|dates of DST observation]] in the United States. Prior to this law, time zones and DST observation in America were independent and erratic across states and cities.<ref name=\"downing 2005\">{{cite news |last1=Downing |first1=Michael |title=Endless Summer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/09/opinion/endless-summer.html |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=The New York Times |date=9 August 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"downing 2018\">{{cite news |last1=Downing |first1=Michael |title=100 years later, the madness of daylight saving time endures |url=https://theconversation.com/100-years-later-the-madness-of-daylight-saving-time-endures-93048 |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=The Conversation |date=9 March 2018}}</ref> The law requires states to change clocks biannually between standard time and DST on federally mandated dates, and it permits states to opt out of DST observation altogether and remain on permanent Standard Time. It does not permit observation of permanent DST. \n\n==Permanent standard time==\n\nPrior to the introduction of DST, all American states observed permanent Standard Time. Presently, Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation), Hawaii, and all US territories observe permanent Standard Time.

A number of states have pursued state bills, resolutions, and referenda to indicate intention to observe permanent DST if federal law would permit it. \n\nAs a work-around to the Uniform Time Act's prohibition on permanent DST, a block of states in New England has proposed a statutory move from the [[Eastern Time Zone]] to the [[Atlantic Time Zone]] (Atlantic Time being one hour ahead of Eastern Time), and then abolishing biannual clock changes. If approved by the [[Department of Transportation]], such a move would effectively put these states on permanent DST without needing to await amendment to the Uniform Time Act by Congress. Similarly, on the West Coast, Washington state passed both a bill for permanent DST (which again cannot be enacting without change to federal law by Congress) and an alternative bill to move the state's official observation from the [[Pacific Time Zone]] to the [[Mountain Time Zone]].<ref name=\"30states\" />\n\nIn 2019, Florida [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Marco Rubio]] introduced \"The Sunshine Protection Act\" to permit states to observe permanent DST.

The practice was unpopular and promptly repealed after each war; however, lobbyists from the petroleum industry lobbied to restore DST, as they had noticed it actually increased fuel consumption. Petroleum lobbyists joined with lobbyists from golf and candy corporations in the 1980s to form the National Daylight Saving Time Coalition, and they have twice since succeeded in extending the length of DST's observation from six months to seven in 1986, and again to eight months in 2005.<ref name=\"downing 2005\" /><ref name=\"cohen\">{{cite news |last1=Cohen |first1=Benyamin |title=Do we still need daylight saving time? |url=https://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/stories/do-we-still-need-daylight-saving-time |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=Mother Nature Network |date=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"porter\">{{cite news |last1=Porter |first1=Catherine |title=Why daylight saving time is bad for the environment |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2008/03/09/why_daylight_saving_time_is_bad_for_the_environment.html |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=The Star |date=9 March 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"schlanger\">{{cite news |last1=Schlanger |first1=Zo\u00eb |title=Daylight Saving Time as Americans know it was instituted by corporate lobbies, not farmers |url=https://qz.com/1120488/daylight-saving-time-as-americans-know-it-was-instituted-by-corporate-lobbies-not-farmers/ |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=Quartz |date=4 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"houston\">{{cite news |last1=Houston |first1=Paul |title=Congress OKs 3 More Weeks of Daylight Time |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-06-25-mn-20202-story.html |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=25 June 1986}}</ref> The observation of DST has also been found to increase residential energy costs and pollution costs by several million dollars per year.<ref name=\"kotchen 2008\">{{cite news |title=Does daylight saving time save electricity? |url=https://voxeu.org/article/does-daylight-saving-time-save-electricity |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research |date=5 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nIn 2018, the European Commission performed a public survey<ref name=\"europe\">{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-discontinuing-seasonal-changes-time-directive-639_en.pdf|access-date=May 15, 2019|title=Discontinuing seasonal changes of time and repealing Directive 2000/84/EC}}</ref> and discovered that 84 percent of European citizens were in favor of discontinuing DST switches.

Likewise, '''permanent daylight saving time''' refers to the year-round observation of [[daylight saving time]] (DST). Both permanent standard time and permanent DST eliminate the practice of biannual clock changes, specifically the advancement of clocks by one hour from standard time to DST in [[Spring (season)|spring]] (commonly called \"spring forward\") and the retraction of clocks by one hour from DST to standard time in [[Autumn|fall]] (\"fall back\"). In the [[United States]], [[Arizona]] (with the exception of the [[Navajo Nation]]), [[Hawaii]], and all [[Territories of the United States|territories]] observe permanent standard time. Observation of permanent DST is forbidden by the [[Uniform Time Act]].\n\nThe Uniform Time Act of 1966 formalized the specification of [[time zone]]s and the [[Daylight saving time in the United States|dates of DST observation]] in the United States. Prior to this law, time zones and DST observation in America were independent and erratic across states and cities.<ref name=\"downing 2005\">{{cite news |last1=Downing |first1=Michael |title=Endless Summer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/09/opinion/endless-summer.html |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=The New York Times |date=9 August 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"downing 2018\">{{cite news |last1=Downing |first1=Michael |title=100 years later, the madness of daylight saving time endures |url=https://theconversation.com/100-years-later-the-madness-of-daylight-saving-time-endures-93048 |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=The Conversation |date=9 March 2018}}</ref> The law requires states to change clocks biannually between standard time and DST on federally mandated dates, and it permits states to opt out of DST observation altogether and remain on permanent Standard Time. It does not, however, permit observation of permanent DST. \n\n==Permanent standard time==\n\nPrior to the introduction of DST, all American states observed permanent Standard Time. Presently, Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation), Hawaii, and all US territories observe permanent Standard Time.

A number of states have pursued state bills, resolutions, and referenda to indicate intention to observe DST permanently year-round if federal law would permit them to do so. As a work-around to the Uniform Time Act, a block of states in New England proposed adoption of year-round Atlantic Standard Time, which is the time zone that lies to the east of Eastern Standard Time. Such a move would be the equivalent of observing DST year-round for the Eastern time zone. This option would not need a congressional vote, instead these state proposals could be approved by the federal [[Department of Transportation]]. Similarly, Washington state enacted a bill for year-round DST pending congressional approval, but the state also has an alternative bill to enact year-round observance of Mountain Standard Time (instead of Pacific Standard Time).<ref name=\"30states\" />\n\nIn 2019, Florida [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Marco Rubio]] introduced \"The Sunshine Protection Act\" to permit states to observe permanent DST. The bill was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]], where it has yet to receive a hearing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/670|title=S.670 - 116th Congress (2019-2020): Sunshine Protection Act of 2019|last=Rubio|first=Marco|date=2019-03-06|website=www.congress.gov|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\nThe first enactment of DST was during World Wars I and II, as an attempt conserve fuel. The practice was unpopular and promptly repealed after each war; however, lobbyists from the petroleum industry lobbied to restore DST, as they had noticed it actually increased fuel consumption. Petroleum lobbyists joined with lobbyists from golf and candy corporations in the 1980s to form the National Daylight Saving Time Coalition, and they have twice since succeeded in extending the length of DST's observation from six months to seven in 1986, and again to eight months in 2005.<ref name=\"downing 2005\" /><ref name=\"cohen\">{{cite news |last1=Cohen |first1=Benyamin |title=Do we still need daylight saving time? |url=https://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/stories/do-we-still-need-daylight-saving-time |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=Mother Nature Network |date=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"porter\">{{cite news |last1=Porter |first1=Catherine |title=Why daylight saving time is bad for the environment |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2008/03/09/why_daylight_saving_time_is_bad_for_the_environment.html |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=The Star |date=9 March 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"schlanger\">{{cite news |last1=Schlanger |first1=Zo\u00eb |title=Daylight Saving Time as Americans know it was instituted by corporate lobbies, not farmers |url=https://qz.com/1120488/daylight-saving-time-as-americans-know-it-was-instituted-by-corporate-lobbies-not-farmers/ |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=Quartz |date=4 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"houston\">{{cite news |last1=Houston |first1=Paul |title=Congress OKs 3 More Weeks of Daylight Time |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-06-25-mn-20202-story.html |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=25 June 1986}}</ref> The observation of DST has also been found to increase residential energy costs and pollution costs by several million dollars per year.<ref name=\"kotchen 2008\">{{cite news |title=Does daylight saving time save electricity? |url=https://voxeu.org/article/does-daylight-saving-time-save-electricity |accessdate=23 April 2020 |publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research |date=5 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nIn 2018, the European Commission performed a public survey<ref name=\"europe\">{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-discontinuing-seasonal-changes-time-directive-639_en.pdf|access-date=May 15, 2019|title=Discontinuing seasonal changes of time and repealing Directive 2000/84/EC}}</ref> and discovered that 84 percent of European citizens were in favor of discontinuing DST switches.

These inscriptions locate them between [[Subartu]] in the north, and [[Marhashe]] and [[Elam]] in the south. They were a prominent nomadic tribe who lived in the Zagros mountains in the time of the [[Akkadian Empire]].\n\n[[Sargon the Great]] ([[reigned|r.]] circa 2340 \u2013 2284 BCE) also mentions them among his subject lands, listing them between [[Lullubi]], [[Armanum]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] to the north; [[Nikku]] and [[Der (Sumer)|Der]] to the south. According to one stele, [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]]'s army of 360,000 soldiers defeated the Gutian king Gula'an, despite having 90,000 slain by the Gutians.\n\nThe epic ''[[Cuthean Legend of Naram-Sin]]'' claims ''Gutium'' among the lands  raided by [[Annubanini]] of [[Lulubum]] during the reign of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] (c. 2254\u20132218 BCE).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5P86eKIOJjgC&pg=PA709 Reallexikon der Assyriologie und vorderasiatischen Arch\u00e4ologie By Erich Ebling, Bruno]</ref> Contemporary year-names for [[Shar-kali-sharri]] of Akkad indicate that in one unknown year of his reign, Shar-kali-sharri captured [[Sharlag]] king of Gutium, while in another year, \"the yoke was imposed on Gutium\".<ref>[http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/yearnames/HTML/T2K4.htm Year-names for Sharkalisharri]</ref>\n\n===Prominence during the early 22nd century BCE===\n[[File:The Gutians capturing a Babylonian city.jpg|thumb|The Gutians capturing a Babylonian city, as Akkadians are making a stand outside their city. 19th century illustration.]]\n{{see also|Gutian dynasty of Sumer}}\nAs the [[Akkadians]] went into decline, the Gutians began a campaign, decades-long of [[hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] raids against Mesopotamia. Their raids crippled the economy of Sumer. Travel became unsafe, as did work in the fields, resulting in famine. The Gutians eventually overran Akkad, and as the King List tells us, their army also subdued [[Uruk]] for hegemony of Sumer, in about 2147\u20132050 BCE. However, it seems that autonomous rulers soon arose again in a number of city-states, notably [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]].\n\nThe Gutians seem also to have briefly overrun [[Elam]] at around the same time, towards the close of [[Kutik-Inshushinak]]'s reign (c. 2100 BCE).<ref>Martin Sicker, 2000, ''The Pre-Islamic Middle East'', p. 19,</ref> On a statue of the Gutian king [[Erridupizir]] at [[Nippur]], an inscription imitates his Akkadian predecessors, styling him \"King of Gutium, King of the Four Quarters\".\n\nThe [[Babylonian Chronicles|Weidner Chronicle]] (written c. 500 BCE), portrays the Gutian kings as uncultured and uncouth:\n{{blockquote|''Naram-Sin destroyed the people of [[Babylon]], so twice [[Marduk]] summoned the forces of [[Gutium]] against him. Marduk gave his kingship to the Gutian force. The Gutians were unhappy people unaware how to revere the gods, ignorant of the right cultic practices.\n''[[Utu-hengal]], the fisherman, caught a fish at the edge of the sea for an offering. That fish should not be offered to another god until it had been offered to Marduk, but the Gutians took the boiled fish from his hand before it was offered, so by his august command, Marduk removed the Gutian force from the rule of his land and gave it to Utu-hengal.''}}\n\n=== Decline from the late 22nd century BCE onwards ===\n[[File:Utu-Khegal, Prince of the Summerian city of Erech, imploring victory against the Gutian king Tirikan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Utu-Khegal]], Prince of the Summerian city of Uruk, praying for victory against the Gutian king [[Tirigan]].]]\nThe Sumerian ruler [[Utu-Khegal]], Prince of the Summerian city of Uruk is similarly credited on the King List with defeating the Gutian ruler [[Tirigan]], and removing the Guti from the country in circa 2050 BCE ([[short chronology timeline|short chronology]]).<ref name=\"ox\">[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.2.1.6&display=Crit&charenc=gcirc&lineid=t216.p1#t216.p1 ETCSL - The victory of Utu-\u1e2be\u011dal]</ref>\n\nFollowing this, [[Ur-Nammu]] of [[Ur]] ordered the destruction of Gutium.
