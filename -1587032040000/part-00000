In a 2012 blog entry, he wrote, {{quote|As a footballer I think first and foremost that a homosexual colleague is afraid of the reception he could get from the fans. My impression is that the players would not have a problem accepting a homosexual. Homosexuality in football is a taboo subject. The atmosphere on the pitch and in the stands is tough. The mechanisms are primitive, and it is often expressed through a classic stereotype that a real man should be brave, strong and aggressive. And it is not the image that a football fan associates with a gay person. The problem for me is that a lot of football fans are stuck in a time of intolerance that does not deserve to be compared with modern society's development in the last decades. While the rest of the world has been more liberal, civilised and less prejudiced, the world of football remains stuck in the past when it comes to tolerance. Homosexuals are in need of a hero. They are in need of someone who dares to stand up for their sexuality.<ref>{{cite

In a 2012 blog entry, he wrote, {{quote|As a footballer I think first and foremost that a homosexual colleague is afraid of the reception he could get from the fans. My impression is that the players would not have a problem accepting a homosexual. Homosexuality in football is a taboo subject. The atmosphere on the pitch and in the stands is tough. The mechanisms are primitive, and it is often expressed through a classic stereotype that a real man should be brave, strong and aggressive. And it is not the image that a football fan associates with a gay person. The problem for me is that a lot of football fans are stuck in a time of intolerance that does not deserve to be compared with modern society's development in the last decades. While the rest of the world has been more liberal, civilised and less prejudiced, the world of football remains stuck in the past when it comes to tolerance. Homosexuals are in need of a hero. They are in need of someone who dares to stand up for their sexuality.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/football-needs-gay-hero-says-manchester-united-goalkeeper-575849.html|title=Football needs gay hero, says Manchester United goalkeeper|publisher=Breaking News|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{NFT player}}\n*[http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/PlayerInfo/4826 National team data] {{in lang|da}}\n*{{Cite web |url=http://resol.dr.dk/sportservice_person.aspx?personid=435089 |title=Career stats at Danmarks Radio |access-date=4 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825174527/http://resol.dr.dk/sportservice_person.aspx?personid=435089 |archive-date=25 August 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all |language=da}}\n\n{{Denmark squad UEFA Euro 2012}}\n{{Helsingborgs IF squad}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lindegaard, Anders}}\n[[Category:1984 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Danish footballers]]\n[[Category:Denmark youth international footballers]]\n[[Category:Denmark international footballers]]\n[[Category:Association football goalkeepers]]\n[[Category:Danish Superliga players]]\n[[Category:Danish 1st Division players]]\n[[Category:Odense Boldklub players]]\n[[Category:Kolding FC players]]\n[[Category:Eliteserien players]]\n[[Category:Aalesunds FK players]]\n[[Category:Danish expatriate footballers]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Norway]]\n[[Category:Manchester United F.C. players]]\n[[Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Preston North End F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Premier League players]]\n[[Category:English Football League players]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in England]]\n[[Category:Helsingborgs IF players]]\n[[Category:Allsvenskan players]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Twin people from Denmark]]\n[[Category:Twin sportspeople]]\n[[Category:UEFA Euro 2012 players]]\n[[Category:Danish expatriate sportspeople in England]]\n[[Category:Danish expatriate sportspeople in Norway]]\n[[Category:LGBT rights activists from Denmark]]\n[[Category:Burnley F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Odense]]\n", "name_user": "2a01:6500:a039:a805:f169:7245:46c2:63d9", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Lindegaard"}

{"title_page": "Greek to me", "text_new": "'''That's Greek to me''' or '''it's (all) Greek to me''' is an [[idiom]] in English, expressing that something is difficult to understand.\n\nThe idiom is typically used with respect to something of a foreign nature, however it may be considered an insult to some. Complexity or imprecision of [[Speech|verbal]] or [[Writing|written]] expression or [[diagram]], often containing excessive use of [[jargon]], [[dialect]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[symbols]], or diagrams. The metaphor makes reference to [[Greek language|Greek]] (either [[Ancient Greek|ancient]] or [[Modern Greek|modern]]), as an [[Archetype|archetypal]] foreign form of communication both written and spoken. Technically, the phrase is classified as a [[dead metaphor]], meaning that its components cannot be used separately, unlike for example the dormant metaphor \"foot of the hill\", which permits saying \"that hill has a tree at its foot\". \n\n==Origins==\nIt may have been a direct translation of a similar phrase in {{lang-la|\"Graecum est; non legitur\"}} (\"it is Greek, [therefore] it cannot be read\"). This phrase was increasingly used by monk scribes in the Middle Ages, as knowledge of the Greek alphabet and language was dwindling among those who were copying manuscripts in monastic libraries.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nRecorded usage of the metaphor in English traces back to the [[early modern period]]. It appears in 1599 in Shakespeare's play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', as spoken by [[Servilius Casca]] to [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] after a festival in which Caesar was offered a crown:\n{{quote|text=\nCASSIUS: Did Cicero say any thing?<br/>\nCASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek.<br/>\nCASSIUS: To what effect?<br/>\nCASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, '''it was Greek to me'''. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.\n|source=[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[The Tragedy of Julius Caesar]]'' (1599)}}\n\nHere, Casca's literal ignorance of Greek is the source of the phrase, using its common meaning to play on the uncertainty among the conspirators about [[Cicero]]'s attitude to Caesar's increasingly regal behaviour. Shakespeare was not the only author to use the expression.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nIt was also used in 1603 by [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] in his play ''[[Patient Grissel]]'':\n{{quote|text=\nFAR: Asking for a Greek poet, to him he fails. I\u2019ll be sworn he knows not so much as one character of the tongue.<br/>\nRIC: Why, then it\u2019s Greek to him.\n|source=[[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]], ''[[Patient Grissel]]'' (1603)}}\n\nThe expression is almost exclusively used with reference to the speaker (generally \"Greek to me\"); Dekker's \"Greek to him\" is rare.\n\n==Variations==\nDifferent languages have similar formulations. Many have picked the point of reference to be a foreign language with another [[alphabet]] or [[writing system]].\n\nThis is an example of the usage of [[demonym]]s in relation to the ability of a people to be understood, comparable to the development of the words ''[[barbarian]]'' (one who babbles), ''Nemec'' ([[Slavic language|Slavic]] for \"the mute one\" indicating [[Germans]]).\n\n===In other languages===\nIn an article published by Arnold L. Rosenberg in the language journal ''[[Lingvisticae Investigationes|Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes]]'', he claimed that there was a popular \"consensus\" that [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was the \"hardest\" language, since various non-English languages most frequently used the Chinese language in their equivalent expression to the English idiom \"it's all Greek to me\".<ref>Rosenberg, A.

me''' or '''it's (all) Greek to me''' is an [[idiom]] in English, expressing that something is difficult to understand.\n\nThe idiom is typically used with respect to something of a foreign nature, however it may be considered an insult to some. Complexity or imprecision of [[Speech|verbal]] or [[Writing|written]] expression or [[diagram]], often containing excessive use of [[jargon]], [[dialect]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[symbols]], or diagrams. The metaphor makes reference to [[Greek language|Greek]] (either [[Ancient Greek|ancient]] or [[Modern Greek|modern]]), as an [[Archetype|archetypal]] foreign form of communication both written and spoken. Technically, the phrase is classified as a [[dead metaphor]], meaning that its components cannot be used separately, unlike for example the dormant metaphor \"foot of the hill\", which permits saying \"that hill has a tree at its foot\". \n\n==Origins==\nIt may have been a direct translation of a similar phrase in {{lang-la|\"Graecum est; non legitur\"}} (\"it is Greek, [therefore] it cannot be read\"). This phrase was increasingly used by monk scribes in the Middle Ages, as knowledge of the Greek alphabet and language was dwindling among those who were copying manuscripts in monastic libraries.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nRecorded usage of the metaphor in English traces back to the [[early modern period]]. It appears in 1599 in Shakespeare's play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', as spoken by [[Servilius Casca]] to [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] after a festival in which Caesar was offered a crown:\n{{quote|text=\nCASSIUS: Did Cicero say any thing?<br/>\nCASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek.<br/>\nCASSIUS: To what effect?<br/>\nCASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, '''it was Greek to me'''. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.\n|source=[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[The Tragedy of Julius Caesar]]'' (1599)}}\n\nHere, Casca's literal ignorance of Greek is the source of the phrase, using its common meaning to play on the uncertainty among the conspirators about [[Cicero]]'s attitude to Caesar's increasingly regal behaviour. Shakespeare was not the only author to use the expression.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nIt was also used in 1603 by [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] in his play ''[[Patient Grissel]]'':\n{{quote|text=\nFAR: Asking for a Greek poet, to him he fails. I\u2019ll be sworn he knows not so much as one character of the tongue.<br/>\nRIC: Why, then it\u2019s Greek to him.\n|source=[[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]], ''[[Patient Grissel]]'' (1603)}}\n\nThe expression is almost exclusively used with reference to the speaker (generally \"Greek to me\"); Dekker's \"Greek to him\" is rare.\n\n==Variations==\nDifferent languages have similar formulations. Many have picked the point of reference to be a foreign language with another [[alphabet]] or [[writing system]].\n\nThis is an example of the usage of [[demonym]]s in relation to the ability of a people to be understood, comparable to the development of the words ''[[barbarian]]'' (one who babbles), ''Nemec'' ([[Slavic language|Slavic]] for \"the mute one\" indicating [[Germans]]).\n\n===In other languages===\nIn an article published by Arnold L. Rosenberg in the language journal ''[[Lingvisticae Investigationes|Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes]]'', he claimed that there was a popular \"consensus\" that [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was the \"hardest\" language, since various non-English languages most frequently used the Chinese language in their equivalent expression to the English idiom \"it's all Greek to me\".<ref>Rosenberg, A. (1979). Lingvistic\u00e6 Investigationes:III 3(2). 323-339</ref> Also, David Moser of the University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies made the same claim as Arnold L. Rosenberg.<ref name=\"Moser\">Moser, D. P\u012bny\u012bn.Info. Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard.

The only [[Dutch people|Dutchman]] so far to become [[pope]], he was the last non-Italian pope until [[John Paul II]], 455 years later.\n\nBorn in the [[Episcopal principality of Utrecht]], Adrian studied at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] in the [[Low Countries]], where he rose to the position of professor of [[theology]], also serving as [[rector (academia)|rector]] (the equivalent of vice-chancellor). In 1507, he became the [[tutor]] of the future [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], who later trusted him as both his [[Ambassador|emissary]] and his [[regent]].\n\nIn 1516, Adrian was appointed by Charles, now King of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], bishop of [[Tortosa]], [[Spain]], and soon thereafter [[Grand Inquisitor]] of the kingdoms of [[Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. He was created cardinal by [[Pope Leo X]] in 1517 and elected pope in 1522 as a compromise candidate after Leo's death.\n\nAdrian came to the papacy in the midst of one of its greatest crises, threatened not only by [[Lutheranism]] to the north but also by the advance of the [[Ottoman Turks]] to the east. He refused to compromise with Lutheranism theologically, demanding [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s condemnation as a [[heretic]]. However, he is noted for having attempted to [[Counter-Reformation|reform]] the Catholic Church administratively in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]].  Adrian's remarkable admission that the turmoil of the Church was the fault of the [[Roman Curia]] itself was read at the 1522\u20131523 [[Diet of Nuremberg]].\n\nHis efforts at reform, however, proved fruitless, as they were resisted by most of his [[Renaissance]] ecclesiastical contemporaries, and he did not live long enough to see his efforts through to their conclusion. He was succeeded by the second [[Medici]] pope, [[Clement VII]].\n\nAdrian VI and his eventual successor [[Marcellus II]] are the only popes of the modern era to retain their [[baptismal name]]s after their election.\n\n==Early life==\n[[Image:Geboortehuis van Paus Adriaan.jpg|thumb|upright|Pope Adrian VI's birthplace in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]]]\nAdriaan Florensz was born on 2 March 1459 in the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], which was then the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht,<ref name=loughlin/> a part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He was born into modest circumstances as the son of Florens Boeyensz, also born in Utrecht, and his wife Geertruid. He had three older brothers, Jan, Cornelius, and Claes.<ref>Rodocanachi, p. 301.</ref>  Adrian consistently signed with ''Adrianus Florentii'' or ''Adrianus de Traiecto'' (\"Adrian of Utrecht\") in later life, suggesting that his family did not yet have a surname but used patronymics only.<ref name=martens>Jos Martens, [http://histoforum.net/recensies/adrianus.html Bio and review of Verweij book] at Histoforum Magazine.</ref>\n\nAdrian was probably raised in a house on the corner of the Brandsteeg and Oude Gracht that was owned by his grandfather Boudewijn (Boeyen, for short). His father, a carpenter and likely [[shipwright]], died when Adrian was 10 years or younger.<ref>Gerard Weel [http://www.gerardweel.nl/adrianus/adrianus_1.php  Life and times of Adrian of Utrecht] (in Dutch)</ref> Adrian studied from a very young age under the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], either at [[Zwolle]] or [[Deventer]] and was also a student of the [[Latin school]] (now ''[[Gymnasium Celeanum]]'') in [[Zwolle]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Coster |title=Metamorfoses|pages=17, 19 |chapter=De Latijnse School te Zwolle }} Rodocanachi, p. 301-302.</ref>\n\n==Leuven==\nIn June 1476, he started his studies at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]],<ref>The date was 1 June 1476 according to the ''Matriculation Register'': Rodocanachi, p. 302 and n. 1.</ref> where he pursued philosophy, [[theology]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], thanks to a scholarship granted by [[Margaret of York]], Duchess of Burgundy. In 1478 he had the title of ''Primus Philosophiae'', as well as that of ''Magister Artium''  (that is, he took his undergraduate degree). In 1488 he was chosen by the Faculty of Arts to be their representative on the Council of the University.<ref>Rodocanachi, p. 302.</ref>\n\nOn 30 June 1490, Adrian was ordained a priest.<ref>David Cheney, ''Catholic-Hierarchy:''  [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bflo.html ''Adrian Florenszoom Dedel''.] Retrieved: 2016-05-14.</ref>\n\nAfter the regular 12 years of study, Adrian became a [[Doctorate|Doctor]] of Theology in 1491. He had been a teacher at the University since 1490, was chosen [[vice-chancellor]] of the university in 1493, and [[dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[St. Peter's Church, Leuven|St. Peter's]] in 1498. In the latter function he was permanent vice-chancellor of the University and de facto in charge of hiring. His lectures were published, as recreated from his students' notes; among those who attended was the young [[Erasmus]]. Adrian offered him a professorate in 1502, but Erasmus refused.<ref name=martens/>\n\nIn November 1506 [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy]], became [[Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands]] and chose Adrian as her advisor. The next year [[Emperor Maximilian I]] appointed him also [[tutor]] to his seven-year-old grandson, and Margaret's nephew, who in 1519 became [[Emperor Charles V]]. By 1512 Adrian was Charles's advisor, and his court obligations were so time-consuming that he quit his positions at the university.<ref name=martens/>\n\n==Spain==\nIn 1515, Charles sent Adrian to Spain to convince his maternal grandfather, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], that the Spanish lands should come under his rule, and not Charles's Spanish-born younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], whom his grandfather had in mind. Adrian succeeded in that just before Ferdinand's death in January 1516.<ref name=martens/> Ferdinand of Aragon,<ref>Paolo Giovio, ''Vita Hadriani VI'',  p. 119.</ref> and subsequently Charles V, appointed Adrian [[Bishop of Tortosa]], which was approved by Pope Leo X on 18 August 1516.<ref>Gulik and Eubel, p. 186.</ref> He was consecrated by Bishop Diego Ribera de Toledo.\n\nOn 14 November 1516 the King commissioned him [[Inquisitor]] General of [[Aragon]].\n\nIn his fifth Consistory for the creation of cardinals, on 1 July 1517, [[Pope Leo X]] (1513\u201321) named thirty-one [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] among whom was Adrianus de Traiecto,<ref name=loughlin/> naming him Cardinal Priest of the [[Basilica]] of [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome|Saints John and Paul]] on the Coelian Hill.<ref>Gulik and Eubel, pp. 16 and 63.</ref>\n\nDuring the minority of Charles V, Adrian was named to serve with Cardinal [[Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros]] as [[List of Spanish regents|co-regent of Spain]]. After the death of Jimenez, Adrian was appointed (14 March 1518) General of the Reunited [[Inquisition]]s of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], in which capacity he acted until his departure for [[Rome]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Adrian (popes) |display=Adrian |volume=1 |page=216}}</ref> When Charles V left Spain for the Netherlands in 1520, he appointed Cardinal Adrian [[Regent of Spain]], during which time he had to deal with the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]].\n[[File:Pope Adrian VI.JPG|thumb|Pope Adrian VI, 1598 engraving by [[Th\u00e9odore Galle]]]]\n\n==Papal election==\n{{Main|1521\u201322 Papal conclave}}\nIn the conclave after the death of the Medici [[Pope Leo X]], Leo's cousin, Cardinal [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio de' Medici]], was the leading figure. With Spanish and French cardinals in a deadlock, the absent Adrian was proposed as a compromise and on 9 January 1522 he was elected by an almost unanimous vote. Charles V was delighted upon hearing that his tutor had been elected to the papacy but soon realised that Adrian VI was determined to reign impartially. [[Francis I of France]], who feared that Adrian would become a tool of the Emperor, and had uttered threats of a schism, later relented and sent an embassy to present his homage.<ref>Baumgartner, p. 95</ref>\n\nFears of a Spanish [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] based on the strength of his relationship with the Emperor as his former tutor and regent proved baseless, and Adrian, having notified the College of Cardinals of his acceptance,<ref>{{cite book|author=Adrian VI|title=Copia Brevis S.

He had forbidden elaborate decorations, and many people stayed away for fear of the plague that was raging. Pope Adrian was crowned at [[St. Peter's Basilica]] on 31 August 1522, at the age of 63.<ref>Baumgartner, pp. 97\u201398</ref>\n\n===Reformer===\nHe immediately entered upon the path of the reformer. The 1908 edition of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' characterised the task that faced him:\n\n:''\"To extirpate inveterate abuses; to reform a court which thrived on corruption, and detested the very name of reform; to hold in leash young and warlike princes, ready to bound at each other's throats; to stem the rising torrent of revolt in Germany; to save Christendom from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], who from [[Belgrade]] now threatened [[Hungary]], and if [[Rhodes]] fell would be masters of the [[Mediterranean]] - these were herculean labours for one who was in his sixty-third year, had never seen Italy, and was sure to be despised by the Romans as a 'barbarian'.''<ref name=loughlin>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope Adrian VI}}</ref>\n\nHis plan was to attack notorious abuses one by one; however, in his attempt to improve the system of [[indulgences]] he was hampered by his cardinals.  He found reduction of the number of [[Dispensation (canon law)|matrimonial dispensation]]s to be impossible, as the income had been farmed out for years in advance by [[Pope Leo X]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Papacy==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}\n{{see also|Cardinals created by Adrian VI}}\nAdrian VI was not successful as a peacemaker among Christian [[prince]]s, whom he hoped to unite in a war against the Turks. In August 1523 he was forced into an alliance with the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]], [[England]], and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] against [[France]]; meanwhile, in 1522 [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1520\u201366) had conquered [[Rhodes]].\n[[File:Portrait of Pope Adrian VI.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Pope Adrian VI (1568)]]\nIn his reaction to the early stages of the [[Lutheran]] revolt, Adrian VI did not completely understand the gravity of the situation. At the [[Diet of Nuremberg]], which opened in December 1522, he was represented by [[Francesco Chieregati]], whose private instructions contain the frank admission that the disorder of the Church was perhaps the fault of the [[Roman Curia]] itself, and that it should be reformed.<ref>Pigafetta, Antonio and Theodore J. Cachey, ''The first voyage around the world, 1519\u20131522'', (University of Toronto Press, 2007), 128.</ref><ref>Hans Joachim Hillerbrand, ''The division of Christendom: Christianity in the sixteenth century'', (Westminster John Knox Press, 2007), 141.</ref> However, the former professor and Inquisitor General was strongly opposed to any change in doctrine and demanded that [[Martin Luther]] be punished for teaching [[Christian heresy|heresy]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHe made only one cardinal in the course of his pontificate, [[Willem van Enckevoirt]], made a [[cardinal-priest]] in a [[papal consistory|consistory]] held on September 10, 1523.\n\nAdrian VI held no beatifications in his pontificate but canonized Saints [[Antoninus of Florence]] and [[Benno|Benno of Meissen]] on 31 May 1523.\n\nCharles V's ambassador in Rome, Juan Manuel, lord of Belmonte, wrote that he was worried that Charles's influence over Adrian waned after Adrian's election, writing \" The Pope is \"deadly afraid\" of the College of Cardinals. He does whatever two or three cardinals write to him in the name of the college.\"<ref>British History Online. ([http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/spain/vol2/pp412-419 15 April 1522 entry])</ref>\n\n[[File:SantaMariaAnima-TombaAdrianoVI01-SteO153.JPG|thumb|left|The funeral monument for Adrian VI in [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]] in [[Rome]]]]\n\n==Death==\nAdrian VI died in [[Rome]] on 14 September 1523, after one year, eight months and six days as pope. Most of his official papers were lost after his death. He published ''Quaestiones in quartum sententiarum praesertim circa sacramenta'' (Paris, 1512, 1516, 1518, 1537; Rome, 1522), and ''Quaestiones quodlibeticae XII.'' (1st ed., Leuven, 1515). He is buried in the [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]] church in Rome.\n\nHe bequeathed property in the Low Countries for the foundation of a college at the University of Leuven that became known as [[Pope's College, Leuven|Pope's College]].\n\nThe pope was mocked by the people of Rome on the [[Pasquino]], and the Romans, who had never taken a liking to a man they saw as a \"barbarian\", rejoiced at his death.\n\n==Pope Adrian VI in popular culture==\n[[File:Engraving of the birthhouse of pope hadrian.jpg|thumb|The birth house of pope Hadrian and accompanying poem. Detail of an engraving of 'Famous Dutch Men and Women'.]]\n\nThe first series of engravings used to educate Dutch school children at the turn of the 18th century includes Adrian VI in its woodcut on 'Famous Dutch Men and Women' with the following [[poem]]:\n:''In Utrecht wijst men nog dit huis den vreemdeling aan, ''\n:''En noemt het om zijn naam 't huis van Paus Adriaan,''\n:''Nog praalt 's mans borstbeeld in den gevel.

The only [[Dutch people|Dutchman]] so far to become [[pope]], he was the last non-Italian pope until [[John Paul II]], 455 years later.\n\nBorn in the [[Episcopal principality of Utrecht]], Adrian studied at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] in the [[Low Countries]], where he rose to the position of professor of [[theology]], also serving as [[rector (academia)|rector]] (the equivalent of vice-chancellor). In 1507, he became the [[tutor]] of the future [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], who later trusted him as both his [[Ambassador|emissary]] and his [[regent]].\n\nIn 1516, Adrian was appointed by Charles, now King of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], bishop of [[Tortosa]], [[Spain]], and soon thereafter [[Grand Inquisitor]] of the kingdoms of [[Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. He was created cardinal by [[Pope Leo X]] in 1517 and elected pope in 1522 as a compromise candidate after Leo's death.\n\nAdrian came to the papacy in the midst of one of its greatest crises, threatened not only by [[Lutheranism]] to the north but also by the advance of the [[Ottoman Turks]] to the east. He refused to compromise with Lutheranism theologically, demanding [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s condemnation as a [[heretic]]. However, he is noted for having attempted to [[Counter-Reformation|reform]] the Catholic Church administratively in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]].  Adrian's remarkable admission that the turmoil of the Church was the fault of the [[Roman Curia]] itself was read at the 1522\u20131523 [[Diet of Nuremberg]].\n\nHis efforts at reform, however, proved fruitless, as they were resisted by most of his [[Renaissance]] ecclesiastical contemporaries, and he did not live long enough to see his efforts through to their conclusion. He was succeeded by the second [[Medici]] pope, [[Clement VII]].\n\nAdrian VI and his eventual successor [[Marcellus II]] are the only popes of the modern era to retain their [[baptismal name]]s after their election.\n\n==Early life==\n[[Image:Geboortehuis van Paus Adriaan.jpg|thumb|upright|Pope Adrian VI's birthplace in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]]]\nAdriaan Florensz was born on 2 March 1459 in the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], which was then the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht,<ref name=loughlin/> a part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He was born into modest circumstances as the son of Florens Boeyensz, also born in Utrecht, and his wife Geertruid. He had three older brothers, Jan, Cornelius, and Claes.<ref>Rodocanachi, p. 301.</ref>  Adrian consistently signed with ''Adrianus Florentii'' or ''Adrianus de Traiecto'' (\"Adrian of Utrecht\") in later life, suggesting that his family did not yet have a surname but used patronymics only.<ref name=martens>Jos Martens, [http://histoforum.net/recensies/adrianus.html Bio and review of Verweij book] at Histoforum Magazine.</ref>\n\nAdrian was probably raised in a house on the corner of the Brandsteeg and Oude Gracht that was owned by his grandfather Boudewijn (Boeyen, for short). His father, a carpenter and likely [[shipwright]], died when Adrian was 10 years or younger.<ref>Gerard Weel [http://www.gerardweel.nl/adrianus/adrianus_1.php  Life and times of Adrian of Utrecht] (in Dutch)</ref> Adrian studied from a very young age under the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], either at [[Zwolle]] or [[Deventer]] and was also a student of the [[Latin school]] (now ''[[Gymnasium Celeanum]]'') in [[Zwolle]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Coster |title=Metamorfoses|pages=17, 19 |chapter=De Latijnse School te Zwolle }} Rodocanachi, p. 301-302.</ref>\n\n==Leuven==\nIn June 1476, he started his studies at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]],<ref>The date was 1 June 1476 according to the ''Matriculation Register'': Rodocanachi, p. 302 and n. 1.</ref> where he pursued philosophy, [[theology]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], thanks to a scholarship granted by [[Margaret of York]], Duchess of Burgundy. In 1478 he had the title of ''Primus Philosophiae'', as well as that of ''Magister Artium''  (that is, he took his undergraduate degree). In 1488 he was chosen by the Faculty of Arts to be their representative on the Council of the University.<ref>Rodocanachi, p. 302.</ref>\n\nOn 30 June 1490, Adrian was ordained a priest.<ref>David Cheney, ''Catholic-Hierarchy:''  [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bflo.html ''Adrian Florenszoom Dedel''.] Retrieved: 2016-05-14.</ref>\n\nAfter the regular 12 years of study, Adrian became a [[Doctorate|Doctor]] of Theology in 1491. He had been a teacher at the University since 1490, was chosen [[vice-chancellor]] of the university in 1493, and [[dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[St. Peter's Church, Leuven|St. Peter's]] in 1498. In the latter function he was permanent vice-chancellor of the University and de facto in charge of hiring. His lectures were published, as recreated from his students' notes; among those who attended was the young [[Erasmus]]. Adrian offered him a professorate in 1502, but Erasmus refused.<ref name=martens/>\n\nIn November 1506 [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy]], became [[Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands]] and chose Adrian as her advisor. The next year [[Emperor Maximilian I]] appointed him also [[tutor]] to his seven-year-old grandson, and Margaret's nephew, who in 1519 became [[Emperor Charles V]]. By 1512 Adrian was Charles's advisor, and his court obligations were so time-consuming that he quit his positions at the university.<ref name=martens/>\n\n==Spain==\nIn 1515, Charles sent Adrian to Spain to convince his maternal grandfather, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], that the Spanish lands should come under his rule, and not Charles's Spanish-born younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], whom his grandfather had in mind. Adrian succeeded in that just before Ferdinand's death in January 1516.<ref name=martens/> Ferdinand of Aragon,<ref>Paolo Giovio, ''Vita Hadriani VI'',  p. 119.</ref> and subsequently Charles V, appointed Adrian [[Bishop of Tortosa]], which was approved by Pope Leo X on 18 August 1516.<ref>Gulik and Eubel, p. 186.</ref> He was consecrated by Bishop Diego Ribera de Toledo.\n\nOn 14 November 1516 the King commissioned him [[Inquisitor]] General of [[Aragon]].\n\nIn his fifth Consistory for the creation of cardinals, on 1 July 1517, [[Pope Leo X]] (1513\u201321) named thirty-one [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] among whom was Adrianus de Traiecto,<ref name=loughlin/> naming him Cardinal Priest of the [[Basilica]] of [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome|Saints John and Paul]] on the Coelian Hill.<ref>Gulik and Eubel, pp. 16 and 63.</ref>\n\nDuring the minority of Charles V, Adrian was named to serve with Cardinal [[Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros]] as [[List of Spanish regents|co-regent of Spain]]. After the death of Jimenez, Adrian was appointed (14 March 1518) General of the Reunited [[Inquisition]]s of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], in which capacity he acted until his departure for [[Rome]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Adrian (popes) |display=Adrian |volume=1 |page=216}}</ref> When Charles V left Spain for the Netherlands in 1520, he appointed Cardinal Adrian [[Regent of Spain]], during which time he had to deal with the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]].\n[[File:Pope Adrian VI.JPG|thumb|Pope Adrian VI, 1598 engraving by [[Th\u00e9odore Galle]]]]\n\n==Papal election==\n{{Main|1521\u201322 Papal conclave}}\nIn the conclave after the death of the Medici [[Pope Leo X]], Leo's cousin, Cardinal [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio de' Medici]], was the leading figure. With Spanish and French cardinals in a deadlock, the absent Adrian was proposed as a compromise and on 9 January 1522 he was elected by an almost unanimous vote. Charles V was delighted upon hearing that his tutor had been elected to the papacy but soon realised that Adrian VI was determined to reign impartially. [[Francis I of France]], who feared that Adrian would become a tool of the Emperor, and had uttered threats of a schism, later relented and sent an embassy to present his homage.<ref>Baumgartner, p. 95</ref>\n\nFears of a Spanish [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] based on the strength of his relationship with the Emperor as his former tutor and regent proved baseless, and Adrian, having notified the College of Cardinals of his acceptance,<ref>{{cite book|author=Adrian VI|title=Copia Brevis S.

He had forbidden elaborate decorations, and many people stayed away for fear of the plague that was raging. Pope Adrian was crowned at [[St. Peter's Basilica]] on 31 August 1522, at the age of 63.<ref>Baumgartner, pp. 97\u201398</ref>\n\n===Reformer===\nHe immediately entered upon the path of the reformer. The 1908 edition of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' characterised the task that faced him:\n\n:''\"To extirpate inveterate abuses; to reform a court which thrived on corruption, and detested the very name of reform; to hold in leash young and warlike princes, ready to bound at each other's throats; to stem the rising torrent of revolt in Germany; to save Christendom from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], who from [[Belgrade]] now threatened [[Hungary]], and if [[Rhodes]] fell would be masters of the [[Mediterranean]] - these were herculean labours for one who was in his sixty-third year, had never seen Italy, and was sure to be despised by the Romans as a 'barbarian'.''<ref name=loughlin>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope Adrian VI}}</ref>\n\nHis plan was to attack notorious abuses one by one; however, in his attempt to improve the system of [[indulgences]] he was hampered by his cardinals.  He found reduction of the number of [[Dispensation (canon law)|matrimonial dispensation]]s to be impossible, as the income had been farmed out for years in advance by [[Pope Leo X]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Papacy==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}\n{{see also|Cardinals created by Adrian VI}}\nAdrian VI was not successful as a peacemaker among Christian [[prince]]s, whom he hoped to unite in a war against the Turks. In August 1523 he was forced into an alliance with the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]], [[England]], and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] against [[France]]; meanwhile, in 1522 [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1520\u201366) had conquered [[Rhodes]].\n[[File:Portrait of Pope Adrian VI.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Pope Adrian VI (1568)]]\nIn his reaction to the early stages of the [[Lutheran]] revolt, Adrian VI did not completely understand the gravity of the situation. At the [[Diet of Nuremberg]], which opened in December 1522, he was represented by [[Francesco Chieregati]], whose private instructions contain the frank admission that the disorder of the Church was perhaps the fault of the [[Roman Curia]] itself, and that it should be reformed.<ref>Pigafetta, Antonio and Theodore J. Cachey, ''The first voyage around the world, 1519\u20131522'', (University of Toronto Press, 2007), 128.</ref><ref>Hans Joachim Hillerbrand, ''The division of Christendom: Christianity in the sixteenth century'', (Westminster John Knox Press, 2007), 141.</ref> However, the former professor and Inquisitor General was strongly opposed to any change in doctrine and demanded that [[Martin Luther]] be punished for teaching [[Christian heresy|heresy]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHe made only one cardinal in the course of his pontificate, [[Willem van Enckevoirt]], made a [[cardinal-priest]] in a [[papal consistory|consistory]] held on September 10, 1523.\n\nAdrian VI held no beatifications in his pontificate but canonized Saints [[Antoninus of Florence]] and [[Benno|Benno of Meissen]] on 31 May 1523.\n\nCharles V's ambassador in Rome, Juan Manuel, lord of Belmonte, wrote that he was worried that Charles's influence over Adrian waned after Adrian's election, writing \" The Pope is \"deadly afraid\" of the College of Cardinals. He does whatever two or three cardinals write to him in the name of the college.\"<ref>British History Online.

Most of his official papers were lost after his death. He published ''Quaestiones in quartum sententiarum praesertim circa sacramenta'' (Paris, 1512, 1516, 1518, 1537; Rome, 1522), and ''Quaestiones quodlibeticae XII.'' (1st ed., Leuven, 1515). He is buried in the [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]] church in Rome.\n\nHe bequeathed property in the Low Countries for the foundation of a college at the University of Leuven that became known as [[Pope's College, Leuven|Pope's College]].\n\nThe pope was mocked by the people of Rome on the [[Pasquino]], and the Romans, who had never taken a liking to a man they saw as a \"barbarian\", rejoiced at his death.\n\n==Pope Adrian VI in popular culture==\n[[File:Engraving of the birthhouse of pope hadrian.jpg|thumb|The birth house of pope Hadrian and accompanying poem.

Rockefeller]]'s partners in the formation of the [[Standard Oil Company]] (now Exxon), as well as founder of [[Charles Pratt and Company]] in New York and [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. \n\nRegister graduated from the [[Lawrenceville School]] in New Jersey. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with B.A. in Literature in 1961, he met his wife Catherine Richards in a photography class at  [[ArtCenter College of Design|Pasadena Art Center]] where he studied commercial art. Register also studied painting for a semester at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in Paris,<ref name=\"swart\"/> and later studied at the [[California School of Fine Arts]] in San Francisco.  \n\nIn 1964 the two moved to New York, where Register studied design and television at the [[Pratt Institute]] (founded by his great-grandfather).<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/> They married on February 6, 1964 and together had three children. During this period Register pursued a successful career as an advertising art director at Young & Rubicam and later McCaffrey and McCall &mdash; and lived in a Fifth Avenue apartment.<ref name=\"swart\"/>  In 1972, just after his 33rd birthday and unhappy with his work,<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/> Register excused himself from an important client meeting saying he had a dental appointment, wrote a note to his boss and never returned.

For her debut feature, Sen won the [[National Film Award for Best Direction|Best Director award]] at the [[Indian National Film Awards]]. ''36 Chowringhee Lane'' also won the Grand Prix (the Golden Eagle) at the Manila International Film Festival.\n\nShe followed up this early success with several other films, notably ''[[Paroma]]'' (1984) winning the Silver Lotus at the National Awards for Best Bengali Film, ''[[Sati (film)|Sati]]'' (1989), which won the National Award for Best Original Screenplay, and ''[[Yugant]]'' (1995), which won the National Award for Best Bengali Film.
