Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique.

Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam.

Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Engine ====\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]].

They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. \n* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Planing hulls'' require sufficient power for the boat to slide up onto the surface, which avoids the need to use power to lift water out of the way of the vessel. Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.\n\nA typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water\u2014the \"deep vee\" hull, designed by Ray Hunt, found in approximately 75% of modern power boats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or more [[Diesel engine|diesel engines]].

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]].

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel.

In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n== Accommodations ==\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

In the \"Mrs. Wiggins\" sketch titled ''Flashbacks'', Mr. Tudball (Conway) is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback to when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins (Burnett); and in \"The Family\" sketch ''The Psychiatrist'', [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) and [[Thelma Harper|Mama]] visit a psychiatrist ([[Craig Richard Nelson]]) with Eunice trying to figure out what went wrong with her life. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre. With the changes in cast (Harvey Korman left the series after the 1976\u201377 season and was replaced by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) along with the mediocre ratings (finishing its last season in 66th place), she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later.\n\nThe celebrities in the audience for the final episode included [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Betty White]] and then-husband [[Allen Ludden]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Jim Nabors]] and screen legend [[Lillian Gish]].\n\n''The Carol Burnett Show'' was one of the longest-running variety shows in television history; its conclusion marked the closing of another chapter in television as Burnett was the last of the great comedic talents heading a variety show, and hers was the last offering live entertainment before an audience.\n\n==Featured segments==\n*Introduction: [[FAQ|Q&A]] (Carol Burnett)\n*Duets: [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]\n*\"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" ([[Burt Reynolds]])\n*\"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" \u2013 ''Flashbacks'' (Carol Burnett and Tim Conway) \n*\"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\" ([[James Stewart]])\n*Water Gimmicks:\n**\"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\" ([[Harvey Korman]])\n**\"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Solo Montage:\n**\"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n**\"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Movie Parodies:\n**''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (Carol Burnett and Steve Lawrence)\n**''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Steve Lawrence)\n*\"The Doily Sisters\" (Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence)\n*Favorite Moments:\n**\"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"S-P-L-I-T\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"The Brown Derby\" (Carol Burnett, [[Bob Hope]] and Bing Crosby)\n**\"Newscaster\" (Tim Conway)\n**\"Cobumble\" \u2013 a spoof of ''[[Columbo]]'' (Tim Conway)\n**\"Hand Insurance\" (Carol Burnett and [[Dick Van Dyke]])\n*\"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" \u2013 ''The Psychiatrist'' (Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence and [[Craig Richard Nelson]])\n*Scrapbook: \"[[Salsoul Orchestra|Magic Bird of Fire]]\" (The Ernie Flatt Dancers)\n*Bloopers and Outtakes\n*\"The Charwoman\" (Carol Burnett) \n*Finale: \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\" (Carol Burnett)\n\n==DVD release==\nOn October 3, 2017, [[Time Life]] released ''The Best of The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Final Show'' as a single disc [[DVD]] in Region 1 to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Carol Burnett Show - The Final Show|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Carol-Burnett-Volume-Release/17604}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|0536584}}\n*[https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=liza+minnelli+&f=all&c=tv&advanced=1&p=4&item=T80:0730 \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at the [[Paley Center for Media]]\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special Evening with Carol Burnett, A}}\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\n| series       = [[The Carol Burnett Show]]\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| season       = 11\n| episode      = 24 (279th overall)\n| airdate      = {{Start date|1978|03|29}}\n| production   = 0124\n| writer       = Roger Beatty<br>Rick Hawkins<br>Liz Sage<br>[[Robert Illes]]<br>[[James R.

She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre. With the changes in cast (Harvey Korman left the series after the 1976\u201377 season and was replaced by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) along with the mediocre ratings (finishing its last season in 66th place), she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later.\n\nThe celebrities in the audience for the final episode included [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Betty White]] and then-husband [[Allen Ludden]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Jim Nabors]] and screen legend [[Lillian Gish]].\n\n''The Carol Burnett Show'' was one of the longest-running variety shows in television history; its conclusion marked the closing of another chapter in television as Burnett was the last of the great comedic talents heading a variety show, and hers was the last offering live entertainment before an audience.\n\n==Featured segments==\n*Introduction: [[FAQ|Q&A]] (Carol Burnett)\n*Duets: [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]\n*\"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" ([[Burt Reynolds]])\n*\"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" \u2013 ''Flashbacks'' (Carol Burnett and Tim Conway) \n*\"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\" ([[James Stewart]])\n*Water Gimmicks:\n**\"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\" ([[Harvey Korman]])\n**\"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Solo Montage:\n**\"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n**\"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Movie Parodies:\n**''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (Carol Burnett and Steve Lawrence)\n**''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Steve Lawrence)\n*\"The Doily Sisters\" (Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence)\n*Favorite Moments:\n**\"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"S-P-L-I-T\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"The Brown Derby\" (Carol Burnett, [[Bob Hope]] and Bing Crosby)\n**\"Newscaster\" (Tim Conway)\n**\"Cobumble\" \u2013 a spoof of ''[[Columbo]]'' (Tim Conway)\n**\"Hand Insurance\" (Carol Burnett and [[Dick Van Dyke]])\n*\"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" \u2013 ''The Psychiatrist'' (Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence and [[Craig Richard Nelson]])\n*Scrapbook: \"[[Salsoul Orchestra|Magic Bird of Fire]]\" (The Ernie Flatt Dancers)\n*Bloopers and Outtakes\n*\"The Charwoman\" (Carol Burnett) \n*Finale: \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\" (Carol Burnett)\n\n==DVD release==\nOn October 3, 2017, [[Time Life]] released ''The Best of The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Final Show'' as a single disc [[DVD]] in Region 1 to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Carol Burnett Show - The Final Show|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Carol-Burnett-Volume-Release/17604}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|0536584}}\n*[https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=liza+minnelli+&f=all&c=tv&advanced=1&p=4&item=T80:0730 \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at the [[Paley Center for Media]]\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special Evening with Carol Burnett, A}}\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSummary", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Special_Evening_with_Carol_Burnett"}

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 1, 2005, though it had premiered three days earlier at a special screening at the [[University of Vermont]], [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]]. In the episode, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] go on a second honeymoon to spice up their marriage, but are chased by [[Mel Gibson]] after Peter steals the sequel to ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' from Gibson's private hotel room. Meanwhile, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] take care of [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] at home.\n\n''Family Guy'' had been canceled in 2002 due to low ratings, but was revived by Fox after reruns on [[Adult Swim]] became the cable network's most watched program, and more than three million DVDs of the show were sold. Written by series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] and directed by [[Peter Shin]], much of the plot and many of the technical aspects of the episode, as well as the title, are direct parodies of the [[1959 in film|1959]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]] movie ''[[North by Northwest]]''; in addition, the episode makes use of [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s theme music from that film. The episode contains many cultural references; in the opening sequence Peter lists 29&nbsp;shows that were canceled by Fox after ''Family Guy'' was canceled and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning.\n\nCritical responses to \"North by North Quahog\" were mostly positive, with the opening sequence being praised in particular. The episode was watched by nearly 12 million viewers and received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)]]. Shin won an [[Annie Award]] for Directing in an Animated Television Production for this episode.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the cold open, Peter tells his family that they have \"been canceled\". He then lists all 29 shows, like ''[[Titus (TV series)|Titus]]'' and ''[[Andy Richter Controls the Universe]]'', that were canceled by Fox between the show's cancellation and revival and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning.\n\nAs Peter and Lois are having sex, she yells out [[George Clooney]]'s name, so Peter realizes that she is imagining him as Clooney to maintain her [[libido]]. Lois and Peter decide to take a second [[honeymoon]] to enliven their marriage, and leave their anthropomorphic dog Brian to take care of their children Stewie, Chris, and Meg. Brian is unable to control the children, but Stewie offers to help (in exchange for Brian changing his diaper) and together they manage the home. The pair chaperone a dance at Chris's school, during which the school principal catches Chris in the boys' restroom with [[vodka]] that belongs to his classmate [[Jake Tucker]]. Although Brian and Stewie punish Chris by grounding him, they try to clear his name. Jake's father [[List of Family Guy characters#Tom Tucker|Tom]] refuses to believe Brian and Stewie, so they resort to planting [[cocaine]] in Jake's locker, and Jake is sentenced to [[community service]].\n\nOn the way to their vacation spot, Lois falls asleep. Unfortunately, Peter doesn't pay attention to the road, deciding instead to read a [[comic book]] while driving, and crashes the car into a tree. They are forced to spend their entire honeymoon money on car repairs and are about to return home when Peter discovers that [[actor]]/[[film director|director]] [[Mel Gibson]] has a private suite at a luxurious hotel nearby, \"which he barely uses\". He and Lois then go to the hotel, where Peter poses as Gibson to gain access to his room. When Lois yells out Gibson's name during intercourse, Peter, again, decides to return home. As the two are about to leave, Peter accidentally stumbles upon Gibson's private screening room and discovers a sequel to ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' entitled ''The Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This''. To spare the world from \"...&nbsp;another two hours of Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo-jumbo,\" Peter steals the film. However, when they leave the hotel, they are noticed by two priests, Gibson's associates, who were there to collect the film.\n\nPursued by the priests in a [[The Blues Brothers (film)|car chase that leads them through a shopping mall]], Lois and Peter escape from the priests and drive to a cornfield where Peter buries the film. While he is doing so, the priests fly down in a [[aerial application|crop-duster]] and [[kidnapping|kidnap]] Lois. Peter is then given a message telling him that if he does not return the film to Gibson at his estate on top of [[Mount Rushmore]], his wife will be killed. Peter arrives at the house and gives Gibson a film can. As Peter and Lois are about to leave, Gibson discovers that the film has been replaced with [[dog]] [[feces]], leading to a chase on the face of the mountain. While being chased, Lois slips but hangs on to [[George Washington]]'s lips. Peter grabs her and, while being held at gunpoint, he tells Gibson that the film \"is in President Rushmore's mouth\" and points to the other side of the monument. Gibson follows Peter's direction and falls off the edge (Peter claims that Christians don't believe in gravity) as Peter pulls Lois to safety. Upon climbing back to the top of the mountain, the two have sexual intercourse there, improving their marriage.\n\n==Production and development==\n{{Wikinews|'Family Guy' returns to US television, loses in ratings to 'Housewives'}}\n\nIn 2002, ''Family Guy''  was canceled after three seasons due to low [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].<ref name=\"Diego\">{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040813/news_lz1c13family.html |title=Resurrected 'Family Guy' is drawing a growing audience |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |author=Morrow, Terry |date=August 13, 2004 |accessdate=July 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041113183715/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040813/news_lz1c13family.html |archivedate=November 13, 2004 }}</ref><ref name=\"Heights\">{{cite news|url=http://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2005/05/02/Features/Family.Guy.Hits.Air.Waves.Again-945745.shtml |title=Family Guy hits air waves again |work=[[The Heights (newspaper)|The Heights]] |date=May 2, 2005 |author=Erickson, Chris |accessdate=July 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826074653/http://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2005/05/02/Features/Family.Guy.Hits.Air.Waves.Again-945745.shtml |archivedate=August 26, 2009 }}</ref> The show was first canceled after the 1999\u20132000 season, but following a last-minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20223760,00.html|title=Fall TV Preview: 'Family Guy'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 12, 2008|author=Wheat, Alynda|accessdate=July 2, 2009}}</ref> Fox tried to sell rights for reruns of the show, but it was hard to find networks that were interested; [[Cartoon Network]] eventually bought the rights, \"{{interp|...}} basically for free\", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television Production.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/> When the reruns were shown on Cartoon Network's [[Adult Swim]] in 2003, ''Family Guy'' became Adult Swim's most-watched show with an average 1.9 million viewers an episode.<ref name=\"USATodayResurrection\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-24-family-guy_x.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|date=March 24, 2004|title='Family Guy' un-canceled, thanks to DVD sales success|author=Levin, Gary|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}</ref> Following ''Family Guy''{{'}}s high ratings on Adult Swim, the first season was released on DVD in April 2003.<ref name=\"Diego\"/> Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993880,00.html?promoid=googlep|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author1=Poniewozik, James |author2=McDowell, Jeanne |date=April 19, 2004|title=It's Not TV.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 1, 2005, though it had premiered three days earlier at a special screening at the [[University of Vermont]], [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]]. In the episode, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] go on a second honeymoon to spice up their marriage, but are chased by [[Mel Gibson]] after Peter steals the sequel to ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' from Gibson's private hotel room. Meanwhile, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] take care of [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] at home.\n\n''Family Guy'' had been canceled in 2002 due to low ratings, but was revived by Fox after reruns on [[Adult Swim]] became the cable network's most watched program, and more than three million DVDs of the show were sold. Written by series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] and directed by [[Peter Shin]], much of the plot and many of the technical aspects of the episode, as well as the title, are direct parodies of the [[1959 in film|1959]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]] movie ''[[North by Northwest]]''; in addition, the episode makes use of [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s theme music from that film. The episode contains many cultural references; in the opening sequence Peter lists 29&nbsp;shows that were canceled by Fox after ''Family Guy'' was canceled and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning.\n\nCritical responses to \"North by North Quahog\" were mostly positive, with the opening sequence being praised in particular. The episode was watched by nearly 12 million viewers and received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)]]. Shin won an [[Annie Award]] for Directing in an Animated Television Production for this episode.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the cold open, Peter tells his family that they have \"been canceled\". He then lists all 29 shows, like ''[[Titus (TV series)|Titus]]'' and ''[[Andy Richter Controls the Universe]]'', that were canceled by Fox between the show's cancellation and revival and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning.\n\nAs Peter and Lois are having sex, she yells out [[George Clooney]]'s name, so Peter realizes that she is imagining him as Clooney to maintain her [[libido]]. Lois and Peter decide to take a second [[honeymoon]] to enliven their marriage, and leave their anthropomorphic dog Brian to take care of their children Stewie, Chris, and Meg. Brian is unable to control the children, but Stewie offers to help (in exchange for Brian changing his diaper) and together they manage the home. The pair chaperone a dance at Chris's school, during which the school principal catches Chris in the boys' restroom with [[vodka]] that belongs to his classmate [[Jake Tucker]]. Although Brian and Stewie punish Chris by grounding him, they try to clear his name. Jake's father [[List of Family Guy characters#Tom Tucker|Tom]] refuses to believe Brian and Stewie, so they resort to planting [[cocaine]] in Jake's locker, and Jake is sentenced to [[community service]].\n\nOn the way to their vacation spot, Lois falls asleep. Unfortunately, Peter doesn't pay attention to the road, deciding instead to read a [[comic book]] while driving, and crashes the car into a tree. They are forced to spend their entire honeymoon money on car repairs and are about to return home when Peter discovers that [[actor]]/[[film director|director]] [[Mel Gibson]] has a private suite at a luxurious hotel nearby, \"which he barely uses\". He and Lois then go to the hotel, where Peter poses as Gibson to gain access to his room. When Lois yells out Gibson's name during intercourse, Peter, again, decides to return home. As the two are about to leave, Peter accidentally stumbles upon Gibson's private screening room and discovers a sequel to ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' entitled ''The Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This''. To spare the world from \"...&nbsp;another two hours of Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo-jumbo,\" Peter steals the film. However, when they leave the hotel, they are noticed by two priests, Gibson's associates, who were there to collect the film.\n\nPursued by the priests in a [[The Blues Brothers (film)|car chase that leads them through a shopping mall]], Lois and Peter escape from the priests and drive to a cornfield where Peter buries the film. While he is doing so, the priests fly down in a [[aerial application|crop-duster]] and [[kidnapping|kidnap]] Lois. Peter is then given a message telling him that if he does not return the film to Gibson at his estate on top of [[Mount Rushmore]], his wife will be killed. Peter arrives at the house and gives Gibson a film can. As Peter and Lois are about to leave, Gibson discovers that the film has been replaced with [[dog]] [[feces]], leading to a chase on the face of the mountain. While being chased, Lois slips but hangs on to [[George Washington]]'s lips. Peter grabs her and, while being held at gunpoint, he tells Gibson that the film \"is in President Rushmore's mouth\" and points to the other side of the monument. Gibson follows Peter's direction and falls off the edge (Peter claims that Christians don't believe in gravity) as Peter pulls Lois to safety. Upon climbing back to the top of the mountain, the two have sexual intercourse there, improving their marriage.\n\n==Production and development==\n{{Wikinews|'Family Guy' returns to US television, loses in ratings to 'Housewives'}}\n\nIn 2002, ''Family Guy''  was canceled after three seasons due to low [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].<ref name=\"Diego\">{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040813/news_lz1c13family.html |title=Resurrected 'Family Guy' is drawing a growing audience |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |author=Morrow, Terry |date=August 13, 2004 |accessdate=July 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041113183715/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040813/news_lz1c13family.html |archivedate=November 13, 2004 }}</ref><ref name=\"Heights\">{{cite news|url=http://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2005/05/02/Features/Family.Guy.Hits.Air.Waves.Again-945745.shtml |title=Family Guy hits air waves again |work=[[The Heights (newspaper)|The Heights]] |date=May 2, 2005 |author=Erickson, Chris |accessdate=July 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826074653/http://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2005/05/02/Features/Family.Guy.Hits.Air.Waves.Again-945745.shtml |archivedate=August 26, 2009 }}</ref> The show was first canceled after the 1999\u20132000 season, but following a last-minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20223760,00.html|title=Fall TV Preview: 'Family Guy'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 12, 2008|author=Wheat, Alynda|accessdate=July 2, 2009}}</ref> Fox tried to sell rights for reruns of the show, but it was hard to find networks that were interested; [[Cartoon Network]] eventually bought the rights, \"{{interp|...}} basically for free\", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television Production.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/> When the reruns were shown on Cartoon Network's [[Adult Swim]] in 2003, ''Family Guy'' became Adult Swim's most-watched show with an average 1.9 million viewers an episode.<ref name=\"USATodayResurrection\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-24-family-guy_x.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|date=March 24, 2004|title='Family Guy' un-canceled, thanks to DVD sales success|author=Levin, Gary|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}</ref> Following ''Family Guy''{{'}}s high ratings on Adult Swim, the first season was released on DVD in April 2003.<ref name=\"Diego\"/> Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993880,00.html?promoid=googlep|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author1=Poniewozik, James |author2=McDowell, Jeanne |date=April 19, 2004|title=It's Not TV.

Premonstratensians are designated by ''O.Praem.'' (''Ordo Praemonstratensis'') following their name.\n\nNorbert was a friend of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and was largely influenced by the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] ideals as to both the manner of life and the government of his order. As the Premonstratensians are not [[monk]]s but Canons Regular, their work often involves preaching and the exercising of pastoral ministry; they frequently serve in parishes close to their abbeys or priories.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==History==\nThe order was founded in 1120.<ref name=\"geudens\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12387b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Premonstratensian Canons|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> Saint Norbert had made various efforts to introduce a strict form of canonical life in various communities of canons in [[Germany]]; in 1120 he was working in the now-extinct [[Ancient Diocese of Laon]], in [[Picardy]], northeastern [[France]]. There, in a rural place called Pr\u00e9montr\u00e9, he and thirteen companions established a monastery to be the cradle of a new order. As they were canons regular, they followed the [[Rule of St. Augustine]], but with supplementary statutes that made their life one of great austerity.<ref name=EB1911/> Common prayer and celebration of the Eucharist was to be the sustaining dynamic of the community.<ref name=\"depere\">{{cite web|url=http://www.norbertines.org/our_history_xanten.html|title=Saint Norbert of Xanten History at Saint Norbert Abbey in De Pere, Wisconsin|work=norbertines.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106082558/http://www.norbertines.org/our_history_xanten.html|archivedate=2013-11-06}}</ref>\n\n[[File:R\u00fcti - Ortsmuseum - Kloster - Pr\u00e4mostratenser-Habit IMG 5172.JPG|thumb|[[Religious habit]] of a Premonstratensian, former [[R\u00fcti Abbey]]]]\nIn 1126, when the order received papal [[approbation]] by [[Pope Honorius II]], there were nine houses; others were established in quick succession throughout western Europe, so that at the middle of the fourteenth century there were some 1,300 monasteries for men and 400 for women. The Norbertines played a predominant part in the conversion of the [[Wends]] and the bringing of [[Christianity]] to the territories around the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder]]. In time, mitigations and relaxations emerged, and these gave rise to reforms and semi-independent congregations within the Order.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Norbertines came to England about 1143, first at Newhouse in [[Lincoln, England]]; before the dissolution under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] there were 35 houses.<ref name=EB1911/> Soon after their arrival in England, they founded [[Dryburgh Abbey]] in the Borders area of [[Scotland]], which was followed by other communities at [[Whithorn Priory]], [[Dercongal Abbey]] and [[Tongland Abbey]] all in the Borders area, as well as [[Fearn Abbey]] in the northern part of the nation. Like most orders they were almost completely devastated by the successive onslaughts of the Reformation, French Revolution and Napoleon, but then experienced a revival in the 19th century.<ref name=\"staley\">[http://www.snc.edu/communications/magazine/2009v41n3/cns.html Staley, Tony. \"Home to a Living History\", ''St. Norbert College Magazine'', Fall 2009]</ref>\n\nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century the order had become almost extinct, only eight houses surviving, all in [[Austria]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Premonstratensians|inline=1}}</ref> However, there was something of a resurgence, and at the start of the twentieth century there were 20 monasteries and 1000 priests. {{As of|2005}}, the number of monasteries had increased to nearly 100 and spread to every continent. In 1893, Father Bernard Pennings and two other Norbertines from Berne Abbey came to the United States to minister to Belgian immigrants in northern Wisconsin. [[De Pere, Wisconsin]], became the site of the first Norbertine Abbey in the new world.<ref name=\"daylesford\" />\n\nIn the twenty-first century, like all canons regular, they follow the [[Augustinians#The Augustinian Rule|Augustinian Rule]]. In order to \u201cearn their living\u201d, the different communities had, as formerly, to create and operate small industrial activities (SME) such as printing ([[Averbode Abbey]], [[Tongerlo Abbey]], [[Berne Abbey]]), farming ([[Kinshasa]], [[Ireland]], [[Postel Abbey]]), cheese-making (Postel Abbey), running schools (Averbode Abbey, Berne Abbey, [[United States]], [[Australia]]), agreements with breweries (Tongerlo Abbey, Postel Abbey, Park Abbey, [[Leffe]], [[Grimbergen]]), retreat centres (nearly everywhere), astronomical observatories (Mira, Grimbergen), artistic bookbinding (in [[Oosterhout]]), forestry ([[Schl\u00e4gl Abbey]], [[Geras Abbey]], [[Slovakia]]) and pilgrimages ([[Conques]]).<ref name=\"abbaye\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abbaye-de-leffe.be/|title=Abbaye Notre-Dame de Leffe|author=Abbaye Notre-Dame de Leffe|work=abbaye-de-leffe.be}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 there were some 1000 male and 200 female members of the Order.<ref name=\"premontre\">{{cite web|url=http://www.premontre.org/chapter/cat/welcome/who-are-the-premonstratensians/|title=Who are the Premonstratensians?|work=premontre.org}}</ref>  The Feast of All Norbertine Saints and Blesseds is celebrated internally on Nov. 13.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norbertines.org/norbertine_associates_calendar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025833/http://www.norbertines.org/norbertine_associates_calendar.html |archivedate=2015-11-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Canonesses==\n[[File:JRKRUK 20130606 NORBERTANKI IMBRAMOWICE IMG 9376.jpg|thumb|left|Norbertine canonesses in [[Imbramowice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Imbramowice]], Poland.]]\n\nThe Order has several abbeys of women who, though technically called canonesses, follow the life of an [[enclosed religious orders|enclosed religious order]] and are therefore more commonly termed Norbertine [[nun]]<nowiki/>s. Like the Norbertine communities for men, those for women are autonomous. Unusually, within the religious communities of the [[Catholic Church]], the Norbertine Order has always seen the spiritual life of the canonesses as being on an equal footing with that of its priests and [[lay brother]]s. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Premonstratentians even had a few [[double monastery|double monasteries]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.premontresisters.com/|title=Premontre Sisters - Norbertine Sisters in the World - Premonstratensian Orders - Life of Saint Norbert - Rule of St. Augustine|website=www.premontresisters.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> where men and women lived in cloisters located next to each other as part of the same abbey, the communities demonstrating their unity by sharing the church building. Today, it is common for a foundation of canonesses to have links not only with other canonesses, but also with a community of canons.\n\nOn January 29, 2011, a canonry of the canonesses, the Bethlehem Priory of St. Joseph, was established with the solemn [[religious profession]] of the first nine canonesses at the [[Saint John the Baptist Cathedral (Fresno, California)|Saint John the Baptist Cathedral]], [[Fresno, California]].  The priory is located in [[Tehachapi, California]], and by 2013 had grown to 26 members in all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/2439/norbertine_nuns_monastery_expansion_blessed.aspx|title=Norbertine nuns' monastery expansion blessed|work=catholicworldreport.com}}</ref>  The community was first founded as a public association of the faithful by the Norbertine canons of St. Michael's Abbey, Orange County, California.  It is the first canonry of Norbertine canonesses founded in North America.\n\n==Premonstratensian Rite==\nThe Premonstratensians were among the religious orders with their own rite who kept this rite after [[Pope Pius V]] suppressed such rites with a continuous tradition of less than two hundred years. The Premonstratensian Rite was especially characterized by a ritual solemnity.  The Premonstratensian Rite was also characterized by an emphasis on the [[Paschal mystery]] unique among the Latin rites.  This was especially seen in the solemnity with which the daily conventional High Mass and office was celebrated during the Easter octave, especially vespers which concluded with a procession to the baptismal font, a practice paralleled among the Latin rites only in similar processions still found in the [[Ambrosian Rite]].  Another unique practice of the Premonstratensian Rite was the celebration of a daily votive Mass in honor of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] in each of its abbeys and priories.\n\n==Structure==\nAs each abbey or priory is autonomous, practices and apostolates differ; some are contemplative in character whilst others are highly active in pastoral ministry. However, each is guided by the Rule of Saint Augustine as well as the Constitutions established by the [[General Chapter]] which is held every 6 years.

Premonstratensians are designated by ''O.Praem.'' (''Ordo Praemonstratensis'') following their name.\n\nNorbert was a friend of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and was largely influenced by the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] ideals as to both the manner of life and the government of his order.

There, in a rural place called Pr\u00e9montr\u00e9, he and thirteen companions established a monastery to be the cradle of a new order. As they were canons regular, they followed the [[Rule of St. Augustine]], but with supplementary statutes that made their life one of great austerity.<ref name=EB1911/> Common prayer and celebration of the Eucharist was to be the sustaining dynamic of the community.<ref name=\"depere\">{{cite web|url=http://www.norbertines.org/our_history_xanten.html|title=Saint Norbert of Xanten History at Saint Norbert Abbey in De Pere, Wisconsin|work=norbertines.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106082558/http://www.norbertines.org/our_history_xanten.html|archivedate=2013-11-06}}</ref>\n\n[[File:R\u00fcti - Ortsmuseum - Kloster - Pr\u00e4mostratenser-Habit IMG 5172.JPG|thumb|[[Religious habit]] of a Premonstratensian, former [[R\u00fcti Abbey]]]]\nIn 1126, when the order received papal [[approbation]] by [[Pope Honorius II]], there were nine houses; others were established in quick succession throughout western Europe, so that at the middle of the fourteenth century there were some 1,300 monasteries for men and 400 for women. The Norbertines played a predominant part in the conversion of the [[Wends]] and the bringing of [[Christianity]] to the territories around the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder]]. In time, mitigations and relaxations emerged, and these gave rise to reforms and semi-independent congregations within the Order.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Norbertines came to England about 1143, first at Newhouse in [[Lincoln, England]]; before the dissolution under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] there were 35 houses.<ref name=EB1911/> Soon after their arrival in England, they founded [[Dryburgh Abbey]] in the Borders area of [[Scotland]], which was followed by other communities at [[Whithorn Priory]], [[Dercongal Abbey]] and [[Tongland Abbey]] all in the Borders area, as well as [[Fearn Abbey]] in the northern part of the nation. Like most orders they were almost completely devastated by the successive onslaughts of the Reformation, French Revolution and Napoleon, but then experienced a revival in the 19th century.<ref name=\"staley\">[http://www.snc.edu/communications/magazine/2009v41n3/cns.html Staley, Tony. \"Home to a Living History\", ''St. Norbert College Magazine'', Fall 2009]</ref>\n\nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century the order had become almost extinct, only eight houses surviving, all in [[Austria]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Premonstratensians|inline=1}}</ref> However, there was something of a resurgence, and at the start of the twentieth century there were 20 monasteries and 1000 priests. {{As of|2005}}, the number of monasteries had increased to nearly 100 and spread to every continent. In 1893, Father Bernard Pennings and two other Norbertines from Berne Abbey came to the United States to minister to Belgian immigrants in northern Wisconsin.

Like the Norbertine communities for men, those for women are autonomous. Unusually, within the religious communities of the [[Catholic Church]], the Norbertine Order has always seen the spiritual life of the canonesses as being on an equal footing with that of its priests and [[lay brother]]s. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Premonstratentians even had a few [[double monastery|double monasteries]],<ref>[http://www.premontresisters.com/ \"Norbertine Sisters in the World\", Premontre Sisters]</ref> where men and women lived in cloisters located next to each other as part of the same abbey, the communities demonstrating their unity by sharing the church building. Today, it is common for a foundation of canonesses to have links not only with other canonesses, but also with a community of canons.\n\nOn January 29, 2011, a canonry of the canonesses, the Bethlehem Priory of St. Joseph, was established with the solemn [[religious profession]] of the first nine canonesses at the [[Saint John the Baptist Cathedral (Fresno, California)|Saint John the Baptist Cathedral]], [[Fresno, California]].  The priory is located in [[Tehachapi, California]], and by 2013 had grown to 26 members in all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/2439/norbertine_nuns_monastery_expansion_blessed.aspx|title=Norbertine nuns' monastery expansion blessed|work=catholicworldreport.com}}</ref>  The community was first founded as a public association of the faithful by the Norbertine canons of St. Michael's Abbey, Orange County, California.  It is the first canonry of Norbertine canonesses founded in North America.\n\n==Premonstratensian Rite==\nThe Premonstratensians were among the religious orders with their own rite who kept this rite after [[Pope Pius V]] suppressed such rites with a continuous tradition of less than two hundred years. The Premonstratensian Rite was especially characterized by a ritual solemnity.  The Premonstratensian Rite was also characterized by an emphasis on the [[Paschal mystery]] unique among the Latin rites.  This was especially seen in the solemnity with which the daily conventional High Mass and office was celebrated during the Easter octave, especially vespers which concluded with a procession to the baptismal font, a practice paralleled among the Latin rites only in similar processions still found in the [[Ambrosian Rite]].  Another unique practice of the Premonstratensian Rite was the celebration of a daily votive Mass in honor of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] in each of its abbeys and priories.\n\n==Structure==\nAs each abbey or priory is autonomous, practices and apostolates differ; some are contemplative in character whilst others are highly active in pastoral ministry. However, each is guided by the Rule of Saint Augustine as well as the Constitutions established by the [[General Chapter]] which is held every 6 years. Demonstrating Norbertine unity, the general Chapter includes representatives from both male and female communities. The head of the Order, termed [[Abbot]] General, resides in [[Rome]], and he is assisted in his duties by the Definitors (High Council) as well as commissions established for various aspects of the Order's life such as liturgy and inter-abbey communications.\n\n==Abbeys==\nAs of 2012, there were Premonstratensian abbeys or priories throughout the world: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom and USA.<ref name=\"premontre\" />\n\nThere are seven circaries (Premonstratensian term for an [[ecclesiastical province]]<ref>[http://www.dict.cc/english-german/circary+%5BPremonstratensian+equivalent+to+a+monastic+province%5D.html 'circary' definition], ''dict.cc\nEnglish-German Dictionary''.</ref>):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premontre.org/chapter/cat/places/|title=Places|work=premontre.org}}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n* '''Anglica Circary''':\n*St Norbert Priory, Queens Park, Perth, Australia\n*[[St. Philip's Priory]], Chelmsford, England<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.praemonstratensis.co.uk/ |title=St. Philip's Priory, Chelmsford. |work=praemonstratensis.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref>\n*Holy Trinity Abbey, Kilnacrott, Ireland\n*[[St. Norbert Abbey]], De Pere, Wisconsin<ref name=\"depere\" />\n** Holy Spirit House of Studies, Chicago\n*[[Daylesford Abbey]], Paoli, Pennsylvania, USA<ref name=\"daylesford\">{{cite web |url=http://www.daylesford.org/Home.aspx |title=Daylesford Abbey |work=daylesford.org |year=2010 |accessdate=19 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718150040/http://www.daylesford.org/home.aspx |archivedate=18 July 2012 }}</ref>\n* Immaculate Conception Priory, Middletown, Delaware, USA \n*[[St. Michael's Abbey (Orange County, California)|St. Michael's Abbey]], California, USA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmichaelsabbey.com/abbey/|title=St. Michael's Abbey of the Norbertine Fathers|work=St. Michael's Abbey|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322121233/http://www.stmichaelsabbey.com/abbey/|archivedate=2013-03-22}}</ref>\n*St. Moses the Black, Jackson, Mississippi, USA<ref name=\"depere\" />\n*Santa Maria de la Vid Abbey, New Mexico, USA<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.norbertinecommunity.org/ |title=Welcome to the Norbertine Community of New Mexico!

Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by [[Yash Raj Films]] as the star of the drama ''[[Saathiya (film)|Saathiya]]''.\n\nMukerji established herself by starring in several top-grossing romantic films, including ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (2003), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), and the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political thriller ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004) and a deaf, blind and mute woman in the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the semi-biographical thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'' (2011), and further success came for her starring roles in the thrillers ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), ''[[Mardaani]]'' (2014) and its sequel ''[[Mardaani 2]]'' (2019), and the comedy-drama ''[[Hichki]]'' (2018). The lattermost emerged as her highest-grossing release.\n\nIn addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show ''[[Dance Premier League]]''. Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker [[Aditya Chopra]], with whom she has a daughter.\n\n== Early life and background ==\n{{See also|Mukherjee-Samarth family}}\nRani Mukerji was born  in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (present-day Mumbai) on 21 March 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wish Rani Mukerji! |date=19 March 2008|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |accessdate=5 January 2011 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921083402/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm|archivedate=21 September 2012 }}</ref> Her father, [[Ram Mukherjee]] (born to the [[Mukherjee-Samarth family]]), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios.

As a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in [[Ram Mukherjee|her father]]'s Bengali-language film ''[[Biyer Phool]]'' (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama ''[[Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat]]'' on the insistence of her mother. Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action drama&nbsp;[[Ghulam (film)|''Ghulam'']] (1998) and breakthrough with the romance&nbsp;''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by [[Yash Raj Films]] as the star of the drama ''[[Saathiya (film)|Saathiya]]''.\n\nMukerji established herself by starring in several top-grossing romantic films, including ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' (2003), ''[[Hum Tum]]'' (2004), ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), and the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005). She also gained praise for playing an abused wife in the political thriller ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004) and a deaf, blind and mute woman in the drama ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. This changed when she played a headstrong journalist in the semi-biographical thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'' (2011), and further success came for her starring roles in the thrillers ''[[Talaash: The Answer Lies Within]]'' (2012), ''[[Mardaani]]'' (2014) and its sequel ''[[Mardaani 2]]'' (2019), and the comedy-drama ''[[Hichki]]'' (2018). The lattermost emerged as her highest-grossing release.\n\nIn addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show ''[[Dance Premier League]]''. Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker [[Aditya Chopra]], with whom she has a daughter.\n\n== Early life and background ==\n{{See also|Mukherjee-Samarth family}}\nRani Mukerji was born  in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (present-day Mumbai) on 21 March 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wish Rani Mukerji! |date=19 March 2008|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |accessdate=5 January 2011 |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921083402/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/mar/19wish.htm|archivedate=21 September 2012 }}</ref> Her father, [[Ram Mukherjee]] (born to the [[Mukherjee-Samarth family]]), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Boltanski Christophe | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires.

The company became a publicly traded company in November 1999 with [[Fox Family Worldwide]] holding a 75.7% majority stake and the other 24.3% being listed on [[Euronext]].

The company became a publicly traded company in November 1999 with [[Fox Family Worldwide]] holding a 75.7% majority stake and the other 24.3% being listed on [[Euronext]].
