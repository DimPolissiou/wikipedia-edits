It often involves armed gangs from one community seeking out defenseless persons or whole families in their homes, slashing and cutting up the male members and sometimes the female members, and raping the latter, and burning all alive including the children. A second source is police killings, which account for a large number of deaths in several major riots for which figures have been provided by inquiry commission reports, and which cannot be justified in terms of \"crowd control\". These killings are disproportionately of Muslims.}}{{sfn|Riaz|2008|p=165|ps=: \"Violence perpetrated against Muslims is now naturalized: riots are 'well-known and accepted transgression of routine political behavior in India.' ...

In particular, scholars fault the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Shiv Sena]] for complicity in these incidents of violence{{sfn|Brass|b}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Sarkur|2007|p=187}}{{sfn|Brekke|2012|pp=86\u201387}} and of using violence against Muslims as a part of a larger electoral strategy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=382}} For example, research by Raheel Dhattiwala and Michael Biggs has stated that killings are far higher in areas where the BJP faces stiff electoral opposition than in areas in which it is already strong.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} In 1989, the north of India saw an increase in orchestrated attacks on Muslims, and the BJP had further success in the local and state elections.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}} The [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]] concludes that the violence in [[Bhagalpur]] in [[1989 Bhagalpur violence|1989]], Hashimpura in [[Hashimpura massacre|1987]] and in [[Moradabad]] [[1980 Moradabad riots|1980]] were organised killings.{{sfn|Tambiah|1997|p=321}} According to [[Ram Puniyani]], the Shiv Sena  were victorious in the elections due to the violence in the 1990s, and the BJP in Gujarat after the 2002 violence.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} [[Gyan Prakash]], however, cautions that the BJP's actions in Gujarat do not equate to the entirety of India, and it remains to be seen if the [[Hindutva]] movement has been successful in the deployment of this strategy nationwide.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\n===Economic and cultural factors===\nHindu nationalists use the historical [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|subjugation]] of India by Muslims as an excuse for violence. They feel that, since the Partition, Indian Muslims are [[Pro-Pakistan sentiment|allied to Pakistan]] and are possibly radicalised  and, therefore, the Hindus must take defensive steps to avoid repeat of the past wrongs and reassert their pride.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Etzion|2008|pp=123\u2013124}} The higher fertility rate among Muslims has been a recurring theme in the Hindu Right's rhetoric. They claim that the [[Islam in India#Population growth rate|higher]] birth rate among Muslims is part of a plan to turn the Hindus into a minority within their own country.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Weigl|2012|p=19}}\n\nAnother reason given for these outbreaks of violence is the upward mobility of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] caused by the expansion of the economy. The violence has become a substitute for class tensions.  Nationalists, rather than deal with the claims from the lower class, instead view Muslims and Christians as not \"fully Indian\" due to their religion,{{sfn|Metcalf|2006|p=89}} and portray those who carry out these attacks as \"heroes\" that defended the majority from \"anti-nationals\".{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} Muslims are viewed as suspect and their loyalty to the state is questioned because of the ill-will still prevalent after the violence during [[Partition of India|partition]]. According to [[Omar Khalidi]]:\n\n<blockquote>Anti-Muslim violence is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, as a final outcome of that economic and social backwardness, assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|p=153}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Cultural nationalism]] has also been given as a reason for instances of violence carried out by [[Shiv Sena]] which initially claimed to speak for the people of [[Maharashtra]], but quickly turned their [[rhetoric]] to inciting violence against Muslims. The Shiv Sena were complicit in the violence in 1984 in the town of [[Bhiwandi]], and again in the violence in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}} Violence has been incited by Sena in 1971 and 1986.{{sfn|Kaur|2005|p=160}}{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}}  According to [[Sudipta Kaviraj]], the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) are still engaged in the religious conflicts which began in the medieval times.{{sfn|Kaviraj|2010|p=245}}\n\nAnti-Muslim violence creates a security risk for Hindus residing outside of India. Since the 1950s, there have been retaliatory attacks on Hindus in Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]] in response to anti-Muslim violence in India. After the 1992 violence in Bombay, Hindu temples were attacked in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Dubai]] and [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2006|p=16}} This recurring violence has become a rigidly conventional pattern which has created a divide between the Muslim and Hindu communities.{{sfn|Shani|2007|p=187}}\n\n[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] has spoken out against these communal clashes, as it believes that the violence not only impacts upon Muslims, but India as a whole, and that these riots are damaging to India's progress.{{sfn|Sikand|2004|p=86}} In Gujarat, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) was used in incidents pertaining to communal violence in 1992 and 1993.  The majority of those arrested under the act were Muslim.  Conversely, TADA was not used after the violence carried out against Muslims during the [[Bombay riots]].{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=427}}\n\n===Demographics===\nThe BJP politicians, as well as those of other parties, argue that [[demographics]] play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher are the chances of centrist parties  to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims \"building bridges\" with their Hindu neighbours.  As such, according to this argument \"Muslim appeasement\" is the root cause of communal violence.{{sfn|Varshney|2003|p=8}} Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to [[globalization]] and [[investment]] from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.{{sfn|Price|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe actions of anti-Hindu and [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|anti-India militant groups]] in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] and Pakistan have reinforced anti-Muslim feelings in India, which has strengthened the Hindu Right. The [[Hindutva]] discourse portrays Muslims as traitors and state enemies, whose patriotism is suspected.{{sfn|Sikand|2006|p=88}} [[Sumit Ganguly]] argues that the rise in terrorism cannot only be attributed to [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] factors, but also to the violence perpetrated by Hindutva forces.{{sfn|Ganguly|2003|p=10}}\n\n==Major incidents==\n\n===1964 Kolkata===\nRiots between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s had left over a hundred people dead, 438 people were injured. Over 7000 people were arrested. 70,000 Muslims have fled their homes and 55,000 were provided protection by the [[Indian army]]. Muslims in Kolkata became more ghettoized than ever before in the aftermath of this riot. The riot was believed to be instigated by violence against Hindus in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh) and the flow of refugees from there. Violence was also seen in rural [[West Bengal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1964: Riots in Calcutta leave more than 100 dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4098000/4098363.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1983 Nellie massacre===\nIn the state of [[Assam]] in 1983 the [[Nellie massacre]] occurred. Nearly 1,800 Muslims of Bengali origin were slaughtered by [[Lalung]] tribespeople (also known as Tiwa) at a village called Nellie.{{sfn|Hazarika|1984}}{{sfn|Kokrajhar|Dhubri|2012}} It has been described as one of the most severe massacres since [[World War II]] with the majority of victims being women and children, as a result of the actions of the [[Assam Movement]].{{sfn|Ghosh|2004|p=312}}{{sfn|Hussain|2009|p=261}}\n\nOne reason cited for this incident is that it resulted from a build-up of resentment over immigration.{{sfn|Datta|2012|p=183}} The Assam movement insisted on striking the names of [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from the electoral register and their deportation from the state. There was widespread support for the movement, which tapered off between 1981 and 1982.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=481}}\n\nThe movement demanded that anyone who had entered the state illegally since 1951 be deported.  The central government, however, insisted on a cutoff date of 1971. Towards the end of 1982, the central government called elections and the movement called for people to [[boycott]] it, which led to the widespread violence.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=418}}\n\nThe official Tiwari Commission report on the Nellie massacre is still a closely guarded secret (only three copies exist).<ref name=\"AT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=feb1908/at02|title=83 polls were a mistake: KPS Gill|publisher=Assam Tribune|date= 18 February 2008|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> The 600-page report was submitted to the Assam Government in 1984 and the Congress Government (headed by [[Hiteswar Saikia]]) decided not to make it public, and subsequent Governments followed suit.<ref name=\"Tehelka\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|title=An Untold Shame|last=Rehman|first=Teresa|publisher=Tehelka Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111192753/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|archive-date=11 November 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Assam United Democratic Front]] and others are making legal efforts to make Tiwari Commission report public, so that reasonable justice is delivered to victims, at least after 25 years after the incident.<ref>{{cite news | last =Reporter | first =Staff | title =Flashback to Nellie Horror:AUDF to move court for probe report | newspaper =The Telegraph | date =19 February 2008 | url =http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080219/jsp/guwahati/story_8920369.jsp |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince, then there have been no instances of communal violence in [[Upper Assam Division|Upper Assam]].{{sfn|Saikia|2005|p=65}}\n\n===1969 to 1989===\nDuring the [[1969 Gujarat riots]], it is estimated that 630 people lost their lives.{{sfn|Khalidi|2009|p=180}} The [[1970 Bhiwandi Riots]] was an instance of anti-Muslim violence which occurred between 7 and 8 May in the Indian towns of Bhiwandi, Jalgaon and Mahad.

It often involves armed gangs from one community seeking out defenseless persons or whole families in their homes, slashing and cutting up the male members and sometimes the female members, and raping the latter, and burning all alive including the children. A second source is police killings, which account for a large number of deaths in several major riots for which figures have been provided by inquiry commission reports, and which cannot be justified in terms of \"crowd control\". These killings are disproportionately of Muslims.}}{{sfn|Riaz|2008|p=165|ps=: \"Violence perpetrated against Muslims is now naturalized: riots are 'well-known and accepted transgression of routine political behavior in India.' ...

In particular, scholars fault the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Shiv Sena]] for complicity in these incidents of violence{{sfn|Brass|b}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Sarkur|2007|p=187}}{{sfn|Brekke|2012|pp=86\u201387}} and of using violence against Muslims as a part of a larger electoral strategy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=382}} For example, research by Raheel Dhattiwala and Michael Biggs has stated that killings are far higher in areas where the BJP faces stiff electoral opposition than in areas in which it is already strong.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} In 1989, the north of India saw an increase in orchestrated attacks on Muslims, and the BJP had further success in the local and state elections.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}} The [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]] concludes that the violence in [[Bhagalpur]] in [[1989 Bhagalpur violence|1989]], Hashimpura in [[Hashimpura massacre|1987]] and in [[Moradabad]] [[1980 Moradabad riots|1980]] were organised killings.{{sfn|Tambiah|1997|p=321}} According to [[Ram Puniyani]], the Shiv Sena  were victorious in the elections due to the violence in the 1990s, and the BJP in Gujarat after the 2002 violence.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} [[Gyan Prakash]], however, cautions that the BJP's actions in Gujarat do not equate to the entirety of India, and it remains to be seen if the [[Hindutva]] movement has been successful in the deployment of this strategy nationwide.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\n===Economic and cultural factors===\nHindu nationalists use the historical [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|subjugation]] of India by Muslims as an excuse for violence. They feel that, since the Partition, Indian Muslims are [[Pro-Pakistan sentiment|allied to Pakistan]] and are possibly radicalised  and, therefore, the Hindus must take defensive steps to avoid repeat of the past wrongs and reassert their pride.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Etzion|2008|pp=123\u2013124}} The higher fertility rate among Muslims has been a recurring theme in the Hindu Right's rhetoric. They claim that the [[Islam in India#Population growth rate|higher]] birth rate among Muslims is part of a plan to turn the Hindus into a minority within their own country.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Weigl|2012|p=19}}\n\nAnother reason given for these outbreaks of violence is the upward mobility of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] caused by the expansion of the economy. The violence has become a substitute for class tensions.  Nationalists, rather than deal with the claims from the lower class, instead view Muslims and Christians as not \"fully Indian\" due to their religion,{{sfn|Metcalf|2006|p=89}} and portray those who carry out these attacks as \"heroes\" that defended the majority from \"anti-nationals\".{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} Muslims are viewed as suspect and their loyalty to the state is questioned because of the ill-will still prevalent after the violence during [[Partition of India|partition]]. According to [[Omar Khalidi]]:\n\n<blockquote>Anti-Muslim violence is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, as a final outcome of that economic and social backwardness, assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|p=153}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Cultural nationalism]] has also been given as a reason for instances of violence carried out by [[Shiv Sena]] which initially claimed to speak for the people of [[Maharashtra]], but quickly turned their [[rhetoric]] to inciting violence against Muslims. The Shiv Sena were complicit in the violence in 1984 in the town of [[Bhiwandi]], and again in the violence in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}} Violence has been incited by Sena in 1971 and 1986.{{sfn|Kaur|2005|p=160}}{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}}  According to [[Sudipta Kaviraj]], the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) are still engaged in the religious conflicts which began in the medieval times.{{sfn|Kaviraj|2010|p=245}}\n\nAnti-Muslim violence creates a security risk for Hindus residing outside of India. Since the 1950s, there have been retaliatory attacks on Hindus in Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]] in response to anti-Muslim violence in India. After the 1992 violence in Bombay, Hindu temples were attacked in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Dubai]] and [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2006|p=16}} This recurring violence has become a rigidly conventional pattern which has created a divide between the Muslim and Hindu communities.{{sfn|Shani|2007|p=187}}\n\n[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] has spoken out against these communal clashes, as it believes that the violence not only impacts upon Muslims, but India as a whole, and that these riots are damaging to India's progress.{{sfn|Sikand|2004|p=86}} In Gujarat, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) was used in incidents pertaining to communal violence in 1992 and 1993.  The majority of those arrested under the act were Muslim.  Conversely, TADA was not used after the violence carried out against Muslims during the [[Bombay riots]].{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=427}}\n\n===Demographics===\nThe BJP politicians, as well as those of other parties, argue that [[demographics]] play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher are the chances of centrist parties  to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims \"building bridges\" with their Hindu neighbours.  As such, according to this argument \"Muslim appeasement\" is the root cause of communal violence.{{sfn|Varshney|2003|p=8}} Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to [[globalization]] and [[investment]] from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.{{sfn|Price|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe actions of anti-Hindu and [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|anti-India militant groups]] in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] and Pakistan have reinforced anti-Muslim feelings in India, which has strengthened the Hindu Right. The [[Hindutva]] discourse portrays Muslims as traitors and state enemies, whose patriotism is suspected.{{sfn|Sikand|2006|p=88}} [[Sumit Ganguly]] argues that the rise in terrorism cannot only be attributed to [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] factors, but also to the violence perpetrated by Hindutva forces.{{sfn|Ganguly|2003|p=10}}\n\n==Major incidents==\n\n===1964 Kolkata===\nRiots between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s had left over a hundred people dead, 438 people were injured. Over 7000 people were arrested. 70,000 Muslims have fled their homes and 55,000 were provided protection by the [[Indian army]]. Muslims in Kolkata became more ghettoized than ever before in the aftermath of this riot. The riot was believed to be instigated by violence against Hindus in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh) and the flow of refugees from there. Violence was also seen in rural [[West Bengal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1964: Riots in Calcutta leave more than 100 dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4098000/4098363.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1983 Nellie massacre===\nIn the state of [[Assam]] in 1983 the [[Nellie massacre]] occurred. Nearly 1,800 Muslims of Bengali origin were slaughtered by [[Lalung]] tribespeople (also known as Tiwa) at a village called Nellie.{{sfn|Hazarika|1984}}{{sfn|Kokrajhar|Dhubri|2012}} It has been described as one of the most severe massacres since [[World War II]] with the majority of victims being women and children, as a result of the actions of the [[Assam Movement]].{{sfn|Ghosh|2004|p=312}}{{sfn|Hussain|2009|p=261}}\n\nOne reason cited for this incident is that it resulted from a build-up of resentment over immigration.{{sfn|Datta|2012|p=183}} The Assam movement insisted on striking the names of [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from the electoral register and their deportation from the state. There was widespread support for the movement, which tapered off between 1981 and 1982.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=481}}\n\nThe movement demanded that anyone who had entered the state illegally since 1951 be deported.  The central government, however, insisted on a cutoff date of 1971. Towards the end of 1982, the central government called elections and the movement called for people to [[boycott]] it, which led to the widespread violence.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=418}}\n\nThe official Tiwari Commission report on the Nellie massacre is still a closely guarded secret (only three copies exist).<ref name=\"AT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=feb1908/at02|title=83 polls were a mistake: KPS Gill|publisher=Assam Tribune|date= 18 February 2008|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> The 600-page report was submitted to the Assam Government in 1984 and the Congress Government (headed by [[Hiteswar Saikia]]) decided not to make it public, and subsequent Governments followed suit.<ref name=\"Tehelka\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|title=An Untold Shame|last=Rehman|first=Teresa|publisher=Tehelka Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111192753/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|archive-date=11 November 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Assam United Democratic Front]] and others are making legal efforts to make Tiwari Commission report public, so that reasonable justice is delivered to victims, at least after 25 years after the incident.<ref>{{cite news | last =Reporter | first =Staff | title =Flashback to Nellie Horror:AUDF to move court for probe report | newspaper =The Telegraph | date =19 February 2008 | url =http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080219/jsp/guwahati/story_8920369.jsp |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince, then there have been no instances of communal violence in [[Upper Assam Division|Upper Assam]].{{sfn|Saikia|2005|p=65}}\n\n===1969 to 1989===\nDuring the [[1969 Gujarat riots]], it is estimated that 630 people lost their lives.{{sfn|Khalidi|2009|p=180}} The [[1970 Bhiwandi Riots]] was an instance of anti-Muslim violence which occurred between 7 and 8 May in the Indian towns of Bhiwandi, Jalgaon and Mahad.

The name being a corruption of the Gaelic name for the main island of the group because the islanders tended to pronounce ''r'' as ''l'', and thus habitually referred to the island as ''Hilta.''<ref name=\"Maclean (1977) page 33.\">Maclean (1977) page 33.</ref> The islanders also pronounced the ''H'' with a \"somewhat guttural quality\" making the spoken word for ''Hirta'' sound more like ''Kilta''.<ref>Steel (1988) page 27.</ref> Similarly, St Kilda speakers interviewed by the [[School of Scottish Studies]] in the 1960s show individual speakers using t-initial forms, [[Lenition|leniting]] to /h/, e.g. ''ann an Tirte'' ({{IPA-gd|\u02c8an\u032a\u02e0\u0259n\u032a\u02e0 \u02c8t\u02b0\u02b2ir\u02e0\u0283t\u032a\u02b2\u0259|}}) and ''gu Hirte'' ({{IPA-gd|k\u0259 \u02c8hir\u02e0\u0283t\u032a\u02b2\u0259|}}).<ref>Bruford, A.

This is nearly a century after the publication of Waghenaer's charts, but it is unclear whether his misspelling led to a common spoken usage or the spoken version has a quite different origin. In a later passage concerning the traditions relating to the [[Flannan Isles]], Martin adds \"It is absolutely unlawful to call the island of St Kilda (which lies thirty leagues southward) by its proper Irish name Hirt, but only the high country\". This refers to the St Kildan's habit of referring to Hirta as 'the high country' and Boreray as 'the north country'.

This figure remained fairly constant from the 18th century until 1851, when 36 islanders emigrated to Australia on board the ''Priscilla'', a loss from which the island never fully recovered. The emigration was in part a response to the [[laird]]'s closure of the church and [[manse]] for several years during the [[Disruption of 1843|Disruption]] that created the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].<ref>Maclean (1977) page 125.</ref><ref>Fleming (2005) page 32.</ref>\n\nA missionary called Alexander Buchan went to St Kilda in 1705, but despite his extended stay, the idea of organised religion did not take hold. This changed when Rev. [[John MacDonald (Gaelic Moderator)|John MacDonald]], the \"Apostle of the North\", arrived in 1822. Reverend MacDonald set about his mission with zeal, preaching 13 lengthy sermons during his first 11 days. He returned regularly and raised funds on behalf of the St Kildans, although privately he was appalled by their lack of religious knowledge. The islanders took to him with enthusiasm and wept when he left for the last time eight years later. His successor, who arrived on 3 July 1830, was Rev. Neil Mackenzie, a resident [[Church of Scotland]] minister who significantly improved the conditions of the inhabitants. He reorganised island agriculture, was instrumental in the rebuilding of the village (see below) and supervised the building of a new church and manse. With help from the Gaelic School Society, MacKenzie and his wife introduced formal education to Hirta, beginning a daily school to teach reading, writing and arithmetic and a [[Sunday school]] for religious education.<ref>Maclean (1977) pages 115\u20136.</ref>\n\nMackenzie left in 1844,{{refn|Maclean (1977) page 116. No new minister was appointed for a decade and as a result the school closed on the MacKenzie's departure.|group=\"note\"}} and although he had achieved a great deal, the weakness of the St Kildans' dependence on external authority was exposed in 1865 with the arrival of Rev. John Mackay. Despite their fondness for Mackenzie, who stayed in the Church of Scotland, the St Kildans \"came out\" in favour of the new Free Church during the Disruption. Mackay, the new Free Church minister, placed an uncommon emphasis on religious observance. He introduced a routine of three two-to-three-hour services on Sunday at which attendance was effectively compulsory. One visitor noted in 1875 that: \"The Sabbath was a day of intolerable gloom. At the clink of the bell, the whole flock hurry to Church with sorrowful looks and eyes bent upon the ground. It is considered sinful to look to the right or to the left.\"<ref>[[John Sands (journalist)|John Sands]], quoted in Maclean (1977) page 117.</ref> [[File:Insidestkildachurch.jpg|thumb|The interior of the church at Oiseabhal, St Kilda]]\n\nTime spent in religious gatherings interfered seriously with the practical routines of the island. Old ladies and children who made noise in church were lectured at length and warned of dire punishments in the afterworld. During a period of food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had to spend the day preparing for church on the Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.<ref>Maclean (1977) pages 116\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== Way of life ===\n[[File:Ropingpeg.jpg|thumb|St Kildans paid some of their rent by collecting seabirds; roping pegs \u2013 one of which can be seen in this photo \u2013 enabled them to [[abseiling|abseil]] down to the nests.]]\n\nMost modern commentators feel that the predominant theme of life on St Kilda was isolation. When [[Martin Martin]] visited the islands in 1697,<ref name=Martin/> the only means of making the journey was by open boat, which could take several days to cross the ocean by rowing and sailing. It was next to impossible to make the journey in the autumn and winter.

After the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746, it was rumoured that [[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] and some of his senior [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] aides had escaped to St Kilda. An expedition was launched, and in due course, British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When the St Kildans were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the prince and had never heard of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] either.<ref>Steel (1988) page 32.</ref>\n\nEven in the late 19th century, the islanders could only communicate with the outside by lighting a bonfire on the summit of Conachair which would, weather permitting, be visible to those on the isles of Harris and the Uists, or by using the \"St Kilda mailboat\".

The islanders kept sheep and a few cattle and were able to grow a limited amount of food crops, such as [[barley]] and [[potatoes]], on the better-drained land in Village Bay; in many ways the islands can be seen as a large mixed farm. [[Samuel Johnson]] reported that in the 18th-century [[Domestic sheep#As food|sheep's milk]] was made \"into small cheeses\" by the St Kildans.<ref>Johnson, Samuel (1775) ''A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland''. Republished, Chapman & Dodd, London, 1924. Page 121.</ref> They generally eschewed fishing because of the heavy seas and unpredictable weather.{{refn|The St Kildans fished from the rocks and even organised fishing trips from their boat(s) from time to time, but this was an occasional event, sometimes undertaken to pay rent, rather than a crucial aspect of day-to-day island life. See Maclean (1977) pp 102\u201303, who also quotes J. MacCulloch's 1824 ''Description of the Western Islands of Scotland'' as stating \"The neglect of fishing proceeds from the wealth of the inhabitants. They possess already as much food as they can consume, and are under no temptation to augment it by another perilous and laborious employment\".|group=\"note\"}} The mainstay of their food supplies was the profusion of island birds, especially [[gannet]] and [[fulmar]]. These they harvested as eggs and young birds and ate both fresh and cured. Adult puffins were also caught by the use of [[fowling]] rods.<ref name=Keay/> A 1764 census described a daily consumption for each of the 90 inhabitants at the same of \"36 wild fouls eggs and 18 fouls\" (i.e. seabirds).<ref>BBC News - Census find sheds new light on St Kilda's history (29 December 2016) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-38450471].

When [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] visited in 1799, he noted that \"the air is infected by a stench almost insupportable \u2013 a compound of rotten fish, filth of all sorts and stinking seafowl\".<ref name=Cooper>Cooper, Derek (1979) ''Road to the Isles: Travellers in the Hebrides 1770\u20131914''.

The building is between 1,700 and 2,500 years old, which suggests that the St Kildan diet had changed little over the millennia. Indeed, the tools were recognised by the St Kildans, who could put names to them as similar devices were still in use.<ref>Maclean (1977) page 26.</ref>\n\nThese fowling activities involved considerable skills in climbing, especially on the precipitous sea stacks. An important island tradition involved the 'Mistress Stone', a door-shaped opening in the rocks north-west of Ruival over-hanging a gully. Young men of the island had to undertake a ritual there to prove themselves on the crags, and to be worthy of taking a wife. Martin Martin wrote:\n[[File:Mistress Stone.jpg|thumb|right|The Mistress Stone]]\n{{quote|In the face of the rock, south from the town, is the famous stone, known by the name of the mistress-stone; it resembles a door exactly; and is in the very front of this rock, which is twenty or thirty fathom [{{Convert|120|to|180|ft|m}}] perpendicular in height, the figure of it being discernible about the distance of a mile; upon the lintel of this door, every bachelor-wooer is by an ancient custom obliged in honour to give a specimen of his affection for the love of his mistress, and it is thus; he is to stand on his left foot, having the one half of his sole over the rock, and then he draws the right foot further out to the left, and in this posture bowing, he puts both his fists further out to the right foot; and then after he has performed this, he has acquired no small reputation, being always after it accounted worthy of the finest mistress in the world: they firmly believe that this achievement is always attended with the desired success. This being the custom of the place, one of the inhabitants very gravely desired me to let him know the time limited by me for trying of this piece of gallantry before I design\u2019d to leave the place, that he might attend me; I told him this performance would have a quite contrary effect upon me, by robbing me both of my life and mistress at the same moment.<ref name=Martin/>}}\n\n[[File:Machias Seal Island puffins.jpg|thumb|[[Atlantic puffin]] (''Fratercula arctica'').

Most were [[blackhouse]]s of typical Hebridean design, but some older buildings were made of corbelled stone and turfed rather than thatched. The turf was used to prevent the ingress of wind and rain, and the older \"beehive\" buildings resembled green hillocks rather than dwellings.<ref>Maclean (1977) page 66.</ref>\n\n=== Post-Medieval period===\nThe Head Wall was built in 1834, when the medieval village was abandoned and a new one planned, between Tobar Childa and the sea which is some 700&nbsp;feet (200 m) down the slope. This came about as the result of a visit by [[Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet|Sir Thomas Dyke Ackland]], one of the [[Member of Parliament|members of parliament]] for [[Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|Devon]]. Appalled by the primitive conditions, he gave money for the building of a completely new settlement of thirty new [[blackhouse]]s. These houses were made of [[dry stone]], had thick walls, and were roofed with turf. Each typically had only one tiny window and a small opening for letting out smoke from the peat fire that burnt in the middle of the room. As a result, the interiors were blackened by soot. The cattle occupied one end of the house in winter, and once a year, the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground.<ref>Steel (1988) pages 72\u20133.</ref> In October 1860, several of the new dwellings were damaged by a severe gale, and repairs were sufficient only to make them suitable for use as [[byre]]s. According to [[Alasdair Alpin MacGregor|Alasdair MacGregor]]'s analysis of the settlement, the sixteen modern, zinc-roofed cottages amidst the black houses and new [[Factor (Scotland)|Factor's]] house seen in most photographs of the native islanders were constructed around 1862.<ref>MacGregor (1969) page 129.</ref>\n\n[[File:Featherstorestkilda.jpg|thumb|left|The Feather Store, where fulmar and gannet feathers were kept, and sold to pay the rent]]\nOne of the more poignant ruins on Hirta is the site of 'Lady Grange's House'.

He returned regularly and raised funds on behalf of the St Kildans, although privately he was appalled by their lack of religious knowledge. The islanders took to him with enthusiasm and wept when he left for the last time eight years later. His successor, who arrived on 3 July 1830, was Rev. Neil Mackenzie, a resident [[Church of Scotland]] minister who significantly improved the conditions of the inhabitants. He reorganised island agriculture, was instrumental in the rebuilding of the village (see below) and supervised the building of a new church and manse. With help from the Gaelic School Society, MacKenzie and his wife introduced formal education to Hirta, beginning a daily school to teach reading, writing and arithmetic and a [[Sunday school]] for religious education.<ref>Maclean (1977) pages 115\u20136.</ref>\n\nMackenzie left in 1844,{{refn|Maclean (1977) page 116. No new minister was appointed for a decade and as a result the school closed on the MacKenzie's departure.|group=\"note\"}} and although he had achieved a great deal, the weakness of the St Kildans' dependence on external authority was exposed in 1865 with the arrival of Rev. John Mackay. Despite their fondness for Mackenzie, who stayed in the Church of Scotland, the St Kildans \"came out\" in favour of the new Free Church during the Disruption. Mackay, the new Free Church minister, placed an uncommon emphasis on religious observance. He introduced a routine of three two-to-three-hour services on Sunday at which attendance was effectively compulsory. One visitor noted in 1875 that: \"The Sabbath was a day of intolerable gloom. At the clink of the bell, the whole flock hurry to Church with sorrowful looks and eyes bent upon the ground. It is considered sinful to look to the right or to the left.\"<ref>[[John Sands (journalist)|John Sands]], quoted in Maclean (1977) page 117.</ref> [[File:Insidestkildachurch.jpg|thumb|The interior of the church at Oiseabhal, St Kilda]]\n\nTime spent in religious gatherings interfered seriously with the practical routines of the island. Old ladies and children who made noise in church were lectured at length and warned of dire punishments in the afterworld. During a period of food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had to spend the day preparing for church on the Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.<ref>Maclean (1977) pages 116\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== Way of life ===\n[[File:Ropingpeg.jpg|thumb|St Kildans paid some of their rent by collecting seabirds; roping pegs \u2013 one of which can be seen in this photo \u2013 enabled them to [[abseiling|abseil]] down to the nests.]]\n\nMost modern commentators feel that the predominant theme of life on St Kilda was isolation. When [[Martin Martin]] visited the islands in 1697,<ref name=Martin/> the only means of making the journey was by open boat, which could take several days to cross the ocean by rowing and sailing. It was next to impossible to make the journey in the autumn and winter. According to a St Kilda diarist writing in 1908, vicious storms could be expected at any time between September and March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/weatherextremes/2014/08/04/st-kilda-extreme-weather-on-the-edge-of-the-world/|title=St Kilda: Extreme Weather on the Edge of the World|author=James|work=University of Nottingham|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref> More modern records from the National Trust for Scotland record gales for 75 days a year with peak winds around {{convert|144|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}} whilst peak wave heights on the Scottish west coast have been recorded at {{convert|16|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30402293|title=Power restored as 'weather bomb' storm subsides|work=BBC Scotland|date=11 December 2014|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeparated by distance and weather, the natives knew little of the mainland and international politics. After the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746, it was rumoured that [[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] and some of his senior [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] aides had escaped to St Kilda. An expedition was launched, and in due course, British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When the St Kildans were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the prince and had never heard of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] either.<ref>Steel (1988) page 32.</ref>\n\nEven in the late 19th century, the islanders could only communicate with the outside by lighting a bonfire on the summit of Conachair which would, weather permitting, be visible to those on the isles of Harris and the Uists, or by using the \"St Kilda mailboat\". This was the invention of [[John Sands (journalist)|John Sands]], who visited in 1877. During his stay, a shipwreck left nine Austrian sailors marooned there, and by February supplies were running low. Sands attached a message to a [[lifebuoy]] salvaged from the ''Peti Dubrovacki'' and threw it into the sea.<ref name=Sands>[http://www.widegrin.com/vicmisc/st_kilda.htm \"Life in St. Kilda\"], an account by J.

The St Kildans, building on this idea, would fashion a piece of wood into the shape of a boat, attach it to a bladder made of sheepskin, and place in it a small bottle or tin containing a message. Launched when the wind came from the north-west, two-thirds of the messages were later found on the west coast of Scotland or, less conveniently, in Norway.<ref>Maclean (1977) pages 136\u20138.</ref><ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/keacam/keacam0109.htm \"St Kilda mailboat\"] Glasgow Digital Library.

The islanders kept sheep and a few cattle and were able to grow a limited amount of food crops, such as [[barley]] and [[potatoes]], on the better-drained land in Village Bay; in many ways the islands can be seen as a large mixed farm. [[Samuel Johnson]] reported that in the 18th-century [[Domestic sheep#As food|sheep's milk]] was made \"into small cheeses\" by the St Kildans.<ref>Johnson, Samuel (1775) ''A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland''. Republished, Chapman & Dodd, London, 1924. Page 121.</ref> They generally eschewed fishing because of the heavy seas and unpredictable weather.{{refn|The St Kildans fished from the rocks and even organised fishing trips from their boat(s) from time to time, but this was an occasional event, sometimes undertaken to pay rent, rather than a crucial aspect of day-to-day island life. See Maclean (1977) pp 102\u201303, who also quotes J. MacCulloch's 1824 ''Description of the Western Islands of Scotland'' as stating \"The neglect of fishing proceeds from the wealth of the inhabitants. They possess already as much food as they can consume, and are under no temptation to augment it by another perilous and laborious employment\".|group=\"note\"}} The mainstay of their food supplies was the profusion of island birds, especially [[gannet]] and [[fulmar]]. These they harvested as eggs and young birds and ate both fresh and cured. Adult puffins were also caught by the use of [[fowling]] rods.<ref name=Keay/> A 1764 census described a daily consumption for each of the 90 inhabitants at the same of \"36 wild fouls eggs and 18 fouls\" (i.e. seabirds).<ref>BBC News - Census find sheds new light on St Kilda's history (29 December 2016) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-38450471].

When [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] visited in 1799, he noted that \"the air is infected by a stench almost insupportable \u2013 a compound of rotten fish, filth of all sorts and stinking seafowl\".<ref name=Cooper>Cooper, Derek (1979) ''Road to the Isles: Travellers in the Hebrides 1770\u20131914''. London. Routledge & Kegan Paul.</ref> An excavation of the ''Taigh an t-Sithiche'' (the \"house of the faeries\" \u2013 see below) in 1877 by Sands unearthed the remains of gannet, sheep, cattle and limpets amidst various stone tools. The building is between 1,700 and 2,500 years old, which suggests that the St Kildan diet had changed little over the millennia. Indeed, the tools were recognised by the St Kildans, who could put names to them as similar devices were still in use.<ref>Maclean (1977) page 26.</ref>\n\nThese fowling activities involved considerable skills in climbing, especially on the precipitous sea stacks. An important island tradition involved the 'Mistress Stone', a door-shaped opening in the rocks north-west of Ruival over-hanging a gully. Young men of the island had to undertake a ritual there to prove themselves on the crags, and to be worthy of taking a wife. Martin Martin wrote:\n[[File:Mistress Stone.jpg|thumb|right|The Mistress Stone]]\n{{quote|In the face of the rock, south from the town, is the famous stone, known by the name of the mistress-stone; it resembles a door exactly; and is in the very front of this rock, which is twenty or thirty fathom [{{Convert|120|to|180|ft|m}}] perpendicular in height, the figure of it being discernible about the distance of a mile; upon the lintel of this door, every bachelor-wooer is by an ancient custom obliged in honour to give a specimen of his affection for the love of his mistress, and it is thus; he is to stand on his left foot, having the one half of his sole over the rock, and then he draws the right foot further out to the left, and in this posture bowing, he puts both his fists further out to the right foot; and then after he has performed this, he has acquired no small reputation, being always after it accounted worthy of the finest mistress in the world: they firmly believe that this achievement is always attended with the desired success. This being the custom of the place, one of the inhabitants very gravely desired me to let him know the time limited by me for trying of this piece of gallantry before I design\u2019d to leave the place, that he might attend me; I told him this performance would have a quite contrary effect upon me, by robbing me both of my life and mistress at the same moment.<ref name=Martin/>}}\n\n[[File:Machias Seal Island puffins.jpg|thumb|[[Atlantic puffin]] (''Fratercula arctica'').

This was a meeting, held in the street, every morning after prayers and attended by all the adult males. During the course of the meeting, they would decide upon the day's activities; no one led the meeting, and all men had the right to speak.

It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so na\u00efve as they sometimes appeared. \"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\".<ref>Rev. Neil MacKenzie, quoted by Fleming (2005), p. 8</ref> The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially ''[[Neonatal tetanus|tetanus infantum]]'', which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 per cent during the late 19th century.<ref name=Keay/> The ''cnatan na gall'' or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.<ref name=Sands/><ref name=Cooper/>\n\nBy the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse.

Improved [[midwifery]] skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of [[childhood tetanus]]. From the 1880s, [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]] fishing the North Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875, during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80.

The islands' inhabitants had existed for centuries in relative isolation until tourism and the presence of the military during the First World War led the islanders to seek alternatives to privations they routinely suffered.

Large [[sheepfold]]s lie inland from the existing village at ''An Lag Bho'n Tuath'' (English: the hollow in the north) and contain unique 'boat-shaped' stone rings, or 'settings'. Soil samples suggest a date of 1850&nbsp;BC, but they are unique to St Kilda, and their purpose is unknown. In Gleann M\u00f2r, (north-west of Village Bay beyond Hirta's central ridge), there are twenty 'horned structures'. These are ruined buildings with a main court measuring about {{Convert|3|by|3|m|0|spell=in}}, with two or more smaller cells and a forecourt formed by two curved or horn-shaped walls. No structures like these exist anywhere else in Europe, and their original use is unknown.<ref>Quine (2000) page 91\u20132.</ref><ref>It is possible they are [[Pict]]ish structures dating from 400 to 900&nbsp;AD. Fleming (2005) page 23.</ref> Also in Gleann M\u00f2r is ''Taigh na Banaghaisgeich'', the 'Amazon's House'. As Martin (1703) reported, many St Kilda tales are told about this female warrior.\n\n<blockquote>\nThis Amazon is famous in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; some of the inhabitants dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in the centre of the floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go off the side of the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix\u2019d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.<ref name=Martin/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSimilar stories of a female warrior who hunted the now-submerged land between the Outer Hebrides and St Kilda are reported from [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]].<ref>Maclean (1977) pages 27\u20138.</ref> The structure's forecourt is akin to the other 'horned structures' in the immediate area, but like Martin's \"Amazon\" its original purpose is the stuff of legend rather than archaeological fact.\n\nMuch more is known of the hundreds of unique [[Cleit|''cleitean'']] that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, [[Food grain|grain]], preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact ''cleitean'' remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands.<ref>Maclean (1977) pages 65\u20136.</ref><ref>Quine (2000) page 32.</ref> House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.<ref>Quine (2000) page 51.</ref>\n\n=== Medieval village ===\n[[File:St Kilda village.jpg|thumb|The Village. The Head Wall surrounds the site, with Tobar Childa top left, the 19th century Street in the centre and the new military base to the right.]]\n\nA medieval village lay near Tobar Childa, about {{Convert|1/4|mile|km}} from the shore, at the foot of the slopes of Conachair. The oldest building is an underground passage with two small annexes called ''Taigh an t-Sithiche'' (house of the faeries) which dates to between 500&nbsp;BC and 300&nbsp;AD. The St Kildans believed it was a house or hiding place, although a more recent theory suggests that it was an [[Ice house (building)|ice house]].<ref>Quine (2000) pages 52\u20133.</ref>\n\nExtensive ruins of field walls and ''cleitean'' and the remnants of a [[medieval]] 'house' with a beehive-shaped annexe remain. Nearby is the 'Bull's House', a roofless rectangular structure in which the island's bull was kept during winter. Tobar Childa itself is supplied by two springs that lie just outside the Head Wall that was constructed around the Village to prevent sheep and cattle gaining access to the cultivated areas within its boundary.<ref name=\"Quine (2000) page 30.\">Quine (2000) page 30.</ref> There were 25 to 30 houses altogether. Most were [[blackhouse]]s of typical Hebridean design, but some older buildings were made of corbelled stone and turfed rather than thatched. The turf was used to prevent the ingress of wind and rain, and the older \"beehive\" buildings resembled green hillocks rather than dwellings.<ref>Maclean (1977) page 66.</ref>\n\n=== Post-Medieval period===\nThe Head Wall was built in 1834, when the medieval village was abandoned and a new one planned, between Tobar Childa and the sea which is some 700&nbsp;feet (200 m) down the slope. This came about as the result of a visit by [[Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet|Sir Thomas Dyke Ackland]], one of the [[Member of Parliament|members of parliament]] for [[Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|Devon]]. Appalled by the primitive conditions, he gave money for the building of a completely new settlement of thirty new [[blackhouse]]s. These houses were made of [[dry stone]], had thick walls, and were roofed with turf. Each typically had only one tiny window and a small opening for letting out smoke from the peat fire that burnt in the middle of the room. As a result, the interiors were blackened by soot. The cattle occupied one end of the house in winter, and once a year, the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground.<ref>Steel (1988) pages 72\u20133.</ref> In October 1860, several of the new dwellings were damaged by a severe gale, and repairs were sufficient only to make them suitable for use as [[byre]]s. According to [[Alasdair Alpin MacGregor|Alasdair MacGregor]]'s analysis of the settlement, the sixteen modern, zinc-roofed cottages amidst the black houses and new [[Factor (Scotland)|Factor's]] house seen in most photographs of the native islanders were constructed around 1862.<ref>MacGregor (1969) page 129.</ref>\n\n[[File:Featherstorestkilda.jpg|thumb|left|The Feather Store, where fulmar and gannet feathers were kept, and sold to pay the rent]]\nOne of the more poignant ruins on Hirta is the site of 'Lady Grange's House'. [[Rachel Chiesley, Lady Grange|Lady Grange]] had been married to the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathiser [[James Erskine, Lord Grange]], for 25 years when he decided that she might have overheard too many of his treasonable plottings. He had her kidnapped and secretly confined in [[Edinburgh]] for six months. From there she was sent to the [[Monach Isles]], where she lived in isolation for two years. She was then taken to Hirta from 1734 to 1740, which she described as \"a vile neasty,<!--sic--> stinking poor isle\". After a failed rescue attempt, she was removed on her husband's orders to the [[Isle of Skye]], where she died. The \"house\" on Hirta which carries her name is a large [[cleit]] in the Village meadows.<ref>Quine (2000) page 48.</ref><ref>Steel (1988) pages 31\u20132.</ref><ref>Keay & Keay (1994) page 358.</ref><ref>[http://www.kilda.org.uk/frame5.htm \"St Kilda: Fascinating Facts\"] National Trust for Scotland.

A small [[jetty]] was erected in 1877, but it was washed away in a storm two years later. In 1883 representations to the [[Napier Commission]] suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the [[Congested Districts Board (Scotland)|Congested Districts Board]] provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year.

The largest, Christ Church, was at the centre of the village and was in use during 1697. But, its thatched-roof structure was too small to hold the entire population, so most of the congregation had to gather in the churchyard during services. St Brendan's Church lay around {{convert|3/4|mile|km}} away on the slopes of Ruival, and St Columba's was at the west end of the village street, but little is left of these buildings. A new [[kirk]] and [[rectory|manse]] were erected at the east end of the village in 1830 and a [[Factor (Scotland)|Factor's]] house in 1860.<ref>Maclean (1977) page 31.</ref><ref>Quine (2000) page 37.</ref>\n\n=== Other islands ===\n[[File:Dun, St Kilda.jpg|thumb|left| [[D\u00f9n, St Kilda|D\u00f9n]] from Ruival with [[Stac Levenish]] in the background at left]]\n[[D\u00f9n, St Kilda|D\u00f9n]] means \"fort\", and there is a single ruined wall of a structure said to have been built in the far-distant past by the [[Fir Bolg]].<ref>Maclean (1977) page 29.</ref> The only \"habitation\" is ''Sean Taigh'' (old house), a natural cavern sometimes used as a shelter by the St Kildans when they were tending the sheep or catching birds.\n\nSoay has a primitive hut known as ''Taigh Dugan'' (Dugan's house).

The story of its creation relates to two sheep-stealing brothers from [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] who came to St Kilda only to cause further trouble. Dugan was exiled to Soay, where he died; the other, called Fearchar M\u00f2r, was sent to Stac an Armin, where he found life so intolerable he cast himself into the sea.\n\nBoreray boasts the ''Cleitean MacPh\u00e0idein'', a \"cleit village\" of three small bothies used regularly during fowling expeditions. Here too are the ruins of ''Taigh Stallar'' (the steward's house), which was similar to the Amazon's house in Gleann M\u00f2r although somewhat larger, and which had six-bed spaces.

During of the evacuation, all the islanders' sheep were removed from Hirta, but those on Boreray were left to become feral. These sheep are now regarded to a breed in their own right, the [[Boreray (sheep)|Boreray]].

In the [[1994 NBA Playoffs]], the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the [[New York Knicks]], whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2\u20130 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]] needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals.

Midway in the third quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket.

Pippen landed several feet (some meters) away from the basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing.

He was skilled at staying in front of his man on defense, and particularly effective as a help defender, with his long arms in traps. He was also capable of chasing down an opposing player in transition to block shots from behind.\n\nOn offense, Pippen relied primarily on his remarkable athleticism to gain an advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots\u2014mid-range and three-pointers\u2014on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket. He honed his jump shot over the course of his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketballnetwork.net/scottie-pippen-explains-how-he-developed-a-consistent-jump-shot-after-the-early-struggles-in-his-career-shooting-the-ball/|title=Scottie Pippen explains how he developed a consistent jump shot after the early struggles in his career shooting the ball|publisher=Basketball Network|date=October 6, 2019|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2019}}[[File:\u65d7.JPG|350x300px|thumbnail|right|Pippen's retired #33 jersey hangs in the rafters of the [[United Center]].]]Pippen is remembered as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall. Much like fellow [[Chicago Bulls all-time roster|Chicago Bull]] [[Michael Jordan]], he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as a help defender. He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.\n\nHis unusually long arms ({{convert|88|in|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wingspan)<ref name=\"SunTimes87\"/> and jumping agility helped him to clog the passing lanes on defense, to block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass him by, to grab seemingly out-of-reach rebounds, to make unusual plays in mid-air, and to make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make. He often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result. Pippen was also a selfless player. His team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls' championships. Pippen's [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|career assists total]] of 6,135 (5.2 per game) is a testament to that approach. It was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired.\n\nHis intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As Pippen himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast break points). During the [[Slam Dunk Contest#1990s|1990 Slam Dunk Contest]], Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with [[slam dunk|dunks]] and a skillful [[finger roll]] that he added to his skill set over time.

September 25, 1965), commonly spelled '''Scottie Pippen''', is an American former professional basketball player. He played 17 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), winning six [[NBA championship]]s with the [[Chicago Bulls]].

That year, he earned All-Star Game MVP honors and led the Bulls in scoring, assists, and blocks, and was second in the NBA in [[steal (basketball)|steals]] per game, averaging 22.0 points, 8.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 2.9 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game, while shooting 49.1% from the field and a career-best 32% from the [[three-point field goal|3-point]] line.

The Bulls (with key additions of Toni Kuko\u010d, Steve Kerr and Luc Longley) finished the season with 55 wins, only two fewer than the year before.\n\nHowever, one of the most controversial moments of Pippen's career came in his first year without Jordan. In the [[1994 NBA Playoffs]], the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the [[New York Knicks]], whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2\u20130 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]] needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philly]] |url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-05-14/sports/25830589_1_scottie-pippen-toni-kukoc-pete-myers|title=Pippen Sits This One Out Bulls' Leader Takes A Seat As Kukoc Hits Game-winner|date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> Although Kuko\u010d did hit the game-winner, a {{convert|23|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[fadeaway|fadeaway jumper]] at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court.<ref>{{YouTube|id=6yjeBPPIp_8|title=Toni Kukoc beats NYK @ d buzzer (94Playoffs) -by SoleRecords}}</ref> \"Scottie asked out of the play,\" Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|work=Sports Illustrated|title=Pippen's Paradox|first=Jackie|last=MacMullan|access-date=June 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301162801/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1997/bulls/pippen.html|archive-date=March 1, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \n\nA key play occurred in the following Game 5 which changed the outcome of the series.

Midway in the third quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center [[Patrick Ewing]] jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several feet (some meters) away from the basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then [[Spike Lee]], who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93\u201379.\n\nIn the final Game 7, Pippen scored 20 points and grabbed a whopping 16 rebounds, but the Bulls still lost 87\u201377.<ref name=\"gameseven\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199405220NYK.html|title=Chicago Bulls at New York Knicks Box Score, May 22, 1994|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref> The Knicks then proceeded to the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they lost to the [[Houston Rockets]], also in seven games.\n\nTrade rumors involving Pippen escalated during the 1994 off-season. [[Jerry Krause]], the Bulls' general manager, was reportedly looking to ship Pippen off to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in exchange for all-star forward [[Shawn Kemp]], moving [[Toni Kuko\u010d]] into Pippen's position as starting small forward with Kemp filling in the vacant starting power forward position in place of Horace Grant, a free agent who left the Bulls for the up-and-coming [[Orlando Magic]] during the off-season.  In January, when asked by the late [[Craig Sager]] as to whether he thought that he would be traded, Pippen replied, \"I hope I am\".<ref name=\"bulls_1995\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLFqk2JZEhM|title=Scottie Pippen Hopes to Be Traded to Suns (1995)|work=youtube.com|publisher=NBA TV|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref> However, Pippen would remain a Bull and those rumors were put to rest once it was announced that Michael Jordan would be returning to the Bulls, late in the {{nbay|1994}} season. The Pippen-led Bulls did not play as well in the {{nbay|1994}} season as they had in the season before. In fact, for the first time in years, they were in danger of missing the playoffs (though much of this may be due to a lack of interior defense and rebounding due to Grant's departure). The Bulls were just 34\u201331, prior to Jordan's return for the final 17 games, and Jordan led them to a 13\u20134 record to close the regular season.

Phil Jackson once described him as a \"one-man wrecking crew\", capable of guarding anyone from the point guard to the center position.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/14/sports/let-us-now-praise-pippen.html|title=Let Us Now Praise Pippen|date=June 14, 1997|last=Araton|first=Harvey|work=NY Times}}</ref> Pippen is one of three NBA players to record 200 steals and 100 blocks in a season and he has the record for second most career steals in the playoffs (395) behind LeBron James.  He was skilled at staying in front of his man on defense, and particularly effective as a help defender, with his long arms in traps. He was also capable of chasing down an opposing player in transition to block shots from behind.\n\nOn offense, Pippen relied primarily on his remarkable athleticism to gain an advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots\u2014mid-range and three-pointers\u2014on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket. He honed his jump shot over the course of his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketballnetwork.net/scottie-pippen-explains-how-he-developed-a-consistent-jump-shot-after-the-early-struggles-in-his-career-shooting-the-ball/|title=Scottie Pippen explains how he developed a consistent jump shot after the early struggles in his career shooting the ball|publisher=Basketball Network|date=October 6, 2019|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{BLP sources section|date=April 2019}}[[File:\u65d7.JPG|350x300px|thumbnail|right|Pippen's retired #33 jersey hangs in the rafters of the [[United Center]].]]Pippen is remembered as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall. Much like fellow [[Chicago Bulls all-time roster|Chicago Bull]] [[Michael Jordan]], he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as a help defender. He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.\n\nHis unusually long arms ({{convert|88|in|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wingspan)<ref name=\"SunTimes87\"/> and jumping agility helped him to clog the passing lanes on defense, to block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass him by, to grab seemingly out-of-reach rebounds, to make unusual plays in mid-air, and to make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make. He often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result. Pippen was also a selfless player. His team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls' championships. Pippen's [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|career assists total]] of 6,135 (5.2 per game) is a testament to that approach. It was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired.\n\nHis intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As Pippen himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast break points). During the [[Slam Dunk Contest#1990s|1990 Slam Dunk Contest]], Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with [[slam dunk|dunks]] and a skillful [[finger roll]] that he added to his skill set over time. He was also a prolific perimeter shooter for the time, taking about 3,000 and making almost 1,000 [[three-point field goal|three-pointers]] in his career.\n\nSeveral NBA players, including [[Jason Kidd]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html|title=Jason Kidd Would Take Scottie Pippen Over LeBron James in His All-Time Starting Five|first=Brian|last=Josephs|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=Jun 15, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> Michael Jordan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1849417-michael-jordan-dishes-on-his-starting-5-favorite-shoes-dunks-more|title=Michael Jordan Dishes on His Starting 5, Favorite Shoes, Dunks and More|first=Kenny|last=Dorset|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=Nov 13, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> and [[Karl Malone]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1662152-karl-malone-leaves-mj-off-his-all-time-starting-5-admits-man-crush-on-lebron|title=Karl Malone Leaves MJ Off His All-Time Starting 5, Admits 'Man Crush' on LeBron|first=Zack|last=Buckley|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=Jun 4, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2014}}</ref> have placed Pippen in their all-time starting lineups.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Scottie Pippen and his wife on December 15, 2006.jpg|300x300px|thumbnail|left|Pippen and his wife Larsa attending a [[Chicago Bulls]] game in December 2006]]\nAlthough his given name is spelled ''Scotty'' on his birth certificate, Pippen usually goes by ''Scottie''.<ref name=smith_07301996/> He stated that people usually shorten the name to ''Scott'' if it ends in ''y''.<ref name=fussman_12162011/>\n\nPippen has been married twice: to Karen McCollum (married 1988; divorced 1990) with whom he has a son, Antron Pippen (born 1987),<ref name=\"SunTimes89\">{{cite news|title=Scottie Pippen|date=May 29, 1989|first=Lacy J.|last=Banks|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=11}}</ref> and to Larsa Younan (married 1997; divorced 2018), with whom he has four children, Scotty Pippen Jr. (born 2000), Preston Pippen (born 2002), Justin Pippen (born 2005), and Sophia Pippen (born 2008).

Lulis and Catharina Jungman (Youngman) and their two children. They divided the land into 60\u2019 by 120\u2019 plots that were sold to other adventurous settlers, many of them German, and the village of Youngmanstown was formed. A few years later George Rote (Rhoade) laid out a village just east of Youngmanstown, known as Greenville or Rotestown, after George's death. Eventually, the two settlements merged at Third Street. In 1827 the two villages combined and were incorporated, the combined village was named Mifflinburg, in honor of [[Thomas Mifflin]], the first Governor of [[Pennsylvania]] after the 1790 Constitution. Historically the town was known for the manufacture of [[horse-drawn vehicles]], known as buggies.\n\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]],<ref name=\"GR2\" /> there were 3,540 people, 1,506 households, and 1,028 families living in the borough. The [[population density]] was 1,976.0 people per square mile (762.4/km\u00b2). There were 1,605 housing units at an average density of 882.4 per square mile (340.5/km\u00b2).

In 1792, S. Lulis and Catharina Jungman (Youngman) and their two children, came from Fort Augusta (now Sunbury) [[Pennsylvania]] to the Buffalo Valley to settle on land given to them by Catharina's father. They divided the land into 60\u2019 by 120\u2019 plots that were sold to other adventurous settlers, many of them German, and the village of Youngmanstown was formed. A few years later George Rote (Rhoade) laid out a village just east of Youngmanstown, known as Greenville or Rotestown, after George's death. Eventually, the two settlements merged at Third Street. In 1827 the two villages combined and were incorporated. The combined village was named Mifflinburg, in honor of [[Thomas Mifflin]], the first Governor of [[Pennsylvania]] after the 1790 Constitution.  The merged towns were known as Mifflinburg before 1827 however, because when Union County was formed from Northumberland County on March 22, 1813, that PA legislative act also established Mifflinburg as the seat of government of the newly formed county, with the first courthouse located at 406 Green Street and other government offices located in various other buildings throughout the town. It remained the county seat until 1815 when it was moved to New Berlin, and then to Lewisburg in 1855 where it remains today.\n\nIn 1845, George Swentzel set up Mifflinburg's first buggy business. Soon other buggy manufacturers set up their own shops in Mifflinburg, and by 1855, with a population of 800, Mifflinburg hosted thirteen coachmakers. By the 1880s, with more than fifty buggy and sleigh factories, Mifflinburg became known as \u201cBuggy Town\u201d because its buggy makers produced more [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s per capita than any other town in the state.\n\nThe [[Mifflinburg Historic District]], [[Hassenplug Bridge]], and [[William A.

At one time, Mifflin, as well as the small community of Denholm lying directly north of the town, was an important stop along the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Those tracks still travel through the town, although they are now owned by the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. Local legend holds that the railroad once considered placing its machine shop functions in Mifflin, which would undoubtedly have led to the establishment of Mifflin as an important Pennsylvania industrial center. However, the railroad placed those functions in the city of [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]].\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad depot still stands in Mifflin, although it has long been abandoned. Mifflin is named after [[Thomas Mifflin]], the 1st [[Governor of Pennsylvania]].\n\n==Geography==\nMifflin is located at {{coord|40|34|6|N|77|24|13|W|type:city}} (40.568262, -77.403496).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.2|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 885\n|1920= 965\n|1930= 913\n|1940= 860\n|1950= 835\n|1960= 745\n|1970= 640\n|1980= 648\n|1990= 660\n|2000= 627\n|2010= 642\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=621\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 627 people, 234 households, and 165 families residing in the borough.

As a \"Samoic Outlier\" language with strong links to western Polynesia, Pukapukan is not closely related to any other languages of the Cook Islands, but does manifest substantial borrowing from some East Polynesian source in antiquity.\n\nRecent research suggests that the languages of Pukapuka, Tokelau and Tuvalu group together as a cluster, and as such had significant influence on several of the Polynesian Outliers, such as Tikopia and Anuta, Pileni, Sikaiana (all in the Solomon Islands) and Takuu (off the coast of Bougainville, PNG). There is also evidence that Pukapuka had prehistoric contact with Micronesia, as there are quite a number of words in Pukapukan that appear to be borrowings from Kiribati (K. & M. Salisbury conference paper, 2013).\n\nPukapukan is also known as \"te leo Wale\" ('the language of Home') in reference to the name of the northern islet where the people live. The atoll population has declined from some 750 in the early 1990s to less than 500 since the cyclone in 2005. Literacy in the Pukapukan language was introduced in the school in the 1980s, resulting in an improvement in the quality of education on the atoll.\n\nThe majority of those speaking the language live in a number of migrant communities in New Zealand and Australia. A bilingual dictionary was started by the school teachers on the island and completed in Auckland within the Pukapukan community there.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Douglas |first1=Briar |title=Pukapuka dictionary goes live |url=http://www.cookislandsnews.com/item/16410-pukapuka-dictionary-goes-live/16410-pukapuka-dictionary-goes-live |accessdate=3 May 2019 |work=Cook Islands News |date=13 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Te Pukamuna - Pukapuka Dictionary |url=https://pukapuka.world/dictionary |accessdate=3 May 2019 |date=2013}}</ref> An indepth study of the language has resulted in a reference grammar (Mary Salisbury, A Grammar of Pukapukan, University of Auckland, 2003 700pp.).\nThe most significant publication in the Pukapuka language will be the \"Puka Y\u0101\" (Bible), with the New Testament expected to be completed for publishing in 2019.\n\n==History==\nPukapukan, also known as Bukabukan, is the language spoken on the coral atoll of Pukapuka, located in the northern section of the Cook Islands (Beaglehole 1906-1965). Pukapukan shares minor intelligibility with its national language of Cook Islands Maori, and bears strong links to its neighboring Western Polynesian cultures specifically Samoa.\nThe island of Pukapuka is one of the most remote islands in the Cook Islands. There is evidence that humans have inhabited the atoll for about 2000 years, but it is not clear whether it has been continuously inhabited. It may be certain that a final settlement took place around 1300 AD from [[Western Polynesia]]. Local oral tradition records that huge waves generated by a severe cyclone washed over the island and killed most of the inhabitants except for 15\u201317 men, 2 women and an unknown number of children. Recent interpretation of genealogies suggests that this catastrophe occurred about 1700 AD. It was from these survivors that the island was repopulated.\n\nThe island was one of the first of the Cook Islands to be discovered by the Europeans, on Sunday 20 August 1595 by the Spanish Explorer Alvaro Mendana.\n\n===Population===\nThe language of Pukapukan is not only spoken on the island of Pukapuka but on the neighboring Cook Islands as well as New Zealand and Australia. Today the population of Pukapuka has diminished with only a few hundred native speakers. From a 2001 census there were only about 644 speakers on Pukapuka and its plantation island of Nassau. As of a 2011 census, there are now only 450 speakers due to a devastating cyclone that hit the island of Pukapuka in 2005. There are a total of 2,400 speakers worldwide, including those who live on Pukapuka and the 200 speakers on [[Rarotonga]], the most populous island of the Cook Islands.\n\n===Classification===\nPukapukan is an Austronesian language,  (Ethnologue 2013). Though grouped with the Cook Islands the language shows influence from both Eastern and Western Polynesia.\n\n==Sound system==\n\n===Alphabet===\nThere are 15 letters in the Pukapukan alphabet \u2013 five vowels and 10 consonants. The digraph 'ng' occurs in the place that G occupies in the English alphabet.\na, e, ng, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, t, u, v, w, y\n\n===Consonants===\nThe consonant phonemes in Pukapukan are: / p, t, k, v, w, y, m, n, \u014b, l / (Teingoa 1993).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n![[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n![[Coronal consonant|Coronal]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n![[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n|[[Voiceless bilabial stop|p]]\n|[[Voiceless dental and alveolar stops|t]]\n|[[Voiceless velar stop|k]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n![[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|[[Voiced bilabial nasal|m]]\n|[[Voiced alveolar nasal|n]]\n|[[Voiced velar nasal|\u014b]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n!

The semivowel /w/ and the palatalised dental spirant /y/, in general, regularly reflect  *f and *s, respectively. The \u2018y\u2019 sound in Pukapukan actually acts somewhat differently and is difficult for non native speakers to pronounce. It is pronounced like \u2018th\u2019 in English \"this, other\".\n\n*wano, go\n*wou, new\n*wawine, woman\n*yinga, fall over\n*iyu, nose\n*tayi, one\n\n===Vowels===\nThe vowels in Pukapukan are respectively /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/. All vowels have two sounds, a long sound and a short sound. A vowel's length is indicated by writing a macron above each vowel.\n\n*papa, rock\n*pap\u0101, European\n*p\u0101p\u0101, father\n*p\u0101pa, crewcut (hairstyle)\n\nIn Pukapukan it is safe to say that every syllable ends with a vowel, every vowel is pronounced, and there are no diphthongal sounds.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Basic word order===\nPukapukan uses the two distinctive word orders of Verb-Subject-Object and Verb-Object-Subject, although it is clear that VSO is used more commonly. Adjectives always follow their nouns in Pukapukan. ''Waka-'' is often used as a causative prefix in Austronesian languages, but in Pukapukan it has various functionalities. Due to Rarotongan influence \u2018waka-\u2019 is shortened to \u2018aka-\u2019, whereas \u2018waka-\u2019 is seen to be more formal (Teingoa 1993).\nNouns prefixed by waka- become verbs with similar meanings:\n*au, peace; waka-au, to make peace\n*l\u0101, sun; waka-l\u0101, to put in the sun to dry\n*ela; wedge; wakaela, to wedge\n\t\nAdjectives prefixed by waka become transitive verbs:\n*yako, straight; waka-yako, to straighten\n*kokoi, sharp; waka-kokoi, to sharpen\n\nSome verbs prefixed by waka- have specialized meanings that become somewhat difficult to predict from the base meaning.\n*y\u0101, sacred; waka-y\u0101, to observe as sacred\n*pono, to be sure; waka-pono, to decide to finalize\n\n===Reduplication===\nLike many other Polynesian languages, Pukapukan uses a lot of full and partial reduplication, some times to emphasize a word or to give it new meaning.\n*kale, wave/surf; kale-le, undertow of the sea (waves coming in and others receding)\n*kapa, to clap hands in rhythm; kapa-kapa, to flutter\n\n===Numerals===\ntayi \u201cone\u201d\t\nlua \u201ctwo\u201d\t\ntolu \u201cthree\u201d\t\nwa \u201cfour\u201d\t\nlima \u201cfive\u201d\t\nono \u201csix\u201d\nwitu \u201cseven\u201d\nvalu \u201ceight\u201d\niva \u201cnine\u201d\nkatoa/laungaulu \u201cten\u201d\n\nPukapukan uses two different counting systems in the language; the \u2018one unit\u2019 and the \u2018two unit\u2019. Numeral classifiers are also used as prefixes for numbers over ten and different objects.\nThe \u2018one unit\u2019 uses its word for ten \u2018laungaulu\u2019 and adds the \u2018one unit\u2019 number (Teingoa 1993).\n*18 - laungaulu ma valu (ten and eight)\n\nFor numbers above nineteen the single unit numbers are used.\n*30 - lau tolu (two three)\n*40 - lau wa (two four)\n\nThe \u2018two unit\u2019 is derived from the \u2018one unit\u2019.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\n===Indigenous vocabulary===\nk\u0101vatavata \u201cnoise made by snapping tongue\u201d\nP\u014diva \u201cname of a deified ancestor\u201d\npulu \u201cthe calf of the leg\u201d\nY\u0101matangi \u201cprayer for a fair wind\u201d\n\n===Loanwords===\nPukapukan is not closely related to other Cook Islands languages but it does show substantial borrowing from Eastern Polynesian languages, such as Rarotongan. In fact, because there is no \u2018r\u2019 in Pukapukan \u2018l\u2019 takes its place in Rarotongan borrowings (Teingoa 1993).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" |\n!\n!Pukapukan\n!Rarotongan\n|-\n|Rarotonga\n|Lalotonga\n|Rarotonga\n|-\n|torch\n|lama\n|rama\n|-\n|hurry\n|limalima\n|rimarima\n|-\n|angry\n|lili\n|riri\n|-\n|pour\n|lilingi\n|riringi\n|}\n\n===Homophones===\nPukapukan uses many homophones in its vocabulary usually to give names to new words or items with similar origin meanings (Beaglehole 1906-1965).\n\nkapa\t\n#v. to clap hands in rhythm\n#v. to cry loudly\n#n. corner\n\nata\n#n. an emotional shock\n#n. shadow\n#n.

Although, today speakers of the language, locals of Pukapuka, and especially teachers on the island are working to put together books and resources dedicated to the teaching and structure of Pukapukan. Collaboratively the locals  of the island are also working to bring back to their own community since the devastating Cyclone Percy in 2005. Since 2005 it has taken nearly 6 years to rebuild their communities (Pasifika 2009). Currently there are a select number of manuscripts and dictionaries on the language of Pukapukan, but their culture is kept alive through music and dance collaborations across the pacific and websites like YouTube.\n\n===Vitality===\nAccording to Ethnologue Pukapukan is considered to be a threatened language and its \u201cIntergenerational transmission is in the process of being broken, but the child-bearing generation can still use the language so it is possible that revitalization efforts could restore transmission of the language in the home (Ethnologue 2013). Speakers of Pukapukan especially children are multilingual in English and Cook Islands Maori, but English is rarely spoken outside of schools and many classes are actually taught in Pukapukan. Today, revitalization efforts of Pukapuka and its language is underway (Pasifika 2009).\n\nPer the [http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/num_act/trma2003130/ Te Reo Maori Act], Pukapukan is deemed to be a form of [[Cook Islands M\u0101ori]] for legal purposes.\n\n===Further reading===\n*Teingo, W.

As a \"Samoic Outlier\" language with strong links to western Polynesia, Pukapukan is not closely related to any other languages of the Cook Islands, but does manifest substantial borrowing from some East Polynesian source in antiquity.\n\nRecent research suggests that the languages of Pukapuka, Tokelau and Tuvalu group together as a cluster, and as such had significant influence on several of the Polynesian Outliers, such as Tikopia and Anuta, Pileni, Sikaiana (all in the Solomon Islands) and Takuu (off the coast of Bougainville, PNG). There is also evidence that Pukapuka had prehistoric contact with Micronesia, as there are quite a number of words in Pukapukan that appear to be borrowings from Kiribati (K. & M. Salisbury conference paper, 2013).\n\nPukapukan is also known as \"te leo Wale\" ('the language of Home') in reference to the name of the northern islet where the people live. The atoll population has declined from some 750 in the early 1990s to less than 500 since the cyclone in 2005. Literacy in the Pukapukan language was introduced in the school in the 1980s, resulting in an improvement in the quality of education on the atoll.\n\nThe majority of those speaking the language live in a number of migrant communities in New Zealand and Australia. A bilingual dictionary was started by the school teachers on the island and completed in Auckland within the Pukapukan community there.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Douglas |first1=Briar |title=Pukapuka dictionary goes live |url=http://www.cookislandsnews.com/item/16410-pukapuka-dictionary-goes-live/16410-pukapuka-dictionary-goes-live |accessdate=3 May 2019 |work=Cook Islands News |date=13 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Te Pukamuna - Pukapuka Dictionary |url=https://pukapuka.world/dictionary |accessdate=3 May 2019 |date=2013}}</ref> An indepth study of the language has resulted in a reference grammar (Mary Salisbury, A Grammar of Pukapukan, University of Auckland, 2003 700pp.).\nThe most significant publication in the Pukapuka language will be the \"Puka Y\u0101\" (Bible), with the New Testament expected to be completed for publishing in 2019.\n\n==History==\nPukapukan, also known as Bukabukan, is the language spoken on the coral atoll of Pukapuka, located in the northern section of the Cook Islands (Beaglehole 1906-1965). Pukapukan shares minor intelligibility with its national language of Cook Islands Maori, and bears strong links to its neighboring Western Polynesian cultures specifically Samoa.\nThe island of Pukapuka is one of the most remote islands in the Cook Islands. There is evidence that humans have inhabited the atoll for about 2000 years, but it is not clear whether it has been continuously inhabited. It may be certain that a final settlement took place around 1300 AD from [[Western Polynesia]]. Local oral tradition records that huge waves generated by a severe cyclone washed over the island and killed most of the inhabitants except for 15\u201317 men, 2 women and an unknown number of children. Recent interpretation of genealogies suggests that this catastrophe occurred about 1700 AD. It was from these survivors that the island was repopulated.\n\nThe island was one of the first of the Cook Islands to be discovered by the Europeans, on Sunday 20 August 1595 by the Spanish Explorer Alvaro Mendana.\n\n===Population===\nThe language of Pukapukan is not only spoken on the island of Pukapuka but on the neighboring Cook Islands as well as New Zealand and Australia. Today the population of Pukapuka has diminished with only a few hundred native speakers. From a 2001 census there were only about 644 speakers on Pukapuka and its plantation island of Nassau. As of a 2011 census, there are now only 450 speakers due to a devastating cyclone that hit the island of Pukapuka in 2005. There are a total of 2,400 speakers worldwide, including those who live on Pukapuka and the 200 speakers on [[Rarotonga]], the most populous island of the Cook Islands.\n\n===Classification===\nPukapukan is an Austronesian language,  (Ethnologue 2013). Though grouped with the Cook Islands the language shows influence from both Eastern and Western Polynesia.\n\n==Sound system==\n\n===Alphabet===\nThere are 15 letters in the Pukapukan alphabet \u2013 five vowels and 10 consonants. The digraph 'ng' occurs in the place that G occupies in the English alphabet.\na, e, ng, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, t, u, v, w, y\n\n===Consonants===\nThe consonant phonemes in Pukapukan are: / p, t, k, v, w, y, m, n, \u014b, l / (Teingoa 1993).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n![[Labial consonant|Labial]]Labial\n!

Continuant\n| f v\n| \u00f0\u02b2 l\n|\n|}\n\nThe letters \u2018y\u2019 and \u2018w\u2019 are not in the Cook Islands Maori language but are additions to Pukapukan. The semivowel /w/ and the palatalised dental spirant /y/, in general, regularly reflect  *f and *s, respectively. The \u2018y\u2019 sound in Pukapukan actually acts somewhat differently and is difficult for non native speakers to pronounce. It is pronounced like \u2018th\u2019 in English \"this, other\".\n\n*wano, go\n*wou, new\n*wawine, woman\n*yinga, fall over\n*iyu, nose\n*tayi, one\n\n===Vowels===\nThe vowels in Pukapukan are respectively /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/. All vowels have two sounds, a long sound and a short sound. A vowel's length is indicated by writing a macron above each vowel.\n\n*papa, rock\n*pap\u0101, European\n*p\u0101p\u0101, father\n*p\u0101pa, crewcut (hairstyle)\n\nIn Pukapukan it is safe to say that every syllable ends with a vowel, every vowel is pronounced, and there are no diphthongal sounds.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Basic word order===\nPukapukan uses the two distinctive word orders of Verb-Subject-Object and Verb-Object-Subject, although it is clear that VSO is used more commonly. Adjectives always follow their nouns in Pukapukan. ''Waka-'' is often used as a causative prefix in Austronesian languages, but in Pukapukan it has various functionalities. Due to Rarotongan influence \u2018waka-\u2019 is shortened to \u2018aka-\u2019, whereas \u2018waka-\u2019 is seen to be more formal (Teingoa 1993).\nNouns prefixed by waka- become verbs with similar meanings:\n*au, peace; waka-au, to make peace\n*l\u0101, sun; waka-l\u0101, to put in the sun to dry\n*ela; wedge; wakaela, to wedge\n\t\nAdjectives prefixed by waka become transitive verbs:\n*yako, straight; waka-yako, to straighten\n*kokoi, sharp; waka-kokoi, to sharpen\n\nSome verbs prefixed by waka- have specialized meanings that become somewhat difficult to predict from the base meaning.\n*y\u0101, sacred; waka-y\u0101, to observe as sacred\n*pono, to be sure; waka-pono, to decide to finalize\n\n===Reduplication===\nLike many other Polynesian languages, Pukapukan uses a lot of full and partial reduplication, some times to emphasize a word or to give it new meaning.\n*kale, wave/surf; kale-le, undertow of the sea (waves coming in and others receding)\n*kapa, to clap hands in rhythm; kapa-kapa, to flutter\n\n===Numerals===\ntayi \u201cone\u201d\t\nlua \u201ctwo\u201d\t\ntolu \u201cthree\u201d\t\nwa \u201cfour\u201d\t\nlima \u201cfive\u201d\t\nono \u201csix\u201d\nwitu \u201cseven\u201d\nvalu \u201ceight\u201d\niva \u201cnine\u201d\nkatoa/laungaulu \u201cten\u201d\n\nPukapukan uses two different counting systems in the language; the \u2018one unit\u2019 and the \u2018two unit\u2019. Numeral classifiers are also used as prefixes for numbers over ten and different objects.\nThe \u2018one unit\u2019 uses its word for ten \u2018laungaulu\u2019 and adds the \u2018one unit\u2019 number (Teingoa 1993).\n*18 - laungaulu ma valu (ten and eight)\n\nFor numbers above nineteen the single unit numbers are used.\n*30 - lau tolu (two three)\n*40 - lau wa (two four)\n\nThe \u2018two unit\u2019 is derived from the \u2018one unit\u2019.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\n===Indigenous vocabulary===\nk\u0101vatavata \u201cnoise made by snapping tongue\u201d\nP\u014diva \u201cname of a deified ancestor\u201d\npulu \u201cthe calf of the leg\u201d\nY\u0101matangi \u201cprayer for a fair wind\u201d\n\n===Loanwords===\nPukapukan is not closely related to other Cook Islands languages but it does show substantial borrowing from Eastern Polynesian languages, such as Rarotongan. In fact, because there is no \u2018r\u2019 in Pukapukan \u2018l\u2019 takes its place in Rarotongan borrowings (Teingoa 1993).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" |\n!\n!Pukapukan\n!Rarotongan\n|-\n|Rarotonga\n|Lalotonga\n|Rarotonga\n|-\n|torch\n|lama\n|rama\n|-\n|hurry\n|limalima\n|rimarima\n|-\n|angry\n|lili\n|riri\n|-\n|pour\n|lilingi\n|riringi\n|}\n\n===Homophones===\nPukapukan uses many homophones in its vocabulary usually to give names to new words or items with similar origin meanings (Beaglehole 1906-1965).\n\nkapa\t\n#v. to clap hands in rhythm\n#v. to cry loudly\n#n. corner\n\nata\n#n. an emotional shock\n#n. shadow\n#n.

Although, today speakers of the language, locals of Pukapuka, and especially teachers on the island are working to put together books and resources dedicated to the teaching and structure of Pukapukan. Collaboratively the locals  of the island are also working to bring back to their own community since the devastating Cyclone Percy in 2005. Since 2005 it has taken nearly 6 years to rebuild their communities (Pasifika 2009). Currently there are a select number of manuscripts and dictionaries on the language of Pukapukan, but their culture is kept alive through music and dance collaborations across the pacific and websites like YouTube.\n\n===Vitality===\nAccording to Ethnologue Pukapukan is considered to be a threatened language and its \u201cIntergenerational transmission is in the process of being broken, but the child-bearing generation can still use the language so it is possible that revitalization efforts could restore transmission of the language in the home (Ethnologue 2013). Speakers of Pukapukan especially children are multilingual in English and Cook Islands Maori, but English is rarely spoken outside of schools and many classes are actually taught in Pukapukan. Today, revitalization efforts of Pukapuka and its language is underway (Pasifika 2009).\n\nPer the [http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/num_act/trma2003130/ Te Reo Maori Act], Pukapukan is deemed to be a form of [[Cook Islands M\u0101ori]] for legal purposes.\n\n===Further reading===\n*Teingo, W.
