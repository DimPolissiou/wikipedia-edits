This joint team combined to defeat [[Ansar al-Islam]], an ally of Al Qaida, in a battle in the northeast corner of Iraq. The U.S. side was carried out by Paramilitary Officers from SAD and the Army's [[10th Special Forces Group (United States)|10th Special Forces Group]].<ref name=\"Attack, Bob Woodward 2004\" /><ref name=\"Tucker 2008\" /><ref name=\"charles-faddis-interview\" />\n\nSAD teams also conducted high-risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions led to the initial strikes against Saddam Hussein and his key generals. Although the initial strikes against Saddam were unsuccessful in killing the dictator or his generals, they were successful in effectively ending the ability to command and control Iraqi forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force coming from the south.<ref name=\"Attack, Bob Woodward 2004\" /><ref name=\"charles-faddis-interview\" />\n\nSAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started and/or not to oppose the invasion force.<ref name=\"Tucker 2008\" /> NATO member [[Turkey]] refused to allow its territory to be used for the invasion. As a result, the SAD/SOG and U.S. Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga constituted the entire northern force against government forces during the invasion. Their efforts kept the 5th Corps of the Iraqi army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than moving to contest the coalition force.\n\nAccording to [[Tommy Franks|General Tommy Franks]], [[April Fool (spy)|April Fool]], an American officer working [[undercover]] as a diplomat, was approached by an Iraqi [[intelligence agent]].

In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to incapacitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see [[Shock and awe]]), attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The assumption was that superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces would allow them to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.\n\nFollowing [[Turkey]]'s decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south.<ref>''Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq'', Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press.</ref> Special Operations forces from the CIA and U.S. Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in [[Kuwait]] and other [[Persian Gulf]] nations. One result of this was that one of the divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable to take part in the invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations.\n\n[[File:Baghdad etm 2003092 lrg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[NASA]] [[Landsat 7]] image of [[Baghdad]], 2 April 2003.

The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the first Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set many oil wells on fire]] and had dumped oil into the Gulf waters; this was to disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi forces had mined some 400 oil wells around [[Basra]] and the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] with explosives. <ref>http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-novdec03/Nov3-Boots.pdf</ref> <ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/21/sprj.irq.oil.wells/index.html</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150519003256/http://kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Profile/History/OilFires.aspx</ref>\nCoalition troops launched an air and [[amphibious assault]] on the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] during the closing hours of 19 March to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Polish Navy]], and [[Royal Australian Navy]].\n\nIn the meantime, Royal Air Force Tornados from 9 and 617 Squadrons attacked the radar defence systems protecting Baghdad, but lost a Tornado on 22 March along with the pilot and navigator (Flight Lieutenant Kevin Main and Flight Lieutenant Dave Williams), shot down by an American Patriot missile as they returned to their airbase in Kuwait.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/31/military.iraq|title=Coroner condemns 'glaring failures' that led to US missile killing RAF crew|newspaper=the Guardian|date=31 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305033041/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/31/military.iraq|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> On 1 April, an F-14 from USS Kitty Hawk crashed in southern Iraq reportedly due to engine failure,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/f-14.htm|title=f-14|access-date=12 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626124822/http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/f-14.htm|archive-date=26 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and a S-3B Viking plunged off the deck of the USS Constellation after a malfunction and an AV-8B Harrier jump jet went into the Gulf while it was trying to land on the USS Nassau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjsinnam.com/war_on_terror/IF/April_2_F-14_SAR.htm|title=The following was received from a PJ in Operation Iraqi Freedom|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073741/http://www.pjsinnam.com/war_on_terror/IF/April_2_F-14_SAR.htm|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nBritish [[3 Commando Brigade]], with the [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] and the [[Poland|Polish]] Special Forces unit [[GROM]] attached, attacked the port of [[Umm Qasr]]. There they met with heavy resistance by Iraqi troops. A total of 14 Coalition troops and 30\u201340 Iraqi troops were killed, and 450 Iraqis taken prisoner. The [[British Army]]'s [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] also secured the oil fields in southern Iraq in places like [[Rumaila Field|Rumaila]] while the Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction. Despite the rapid advance of the invasion forces, some 44 oil wells were destroyed and set ablaze by Iraqi explosives or by incidental fire. However, the wells were quickly capped and the fires put out, preventing the ecological damage and loss of oil production capacity that had occurred at the end of the Gulf War.\n\nIn keeping with the rapid advance plan, the [[U.S. 3rd Infantry Division]] moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the [[1st Marine Expeditionary Force]] moved along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and [[1 (UK) Armoured Division]] moved northward through the eastern marshland.\n\nDuring the first week of the war, Iraqi forces fired a [[Scud]] missile at the American Battlefield Update Assessment center in [[Camp Doha]], Kuwait.

Iraqi reinforcements from [[Kut]] launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200\u2013300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi Fedayeen continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights in which large numbers of Fedayeen were killed. Because of Nasiriyah's strategic position as a road junction, significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the city's surrounding highways.\n\nWith the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured, Coalition forces gained an important logistical center in southern Iraq and established FOB/EAF Jalibah, some {{convert|10|mi|km}} outside of Nasiriyah. Additional troops and supplies were soon brought through this forward operating base. The [[101st Airborne Division]] continued its attack north in support of the 3rd Infantry Division.\n\nBy 28 March, a severe sand storm slowed the Coalition advance as the 3rd Infantry Division halted its northward drive halfway between Najaf and Karbala.

A joint Polish-British-American force ran into unexpectedly stiff resistance, and it took several days to clear the Iraqi forces out. Farther north, the [[British 7 Armoured Brigade]] (\"The Desert Rats\"), fought their way into Iraq's second-largest city, [[Basra]], on 6 April, coming under constant attack by regulars and Fedayeen, while 3rd Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] cleared the 'old quarter' of the city that was inaccessible to vehicles. Entering Basra was achieved after two weeks of fierce fighting, including a tank battle when the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]] destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks on 27 March. A few members of D Squadron, British SAS, were deployed to southern Iraq to support the coalition advance on Basra, the team conducted forward route reconnaissance and infiltrated the city and brought in strikes on the Ba'athist loyalist leadership.<ref>{{cite book|last=Urban|first=Mark|title=Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq|location=St. Martin's|publisher=Griffin|year=2012|isbn=978-1250006967|p=9}}</ref><ref name=\"Neville, Leigh 2016\">Neville, Leigh, ''The SAS 1983-2014 (Elite)'', Osprey Publishing, 2016, {{ISBN|1472814037}} {{ISBN|978-1472814036}}, p.36,</ref>\n\nElements of [[1 (UK) Armoured Division]] began to advance north towards U.S. positions around [[Amarah|Al Amarah]] on 9 April. Pre-existing electrical and water shortages continued throughout the conflict and looting began as Iraqi forces collapsed. While Coalition forces began working with local Iraqi Police to enforce order, a joint team composed of [[Royal Engineers]] and the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] of the British Army rapidly set up and repaired dockyard facilities to allow humanitarian aid to begin to arrive from ships arriving in the port city of [[Umm Qasr]].\n\nAfter a rapid initial advance, the first major pause occurred near [[Karbala]]. There, U.S. Army elements met resistance from Iraqi troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north. Eventually, troops from the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S. Army secured the cities of Najaf and Karbala to prevent any Iraqi counterattacks on the 3rd Infantry Division's lines of communication as the division pressed its advance toward Baghdad.\n\nA total of 11 British soldiers were killed, while 395\u2013515 Iraqi soldiers, irregulars, and Fedayeen were killed.\n\n===Battle of Karbala===\n{{Main|Battle of Karbala (2003)}}\n[[File:DerelictAsadBabil.JPEG|thumb|An ''Asad Babil'' abandoned after facing the final US thrust into Baghdad]]\nThe Karbala Gap was a 20\u201325-mile wide strip of land with the Euphrates River to the east and [[Lake Razazah]] to the west. This strip of land was recognized by Iraqi commanders as a key approach to [[Baghdad]], and was defended by some of the best units of the [[Iraqi Republican Guard]].

Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was in command of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib. At Musayib, U.S. troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time.\n\nThe 10th Armored Brigade from the Medina Division and the 22nd Armored Brigade from the Nebuchadnezzar Division, supported by artillery, launched night attacks against the U.S. bridgehead at Musayib. The attack was repulsed using tank fire and massed [[Multiple Launch Rocket System|artillery rockets]], destroying or disabling every Iraqi tank in the assault. The next morning, Coalition aircraft and helicopters fired on the Republican Guard units, destroying many more vehicles as well as communications infrastructure. The Republican Guard units broke under the massive firepower and the U.S. forces poured through the gap and onward to Baghdad.\n\n===Special operations===\n[[File:Iraq invasion northern front.gif|thumb|upright|The northern front during March and April 2003]]\n\n====Initial infiltration====\nB Squadron, [[Delta Force]] (known as \"Wolverines,\") accompanied by several Air Force Special Tactics teams, a Delta intelligence and Target Acquisition, several military working dog teams and two Iraqi\u2014American interpreters, was the first US SOF unit to enter western Iraq, crossing the border from [[Arar, Saudi Arabia|Ar'ar]] in 15 customised [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauer]] 6x6 Special Operations Vehicles and several armed Toyota Hilux pick up trucks. As part of Task Force 20, their formal role was to conduct selected high-priority [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] on suspected chemical weapon facilities before heading for the Haditha Dam complex.

They set up observation posts and called in airstrikes that defeated the Iraqi defenders, the combined British and Australian Squadrons took H-2 virtually unopposed, H-3 was secured on 25 March with the assistance of members of Delta Force and by Green Beret ODAs from Bravo company, 1st Battalion 5th SFG; a company of Rangers and Royal Marines from [[45 Commando]] flew from Jordan to the bases and the base was handed over to them. The SAS teams moved to the next objective \u2013 the intersection of the two main highways linking Baghdad with Syria and Jordan,<ref>Urban, Mark, ''Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq '', St. Martin's Griffin, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00696-7}}, p.10</ref><ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.118-119</ref> where both squadrons were involved in conducting interdictions of fleeing Iraqi leadership targets heading for Syria.<ref name=\"Neville, Leigh 2016\"/>\n\nPreviously, 16 (Air) Troop of D squadron conducted mounted reconnaissance of an Iraqi army facility near the Syrian border, followed by a harassing attack on the site, two other troops had conducted mobile ambushes on Iraqi units in the area, although they themselves were being hunted by a large Fedayeen Saddam unit mounted in 'technicals.'<ref name=\"Neville, Leigh 2016\"/>\n\nIn northern Iraq in early March, a small reconnaissance team from M Squadron of the [[Special Boat Service|British Special Boat Service]] mounted on Honda ATVs inserted into Iraq from Jordan, its first mission was to conduct reconnaissance of an Iraqi air base at al-Sahara. The team was compromised by an anti-special forces Fedayeen unit and barely escaped thanks to a U.S. F-15E that flew air cover for the team and the bravery of an RAF Chinook that extracted the team under the Fedayeen's 'noses'. A second larger SBS operation was launched by M Squadron in full strength in a mix of land rovers and ATVs into northern Iraq from H-2 airbase, the objective was to locate, make contact and take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Army Corps somewhere past Tikrit and to survey and mark viable temporary landing zones for follow-on forces. However the Squadron was compromised by a goat herder; the SBS drove for several days whilst unknown to them anti-special forces Fedayeen units followed them. At an overnight position near Mosul, the Fedayeen ambushed the Squadron with DShK heavy machine guns and RPGs, the SBS returned fire and began taking fire from a [[T-72]], the Squadron scattered and escaped the well-constructed trap. A number of Land Rovers became bogged down in a nearby wadi, so they mined the vehicles and abandoned them \u2013 though several did not detonate and were captured and exhibited on Iraqi television. The SBS was now in three distinct groups: one with several operational Land Rovers was being pursued by the Iraqi hunter force, a second mainly equipped with ATVs was hunkered down and trying to arrange extraction, the third with just 2 operators on an ATV raced for the Syrian border. The first group tried to call in coalition strike aircraft but the aircraft couldn't identify friendly forces because the SBS were not equipped with infra-red strobes \u2013 although their vehicles did have Blue Force Tracker units, they eventually made it to an emergency rendezvous point and were extracted by a RAF Chinook. The second group was also extracted by an RAF Chinook and the third group made it to Syria and was held there until their release was negotiated, there were no SBS casualties.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.121-123</ref>\n\n====Operation Viking Hammer====\nIn the early hours of 21 March 2003, as part of [[Operation Viking Hammer]], a total of 64 [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk cruise missiles]] struck the [[Ansar al-Islam]] camp and the surrounding sites, the terrorists group \u2013 numbering around 700 \u2013 had inhabited a valley near [[Halabja]] Iraqi Kurdistan, along with a small [[Kurdistan Islamic Group|Kurdish splinter faction]]; they had prepared a number of defensive positions including anti-aircraft machine guns and maintained a facility, that US intelligence suspected, at which chemical and biological agents may have been developed and stored for future terrorist attacks.

The main advance set off towards Sargat \u2013 the location of the suspected chemical and biological weapons site; the force was soon pinned down by DShK heavy machine gun fire from the surrounding hills. A pair of [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18s]] responded to an urgent [[Close air support|CAS]] request from the force and dropped two [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|500lb JDAMs]] on the Ansar al-Islam machine gun nests and strafed the positions with 20mm cannon before departing due to being low on fuel. The advance began again only to be halted once more by fire from prepared DShK and PKM machine gun nests, Green Berets from ODA 081 deployed a [[Mk 19 grenade launcher]] from the back of a [[Toyota Tacoma]] and suppressed the gun positions allowing the Peshmerga to assault and wipe out the terrorists. After capturing the town of Gulp, the force continued onto the village of Sargat; the village was heavily defended by fortified fighting positions mounting DShKs and mortars along with several [[BM-21 Grad]]. Unable to call in airstrikes due to the close proximity of the Peshmerga, a Green Beret sergeant used a dismounted [[M2 Browning|M2 HMG]] to suppress the entrenched terrorists, his actions allowed the Peshmerga to bring forward their own 82mm Mortars and Grads which forced the Ansar al-Islam fighters to retreat. Task Force Viking advanced to secure the Daramar Gorge \u2013 which was surrounded by caves in the rock walls \u2013 the Peshmerga were again engaged by small arms fire and RPGs which it and the ODAs returned fire with heavy weapons, however it became obvious that they couldn't advance any further without air support. To dislodge the terrorists, the [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Combat Controllers]] attached to the ODAs vectored in US Navy F/A-18s which dropped six 500&nbsp;lb JDAMs that shut down any further resistance. During the night, four [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunships]] maintained the pressure on the retreating Ansar al-Islam terrorists as they pulled back toward the Iranian border; the next day, Task Force Viking seized the high ground and pushed down through the valley \u2013 surrounding and killing small pockets of remnants from Ansar al-Islam. With their objectives completed 3rd Battalion and their Peshmerga returned to the green line to assist the push on Kirkuk and Mosul. A specialist [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] team was brought in to document the find at Sargat, the team recovered traces of several chemicals including [[Ricin]] along with stocks of [[CBRN defense|NBC protective suits]], atropine injectors and Arabic manuals on chemical weapons and [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] construction. Estimates of Ansar al-Islam dead number over 300, many of them foreign fighters, whilst only 22 Peshmerga fighters were killed.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.100-101</ref>\n\n====Special operations in southern Iraq====\nOn 21 March, ODA 554 of Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]] crossed the border with the United States Marines to support the seizure of the Rumaylah oilfields which was later secured by UK forces; half the team later drove to the outskirts of Basra and successfully picked up four Iraqi oil industry technicians who had been recruited by the CIA to assist in safeguarding the oilfields from destruction, they later rejoined the other half of the team and fought roving bands of Fedayeen. The ODAs next mission was to work with a CIA-recruited Sheikh and assist British forces in identifying targets around Basra. The ODA soon established an informant network, they eventually assisted the British in rounding up some 170 Fedayeen in the city; they were eventually replaced by members of G Squadron 22nd SAS Regiment.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.116</ref>\n\n===Special operations in northern Iraq===\n[[File:030323-M-3692W-014 Sgt.

Delta Force recce operators drove through Iraqi lines around the [[Haditha Dam]] on customised ATVs, marking targets for Coalition airstrikes resulting in the eventual destruction of a large number of Iraqi armoured vehicles and antiaircraft systems. Delta's reconnaissance of the dam indicated that a larger force would be needed to seize it, so a request was made and approved for a second Delta squadron from Fort Bragg to be dispatched with a further Ranger battalion, along with M1A1 Abrams tanks from C Company, 2nd Battalion [[70th Armor Regiment|70th Armor]]. C-17 flew the company from Talil to H-1 and then to MSS (Mission Support Site) Grizzly \u2013 a desert strip established by Delta Force located between Haditha and Tikrit; C Squadron, Delta Force was flown directly to MSS Grizzly.<ref name=\"Neville, Leigh p.93\"/>\n\nOn 1 April, C squadron, Delta Force and 3/75th Ranger Regiment conducted a night-time ground assault in their [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauers]] and GMVs against the Haditha Dam complex. Three platoons of Rangers seized the dams' administrative buildings with little initial opposition, while a pair of AH-6M Six Guns orbited overhead, soon after daybreak, a Ranger sniper shot and killed 3 Iraqis carrying RPGs on the western side of the dam and Rangers on the eastern side engaged a truck carrying infantry, which led to an hour-long contract. South of the dam, another Ranger platoon was securing the dam's power station and electricity transformer against sabotage, another platoon was occupied establishing blocking positions on the main road into the dam complex. The blocking positions came under the sporadic mortar fire, resulting in the AH-6Ms flying multiple gun runs to silence the mortar positions, another mortar team, firing from a small island was engaged and silenced by a Ranger Javelin team. For five days, Iraqi forces continued to harass the Rangers at the dam, principally with episodic artillery and mortar fire along with several infantry counterattacks against the blocking positions; the [[HIMARS]] rocket system saw its first combat deployment at the dam \u2013 firing counter-battery missions, 3 Rangers were killed on 3 April by a [[Car bomb|VBIED]] at the blocking positions, the car was driven by a pregnant Iraqi woman acting distressed and asking for water. Rangers captured an Iraqi forward observer dressed as a civilian after sinking his kayak with .50cal fire, the observer had maps of the Rangers positions.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.128-130</ref>\n\n====Objective Beaver====\nIntelligence indicated that chemical and biological weapons stocks may have been located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along the shore of the [[Lake Qadisiyah|al Qadisiyah reservoir]] among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a [[DEVGRU]] assault element supported by B Company, [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Battalion]], 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky \u2013 pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached \u2013 engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of chemical or biological weapons at the Objective Beaver.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.133-134</ref>\n\n====Operations in western Iraq====\nBravo and Charlie companies of 1st Battalion [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]] crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges to clear a path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of [[Nukhayb|Nukyab]], Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA's 534 and 532 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab searching for mobile SCUB-B TEL launch sites.  ODA 532 also inserted a mobile weather station that provided planners with vital real time weather updates of the battle space. Bravo company set out for the central town of [[Ar-Rutbah|Ar Rutba]] and [[H-3 Air Base]] with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. While waiting, the reconnaissance team and Target Acquisition Marines fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (who were clearing suspects east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove into the middle of the firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.108-111</ref>\n\nThe strategic intent of the US Army Special Forces ODAs had been to shutdown the main supply routes and deny access around Ar Rutbah and the strategically important H-3 airbase, which was defended by a battalion of Iraqi troops and significant numbers of mobile and static anti aircraft guns. On 24 March 2003, the surrounding ODAs supported by Task Force 7 (British [[Special Air Service]]) and Task Force 64 (Australian Special Air Service Regiment) called in constant 24 hours of precision airstrikes on H-3 using SOFLAM target designators, the aerial bombardment forced the Iraqi military vehicles to leave the base and headed towards Baghdad. ODA 521 over watching the highway they were travelling on ambushed the convoy destroying a truck mounted [[ZU-23-2|ZU-23]], the convoy was thrown into disarray, a sandstorm prevented the ODA calling in airstrikes and the convoy scattered into the desert. Bravo company 5th SFG and the coalition SOF secured the airfield, finding a [[Roland (missile)|Roland surface-to-air missile system]], around 80 assorted anti aircraft cannon guns including [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7 grail handheld SAMs]] and an enormous amount of ammunition. H-3 was established as an Advanced Operating Base for Bravo company, with supplies delivered by C-130s and MH-47Es; ODA 581 vehicle checkpoint managed to capture the Iraqi general in command of H-3 as he was trying to escape in civilian attire, he was secured and flown by an unmarked CIA SAD Air Branch Little Brid on 28 March for further interrogation. Additionally, ODA 523 discovered what may have been chemical weapons samples in a laboratory on the grounds of H-3.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.111-112</ref>\n\nBravo company turned its attention to Ar Rutbah, signals intercepts by SOT-A (Support Operations Team \u2013 Alpha) and an informer network among the Bedouins as well as inhabitants of the town indicated that around 800 Fedayeen remained in the town; Fedayeen patrols from the town were engaged by surrounding Green Berets and captured. ODAs guided in precision airstrikes on Fedayeen anti aircraft guns on the outskirts of the town and on top of the airstrikes, they also struck large groups of Fedayeen militia with Javelin missiles. On 9 April, nine ODAs secured the main roads into the town an commenced a day of near continuous final airstrikes from fix-wing aircraft and Apache helicopters. Civilians from the town approached the Green Berets asking them to stop the bombing, the Green Berets struck a deal with the civilians and they entered the town the next day. A B-52 and 2 F-16Cs flew show of force flights over the town as the Green Berets entered, the Fedayeen blended in with the population. Within days, the Green Berets helped the town to elect a mayor and set up markets, get sixty percent of the electricity grid working and repair water supplies. ODA 521 and 525 continued to operate in the region, stopping several trucks carrying foreign fighters, they disarmed them, took their details and warned them not to come back before sending them to Syria; in late May, the teams were replaced by the [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment]].<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.113-114</ref>\n\n====Other special operations====\n[[File:T-54s, T-55s, Type 59s or Type 69s at Diwaniyah, Iraq.jpg|thumb|The destroyed remains of Iraqi tanks and other armored vehicles litter an Iraqi military complex west of [[Diwaniyah]]]]\nThe 2nd [[Battalion]] of the U.S. [[5th Special Forces Group]], [[United States Army Special Forces]] (Green Berets) conducted reconnaissance in the cities of [[Basra]], [[Karbala]] and various other locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.groups.sfahq.com/5th/03_04_29_before_war_sf.htm |title=SF in Iraq Long Before War Began |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=U.S. Army Special Forces Groups (Airborne) |access-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321015110/http://www.groups.sfahq.com/5th/03_04_29_before_war_sf.htm |archivedate=21 March 2015  }}<br />{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=US Special Forces in Iraq Long Before War Began \u2013 2003-04-29 |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-a-2003-04-29-32-us-67306707/381196.html |publisher=Voice of America |date=28 April 2003 |access-date=18 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320200358/http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-a-2003-04-29-32-us-67306707/381196.html |archive-date=20 March 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nAfter Sargat was taken, Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and CIA paramilitary officers along with their Kurdish allies pushed south towards [[Tikrit]] and the surrounding towns of Northern Iraq.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leigh Neville|title=Special Operations Forces in Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cqi3yVGkDZ8C&pg=PA12|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-826-8|pages=12\u201313|access-date=16 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914235907/https://books.google.com/books?id=Cqi3yVGkDZ8C&pg=PA12|archive-date=14 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Previously, during the Battle of the Green Line, Bravo Company, 3/10 with their Kurdish allies pushed back, destroyed, or routed the 13th Iraqi Infantry Division.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Frank Antenori|author2=Hans Halberstadt|title=Roughneck Nine-One|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3rcU3nBOFO4C&pg=PA133|date=24 May 2011|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-54414-0|pages=133\u2013136|access-date=16 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915001924/https://books.google.com/books?id=3rcU3nBOFO4C&pg=PA133|archive-date=15 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The same company took Tikrit.

Initial intelligence that led to her rescue was provided by an informant who approached ODA 553 when it was working in Nasiriyah, the intelligence was passed on and Task Force 20 planned a rescue mission. Launching from the recently captured airfield at Talil, the rescue force consisted of 290 Rangers from [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd battalion]], 75th Ranger Regiment, around 60 SEALs from [[DEVGRU]] along with [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Para Rescue Jumpers]] and Combat Controllers from the [[24th Special Tactics Squadron]] conventional Marines from Task Force Tarawa then currently fighting through the city and aviators from the Army, Marines and Air Force. The plan called for Task Force Tarawa to conduct a deception mission by seizing the bridges across the Euphrates to draw attention away from the hospital Lynch was held at, an airstrike by US Marine AV-8 Harriers would be conducted against one of the bridges to confuse the opposition further and US Marine AH-1W Cobras were tasked to fly over the area to conceal the sound of incoming SOF helicopters. Air cover as provided by an AC-130 Spectre and a Marine EA-6 Prowler to jam any enemy SAM systems that might be present. With the deception mission underway, the SEAL and select Ranger elements would be inserted by MH-60K Blackhawks and four MH-6 Little Birds, supported by four AH-6 attack helicopters and two MH-60L DAPs, the other Rangers would be flown in by Marine CH-46s and CH-53 transport helicopters to establish a cordon around the hospital grounds. The main assault force of SEALs would arrive by a ground convoy of [[Pandur I|AGMS Pandur]] forearmed vehicles and GMV trucks whilst the hostage rescue element landed directly on the objective in MH-6 Little Birds.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.131</ref>\n\nAt 0100 on 1 April 2003, the Marines commenced their deception mission, CIA elements cut the city's power as the helicopters approached their objective, the AH-6s led the way, behind them the MH-6s dropped off Task Force 20 sniper teams at strategic locations around and on the hospital. The DAPs and the AH-6s covered the MH-60Ks as they dropped off assault teams on the hospital roof and another by the front door, the ground assault convoy arrived and the assaulters raced inside and onto the second floor where Lynch was located. 13 minutes later, a MH-60K touched down near the hospital entrance with a team of PJs and SOAR medics on board and transported Lynch to Talil where it rendezvoused with a standby medical flight and then onto Kuwait and finally the United States. The Hospital was devoid of any Fedayeen, although evidence suggested they were using it as a base; the Ranger blocking teams experienced some sporadic direct fire, the SEALs and the Rangers eventually recovered the remains of eight members of Lynch's unit that had been killed or died of their wounds.

The rest of the defenders were a mixture of [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] units, regular army units, [[Fedayeen Saddam]], and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.\n\nThis plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guard's assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. On 5 April, Task Force [[64th Armor Regiment|1\u201364 Armor]] of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division executed a raid, later called the \"Thunder Run\", to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 Bradley armored fighting vehicles advancing to the [[Baghdad airport]]. They met significant resistance, but were successful in reaching the airport, and eventually secured it after heavy fighting.\n\n[[File:IrakKriegM1A1USA.jpg|thumb|An American M1 Abrams tank destroyed in Baghdad]]\n\nThe next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division attacked into downtown Baghdad and occupied one of the palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.\n\n[[File:Marines in Saddams palace DM-SD-04-12222.jpg|left|alt=photograph of three Marines entering a partially destroyed stone palace with a mural of Arabic script|thumb|Marines from [[1st Battalion 7th Marines]] enter a palace during the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|Battle of Baghdad]]]]\n\nOn 10 April, a rumor emerged that Saddam Hussein and his top aides were in a mosque complex in the Al Az'Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three companies of Marines were sent to capture him and came under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed.\n\n[[File:SaddamStatue.jpg|thumb|upright|The April 2003 [[Firdos Square statue destruction|toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue]] in [[Firdos Square]] in Baghdad shortly after the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|capture of the city]]]]\n\nMany Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his [[cult of personality]].

The Iraqi cities of [[Al-Kut]] and [[Nasiriyah]] launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of the new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued.\n[[File:Grateful Iraqis welcome American Marines during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.ogg|alt=video of US Marines entering the city|US Marines being welcomed while entering Baghdad in April 2003|right|thumb]]\nU.S. General [[Tommy Franks]] assumed control of Iraq as the supreme commander of the coalition occupation forces. Shortly after the sudden collapse of the defense of Baghdad, rumors were circulating in Iraq and elsewhere that there had been a deal struck (a \"safqua\") wherein the U.S.-led Coalition had bribed key members of the Iraqi military elite and/or the Ba'ath party itself to stand down. In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led Coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear.\n\nU.S.-led Coalition troops promptly began searching for the key members of Saddam Hussein's government. These individuals were identified by a variety of means, most famously through sets of [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]]. Later during the [[military occupation]] period after the invasion, on 22 July 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from [[Task Force 20]], Saddam Hussein's sons [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight. Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003 by the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division and members of [[Task Force 121]] during [[Operation Red Dawn]].\n\n===Other areas===\n\nU.S. special forces had also been involved in the extreme south of Iraq, attempting to occupy key roads to [[Syria]] and airbases. In one case two armored platoons were used to convince Iraqi leadership that an entire armored battalion was entrenched in the west of Iraq.\n\nOn 15 April, U.S. forces took control of [[Tikrit]], the last major outpost in central Iraq, with an attack led by the Marines' [[Task Force Tripoli]]. About a week later the Marines were relieved in place by the Army's 4th Infantry Division.\n\nCoalition aircraft flew over 41,000 sorties,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/topics/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18635 |title=Operation Iraqi Freedom |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=16 October 2014 |website=Air Force Historical Support Division |publisher=United States Air Force |access-date=16 March 2015 |quote=n the first six weeks, coalition air forces flew more than 41,000 sorties and the USAF accounted for more than 24,000 of the total. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313040611/http://www.afhso.af.mil/topics/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18635 |archive-date=13 March 2015 |url-status=live  }}<br />{{cite book|author=Benjamin Benjamin Lambeth|title=The Unseen War: Allied Air Power and the Takedown of Saddam Hussein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_5mAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT135|date=15 October 2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-312-6|page=135}}</ref> of which over 9,000 were tanker sorties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony H.

The invasion did require a large army build-up like the 1991 Gulf War, but many did not see combat and many were withdrawn after the invasion ended.

Attacks on U.S. [[Main Supply Route|supply routes]] by Fedayeen militiamen were repulsed. The Iraqis' artillery proved largely ineffective, and they were unable to mobilize their air force to attempt a defense. The Iraqi [[T-72]] tanks, the most powerful armored vehicles in the Iraqi army, were both outdated and ill-maintained, and when they were mobilized they were rapidly destroyed, thanks in part to the Coalition [[air supremacy]]. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Naval Aviation, and British [[Royal Air Force]] operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended resistance targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived. The [[main battle tank]]s of the U.S. and UK forces, the U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] and British [[Challenger 2]], functioned well in the rapid advance across the country. Despite the many [[rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few U.S. and UK tanks were lost, and no tank crew-members were killed by hostile fire, although nearly 40 M1 Abrams were damaged in the attacks.<ref>\"During Operation Iraqi Freedom, as many as 40 Abrams tanks were damaged by RPGs. Most were repaired.\" ''Battle Tanks: Power in the Field'', Page 33, Enslow Publishers, 2006</ref> The only tank loss sustained by the British Army was a Challenger 2 of the [[Queen's Royal Lancers]] that was hit by another Challenger 2, killing two crew members.\n\nThe Iraqi army suffered from poor [[morale]], even amongst the elite Republican Guard. Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon the approach of invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces to surrender to. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. The leadership of the Iraqi army was incompetent \u2013 reports state that [[Qusay Hussein]], charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units were confused, and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target points rather than seek to engage Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war without having been engaged, and fully intact, especially in southern Iraq. It is assumed that most units disintegrated to return to their homes.\n\nAccording to the declassified [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] report, \"The largest contributing factor to the complete defeat of Iraq's military forces was the continued interference by Saddam.\" The report, designed to help U.S. officials understand in hindsight how Saddam and his military commanders prepared for and fought the invasion, paints a picture of an Iraqi government blind to the threat it faced, hampered by Saddam's inept military leadership and deceived by its own propaganda and inability to believe an invasion was imminent without further Iraqi provocation. According to the BBC, the report portrays Saddam Hussein as \"chronically out of touch with reality&nbsp;\u2013 preoccupied with the prevention of domestic unrest and with the threat posed by Iran.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4843394.stm |title=Russia denies Iraq secrets claim |work=BBC News |date=25 March 2006 |accessdate=7 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061223055637/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4843394.stm |archive-date=23 December 2006 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n==Casualties==\n{{Main|Casualties in the conflict in Iraq|Humanitarian Crises of the Iraq War}}\n\n===Death toll===\nEstimates on the number of casualties during the invasion in Iraq vary widely.

There were only enough U.S. troops on the ground to guard a certain number of the many sites that ideally needed protection, and so, apparently, some \"hard choices\" were made.\n\nIt was reported that [[National Museum of Iraq|The Iraq Museum]] was among the looted sites. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was soon called into Iraq to track down the stolen items. It was found that the initial allegations of looting of substantial portions of the collection were heavily exaggerated. Initial reports asserted a near-total looting of the museum, estimated at upwards of 170,000 inventory lots, or about 501,000 pieces. The more recent estimate places the number of stolen pieces at around 15,000, and about 10,000 of them probably were taken in an \"inside job\" before U.S. troops arrived, according to Bogdanos.

In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to incapacitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see [[Shock and awe]]), attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The assumption was that superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces would allow them to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.\n\nFollowing [[Turkey]]'s decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south.<ref>''Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq'', Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press.</ref> Special Operations forces from the CIA and U.S. Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in [[Kuwait]] and other [[Persian Gulf]] nations. One result of this was that one of the divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable to take part in the invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations.\n\n[[File:Baghdad etm 2003092 lrg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[NASA]] [[Landsat 7]] image of [[Baghdad]], 2 April 2003.

The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the first Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set many oil wells on fire]] and had dumped oil into the Gulf waters; this was to disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi forces had mined some 400 oil wells around [[Basra]] and the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] with explosives. <ref>http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-novdec03/Nov3-Boots.pdf</ref> <ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/21/sprj.irq.oil.wells/index.html</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150519003256/http://kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Profile/History/OilFires.aspx</ref>\nCoalition troops launched an air and [[amphibious assault]] on the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] during the closing hours of 19 March to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Polish Navy]], and [[Royal Australian Navy]].\n\nIn the meantime, Royal Air Force Tornados from 9 and 617 Squadrons attacked the radar defence systems protecting Baghdad, but lost a Tornado on 22 March along with the pilot and navigator (Flight Lieutenant Kevin Main and Flight Lieutenant Dave Williams), shot down by an American Patriot missile as they returned to their airbase in Kuwait.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/31/military.iraq|title=Coroner condemns 'glaring failures' that led to US missile killing RAF crew|newspaper=the Guardian|date=31 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305033041/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/31/military.iraq|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> On 1 April, an F-14 from USS Kitty Hawk crashed in southern Iraq reportedly due to engine failure,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/f-14.htm|title=f-14|access-date=12 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626124822/http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/f-14.htm|archive-date=26 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and a S-3B Viking plunged off the deck of the USS Constellation after a malfunction and an AV-8B Harrier jump jet went into the Gulf while it was trying to land on the USS Nassau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjsinnam.com/war_on_terror/IF/April_2_F-14_SAR.htm|title=The following was received from a PJ in Operation Iraqi Freedom|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073741/http://www.pjsinnam.com/war_on_terror/IF/April_2_F-14_SAR.htm|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nBritish [[3 Commando Brigade]], with the [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] and the [[Poland|Polish]] Special Forces unit [[GROM]] attached, attacked the port of [[Umm Qasr]]. There they met with heavy resistance by Iraqi troops. A total of 14 Coalition troops and 30\u201340 Iraqi troops were killed, and 450 Iraqis taken prisoner. The [[British Army]]'s [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] also secured the oil fields in southern Iraq in places like [[Rumaila Field|Rumaila]] while the Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction. Despite the rapid advance of the invasion forces, some 44 oil wells were destroyed and set ablaze by Iraqi explosives or by incidental fire. However, the wells were quickly capped and the fires put out, preventing the ecological damage and loss of oil production capacity that had occurred at the end of the Gulf War.\n\nIn keeping with the rapid advance plan, the [[U.S. 3rd Infantry Division]] moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the [[1st Marine Expeditionary Force]] moved along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and [[1 (UK) Armoured Division]] moved northward through the eastern marshland.\n\nDuring the first week of the war, Iraqi forces fired a [[Scud]] missile at the American Battlefield Update Assessment center in [[Camp Doha]], Kuwait.

Iraqi reinforcements from [[Kut]] launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200\u2013300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi Fedayeen continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights in which large numbers of Fedayeen were killed. Because of Nasiriyah's strategic position as a road junction, significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the city's surrounding highways.\n\nWith the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured, Coalition forces gained an important logistical center in southern Iraq and established FOB/EAF Jalibah, some {{convert|10|mi|km}} outside of Nasiriyah. Additional troops and supplies were soon brought through this forward operating base. The [[101st Airborne Division]] continued its attack north in support of the 3rd Infantry Division.\n\nBy 28 March, a severe sand storm slowed the Coalition advance as the 3rd Infantry Division halted its northward drive halfway between Najaf and Karbala.

There, U.S. Army elements met resistance from Iraqi troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north.

Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was in command of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib. At Musayib, U.S. troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time.\n\nThe 10th Armored Brigade from the Medina Division and the 22nd Armored Brigade from the Nebuchadnezzar Division, supported by artillery, launched night attacks against the U.S. bridgehead at Musayib. The attack was repulsed using tank fire and massed [[Multiple Launch Rocket System|artillery rockets]], destroying or disabling every Iraqi tank in the assault. The next morning, Coalition aircraft and helicopters fired on the Republican Guard units, destroying many more vehicles as well as communications infrastructure.

A second larger SBS operation was launched by M Squadron in full strength in a mix of land rovers and ATVs into northern Iraq from H-2 airbase, the objective was to locate, make contact and take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Army Corps somewhere past Tikrit and to survey and mark viable temporary landing zones for follow-on forces. However the Squadron was compromised by a goat herder; the SBS drove for several days whilst unknown to them anti-special forces Fedayeen units followed them. At an overnight position near Mosul, the Fedayeen ambushed the Squadron with DShK heavy machine guns and RPGs, the SBS returned fire and began taking fire from a [[T-72]], the Squadron scattered and escaped the well-constructed trap. A number of Land Rovers became bogged down in a nearby wadi, so they mined the vehicles and abandoned them \u2013 though several did not detonate and were captured and exhibited on Iraqi television. The SBS was now in three distinct groups: one with several operational Land Rovers was being pursued by the Iraqi hunter force, a second mainly equipped with ATVs was hunkered down and trying to arrange extraction, the third with just 2 operators on an ATV raced for the Syrian border. The first group tried to call in coalition strike aircraft but the aircraft couldn't identify friendly forces because the SBS were not equipped with infra-red strobes \u2013 although their vehicles did have Blue Force Tracker units, they eventually made it to an emergency rendezvous point and were extracted by a RAF Chinook. The second group was also extracted by an RAF Chinook and the third group made it to Syria and was held there until their release was negotiated, there were no SBS casualties.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.121-123</ref>\n\n====Operation Viking Hammer====\nIn the early hours of 21 March 2003, as part of [[Operation Viking Hammer]], a total of 64 [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk cruise missiles]] struck the [[Ansar al-Islam]] camp and the surrounding sites, the terrorists group \u2013 numbering around 700 \u2013 had inhabited a valley near [[Halabja]] Iraqi Kurdistan, along with a small [[Kurdistan Islamic Group|Kurdish splinter faction]]; they had prepared a number of defensive positions including anti-aircraft machine guns and maintained a facility, that US intelligence suspected, at which chemical and biological agents may have been developed and stored for future terrorist attacks.

The main advance set off towards Sargat \u2013 the location of the suspected chemical and biological weapons site; the force was soon pinned down by DShK heavy machine gun fire from the surrounding hills. A pair of [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18s]] responded to an urgent [[Close air support|CAS]] request from the force and dropped two [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|500lb JDAMs]] on the Ansar al-Islam machine gun nests and strafed the positions with 20mm cannon before departing due to being low on fuel. The advance began again only to be halted once more by fire from prepared DShK and PKM machine gun nests, Green Berets from ODA 081 deployed a [[Mk 19 grenade launcher]] from the back of a [[Toyota Tacoma]] and suppressed the gun positions allowing the Peshmerga to assault and wipe out the terrorists. After capturing the town of Gulp, the force continued onto the village of Sargat; the village was heavily defended by fortified fighting positions mounting DShKs and mortars along with several [[BM-21 Grad]]. Unable to call in airstrikes due to the close proximity of the Peshmerga, a Green Beret sergeant used a dismounted [[M2 Browning|M2 HMG]] to suppress the entrenched terrorists, his actions allowed the Peshmerga to bring forward their own 82mm Mortars and Grads which forced the Ansar al-Islam fighters to retreat. Task Force Viking advanced to secure the Daramar Gorge \u2013 which was surrounded by caves in the rock walls \u2013 the Peshmerga were again engaged by small arms fire and RPGs which it and the ODAs returned fire with heavy weapons, however it became obvious that they couldn't advance any further without air support. To dislodge the terrorists, the [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Combat Controllers]] attached to the ODAs vectored in US Navy F/A-18s which dropped six 500&nbsp;lb JDAMs that shut down any further resistance. During the night, four [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunships]] maintained the pressure on the retreating Ansar al-Islam terrorists as they pulled back toward the Iranian border; the next day, Task Force Viking seized the high ground and pushed down through the valley \u2013 surrounding and killing small pockets of remnants from Ansar al-Islam.

As ODA 51 cautiously advanced on the village, it came under intense fire \u2013 the two platoons of Iraqis turned out to be closer to battalion strength and equipped with heavy weapons like 82mm mortars, antiaircraft guns and an artillery piece. After 4 hours of F/A-18 airstrikes and constant heavy weapons fire from ODA 055 and 056, the assault force entered Ayn Sifni; soon afterwards, Iraqi infantry counterattacked, supported by several mortars, attempting to retake the town, but it was beaten back by ODA 51 and the Kurds.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.102</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 2003, ODA 391 and ODA 392 from the 3rd SFG and ODA 044 from 10th SFG with about 150 Kurdish fighters were the main force involved in the [[Battle of Debecka Pass]].<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.102-105</ref>\n\nOn 9 April, nine ODAs from FOB 103 encircled [[Kirkuk]] after fierce fighting to capture the ridges overlooking the approaches to the city, the earlier capture of the nearby city of [[Tuz Khormato|Tuz]] had largely broken the will of the Iraqi Army and only the Fedayeen remained in Kirkuk, the first ODA units entered the city the next day, a week later the 173rd Airborne took over responsibility for the city, after some minor skirmishes the Fedayeen fled.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.105</ref> Staging out of MSS Grizzly, Delta mounted operations to interdict Ba'ath Party HVTs on Highway 1 (Highway 2 and 4 in western Iraq had been secured by British SAS and Australian SAS teams), on 9 April, the combined team seized an airfield near Tikrit.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.130-131</ref>\n\nThe successful occupation of Kirkuk came as a result of approximately two weeks of fighting that included the Battle of the Green Line (the unofficial border of the Kurdish autonomous zone) and the subsequent Battle of Kani Domlan Ridge (the ridgeline running northwest to southeast of Kirkuk), the latter fought exclusively by 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga against the Iraqi [[1st Corps (Iraq)|1st Corps]].

Delta Force recce operators drove through Iraqi lines around the [[Haditha Dam]] on customised ATVs, marking targets for Coalition airstrikes resulting in the eventual destruction of a large number of Iraqi armoured vehicles and antiaircraft systems. Delta's reconnaissance of the dam indicated that a larger force would be needed to seize it, so a request was made and approved for a second Delta squadron from Fort Bragg to be dispatched with a further Ranger battalion, along with M1A1 Abrams tanks from C Company, 2nd Battalion [[70th Armor Regiment|70th Armor]]. C-17 flew the company from Talil to H-1 and then to MSS (Mission Support Site) Grizzly \u2013 a desert strip established by Delta Force located between Haditha and Tikrit; C Squadron, Delta Force was flown directly to MSS Grizzly.<ref name=\"Neville, Leigh p.93\"/>\n\nOn 1 April, C squadron, Delta Force and 3/75th Ranger Regiment conducted a night-time ground assault in their [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauers]] and GMVs against the Haditha Dam complex. Three platoons of Rangers seized the dams' administrative buildings with little initial opposition, while a pair of AH-6M Six Guns orbited overhead, soon after daybreak, a Ranger sniper shot and killed 3 Iraqis carrying RPGs on the western side of the dam and Rangers on the eastern side engaged a truck carrying infantry, which led to an hour-long contract. South of the dam, another Ranger platoon was securing the dam's power station and electricity transformer against sabotage, another platoon was occupied establishing blocking positions on the main road into the dam complex. The blocking positions came under the sporadic mortar fire, resulting in the AH-6Ms flying multiple gun runs to silence the mortar positions, another mortar team, firing from a small island was engaged and silenced by a Ranger Javelin team. For five days, Iraqi forces continued to harass the Rangers at the dam, principally with episodic artillery and mortar fire along with several infantry counterattacks against the blocking positions; the [[HIMARS]] rocket system saw its first combat deployment at the dam \u2013 firing counter-battery missions, 3 Rangers were killed on 3 April by a [[Car bomb|VBIED]] at the blocking positions, the car was driven by a pregnant Iraqi woman acting distressed and asking for water. Rangers captured an Iraqi forward observer dressed as a civilian after sinking his kayak with .50cal fire, the observer had maps of the Rangers positions.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.128-130</ref>\n\n====Objective Beaver====\nIntelligence indicated that chemical and biological weapons stocks may have been located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along the shore of the [[Lake Qadisiyah|al Qadisiyah reservoir]] among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a [[DEVGRU]] assault element supported by B Company, [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Battalion]], 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky \u2013 pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached \u2013 engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of chemical or biological weapons at the Objective Beaver.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.133-134</ref>\n\n====Operations in western Iraq====\nBravo and Charlie companies of 1st Battalion [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]] crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges to clear a path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of [[Nukhayb|Nukyab]], Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA's 534 and 532 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab searching for mobile SCUB-B TEL launch sites.  ODA 532 also inserted a mobile weather station that provided planners with vital real time weather updates of the battle space. Bravo company set out for the central town of [[Ar-Rutbah|Ar Rutba]] and [[H-3 Air Base]] with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. While waiting, the reconnaissance team and Target Acquisition Marines fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (who were clearing suspects east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove into the middle of the firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.108-111</ref>\n\nThe strategic intent of the US Army Special Forces ODAs had been to shutdown the main supply routes and deny access around Ar Rutbah and the strategically important H-3 airbase, which was defended by a battalion of Iraqi troops and significant numbers of mobile and static anti aircraft guns. On 24 March 2003, the surrounding ODAs supported by Task Force 7 (British [[Special Air Service]]) and Task Force 64 (Australian Special Air Service Regiment) called in constant 24 hours of precision airstrikes on H-3 using SOFLAM target designators, the aerial bombardment forced the Iraqi military vehicles to leave the base and headed towards Baghdad. ODA 521 over watching the highway they were travelling on ambushed the convoy destroying a truck mounted [[ZU-23-2|ZU-23]], the convoy was thrown into disarray, a sandstorm prevented the ODA calling in airstrikes and the convoy scattered into the desert. Bravo company 5th SFG and the coalition SOF secured the airfield, finding a [[Roland (missile)|Roland surface-to-air missile system]], around 80 assorted anti aircraft cannon guns including [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7 grail handheld SAMs]] and an enormous amount of ammunition. H-3 was established as an Advanced Operating Base for Bravo company, with supplies delivered by C-130s and MH-47Es; ODA 581 vehicle checkpoint managed to capture the Iraqi general in command of H-3 as he was trying to escape in civilian attire, he was secured and flown by an unmarked CIA SAD Air Branch Little Brid on 28 March for further interrogation. Additionally, ODA 523 discovered what may have been chemical weapons samples in a laboratory on the grounds of H-3.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.111-112</ref>\n\nBravo company turned its attention to Ar Rutbah, signals intercepts by SOT-A (Support Operations Team \u2013 Alpha) and an informer network among the Bedouins as well as inhabitants of the town indicated that around 800 Fedayeen remained in the town; Fedayeen patrols from the town were engaged by surrounding Green Berets and captured. ODAs guided in precision airstrikes on Fedayeen anti aircraft guns on the outskirts of the town and on top of the airstrikes, they also struck large groups of Fedayeen militia with Javelin missiles. On 9 April, nine ODAs secured the main roads into the town an commenced a day of near continuous final airstrikes from fix-wing aircraft and Apache helicopters. Civilians from the town approached the Green Berets asking them to stop the bombing, the Green Berets struck a deal with the civilians and they entered the town the next day. A B-52 and 2 F-16Cs flew show of force flights over the town as the Green Berets entered, the Fedayeen blended in with the population. Within days, the Green Berets helped the town to elect a mayor and set up markets, get sixty percent of the electricity grid working and repair water supplies.

Initial intelligence that led to her rescue was provided by an informant who approached ODA 553 when it was working in Nasiriyah, the intelligence was passed on and Task Force 20 planned a rescue mission. Launching from the recently captured airfield at Talil, the rescue force consisted of 290 Rangers from [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd battalion]], 75th Ranger Regiment, around 60 SEALs from [[DEVGRU]] along with [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Para Rescue Jumpers]] and Combat Controllers from the [[24th Special Tactics Squadron]] conventional Marines from Task Force Tarawa then currently fighting through the city and aviators from the Army, Marines and Air Force. The plan called for Task Force Tarawa to conduct a deception mission by seizing the bridges across the Euphrates to draw attention away from the hospital Lynch was held at, an airstrike by US Marine AV-8 Harriers would be conducted against one of the bridges to confuse the opposition further and US Marine AH-1W Cobras were tasked to fly over the area to conceal the sound of incoming SOF helicopters. Air cover as provided by an AC-130 Spectre and a Marine EA-6 Prowler to jam any enemy SAM systems that might be present. With the deception mission underway, the SEAL and select Ranger elements would be inserted by MH-60K Blackhawks and four MH-6 Little Birds, supported by four AH-6 attack helicopters and two MH-60L DAPs, the other Rangers would be flown in by Marine CH-46s and CH-53 transport helicopters to establish a cordon around the hospital grounds. The main assault force of SEALs would arrive by a ground convoy of [[Pandur I|AGMS Pandur]] forearmed vehicles and GMV trucks whilst the hostage rescue element landed directly on the objective in MH-6 Little Birds.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.131</ref>\n\nAt 0100 on 1 April 2003, the Marines commenced their deception mission, CIA elements cut the city's power as the helicopters approached their objective, the AH-6s led the way, behind them the MH-6s dropped off Task Force 20 sniper teams at strategic locations around and on the hospital. The DAPs and the AH-6s covered the MH-60Ks as they dropped off assault teams on the hospital roof and another by the front door, the ground assault convoy arrived and the assaulters raced inside and onto the second floor where Lynch was located. 13 minutes later, a MH-60K touched down near the hospital entrance with a team of PJs and SOAR medics on board and transported Lynch to Talil where it rendezvoused with a standby medical flight and then onto Kuwait and finally the United States. The Hospital was devoid of any Fedayeen, although evidence suggested they were using it as a base; the Ranger blocking teams experienced some sporadic direct fire, the SEALs and the Rangers eventually recovered the remains of eight members of Lynch's unit that had been killed or died of their wounds.

The rest of the defenders were a mixture of [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] units, regular army units, [[Fedayeen Saddam]], and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.\n\nThis plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guard's assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. On 5 April, Task Force [[64th Armor Regiment|1\u201364 Armor]] of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division executed a raid, later called the \"Thunder Run\", to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 Bradley armored fighting vehicles advancing to the [[Baghdad airport]]. They met significant resistance, but were successful in reaching the airport, and eventually secured it after heavy fighting.\n\n[[File:IrakKriegM1A1USA.jpg|thumb|An American M1 Abrams tank destroyed in Baghdad]]\n\nThe next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division attacked into downtown Baghdad and occupied one of the palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.\n\n[[File:Marines in Saddams palace DM-SD-04-12222.jpg|left|alt=photograph of three Marines entering a partially destroyed stone palace with a mural of Arabic script|thumb|Marines from [[1st Battalion 7th Marines]] enter a palace during the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|Battle of Baghdad]]]]\n\nOn 10 April, a rumor emerged that Saddam Hussein and his top aides were in a mosque complex in the Al Az'Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three companies of Marines were sent to capture him and came under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed.\n\n[[File:SaddamStatue.jpg|thumb|upright|The April 2003 [[Firdos Square statue destruction|toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue]] in [[Firdos Square]] in Baghdad shortly after the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|capture of the city]]]]\n\nMany Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his [[cult of personality]]. One widely publicized event was the dramatic toppling of a large statue of Saddam in Baghdad's [[Firdos Square]]. This attracted considerable media coverage at the time.

The Iraqi cities of [[Al-Kut]] and [[Nasiriyah]] launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of the new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued.\n[[File:Grateful Iraqis welcome American Marines during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.ogg|alt=video of US Marines entering the city|US Marines being welcomed while entering Baghdad in April 2003|right|thumb]]\nU.S. General [[Tommy Franks]] assumed control of Iraq as the supreme commander of the coalition occupation forces. Shortly after the sudden collapse of the defense of Baghdad, rumors were circulating in Iraq and elsewhere that there had been a deal struck (a \"safqua\") wherein the U.S.-led Coalition had bribed key members of the Iraqi military elite and/or the Ba'ath party itself to stand down. In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led Coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear.\n\nU.S.-led Coalition troops promptly began searching for the key members of Saddam Hussein's government. These individuals were identified by a variety of means, most famously through sets of [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]]. Later during the [[military occupation]] period after the invasion, on 22 July 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from [[Task Force 20]], Saddam Hussein's sons [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight. Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003 by the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division and members of [[Task Force 121]] during [[Operation Red Dawn]].\n\n===Other areas===\n\nU.S. special forces had also been involved in the extreme south of Iraq, attempting to occupy key roads to [[Syria]] and airbases. In one case two armored platoons were used to convince Iraqi leadership that an entire armored battalion was entrenched in the west of Iraq.\n\nOn 15 April, U.S. forces took control of [[Tikrit]], the last major outpost in central Iraq, with an attack led by the Marines' [[Task Force Tripoli]]. About a week later the Marines were relieved in place by the Army's 4th Infantry Division.\n\nCoalition aircraft flew over 41,000 sorties,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/topics/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18635 |title=Operation Iraqi Freedom |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=16 October 2014 |website=Air Force Historical Support Division |publisher=United States Air Force |access-date=16 March 2015 |quote=n the first six weeks, coalition air forces flew more than 41,000 sorties and the USAF accounted for more than 24,000 of the total. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313040611/http://www.afhso.af.mil/topics/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18635 |archive-date=13 March 2015 |url-status=live  }}<br />{{cite book|author=Benjamin Benjamin Lambeth|title=The Unseen War: Allied Air Power and the Takedown of Saddam Hussein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_5mAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT135|date=15 October 2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-312-6|page=135}}</ref> of which over 9,000 were tanker sorties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony H.

The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Naval Aviation, and British [[Royal Air Force]] operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended resistance targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived. The [[main battle tank]]s of the U.S. and UK forces, the U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] and British [[Challenger 2]], functioned well in the rapid advance across the country. Despite the many [[rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few U.S. and UK tanks were lost, and no tank crew-members were killed by hostile fire, although nearly 40 M1 Abrams were damaged in the attacks.<ref>\"During Operation Iraqi Freedom, as many as 40 Abrams tanks were damaged by RPGs. Most were repaired.\" ''Battle Tanks: Power in the Field'', Page 33, Enslow Publishers, 2006</ref> The only tank loss sustained by the British Army was a Challenger 2 of the [[Queen's Royal Lancers]] that was hit by another Challenger 2, killing two crew members.\n\nThe Iraqi army suffered from poor [[morale]], even amongst the elite Republican Guard. Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon the approach of invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces to surrender to. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. The leadership of the Iraqi army was incompetent \u2013 reports state that [[Qusay Hussein]], charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units were confused, and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target points rather than seek to engage Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war without having been engaged, and fully intact, especially in southern Iraq. It is assumed that most units disintegrated to return to their homes.\n\nAccording to the declassified [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] report, \"The largest contributing factor to the complete defeat of Iraq's military forces was the continued interference by Saddam.\" The report, designed to help U.S. officials understand in hindsight how Saddam and his military commanders prepared for and fought the invasion, paints a picture of an Iraqi government blind to the threat it faced, hampered by Saddam's inept military leadership and deceived by its own propaganda and inability to believe an invasion was imminent without further Iraqi provocation. According to the BBC, the report portrays Saddam Hussein as \"chronically out of touch with reality&nbsp;\u2013 preoccupied with the prevention of domestic unrest and with the threat posed by Iran.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4843394.stm |title=Russia denies Iraq secrets claim |work=BBC News |date=25 March 2006 |accessdate=7 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061223055637/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4843394.stm |archive-date=23 December 2006 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n==Casualties==\n{{Main|Casualties in the conflict in Iraq|Humanitarian Crises of the Iraq War}}\n\n===Death toll===\nEstimates on the number of casualties during the invasion in Iraq vary widely.

The 2nd Squadron is currently stationed at [[Fort Bliss, Texas]], as part of the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]].\n\n==History==\nThe 13th Cavalry Regiment was first constituted on 2 February 1901 in the Regular Army, and its first active component was K Troop. The Regiment was organized on 26 July 1901 at [[Fort Meade, South Dakota]]. Immediately following the American takeover of the [[Philippines]] after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898, Filipino leader [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] led a rebellion against American rule and the [[Philippine\u2013American War]] erupted in 1899. By 1902, Aguinaldo had sworn allegiance to the United States and the war was officially declared to be over, but insurgents still plagued the countryside, prompting the deployment of the 13th Cavalry Regiment to the Philippine Islands. From 1903 to 1905 the 13th Cavalry conducted counter-insurgency operations against Filipino rebels and bandits until their return to the United States. In 1909 they returned to the Philippines and continued to conduct counter-insurgency operations until 1910.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/1-13ar.htm</ref> \n\n[[File:Herbert Jermain Slocum circa 1915.jpg|thumb|Herbert Jermain Slocum circa 1915]]\n\n[[File:13th Cavalry Columbus NM 1916.jpg|thumb|13th Cavalry Columbus NM 1916]]\n\n===Border War===\nIn 1911, the 13th Cavalry Regiment\u2019s Headquarters was moved to [[Fort Riley, Kansas]], but their attention quickly shifted to defending the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. From 1911 to 1916 the 13th Cavalry patrolled the desert landscape of the border on horseback, deterring ''bandito'' raids and protecting American border towns from the violence seeping over from the ongoing [[Mexican Revolution]]. One such instance was the hunt for the infamous Mexican outlaw [[Pascual Orozco]]. He was placed under house-arrest in [[El Paso, Texas]] for violating US neutrality laws, but managed to escape. A posse consisting of 8 local deputies, 13 [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], and 26 Troopers of the 13th Cavalry was formed to pursue him. Orozco managed to steal a herd of horses until the posse caught up to him and his gang at High Lonesome in the [[Van Horn, Texas|Van Horn Mountains]] and killed them in a gunfight.\n\n====Raid on Columbus, NM====\n[[File:13th Cavalry seeking bodies.png|thumb|13th Cavalry seeking bodies. Columbus, NM. 1916.]]\nUnder the command of COL [[Herbert Jermain Slocum]], four Troops and a Machine-Gun Troop of the 13th Cavalry were posted at \u201cCavalry Camp\u201d in [[Columbus, New Mexico]] when raiders under Mexican Revolutionary [[Pancho Villa]] attacked across the border in the dead of night on 9 March 1916.<ref name=\"armyhistory\">{{Cite web|url=https://armyhistory.org/13th-armor/|title=13th Armor|last=Army|first=The Campaign for the National Museum of the United States|date=2015-01-28|website=The Campaign for the National Museum of the United States Army|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> Most of the garrison was asleep when the raiders entered Columbus from the west and southeast shouting ''\"\u00a1Viva Villa! \u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\"'' and other phrases. The Cavalrymen awoke to an army of 600 Villistas burning the city and looting the homes. Despite being taken by surprise, the Troopers quickly recovered. Even the cooks, already up and working on breakfast for the Troopers, fought back, throwing boiling water at the attackers. Soon after the attack began, 2LT John P. Lucas, commanding the 13th Cavalry's Machine-Gun Troop, made his way barefooted from his quarters to the camp's barracks. He organized a hasty defense around the camp's guard tent, where his machine-guns were kept under lock, with two men and a [[Hotchkiss M1909]] machine-gun. He was soon joined by the remainder of his unit and 30 Troopers armed with [[M1903 Springfield]] rifles led by 2LT Horace Stringfellow, Jr. The Troop's four machine-guns fired more than 5,000 rounds apiece during the fight, their targets illuminated by fires of burning buildings.<ref name=\"armyhistory\" />\n \nThe battle raged until a Mexican bugler sounded the retreat after 90 minutes of fighting, and rode away to the south. 8 Cavalry Troopers were killed and 8 were wounded in this raid, but their tenacious defense inflicted over 100 enemy casualties. MAJ [[Frank Tompkins]], commanding the Regiment's 3rd Squadron and acting as its Executive Officer, asked and received permission from COL Slocum to pursue the withdrawing Mexicans. He led two Troops 15 miles into Mexico in pursuit of a force approximately six times the size of his, engaged Villa's rearguard four times, and inflicted some losses on them before withdrawing back across the border after running low on ammunition and water. MAJ Tompkins was awarded the [[Army Distinguished Service Medal]] and the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] in 1918 for this action.<ref name=\"PrietoJulie\">{{cite book |last1=Prieto |first1=Julie |title=The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War I: The Mexican Expedition 1916-1917 |date=2016 |publisher=St. John's Press |location=Alexandria, VA}}</ref>\n\n====Punitive Expedition====\nPancho Villa's raid on Columbus, New Mexico on 9 March 1916 was a ''[[casus belli]]'' in the eyes of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and he ordered [[John J. Pershing|General John \"Black Jack\" Pershing]] to lead a Punitive Expedition into Mexico on 16 March 1916. Four cavalry regiments, two infantry regiments, and two batteries of artillery formed the main body of the expedition, and the 13th Cavalry was in the vanguard, taking point for the expedition.<ref name=\"PrietoJulie\" /> \n\nIn early April 1916, MAJ Frank Tompkins, who fought in the [[Battle of Columbus (1916)|Battle of Columbus]], persuaded GEN Pershing to allow him to lead 8 officers and 120 men of Troops K and M, 13th Cavalry, on a raid deep into Mexican territory. MAJ Tompkins' intentions were to chase and eventually engage the elusive rebels of Pancho Villa. After preparations were completed, the force left camp on 5 April. The Americans made a quick ride across the Mexican desert, traveling 85 miles in 50 hours. Following several days in the wilderness, MAJ Tompkins wrote; \"We were ragged, shoes were gone and nearly everyone had a beard. We certainly presented a hard-boiled, savage appearance.\" The Americans were hoping to rest at the city of [[Parral, Chihuahua|Parral]] for a day, and they were told they'd be welcome by a [[Constitutionalists in the Mexican Revolution|Carrancista]] (Mexican Constitutionalist) officer along the way. However, when the column arrived at Parral in the early morning of 12 April, the Carrancista commander of the city, General Ismael Lozano, informed MAJ Tompkins that coming to the city was a bad idea and that he must leave immediately. Tompkins agreed so the Americans left Parral not long after getting there.<ref name=\"armyhistory\" /> \n\nOn the way out of town, a group of Mexicans began shouting ''\"Viva Villa\"'', and other phrases, so MAJ Tompkins shouted the same back. A few minutes later, as the column was just outside town, a cavalry force of about 550 Carrancistas launched an attack on the American column. MAJ Tompkins had been betrayed. Within the first few shots a Sergeant standing next to Tompkins was hit and killed while a second man was seriously wounded. Heavily outnumbered, the 13th Cavalry had no choice but to keep going so they dismounted a rear guard to take up positions on a small hill and engage the pursuing Mexicans. In this first skirmish, an estimated 25 Mexicans were killed and the rest were driven off. The rear guard then regrouped with the main force where they withstood another attack. During the second skirmish, an estimated 45 Mexicans were killed. The Troopers continued their ride to Santa Cruz de Villegas, a fortified town, 8 miles from Parral, that the Americans could defend. The Cavalry reached their town, but the Mexicans were not far away, and MAJ Tompkins was facing the possibility of his 100-man force being besieged by hundreds of Carrancistas, so he sent out dispatch riders for reinforcements.\n\nJust before 0800, a force of [[Buffalo Soldiers]] from the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]], arrived. They had recently engaged about 150 Villistas at the [[Battle of Agua Caliente]] on 1 April . Following the arrival of reinforcements, the Mexicans retreated back to Parral and there was no more fighting. Two Americans were killed in the battle and six others were wounded, including MAJ Tompkins. The enemy, however, suffered much greater losses.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cabq.gov/veterans/history/worldwari |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727094137/http://cabq.gov/veterans/history/worldwari |archive-date=27 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Battle of Parral]] was a turning point in the [[Mexican Expedition]], it marked America's furthest penetration into Mexico during the operation, 516 miles from the border, and marked the beginning of a slow withdrawal from Mexico which ended in early 1917. When [[General Pershing]] heard of the Carrancista government's betrayal, he was \"mad as hell\" and demanded a formal apology, but it never came. The 13th Cavalry Regiment's exceptional performance in America's last great mounted cavalry campaign earned it the special designation; 13th Horse.<ref name=\"armyhistory\" />\n\n===Interbellum===\n[[File:13th Armor, Carolina Maneuvers.jpg|thumb|Gun crew of the 13th Armor firing machine-guns at airplanes attacking a bridge near Bethune, SC. 1941.]]\nThe period between the Mexican Expedition and [[World War II]] was a tumultuous time for the 13th Cavalry. The United States entered [[World War I]] in April 1917, but the Regiment remained on the Mexican border and patrolled the area to protect against future raids. In 1921 it returned to Fort Riley, Kansas where it was key in developing the Army's future mechanized and armored force. The Troopers received [[M1 Combat Car]]s for their reconnaissance roles, but some remained mounted on horseback. In 1933, it was assigned to the [[2nd Cavalry Division (United States)|2nd Cavalry Division]], and was soon transferred to the [[7th Cavalry Brigade (United States)|7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized)]] at [[Fort Knox|Fort Knox, Kentucky]] in 1936. Here, the troopers dismounted their loyal horses for the final time and went on to become a fully mechanized unit. \n\nThe 13th Cavalry, in their new vehicles, was sent to [[Fort Drum|Pine Camp, New York]] to participate in some of the Army\u2019s first ever mechanized warfare exercises. This training helped to identify the advantages and shortcomings of the Army\u2019s new mechanized cavalry forces, and the 13th Cavalry played a major role in the Army\u2019s modernization. On 15 June 1940, the 13th Cavalry Regiment was redesignated as the 13th Armored Regiment (Light) and was assigned to the newly formed [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]]. As a Light Armored Regiment, the 13th had an authorized complement of 91 Officers and 1,405 Enlisted Men, along with 82 [[M3 Scout Car]]s for reconnaissance, and 136 [[M3 Stuart]] Light Tanks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron |first1=Robert |title=ARMOR IN BATTLE: Special Edition for the Armored Force 75th Anniversary |date=2017 |publisher=U.S. Army Armor School |location=Fort Benning, GA}}</ref> With the 1st AD, the 13th Armor (Light) participated in the [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Carolina Maneuvers]] of 1941, which were the Army\u2019s first training exercises in large-scale armored warfare.  \n\nThese maneuvers helped the Army\u2019s fledgling mechanized force identify its strengths and weaknesses, and helped the Army develop new strategies and tactics regarding the implementation of armored units, and how to coordinate between reconnaissance, armor, infantry, and artillery for combined arms maneuver. In this regard, the 13th Armored Regiment (Light) was a true pioneer in the development of the US Army's Armor Branch. On 7 December 1941, the Regiment was redesignated as the 13th Armored Regiment after it received larger tanks and underwent a significant reorganization; 1st Battalion consisted of the [[M3 Stuart]] light tanks and was used in a reconnaissance and security role. 2nd and 3rd Battalions consisted of [[M3 Lee]] medium tanks for use in direct action.\n\nThat same day, 7 December 1941, the [[Empire of Japan]] attacked [[Pearl Harbor]], thrusting the United States into World War II. On 11 December, [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] declared war on the United States as well, thus setting the stage for America's involvement in a two-front war. The men of the 13th Armored Regiment would not have long to wait until they could test their newfound skills as an armored force in battle.\n<ref name=\"armyhistory\" />\n\n===World War II===\nThe 1st Armored Division was one of the first American units to sail across the [[Atlantic]] to do battle with the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. Leaving from [[Fort Dix, New Jersey]] on 11 April 1942, the Old Ironsides patch set foot on European soil in [[Northern Ireland]] on 16 May 1942. Here, they trained with a new intensity as they prepared to go into battle for the first time. \n\n====Algeria-French Morocco====\nOn 8 November 1942, almost a full year after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Allied American, [[Free French]], and [[British armies]] launched [[Operation Torch]], the seaborne invasion of [[French North Africa]]. The 13th Armored Regiment was assigned to the 1st Armored Division's Combat Command B, or CCB, and was split between \u201cTask Force Red\u201d and \u201cTask Force Green\u201d for the invasion. At this time, the commander of the 13th Armored Regiment was COL [[Paul McDonald Robinett]]. Standing at five feet four, he was known to his men as \u201cLittle [[Napoleon]],\u201d \u201cLittle [[Caesar]],\u201d or \u201cRobbie.\u201d A cavalryman at heart, he was on the [[United States Equestrian Team|United States Olympic Equestrian Team]] and studied at the French [[Cavalry School]] at [[Saumur]]. He offered a dollar to any Soldier who could out-shoot him, and only one man ever collected.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Atkinson |first1=Rick |title=An Army at Dawn|url=https://archive.org/details/armyatdawnwarinn00atki |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe M3 Lee tanks were too large for the US and British naval landing craft, so the initial armored elements would be limited to M3 Stuart light tanks and lighter vehicles. 1-13 Armor, under LTC John H. Todd, was ordered to land just west of [[Oran]] in [[Algeria]], with the objective of forming a flying column to seize [[Lourmel Airfield]] before French planes could take off, then drive east toward [[Es S\u00e9nia|La S\u00e9nia]] airfield. However, France's collaborationist government, [[Vichy France]], was determined to resist the Allied invasion in order to save their country from further German retribution. \n\nAs part of TF Green, 1LT Richard Van Nostrand\u2019s 1st Platoon, 13th AR Reconnaissance Company was the first to land. They began racing for their objectives at 0603. To the west, the remainder of 13th Armor Reconnaissance Company under CPT G. Samuel Yeiter, was the first unit to land as part of TF Red. Despite struggling through the soft sand on the beachhead, their [[Willys MB|Jeeps]] and [[M3 half-track]]s began rolling to their objectives by 0820. By 0900, 1LT Van Nostrand\u2019s Platoon received the 1st Armored Division\u2019s first hostile fire from French snipers.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\">{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=George |title=The Battle History of the First Armored Division |date=1954 |publisher=Combat Forces Press |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> Soon after, the remainder of the flying column landed with M3 Stuart tanks and pressed on their objectives. Lourmel was secured by 1-13 Armor, and LTC Todd pushed east, breaking through a French roadblock. By the end of the day, 2-13 Armor\u2019s tanks were being unloaded at the newly captured docks at [[Arzew]]. Attacking towards La S\u00e9nia near Oran, TF Green was halted by the French at [[Misserghin]], seven miles from the airfield. A frontal attack by tanks and artillery was thwarted, and a flanking attack was tried, but this failed as well. One tank was knocked out on the road, forming a partial roadblock, and slowing Task Force Green\u2019s advance. The strongpoint was eventually bypassed in the middle of the night, but the 13th Armor had learned valuable lessons in this battle. Its lack of infantry support made attacking anti-tank guns costly.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> These lessons shaped how the 1st Armored Division would fight in the future.\n\nDespite stronger than expected Vichy French resistance to the American landings, nothing could stop the 1st Armored Division, and the 13th Armored Regiment entered the city of Oran two days after landing. Two M3 Lee tanks from 2-13 Armor led the way into the city. An enemy shell struck one and disabled it, but the following tanks bypassed the position and pressed into the city. At this point, many of the Vichy French soldiers joined the Free French and the Allied cause, and the Vichy government was dissolved by the Germans.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The Vichy soldiers fought halfheartedly against an erstwhile enemy they didn't hate, but the 13th Armored Regiment's next enemy would not be so easy.\n\n====Tunisia====\n[[File:M3 Lee tank. D Co, 2nd BN, 13th Armored Regiment, 1st Armored Division in Tunisia.jpg|thumb|M3 Lee tank of D Company, 2nd Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment at Souk el Arba, Tunisia, 23 Nov 1942.]]\n[[File:M3 Lee tank; \"ARAB.\".jpg|thumb|The crew of \"ARAB.\" An M3 Lee tank of the 13th Armored Regiment, El Guettar, Tunisia, 1943.]]\nAfter Vichy French forces ceased resistance to the Allied landings of Operation Torch, the 1st Armored Division pushed east into [[Tunisia]] where they would meet a tougher enemy. The German [[Afrika Korps]] was a battle-hardened force which had been fighting the British and Free French armies in the deserts of [[North Africa]] for several years. When the tanks of the 13th Armored Regiment encountered them, they were some of the first American troops to encounter [[Panzer IV|Panzer Mark IVs]]. From 1-4 December 1942, the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] attacked positions occupied by the 13th Armor near [[Djedeida]] and [[Tebourba]] in Tunisia. In a valiant effort, tanks from Companies E and F, 2-13 Armor, sortied against the attacking Germans, but were stopped with many casualties and 7 tanks lost. During this action, PVT Casimir Gajek, E Co, earned the Distinguished Service Cross for carrying his wounded NCO, SGT Evans, out of a burning tank, and remaining with him under fire until medics could arrive. 1-13 Armor\u2019s light tanks made a similar daylight charge on 10 December but were defeated by the heavier Panzers. The experienced Germans were not impressed with American tank tactics but noted that the tankers of the 1st Armored Division made up for their flaws with bravery. After withdrawing on 11 December 1st AD concluded that its M3 Stuart tanks were too light for modern warfare and began replacing them with heavier tanks.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /><ref name=\"3ad.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ad.org/unit-web-sites/armor-site/13th-cavalry-regiment/|title=13th Cavalry Regiment|last=|first=|date=|website=Association of 3d Armored Division Veterans|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027190101/http://www.3ad.org/unit-web-sites/armor-site/13th-cavalry-regiment/|archive-date=27 October 2018|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nA series of counterattacks steadily pushed the Germans back towards [[Tunis]], the final Allied objective in Tunisia, and the 13th Armor did well in several smaller tank battles in the desert. The year of 1943 began well for the 1st AD, but the Germans were not finished yet. In February 1943, Generalfeldmarschall [[Erwin Rommel]] led a German combined-arms attack against the American and British positions known as the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]]. Their superior maneuver and weaponry defeated elements of the 13th Armor and forced the Americans back over 50 miles before they rallied and halted the enemy offensive. Despite being forced from their positions, 2nd Battalion 13th Armored Regiment made a stand at the town of [[Sbeitla]] in the face of the German advance. G Company, 3-13 under CPT Herman T. McWatters covered the withdrawal of CCA along the [[Fa\u00efd]]-Sbeitla road, until they could be relieved by the rest of LTC Ben Crosby's 3rd Battalion. From their positions, their forward elements spotted a German armored column headed west towards the positions of 2nd Battalion at Sbeitla. Fortified in hull-down or partially concealed positions, 2nd Battalion awaited the enemy advance. Their right flank was covered by 2nd Battalion 6th Infantry, and the 1st AD Reconnaissance Company screened the flank and reported enemy movements. At least 40 tanks of the [[21st Panzer Division]] were bearing down on them. Holding their concealed positions until the enemy drew near, the tanks of 2-13 Armor opened fire when their Commander, LTC Henry E. Gardiner commanded \u201cBoys, let them have it!\u201d 15 Panzers were destroyed or disabled, and the surprised enemy faltered, but the determined Germans managed to drive away 2nd Battalion's supporting [[M3 Gun Motor Carriage|M3 tank destroyers]].<ref name=\"3ad.org\" />\n\nWhile the rest of the battalions in CCB withdrew, 2-13 Armor stayed in Sbeitla to cover the withdrawal. When LTC Gardiner asked permission to withdraw, he was told to hold on a little longer, so the rest of the command could get through Kasserine Pass. At 1730 on 18 February 2nd Battalion was finally permitted to withdraw to safety. The withdrawal under fire was perilous, and the battalion lost nine M3 Lee tanks. LTC Gardiner made sure he was the last man to leave the field, but his tank was destroyed in the process and he was severely wounded. Rommel later praised the battalion's defense of Sbeitla, saying it was \u201cclever and well fought.\u201d<ref name=\"3ad.org\" />\n\nThe Germans were eventually stopped by the remnants of 2-13 and 3-13 Armor near [[Thala, Tunisia|Thala]] on 22 February. Although the enemy had pushed back the Allies, they were tired and spread thin. The Allied counter strike culminated at the Battles of [[Battle of El Guettar|El Guettar]] and [[Battle of Sedjenane|Mateur]], where tankers from 13th Armor showed the Germans that they had learned from their early mistakes, and were capable of fighting, and winning against the best. In early May 1943, one week before German forces in Africa ceased resistance, 2nd Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment was poised to take the seaside town of [[Bizerte]]. During the push to the city, 1LT Dwight Varner, from [[Piatt County, Illinois]] and a recent graduate of the [[University of Illinois]], was leading his platoon in the attack, when his tank and eight others were knocked out by German anti-tank guns. 1LT Varner escaped his burning tank and managed to drag several crewmen to safety and provide first aid. However, he was wounded and captured. While marching to Tunis, he managed to escape his captors after three days and 40 miles of marching. Upon encountering seven Italian soldiers, he turned the tables and captured them by bluffing that the mess kit spoon in his pocket was a pistol. Commandeering the enemy\u2019s vehicle, he then captured 18 unsuspecting Germans and drove them all back to American lines. 1LT Varner was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extreme gallantry and risk of his life while facing the enemy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.journal-republican.com/obituaries/dwight-steve-varner/article_2f621243-8588-5c53-be4d-218eac56b499.html|title=Dwight Steve Varner|last=Republican|first=Journal|website=Journal Republican|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news-gazette.com/obituaries/steve-varner/article_8a5eb464-5d9a-5ba7-b809-7bd57d1de3f5.html|title=Steve Varner|last=News-Gazette|first=The|website=The News-Gazette|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Robinett |first1=Paul McDonald |title=Armor Command: The Personal Story of a Commander of the 13th Armored Regiment, of CCB, 1st Armored Division, and of the Armored School during World War II |date=2017 |publisher=Arcole Publishing |page=289}}</ref> \n\nAll Germans in Africa surrendered by 15 May 1943, and the 13th Armor began training for its next assignment.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\n====Naples-Foggia====\n[[File:13th Armor Tank stuck in the mud.

It was moved across the desert west to [[French protectorate in Morocco|French-Morocco]] and was quartered in and around the city of [[Rabat]] where it underwent a major reorganization. General [[Ernest N. Harmon]], commander of the 1st Armored Division, placed COL [[Hamilton H. Howze]] in command of the 13th Armored Regiment, and he quickly saw fit to rearm the Regiment with more modern equipment. The M3 Stuart light tanks were replaced by [[M5 Stuart]] light tanks, and the M3 Lee tanks were replaced by the [[M4 Sherman]].<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The Sherman tank would become the workhorse of the US Army, with over 50,000 of them being built during World War II. While 1st Armored Division was refitting in Morocco, other Allied forces [[Operation Husky|invaded Sicily]], and the men of Old Ironsides knew they would soon be headed into combat again. In September 1943, General Harmon reported to the [[Fifth Army (United States)|Fifth Army]] commander, General [[Mark W. Clark]], that the 1st Armored Division had completed rigorous training and was ready for combat operations once again. The 13th Armor landed in [[Italy]] near [[Naples]] in November 1943, where Allied units had already carved out a beachhead. After assembling in [[Capua]], the Regiment waited in reserve. Their mission was to attack through the [[Liri Valley]] once infantry units had seized the surrounding heights.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />  \n\nHowever, unlike Africa, the terrain of Italy is not suited for armored warfare. The Germans broke dams and flooded the countryside whenever they withdrew to mire the Allied advance. This also provided breeding ground for mosquitoes, leading to a [[malaria]] outbreak among Allied soldiers.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The winding rivers and steep mountains also proved difficult for the 13th Armor tanks to negotiate. Despite the cold, wet and miserable conditions, [[Christmas]] 1943 was greeted with considerable activity. Father Flaherty, the 13th Armored Regimental Chaplain, celebrated Mass in a Medieval village church. There was caroling, [[Christmas tree]] decoration, and music. The festivities ended on [[New Year\u2019s Day]], and the year of 1944 began with a German artillery barrage, further miring the Liri Valley and halting any hope of an American armored attack. The Allies began to look for other ways to break the stalemate in Southern Italy.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\n====Anzio====\n[[File:1st Armored Division tanks land on the Anzio beachhead. 1944.jpg|thumb|1st Armored Division tanks land on the Anzio beachhead. 1944.]]\nBy January 1944, Allied forces had become stalemated along the German [[Gustav Line]], which was anchored around the strong fortifications of [[Monte Cassino]]. The mud, mountains, and rivers made an armored breakthrough impossible. In order to defeat this defensive line, the Allies launched [[Operation Shingle]], the amphibious invasion of [[Anzio]], behind the Gustav Line. Combat Command A (CCA) of the 1st Armored Division was part of the initial landings, but CCB, including the 13th Armored Regiment, remained in the [[Cassino]] area ready to exploit any German weakness and attack through the Liri Valley should the opportunity arise. After intense German counterattacks on the Anzio beachhead and no meaningful progress south of the Gustav Line, it was decided to reunite the 1st Armored Division in order to make a decisive armored thrust to break out of Anzio. 13th Armor was shipped north to Anzio in early May 1944 after months of waiting. There, they received extensive training on breaching and the 191st Tank Battalion was attached to the Regiment for the coming attack. After rehearsing infantry-tank cooperation, the Regiment was in its pre-attack positions near [[Cisterna di Latina|Cisterna]] by 22 May.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> On 23 May, 2nd Battalion 13th Armor jumped off at first light with D Co to the west, F Co to the east, and E Co in reserve. Attacking toward [[Torrecchia Vecchia|Torrecchia Nuova]], the Battalion ran into an American [[minefield]] that was not properly marked. 40 total vehicles from CCB were damaged as a result.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> D Co had so many tanks lose their tracks to mines that E Co advanced and assumed their mission. Despite this early setback, the tanks of Companies E and F rapidly advanced. They knocked out enemy anti-tank guns, bunkers, and trenches before setting into local security positions for the night. \n \nMeanwhile, near Carano Creek on the American left flank, the German Army had launched a counterattack in the afternoon. 3-13 Armor, under LTC Cairns in Division reserve, drove away the Germans with the help of accurate artillery support. Tank recovery operations to repair damaged tracks and return the damaged tanks of 2-13 Armor to action went on for the duration of the night. Nearly all lost tanks were operational again within 48 hours.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The next day, 24 May, the attack continued. 2-13 Armor went forward, supporting 3-[[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6 Infantry]], and cleared out enemy positions in a forest and captured two artillery batteries. F Co, under CPT John C. Elliott, was sent to assist the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] to the west while the rest of 2-13 went into reserve. The light tanks of LTC Carr\u2019s 1-13 Armor passed through 2-13\u2019s lines and seized the Regimental objective, Torrecchia Nuova. The next day, 25 May, COL Howze was ordered to seize [[Giulianello]], and the attack jumped off at dawn. Near the town of [[Valmontone]], the 13th Armor engaged the infamous German [[Hermann G\u00f6ring Division]]. 3-13 Armor blocked the road to west while 1-13 flanked the retreating Germans, capturing many. 2-13 Armor\u2019s attack went well, but a German artillery shell killed its Executive Officer, MAJ George Johnson, and the attack stalled.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> In order to capitalize on their gains, Task Force Howze (consisting of 3-13 Armor and supporting units) was formed to take [[Velletri]] and Giulianello. Working well with infantry support, the tanks of both CCB and TF Howze broke through the enemy lines while other armored units were halted by German anti-tank guns. The main highways to [[Rome]], Routes 6 and 7, were opened for an Allied attack by 2 June 1944. During the [[Battle of Anzio]], the 13th Armored Regiment saw its first real combat in the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]]. Although the fighting here was difficult and not ideal for armored warfare, the 13th Armor secured an Allied breakthrough and helped end the stalemate in Southern Italy.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Rome, the Italian capital, was finally within reach.\n\n====Rome-Arno====\n[[File:13th Armored Regiment enters Rome.jpg|thumb|H Co, 13th Armor, enters the city limits of Rome. 4 June 1944.]]\nAfter achieving a breakout from the Anzio beachhead, 1st Armored Division tanks were positioned just south of Rome by 2 June 1944. Allied planners wanted to waste no time, and immediately ordered the tanks of the 13th Armored Regiment to advance to the \u201cEternal City.\u201d LTC Cairns\u2019 3rd Battalion 13th Armor, part of Task Force Howze, led the way down Highway 6.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Despite sporadic enemy resistance, the retreating Germans could not stop the rapid advance. Meanwhile, on 3 June, the bulk of the 1st Armored Division advanced up Highway 7, with 1-13 and 2-13 Armor in Combat Command B (CCB). Allied units from across Italy were in a rush to be the first to enter Rome. The morning of 4 June 1944 began as a race. A Co, 1-13 Armor was sent ahead as a [[flying column]] while the rest of CCB broke into three columns advancing down parallel roads along Highway 7 to bypass Allied traffic and German defenses. TF Howze, to the east of the city, ran into strong German resistance just outside of city limits. By 0615, its 3rd Battalion, 13th Armor broke through and continued down Highway 6; eager infantrymen holding onto the backs of the fast-moving tanks. By 0715, H Co, 3-13 Armor, under CPT John A. Beale, became the first American element to enter the Eternal city; The lead tank was commanded by SGT Abner.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> However, after turning a corner, his tank and another were both hit by anti-tank gun fire; the Germans weren\u2019t going to give up so easily.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> For hours, TF Howze battled with German roadblocks in the city, slowly clearing the streets. Companies G, H, and I rolled to the northwest to cut off a German armored counterattack. After his tank was disabled, LTC Cairns, commanding 3-13 Armor, took command of CPT Beale\u2019s tank, resulting in the odd scenario where a Company Commander acted as the gunner for his Battalion Commander. Together, the two commanders found and knocked out several enemy vehicles.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the 13th Armored Regiment advanced quickly up from the south, capturing numerous prisoners and surprising many Germans who didn\u2019t expect the Allies to be so far north. By the end of 4 June 1944, Rome was completely in Allied hands. Italian citizens thronged the streets, kissing the GIs and giving them flowers.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The 1st Armored Division quickly moved north of the city and prepared for the next attack; along the coastal plain to the [[Arno River]]. Although the capture of Rome was a major win for the Allies, public and military attention quickly shifted elsewhere. On 6 June 1944, the [[Invasion of Normandy]] began, opening another front against the Axis. Allied forces in Italy would now be a secondary effort.\n\nFrom 6-10 June, 1-13 and 2-13 advanced 25 miles north of Rome meeting only scant resistance. The relatively flat land of the Italian coastal plain was much more suited to armored warfare than the terrain of Southern Italy. By 22 June, 1AD again ran into steep mountainous terrain, and all attacks north were stalled.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Grinding north again, the 13th Armor engaged and defeated German elements in numerous battles and skirmishes as the retreating enemy tried to delay the Allied advance. CCB and TF Howze became adept at defeating German armored elements, and the Arno River was finally reached on 18 July 1944, but the 1st Armored Division needed a rest. After pulling back, the Division was completely reorganized on 20 July. The 13th Armored Regiment was reduced in size and was redesignated as the 13th Tank Battalion. 1-13 Armor was disbanded, and its tanks and crews went on to replace others lost in combat. Companies D, E, and F of 2-13 Armor became Companies A, B, and C of the 13th Tank Battalion (M4 Shermans). B Co of [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Armored Regiment]] became D Co, 13th Tank Battalion (M5 Stuarts). Companies G, H, and I of 3-13 Armor left and formed the 4th Tank Battalion. The 13th Tank Battalion now had an effective strength of 804 tanks, and it soon began preparing to meet the next formidable German defensive position; the [[Gothic Line]].<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\n====North Apennines====\n[[File:B Co 13th Armor in Italy.jpg|thumb|B Co 13th Tank Battalion in Italy]]\nDespite a rapid Allied advance into and beyond Rome, the Italian Front had stalemated once again at the German Gothic Line. The 13th Tank Battalion, commanded by LTC Henry E. Gardiner, was assigned to Combat Command B (CCB), commanded by COL [[Lawrence Russell Dewey]], for the coming offensive. On 1 September 1944, CCB crossed the Arno river with combined tank and infantry columns and met only scant resistance. Swiftly advancing, CCB captured the town of [[Altopascio]] on 4 September, and the 13th Tank Battalion continued its steady advance.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> On 10 September, the tankers faced their first real German resistance of the offensive, but they continued to apply pressure to the enemy\u2019s western flank to divert German troops from Fifth Army\u2019s main effort at [[Il Giogo Pass]]. On 25 September 1st Armored Division was split up. The steep mountains and foothills of the [[Apennine Range]] were ill-suited to rapid armored assaults, and the Combat Commands of the Division were attached to infantry units to provide them with necessary tank support. 13th Tank Battalion was assigned to \u201cTask Force 92\u201d under BG John E. Wood. TF 92 was a component of the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Division]], a \u201cColored Division\u201d in the segregated Army of WWII. TF 92 and 13th Tank Battalion worked together well, and from 26-29 September, they launched a large attack on German positions on the Gothic Line.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> They managed to capture the town of [[Lucchio]] and push the enemy out of the [[Serchio|Serchio Valley]]. By the end of September 13th Tank Battalion and TF 92 was attacking down Highway 64 toward [[Vergato]], operating independently of the 1st Armored or the 92nd Infantry Divisions.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n  \nOn 6 October 13th Tank was temporarily attached to the \u201c[[6th Armoured Division (South Africa)|6 South African Armoured Division]].\u201d The 1st Armored Division now held the extreme western flank of the [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]] Zone.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Throughout October, the 13th Tank Battalion, on the left flank of CCB, pushed up the mountain slopes along Highway 64. First they reached [[Porretta Terme]], and then near the end of the month, arrived beyond the town of [[Riola]]. An attack on 29 October against German positions at [[Castelnuovo Rangone|Castelnuovo]] was stopped short. The Germans counterattacked, but 13th Tank defeated them. In a last-ditch effort, the enemy destroyed all nearby bridges, forcing CCB to halt its attack. On 10 December 1944, after a month of inactivity on the front-line, 13th Tank Battalion was attached to the Allied [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] in an attack against [[Monte Castello]], but they were repulsed by the Germans.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> As the winter cold and rain set in, both sides in this sector maintained defensive positions along the stalemated front. Late in 1944 and in early 1945, D Company\u2019s M5 Stuart light tanks began to be replaced by the more modern [[M24 Chaffee]] light tanks. The Chaffee was a vast improvement over the Stuart, as its 75mm gun more than doubled the firepower of the Stuart\u2019s 37mm gun. Throughout the winter, Companies A, B, C, and D conducted training and refitting for the coming campaign.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\n====Po Valley====\n[[File:1st Armored Division tanks in Milan.jpg|thumb|1st Armored Division tanks reach Milan, 29 May 1945.]]\nBy early 1945, German forces in [[Western Europe]] had been defeated at the [[Battle of the Bulge]], and Allied units were steadily advancing into [[Germany]]. In Italy, the German and [[Italian Social Republic|Fascist Italian]] remnants were depleted, but still occupied strong defensive positions anchored by steep mountains ranges. Beyond this line, lay the [[Po Valley]] to the north. The Po Valley is flat, wide, and perfect for offensive armored warfare; if Allied forces could break through to it, the war in Italy could be swiftly won.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Furthermore, Allied units needed to reach the valley in order to cut off retreating German forces before they could reach the [[Alps]] in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]] and set up stronger defenses. 1st Armored Division began its attack on 14 April 1945. A Co, and 2nd Platoon of C Co, were in Combat Command B (CCB), the Division\u2019s main effort, while the remainder of 13th Tank Battalion was placed in reserve. A Co and 2nd Platoon of C Co had 34 tanks, including 17 Shermans equipped with high velocity 76mm guns, and 9 M4A3 Shermans equipped with 105mm guns. The tanks were to support the 6th, 11th, and 14th Armored Infantry Battalions in their advance. At 1630, the attack jumped off under the cover of a smoke screen laid down by Division Artillery. The tanks and infantry met determined German resistance but captured their objectives by 17 April.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\nMeanwhile, an M4 Sherman platoon from 13th Armor was detached to assist the 81st Cavalry Squadron in seizing [[Piano di Venola]]. After meeting stiff resistance along Highway 64, the Troopers and Tankers of the force were near their objective by 17 April as well.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> During the advance, the rest of 13th Tank Battalion remained in Division reserve, ready to exploit a breakthrough. On 20 April, 13th Tank Battalion was attached to Combat Command A (CCA). With A Co on the right, B Co on the left, and C Co in reserve, 13th Tank Battalion attacked alongside the 6th Armored Infantry Battalion into the Po Valley. After a rapid advance, 13th Tank encountered fierce resistance at the town of [[Oliveto Lario|Oliveto]], losing 3 tanks from C Co, but ultimately securing victory, and taking 179 German prisoners. 1st Armored Division elements had at last reached the Po Valley, and were ready to strike. 13th Tank Battalion\u2019s Commander, LTC Henry E. Gardiner, took A Co and D Co to cut Highway 9, while the Executive Officer, MAJ John C. Elliot, took B Co and C Co northwest to occupy [[Castelfranco Emilia|Castelfranco]]. By the end of 21 April, these objectives were secured, and many Germans were taken prisoner. The 13th Tank Battalion continued its audacious drive north and west, cutting through German lines and defeating or capturing any enemies it encountered. By the end of 23 April, the Battalion had crossed the [[Po River]], and it captured the city of [[Verona]] by 26 April.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Speeding to the northwest, the 1st AD began capturing thousands of German prisoners; they knew the war was lost and were not keen on fighting powerful Allied armored units anymore. On 28 April, it was revealed that [[Mussolini]] had been captured and executed by [[Italian partisans]], and soon after, C Co of the 13th Tank Battalion entered the city of [[Milan]].<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The next day, the German commander, General [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]], surrendered and the fighting in Italy ceased on 2 May 1945. [[Hitler]] committed suicide soon after, and WWII in Europe ended on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]].\nThe 13th Tank Battalion soon moved into occupied [[West Germany]] to begin its post-war duties. WWII was the 13th\u2019s longest and deadliest conflict. Despite a steep learning curve at Kasserine Pass, the unit proved itself in Tunisia and Italy, earning itself a decorated place in American military history.\n\n===Cold War===\nAs part of the post-war [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied Occupation of Germany]], The 13th Tank Battalion was converted, reorganized, and redesignated on 1 May 1946 as the [[US Constabulary|13th Constabulary Squadron]], an element of the 10th Constabulary Regiment.<ref name=\"historyArmyMilLineageAndHonors\">{{Cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/armor-cav/013cv002sq.htm|title=2d Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment {{!}} Lineage and Honors {{!}} U.S. Army Center of Military History (CMH)|website=history.army.mil|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> It was inactivated on 20 September 1947 in [[Coburg]], [[West Germany]] and relieved from assignment to the 10th Constabulary Regiment. On 7 March 1951, it was reactivated as the 13th Medium Tank Battalion and was assigned, once again, to the 1st Armored Division at [[Fort Hood, Texas]]. On 20 May 1953, its designation was changed back to the 13th Tank Battalion. The Battalion was inactivated on 15 February 1957 at [[Fort Polk, Louisiana]] and was reactivated later that year, 1 October 1957, and was assigned to the [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] in Germany.<ref name=\"historyArmyMilLineageAndHonors\" />\n\nOn 3 February 1962 2nd Battalion, 13th Armor was relieved from assignment to the 3rd Armored Division and was assigned to the 1st Armored Division.<ref name=\"historyArmyMilLineageAndHonors\" /> On 5 May 1971 it was relieved from assignment to the 1st Armored Division and was assigned to the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] at Fort Hood and was inactivated on 23 April 1973. On 20 June 1974, 1st Battalion, 13th Armor rejoined the 1st Armored Division at [[Illesheim]], Germany until 20 February 1987, when the Battalion moved to [[Vilseck]], Germany. 13th Tank remained here until 1988, when it was inactivated and re-designated as 2nd Battalion, 13th Armor at [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]].<ref name=\"historyArmyMilLineageAndHonors\" />\n\n===Bosnia===\nAt Fort Riley, Kansas in March 1996, 3rd Battalion, [[37th Armor Regiment]] cased its colors and reflagged as the 1st Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment, with the Soldiers exchanging their [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] patches for the \"Old Ironsides\" patches of the 1st Armored Division. LTC Richard G. Jung Sr. commanded the \"Dakota\" Battalion from 1996\u201398, honoring the Regiment's history with the Battalion name and call sign. Called \"13th Tank\" by those who served in the unit, 1-13 Armor was one of two armor battalions in 3rd Brigade, 1st AD (Bulldogs) under the command of COL Joseph F.H. Peterson.\n\nIn January 1997, A Company (Ironhorse), 1-13 Armor, under CPT Paul P. Reese, was alerted for deployment to [[Europe]] as part of the ongoing peacekeeping effort in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. In March, A Company was attached to 1st Battalion, [[41st Infantry Regiment (United States)|41st Infantry Regiment]], 1-41 Infantry, and deployed to [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] in support of [[Operation Joint Guard]]. The Company was stationed at [[Camp Dobol]] near the zone of separation (ZOS) as the first iteration of \"[[SFOR]]\" or the \"Stabilization Force\" after the designation changed from \"[[IFOR]]\" or the \"Implementation Force\" in early 1997, \"Team Tank\" conducted a variety of missions and patrols in accordance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP) and corresponding rules of engagement (ROE) while operating within its area of responsibility. The company operated near the Bosnian-Serbian ([[Republika Srpska]]) towns of [[\u0160ekovi\u0107i]], [[Bratunac]] and the infamous [[Srebrenica]]. A/1-13 AR consisted of 2 [[M1A1 tank]] platoons and 1 [[M2A2 Bradley]] platoon (1 organic tank platoon was detached and assigned to A/1-41 IN at Camp Demi). Ironhorse company returned to the 1st Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment in December, 1997 upon redeployment to Fort Riley at the successful completion of their mission.\n\n===Iraq War===\n[[File:2-13 Cavalry.

The Squadron deployed to Iraq in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] from May 2009 to May 2010. The 1st Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment (Warhorse) stood up in 2009 as part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division at Fort Bliss, TX. In April 2009, 4th Brigade, including 2-13 Cavalry, deployed to the southern Iraqi provinces of [[Dhi Qar]], [[Maysan]], and Al-Muthanna, as the Army's first \"advise and assist brigade,\" a concept in which US forces would take a backseat to [[Iraqi Armed Forces|Iraqi Security Forces]] (ISF) and local government officials. The Brigade, under the command of COL Peter A. Newell and CSM Phillip D. Pandy, partnered with provincial reconstruction teams, civil affairs teams, [[US Department of State]] officials, and military transition teams, while assisting ISF and the Government of Iraq. The Brigade's partnership allowed over one million voters to participate in the election of 2010. For their actions in assisting elections in Iraq, 2nd Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment earned the [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]].\n\nIn July 2011, the 4/1 AD Highlanders deployed to Iraq in support of [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|Operation New Dawn]]. The Brigade deployed under the command of COL [[Scott McKean]], who later served as the 1AD Deputy Commanding General for Operations. 2-13 Cavalry served with the Brigade for the entirety of this deployment and was a key part in maintaining security while US forces withdrew from Iraq. 4th Brigade was one of the last units to withdraw from Iraq as part of the closing of Operation New Dawn.\n\n===Afghanistan War===\n1st Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment (TF 1-13 Cavalry), as part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, (TF 3-1AD), deployed from Fort Bliss, Texas to eastern Afghanistan ([[Train Advise Assist Command \u2013 East|RC-East]]) on 16 October 2011. The Brigade conducted combined, population-centric [[counterinsurgency]] operations in [[Logar Province|Logar]], [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]], and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]] provinces, relieving the 4th Brigade, [[10th Mountain Division]]. TF 3-1 AD and partners worked to secure Highway 1, a vital line of communication, neutralize insurgent and criminal networks, and train the [[Afghan Armed Forces|Afghan National Security Forces]] in order to expand the [[Kabul]] Security Zone and extend the Afghan Government's influence among the local people. In mid-October, TF 3-1 AD launched the brigade's first operation, Operation Shamshir. Planned in support of an RC-East operation to disrupt insurgents from the [[Haqqani Network]] across eastern [[Afghanistan]], the operation disrupted and dislodged insurgents from their entrenched positions and forced them into the open. A total of 14 villages in the [[Kharwar District]] were cleared and the operation concluded with a [[Shura]] among key leaders. As the Afghan winter set in, TF 3-1 AD continued to target insurgent supply caches, disrupt support zones, and expand the Afghan government's authority. The Brigade and their Afghan partners continued to push the enemy south, expanding the Kabul security zone.  \n\nOn 15 April 2012, insurgents launched the opening salvos of their spring offensive. Coordinated attacks targeting coalition and Afghan military bases and embassies were carried out in Kabul, [[Paktiya]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], and Logar Provinces. The enemy attacks were defeated by a combination of TF 3-1 AD Soldiers, Afghan partners, and close air support. In all, 11 insurgents were killed in action. In May 2012, TF 1-13 Cavalry assumed control for all of northern Logar Province and planned and resourced the movement of two additional [[Afghan National Army]] battalions (Kandaks) into the area. On 15 July 2012, TF 1-13 Cavalry and the rest of TF 3-1 AD returned to Fort Bliss, Texas. \n\n===Global Security Rotations===\nFollowing the 4th Brigade's re-flagging as 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division in 2015, 1-13 Cavalry inactivated on 15 April 2015 as part of the Brigade's inactivation, and the 2nd Squadron 13th Cavalry Regiment, now part of 3rd ABCT, participated in the Brigade's Regionally Aligned Force mission throughout the continent of [[Africa]]. The Squadron sent Troopers on various train and assist missions to multiple countries on the African continent to include: [[Malawi]], [[Morocco]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Namibia]], and [[Zambia]]. As a result of these missions, the Squadron directly supported the [[United Nations]]' Peace Keeping operations, enhanced the Army's geo-political impact, and increased the readiness of America's African allies and partners throughout the continent.\n\nIn July 2016, 2-13 Cavalry Squadron assumed responsibility of the [[US Army Central Command]] theater security cooperation and partnership missions at [[Camp Buehring]], [[Kuwait]], in support of [[Operation Spartan Shield]].

The 2nd Squadron is currently stationed at [[Fort Bliss, Texas]], as part of the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]].\n\n==History==\nThe 13th Cavalry Regiment was first constituted on 2 February 1901 in the Regular Army, and its first active component was K Troop. The Regiment was organized on 26 July 1901 at [[Fort Meade, South Dakota]]. Immediately following the American takeover of the [[Philippines]] after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898, Filipino leader [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] led a rebellion against American rule and the [[Philippine\u2013American War]] erupted in 1899. By 1902, Aguinaldo had sworn allegiance to the United States and the war was officially declared to be over, but insurgents still plagued the countryside, prompting the deployment of the 13th Cavalry Regiment to the Philippine Islands. From 1903 to 1905 the 13th Cavalry conducted counter-insurgency operations against Filipino rebels and bandits until their return to the United States. In 1909 they returned to the Philippines and continued to conduct counter-insurgency operations until 1910.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/1-13ar.htm</ref> \n\n[[File:Herbert Jermain Slocum circa 1915.jpg|thumb|Herbert Jermain Slocum circa 1915]]\n\n[[File:13th Cavalry Columbus NM 1916.jpg|thumb|13th Cavalry Columbus NM 1916]]\n\n===Border War===\nIn 1911, the 13th Cavalry Regiment\u2019s Headquarters was moved to [[Fort Riley, Kansas]], but their attention quickly shifted to defending the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. From 1911 to 1916 the 13th Cavalry patrolled the desert landscape of the border on horseback, deterring ''bandito'' raids and protecting American border towns from the violence seeping over from the ongoing [[Mexican Revolution]]. One such instance was the hunt for the infamous Mexican outlaw [[Pascual Orozco]]. He was placed under house-arrest in [[El Paso, Texas]] for violating US neutrality laws, but managed to escape. A posse consisting of 8 local deputies, 13 [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], and 26 Troopers of the 13th Cavalry was formed to pursue him. Orozco managed to steal a herd of horses until the posse caught up to him and his gang at High Lonesome in the [[Van Horn, Texas|Van Horn Mountains]] and killed them in a gunfight.\n\n====Raid on Columbus, NM====\n[[File:13th Cavalry seeking bodies.png|thumb|13th Cavalry seeking bodies. Columbus, NM. 1916.]]\nUnder the command of COL [[Herbert Jermain Slocum]], four Troops and a Machine-Gun Troop of the 13th Cavalry were posted at \u201cCavalry Camp\u201d in [[Columbus, New Mexico]] when raiders under Mexican Revolutionary [[Pancho Villa]] attacked across the border in the dead of night on 9 March 1916.<ref name=\"armyhistory\">{{Cite web|url=https://armyhistory.org/13th-armor/|title=13th Armor|last=Army|first=The Campaign for the National Museum of the United States|date=2015-01-28|website=The Campaign for the National Museum of the United States Army|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> Most of the garrison was asleep when the raiders entered Columbus from the west and southeast shouting ''\"\u00a1Viva Villa! \u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\"'' and other phrases. The Cavalrymen awoke to an army of 600 Villistas burning the city and looting the homes. Despite being taken by surprise, the Troopers quickly recovered. Even the cooks, already up and working on breakfast for the Troopers, fought back, throwing boiling water at the attackers. Soon after the attack began, 2LT John P. Lucas, commanding the 13th Cavalry's Machine-Gun Troop, made his way barefooted from his quarters to the camp's barracks. He organized a hasty defense around the camp's guard tent, where his machine-guns were kept under lock, with two men and a [[Hotchkiss M1909]] machine-gun. He was soon joined by the remainder of his unit and 30 Troopers armed with [[M1903 Springfield]] rifles led by 2LT Horace Stringfellow, Jr. The Troop's four machine-guns fired more than 5,000 rounds apiece during the fight, their targets illuminated by fires of burning buildings.<ref name=\"armyhistory\" />\n \nThe battle raged until a Mexican bugler sounded the retreat after 90 minutes of fighting, and rode away to the south. 8 Cavalry Troopers were killed and 8 were wounded in this raid, but their tenacious defense inflicted over 100 enemy casualties. MAJ [[Frank Tompkins]], commanding the Regiment's 3rd Squadron and acting as its Executive Officer, asked and received permission from COL Slocum to pursue the withdrawing Mexicans. He led two Troops 15 miles into Mexico in pursuit of a force approximately six times the size of his, engaged Villa's rearguard four times, and inflicted some losses on them before withdrawing back across the border after running low on ammunition and water. MAJ Tompkins was awarded the [[Army Distinguished Service Medal]] and the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] in 1918 for this action.<ref name=\"PrietoJulie\">{{cite book |last1=Prieto |first1=Julie |title=The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War I: The Mexican Expedition 1916-1917 |date=2016 |publisher=St. John's Press |location=Alexandria, VA}}</ref>\n\n====Punitive Expedition====\nPancho Villa's raid on Columbus, New Mexico on 9 March 1916 was a ''[[casus belli]]'' in the eyes of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and he ordered [[John J. Pershing|General John \"Black Jack\" Pershing]] to lead a Punitive Expedition into Mexico on 16 March 1916. Four cavalry regiments, two infantry regiments, and two batteries of artillery formed the main body of the expedition, and the 13th Cavalry was in the vanguard, taking point for the expedition.<ref name=\"PrietoJulie\" /> \n\nIn early April 1916, MAJ Frank Tompkins, who fought in the [[Battle of Columbus (1916)|Battle of Columbus]], persuaded GEN Pershing to allow him to lead 8 officers and 120 men of Troops K and M, 13th Cavalry, on a raid deep into Mexican territory. MAJ Tompkins' intentions were to chase and eventually engage the elusive rebels of Pancho Villa. After preparations were completed, the force left camp on 5 April. The Americans made a quick ride across the Mexican desert, traveling 85 miles in 50 hours. Following several days in the wilderness, MAJ Tompkins wrote; \"We were ragged, shoes were gone and nearly everyone had a beard. We certainly presented a hard-boiled, savage appearance.\" The Americans were hoping to rest at the city of [[Parral, Chihuahua|Parral]] for a day, and they were told they'd be welcome by a [[Constitutionalists in the Mexican Revolution|Carrancista]] (Mexican Constitutionalist) officer along the way. However, when the column arrived at Parral in the early morning of 12 April, the Carrancista commander of the city, General Ismael Lozano, informed MAJ Tompkins that coming to the city was a bad idea and that he must leave immediately. Tompkins agreed so the Americans left Parral not long after getting there.<ref name=\"armyhistory\" /> \n\nOn the way out of town, a group of Mexicans began shouting ''\"Viva Villa\"'', and other phrases, so MAJ Tompkins shouted the same back. A few minutes later, as the column was just outside town, a cavalry force of about 550 Carrancistas launched an attack on the American column. MAJ Tompkins had been betrayed. Within the first few shots a Sergeant standing next to Tompkins was hit and killed while a second man was seriously wounded. Heavily outnumbered, the 13th Cavalry had no choice but to keep going so they dismounted a rear guard to take up positions on a small hill and engage the pursuing Mexicans. In this first skirmish, an estimated 25 Mexicans were killed and the rest were driven off. The rear guard then regrouped with the main force where they withstood another attack. During the second skirmish, an estimated 45 Mexicans were killed. The Troopers continued their ride to Santa Cruz de Villegas, a fortified town, 8 miles from Parral, that the Americans could defend. The Cavalry reached their town, but the Mexicans were not far away, and MAJ Tompkins was facing the possibility of his 100-man force being besieged by hundreds of Carrancistas, so he sent out dispatch riders for reinforcements.\n\nJust before 0800, a force of [[Buffalo Soldiers]] from the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]], arrived. They had recently engaged about 150 Villistas at the [[Battle of Agua Caliente]] on 1 April . Following the arrival of reinforcements, the Mexicans retreated back to Parral and there was no more fighting. Two Americans were killed in the battle and six others were wounded, including MAJ Tompkins. The enemy, however, suffered much greater losses.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cabq.gov/veterans/history/worldwari |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727094137/http://cabq.gov/veterans/history/worldwari |archive-date=27 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Battle of Parral]] was a turning point in the [[Mexican Expedition]], it marked America's furthest penetration into Mexico during the operation, 516 miles from the border, and marked the beginning of a slow withdrawal from Mexico which ended in early 1917. When [[General Pershing]] heard of the Carrancista government's betrayal, he was \"mad as hell\" and demanded a formal apology, but it never came. The 13th Cavalry Regiment's exceptional performance in America's last great mounted cavalry campaign earned it the special designation; 13th Horse.<ref name=\"armyhistory\" />\n\n===Interbellum===\n[[File:13th Armor, Carolina Maneuvers.jpg|thumb|Gun crew of the 13th Armor firing machine-guns at airplanes attacking a bridge near Bethune, SC. 1941.]]\nThe period between the Mexican Expedition and [[World War II]] was a tumultuous time for the 13th Cavalry. The United States entered [[World War I]] in April 1917, but the Regiment remained on the Mexican border and patrolled the area to protect against future raids. In 1921 it returned to Fort Riley, Kansas where it was key in developing the Army's future mechanized and armored force. The Troopers received [[M1 Combat Car]]s for their reconnaissance roles, but some remained mounted on horseback. In 1933, it was assigned to the [[2nd Cavalry Division (United States)|2nd Cavalry Division]], and was soon transferred to the [[7th Cavalry Brigade (United States)|7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized)]] at [[Fort Knox|Fort Knox, Kentucky]] in 1936. Here, the troopers dismounted their loyal horses for the final time and went on to become a fully mechanized unit. \n\nThe 13th Cavalry, in their new vehicles, was sent to [[Fort Drum|Pine Camp, New York]] to participate in some of the Army\u2019s first ever mechanized warfare exercises. This training helped to identify the advantages and shortcomings of the Army\u2019s new mechanized cavalry forces, and the 13th Cavalry played a major role in the Army\u2019s modernization. On 15 June 1940, the 13th Cavalry Regiment was redesignated as the 13th Armored Regiment (Light) and was assigned to the newly formed [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]]. As a Light Armored Regiment, the 13th had an authorized complement of 91 Officers and 1,405 Enlisted Men, along with 82 [[M3 Scout Car]]s for reconnaissance, and 136 [[M3 Stuart]] Light Tanks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron |first1=Robert |title=ARMOR IN BATTLE: Special Edition for the Armored Force 75th Anniversary |date=2017 |publisher=U.S. Army Armor School |location=Fort Benning, GA}}</ref> With the 1st AD, the 13th Armor (Light) participated in the [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Carolina Maneuvers]] of 1941, which were the Army\u2019s first training exercises in large-scale armored warfare.  \n\nThese maneuvers helped the Army\u2019s fledgling mechanized force identify its strengths and weaknesses, and helped the Army develop new strategies and tactics regarding the implementation of armored units, and how to coordinate between reconnaissance, armor, infantry, and artillery for combined arms maneuver. In this regard, the 13th Armored Regiment (Light) was a true pioneer in the development of the US Army's Armor Branch. On 7 December 1941, the Regiment was redesignated as the 13th Armored Regiment after it received larger tanks and underwent a significant reorganization; 1st Battalion consisted of the [[M3 Stuart]] light tanks and was used in a reconnaissance and security role. 2nd and 3rd Battalions consisted of [[M3 Lee]] medium tanks for use in direct action.\n\nThat same day, 7 December 1941, the [[Empire of Japan]] attacked [[Pearl Harbor]], thrusting the United States into World War II. On 11 December, [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] declared war on the United States as well, thus setting the stage for America's involvement in a two-front war. The men of the 13th Armored Regiment would not have long to wait until they could test their newfound skills as an armored force in battle.\n<ref name=\"armyhistory\" />\n\n===World War II===\nThe 1st Armored Division was one of the first American units to sail across the [[Atlantic]] to do battle with the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. Leaving from [[Fort Dix, New Jersey]] on 11 April 1942, the Old Ironsides patch set foot on European soil in [[Northern Ireland]] on 16 May 1942. Here, they trained with a new intensity as they prepared to go into battle for the first time. \n\n====Algeria-French Morocco====\nOn 8 November 1942, almost a full year after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Allied American, [[Free French]], and [[British armies]] launched [[Operation Torch]], the seaborne invasion of [[French North Africa]]. The 13th Armored Regiment was assigned to the 1st Armored Division's Combat Command B, or CCB, and was split between \u201cTask Force Red\u201d and \u201cTask Force Green\u201d for the invasion. At this time, the commander of the 13th Armored Regiment was COL [[Paul McDonald Robinett]]. Standing at five feet four, he was known to his men as \u201cLittle [[Napoleon]],\u201d \u201cLittle [[Caesar]],\u201d or \u201cRobbie.\u201d A cavalryman at heart, he was on the [[United States Equestrian Team|United States Olympic Equestrian Team]] and studied at the French [[Cavalry School]] at [[Saumur]]. He offered a dollar to any Soldier who could out-shoot him, and only one man ever collected.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Atkinson |first1=Rick |title=An Army at Dawn|url=https://archive.org/details/armyatdawnwarinn00atki |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe M3 Lee tanks were too large for the US and British naval landing craft, so the initial armored elements would be limited to M3 Stuart light tanks and lighter vehicles. 1-13 Armor, under LTC John H. Todd, was ordered to land just west of [[Oran]] in [[Algeria]], with the objective of forming a flying column to seize [[Lourmel Airfield]] before French planes could take off, then drive east toward [[Es S\u00e9nia|La S\u00e9nia]] airfield. However, France's collaborationist government, [[Vichy France]], was determined to resist the Allied invasion in order to save their country from further German retribution. \n\nAs part of TF Green, 1LT Richard Van Nostrand\u2019s 1st Platoon, 13th AR Reconnaissance Company was the first to land. They began racing for their objectives at 0603. To the west, the remainder of 13th Armor Reconnaissance Company under CPT G. Samuel Yeiter, was the first unit to land as part of TF Red. Despite struggling through the soft sand on the beachhead, their [[Willys MB|Jeeps]] and [[M3 half-track]]s began rolling to their objectives by 0820. By 0900, 1LT Van Nostrand\u2019s Platoon received the 1st Armored Division\u2019s first hostile fire from French snipers.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\">{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=George |title=The Battle History of the First Armored Division |date=1954 |publisher=Combat Forces Press |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> Soon after, the remainder of the flying column landed with M3 Stuart tanks and pressed on their objectives. Lourmel was secured by 1-13 Armor, and LTC Todd pushed east, breaking through a French roadblock. By the end of the day, 2-13 Armor\u2019s tanks were being unloaded at the newly captured docks at [[Arzew]]. Attacking towards La S\u00e9nia near Oran, TF Green was halted by the French at [[Misserghin]], seven miles from the airfield. A frontal attack by tanks and artillery was thwarted, and a flanking attack was tried, but this failed as well. One tank was knocked out on the road, forming a partial roadblock, and slowing Task Force Green\u2019s advance. The strongpoint was eventually bypassed in the middle of the night, but the 13th Armor had learned valuable lessons in this battle. Its lack of infantry support made attacking anti-tank guns costly.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> These lessons shaped how the 1st Armored Division would fight in the future.\n\nDespite stronger than expected Vichy French resistance to the American landings, nothing could stop the 1st Armored Division, and the 13th Armored Regiment entered the city of Oran two days after landing. Two M3 Lee tanks from 2-13 Armor led the way into the city. An enemy shell struck one and disabled it, but the following tanks bypassed the position and pressed into the city. At this point, many of the Vichy French soldiers joined the Free French and the Allied cause, and the Vichy government was dissolved by the Germans.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The Vichy soldiers fought halfheartedly against an erstwhile enemy they didn't hate, but the 13th Armored Regiment's next enemy would not be so easy.\n\n====Tunisia====\n[[File:M3 Lee tank. D Co, 2nd BN, 13th Armored Regiment, 1st Armored Division in Tunisia.jpg|thumb|M3 Lee tank of D Company, 2nd Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment at Souk el Arba, Tunisia, 23 Nov 1942.]]\n[[File:M3 Lee tank; \"ARAB.\".jpg|thumb|The crew of \"ARAB.\" An M3 Lee tank of the 13th Armored Regiment, El Guettar, Tunisia, 1943.]]\nAfter Vichy French forces ceased resistance to the Allied landings of Operation Torch, the 1st Armored Division pushed east into [[Tunisia]] where they would meet a tougher enemy. The German [[Afrika Korps]] was a battle-hardened force which had been fighting the British and Free French armies in the deserts of [[North Africa]] for several years. When the tanks of the 13th Armored Regiment encountered them, they were some of the first American troops to encounter [[Panzer IV|Panzer Mark IVs]]. From 1-4 December 1942, the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] attacked positions occupied by the 13th Armor near [[Djedeida]] and [[Tebourba]] in Tunisia. In a valiant effort, tanks from Companies E and F, 2-13 Armor, sortied against the attacking Germans, but were stopped with many casualties and 7 tanks lost. During this action, PVT Casimir Gajek, E Co, earned the Distinguished Service Cross for carrying his wounded NCO, SGT Evans, out of a burning tank, and remaining with him under fire until medics could arrive. 1-13 Armor\u2019s light tanks made a similar daylight charge on 10 December but were defeated by the heavier Panzers. The experienced Germans were not impressed with American tank tactics but noted that the tankers of the 1st Armored Division made up for their flaws with bravery. After withdrawing on 11 December 1st AD concluded that its M3 Stuart tanks were too light for modern warfare and began replacing them with heavier tanks.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /><ref name=\"3ad.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ad.org/unit-web-sites/armor-site/13th-cavalry-regiment/|title=13th Cavalry Regiment|last=|first=|date=|website=Association of 3d Armored Division Veterans|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027190101/http://www.3ad.org/unit-web-sites/armor-site/13th-cavalry-regiment/|archive-date=27 October 2018|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nA series of counterattacks steadily pushed the Germans back towards [[Tunis]], the final Allied objective in Tunisia, and the 13th Armor did well in several smaller tank battles in the desert. The year of 1943 began well for the 1st AD, but the Germans were not finished yet. In February 1943, Generalfeldmarschall [[Erwin Rommel]] led a German combined-arms attack against the American and British positions known as the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]]. Their superior maneuver and weaponry defeated elements of the 13th Armor and forced the Americans back over 50 miles before they rallied and halted the enemy offensive. Despite being forced from their positions, 2nd Battalion 13th Armored Regiment made a stand at the town of [[Sbeitla]] in the face of the German advance. G Company, 3-13 under CPT Herman T. McWatters covered the withdrawal of CCA along the [[Fa\u00efd]]-Sbeitla road, until they could be relieved by the rest of LTC Ben Crosby's 3rd Battalion. From their positions, their forward elements spotted a German armored column headed west towards the positions of 2nd Battalion at Sbeitla. Fortified in hull-down or partially concealed positions, 2nd Battalion awaited the enemy advance. Their right flank was covered by 2nd Battalion 6th Infantry, and the 1st AD Reconnaissance Company screened the flank and reported enemy movements. At least 40 tanks of the [[21st Panzer Division]] were bearing down on them. Holding their concealed positions until the enemy drew near, the tanks of 2-13 Armor opened fire when their Commander, LTC Henry E. Gardiner commanded \u201cBoys, let them have it!\u201d 15 Panzers were destroyed or disabled, and the surprised enemy faltered, but the determined Germans managed to drive away 2nd Battalion's supporting [[M3 Gun Motor Carriage|M3 tank destroyers]].<ref name=\"3ad.org\" />\n\nWhile the rest of the battalions in CCB withdrew, 2-13 Armor stayed in Sbeitla to cover the withdrawal. When LTC Gardiner asked permission to withdraw, he was told to hold on a little longer, so the rest of the command could get through Kasserine Pass. At 1730 on 18 February 2nd Battalion was finally permitted to withdraw to safety. The withdrawal under fire was perilous, and the battalion lost nine M3 Lee tanks. LTC Gardiner made sure he was the last man to leave the field, but his tank was destroyed in the process and he was severely wounded. Rommel later praised the battalion's defense of Sbeitla, saying it was \u201cclever and well fought.\u201d<ref name=\"3ad.org\" />\n\nThe Germans were eventually stopped by the remnants of 2-13 and 3-13 Armor near [[Thala, Tunisia|Thala]] on 22 February. Although the enemy had pushed back the Allies, they were tired and spread thin. The Allied counter strike culminated at the Battles of [[Battle of El Guettar|El Guettar]] and [[Battle of Sedjenane|Mateur]], where tankers from 13th Armor showed the Germans that they had learned from their early mistakes, and were capable of fighting, and winning against the best. In early May 1943, one week before German forces in Africa ceased resistance, 2nd Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment was poised to take the seaside town of [[Bizerte]]. During the push to the city, 1LT Dwight Varner, from [[Piatt County, Illinois]] and a recent graduate of the [[University of Illinois]], was leading his platoon in the attack, when his tank and eight others were knocked out by German anti-tank guns. 1LT Varner escaped his burning tank and managed to drag several crewmen to safety and provide first aid. However, he was wounded and captured. While marching to Tunis, he managed to escape his captors after three days and 40 miles of marching. Upon encountering seven Italian soldiers, he turned the tables and captured them by bluffing that the mess kit spoon in his pocket was a pistol. Commandeering the enemy\u2019s vehicle, he then captured 18 unsuspecting Germans and drove them all back to American lines. 1LT Varner was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extreme gallantry and risk of his life while facing the enemy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.journal-republican.com/obituaries/dwight-steve-varner/article_2f621243-8588-5c53-be4d-218eac56b499.html|title=Dwight Steve Varner|last=Republican|first=Journal|website=Journal Republican|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news-gazette.com/obituaries/steve-varner/article_8a5eb464-5d9a-5ba7-b809-7bd57d1de3f5.html|title=Steve Varner|last=News-Gazette|first=The|website=The News-Gazette|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Robinett |first1=Paul McDonald |title=Armor Command: The Personal Story of a Commander of the 13th Armored Regiment, of CCB, 1st Armored Division, and of the Armored School during World War II |date=2017 |publisher=Arcole Publishing |page=289}}</ref> \n\nAll Germans in Africa surrendered by 15 May 1943, and the 13th Armor began training for its next assignment.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\n====Naples-Foggia====\n[[File:13th Armor Tank stuck in the mud. Southern Italy.jpg|thumb|A tank from the 13th Armored Regiment is stuck in the mud of southern Italy, 1943.]]\nAfter victory in North Africa, the 1st Armored Division began training for its next operation. It was moved across the desert west to [[French protectorate in Morocco|French-Morocco]] and was quartered in and around the city of [[Rabat]] where it underwent a major reorganization. General [[Ernest N. Harmon]], commander of the 1st Armored Division, placed COL [[Hamilton H. Howze]] in command of the 13th Armored Regiment, and he quickly saw fit to rearm the Regiment with more modern equipment. The M3 Stuart light tanks were replaced by [[M5 Stuart]] light tanks, and the M3 Lee tanks were replaced by the [[M4 Sherman]].<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The Sherman tank would become the workhorse of the US Army, with over 50,000 of them being built during World War II. While 1st Armored Division was refitting in Morocco, other Allied forces [[Operation Husky|invaded Sicily]], and the men of Old Ironsides knew they would soon be headed into combat again. In September 1943, General Harmon reported to the [[Fifth Army (United States)|Fifth Army]] commander, General [[Mark W. Clark]], that the 1st Armored Division had completed rigorous training and was ready for combat operations once again. The 13th Armor landed in [[Italy]] near [[Naples]] in November 1943, where Allied units had already carved out a beachhead. After assembling in [[Capua]], the Regiment waited in reserve. Their mission was to attack through the [[Liri Valley]] once infantry units had seized the surrounding heights.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />  \n\nHowever, unlike Africa, the terrain of Italy is not suited for armored warfare. The Germans broke dams and flooded the countryside whenever they withdrew to mire the Allied advance. This also provided breeding ground for mosquitoes, leading to a [[malaria]] outbreak among Allied soldiers.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The winding rivers and steep mountains also proved difficult for the 13th Armor tanks to negotiate. Despite the cold, wet and miserable conditions, [[Christmas]] 1943 was greeted with considerable activity. Father Flaherty, the 13th Armored Regimental Chaplain, celebrated Mass in a Medieval village church. There was caroling, [[Christmas tree]] decoration, and music. The festivities ended on [[New Year\u2019s Day]], and the year of 1944 began with a German artillery barrage, further miring the Liri Valley and halting any hope of an American armored attack. The Allies began to look for other ways to break the stalemate in Southern Italy.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\n====Anzio====\n[[File:1st Armored Division tanks land on the Anzio beachhead. 1944.jpg|thumb|1st Armored Division tanks land on the Anzio beachhead. 1944.]]\nBy January 1944, Allied forces had become stalemated along the German [[Gustav Line]], which was anchored around the strong fortifications of [[Monte Cassino]]. The mud, mountains, and rivers made an armored breakthrough impossible. In order to defeat this defensive line, the Allies launched [[Operation Shingle]], the amphibious invasion of [[Anzio]], behind the Gustav Line. Combat Command A (CCA) of the 1st Armored Division was part of the initial landings, but CCB, including the 13th Armored Regiment, remained in the [[Cassino]] area ready to exploit any German weakness and attack through the Liri Valley should the opportunity arise. After intense German counterattacks on the Anzio beachhead and no meaningful progress south of the Gustav Line, it was decided to reunite the 1st Armored Division in order to make a decisive armored thrust to break out of Anzio. 13th Armor was shipped north to Anzio in early May 1944 after months of waiting. There, they received extensive training on breaching and the 191st Tank Battalion was attached to the Regiment for the coming attack. After rehearsing infantry-tank cooperation, the Regiment was in its pre-attack positions near [[Cisterna di Latina|Cisterna]] by 22 May.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> On 23 May, 2nd Battalion 13th Armor jumped off at first light with D Co to the west, F Co to the east, and E Co in reserve. Attacking toward [[Torrecchia Vecchia|Torrecchia Nuova]], the Battalion ran into an American [[minefield]] that was not properly marked. 40 total vehicles from CCB were damaged as a result.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> D Co had so many tanks lose their tracks to mines that E Co advanced and assumed their mission. Despite this early setback, the tanks of Companies E and F rapidly advanced. They knocked out enemy anti-tank guns, bunkers, and trenches before setting into local security positions for the night. \n \nMeanwhile, near Carano Creek on the American left flank, the German Army had launched a counterattack in the afternoon. 3-13 Armor, under LTC Cairns in Division reserve, drove away the Germans with the help of accurate artillery support. Tank recovery operations to repair damaged tracks and return the damaged tanks of 2-13 Armor to action went on for the duration of the night. Nearly all lost tanks were operational again within 48 hours.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The next day, 24 May, the attack continued. 2-13 Armor went forward, supporting 3-[[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6 Infantry]], and cleared out enemy positions in a forest and captured two artillery batteries. F Co, under CPT John C. Elliott, was sent to assist the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] to the west while the rest of 2-13 went into reserve. The light tanks of LTC Carr\u2019s 1-13 Armor passed through 2-13\u2019s lines and seized the Regimental objective, Torrecchia Nuova. The next day, 25 May, COL Howze was ordered to seize [[Giulianello]], and the attack jumped off at dawn. Near the town of [[Valmontone]], the 13th Armor engaged the infamous German [[Hermann G\u00f6ring Division]]. 3-13 Armor blocked the road to west while 1-13 flanked the retreating Germans, capturing many. 2-13 Armor\u2019s attack went well, but a German artillery shell killed its Executive Officer, MAJ George Johnson, and the attack stalled.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> In order to capitalize on their gains, Task Force Howze (consisting of 3-13 Armor and supporting units) was formed to take [[Velletri]] and Giulianello. Working well with infantry support, the tanks of both CCB and TF Howze broke through the enemy lines while other armored units were halted by German anti-tank guns. The main highways to [[Rome]], Routes 6 and 7, were opened for an Allied attack by 2 June 1944. During the [[Battle of Anzio]], the 13th Armored Regiment saw its first real combat in the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]]. Although the fighting here was difficult and not ideal for armored warfare, the 13th Armor secured an Allied breakthrough and helped end the stalemate in Southern Italy.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Rome, the Italian capital, was finally within reach.\n\n====Rome-Arno====\n[[File:13th Armored Regiment enters Rome.jpg|thumb|H Co, 13th Armor, enters the city limits of Rome. 4 June 1944.]]\nAfter achieving a breakout from the Anzio beachhead, 1st Armored Division tanks were positioned just south of Rome by 2 June 1944. Allied planners wanted to waste no time, and immediately ordered the tanks of the 13th Armored Regiment to advance to the \u201cEternal City.\u201d LTC Cairns\u2019 3rd Battalion 13th Armor, part of Task Force Howze, led the way down Highway 6.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Despite sporadic enemy resistance, the retreating Germans could not stop the rapid advance. Meanwhile, on 3 June, the bulk of the 1st Armored Division advanced up Highway 7, with 1-13 and 2-13 Armor in Combat Command B (CCB). Allied units from across Italy were in a rush to be the first to enter Rome. The morning of 4 June 1944 began as a race. A Co, 1-13 Armor was sent ahead as a [[flying column]] while the rest of CCB broke into three columns advancing down parallel roads along Highway 7 to bypass Allied traffic and German defenses. TF Howze, to the east of the city, ran into strong German resistance just outside of city limits. By 0615, its 3rd Battalion, 13th Armor broke through and continued down Highway 6; eager infantrymen holding onto the backs of the fast-moving tanks. By 0715, H Co, 3-13 Armor, under CPT John A. Beale, became the first American element to enter the Eternal city; The lead tank was commanded by SGT Abner.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> However, after turning a corner, his tank and another were both hit by anti-tank gun fire; the Germans weren\u2019t going to give up so easily.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> For hours, TF Howze battled with German roadblocks in the city, slowly clearing the streets. Companies G, H, and I rolled to the northwest to cut off a German armored counterattack. After his tank was disabled, LTC Cairns, commanding 3-13 Armor, took command of CPT Beale\u2019s tank, resulting in the odd scenario where a Company Commander acted as the gunner for his Battalion Commander. Together, the two commanders found and knocked out several enemy vehicles.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the 13th Armored Regiment advanced quickly up from the south, capturing numerous prisoners and surprising many Germans who didn\u2019t expect the Allies to be so far north. By the end of 4 June 1944, Rome was completely in Allied hands. Italian citizens thronged the streets, kissing the GIs and giving them flowers.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The 1st Armored Division quickly moved north of the city and prepared for the next attack; along the coastal plain to the [[Arno River]]. Although the capture of Rome was a major win for the Allies, public and military attention quickly shifted elsewhere. On 6 June 1944, the [[Invasion of Normandy]] began, opening another front against the Axis. Allied forces in Italy would now be a secondary effort.\n\nFrom 6-10 June, 1-13 and 2-13 advanced 25 miles north of Rome meeting only scant resistance. The relatively flat land of the Italian coastal plain was much more suited to armored warfare than the terrain of Southern Italy. By 22 June, 1AD again ran into steep mountainous terrain, and all attacks north were stalled.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Grinding north again, the 13th Armor engaged and defeated German elements in numerous battles and skirmishes as the retreating enemy tried to delay the Allied advance. CCB and TF Howze became adept at defeating German armored elements, and the Arno River was finally reached on 18 July 1944, but the 1st Armored Division needed a rest. After pulling back, the Division was completely reorganized on 20 July. The 13th Armored Regiment was reduced in size and was redesignated as the 13th Tank Battalion. 1-13 Armor was disbanded, and its tanks and crews went on to replace others lost in combat. Companies D, E, and F of 2-13 Armor became Companies A, B, and C of the 13th Tank Battalion (M4 Shermans). B Co of [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Armored Regiment]] became D Co, 13th Tank Battalion (M5 Stuarts). Companies G, H, and I of 3-13 Armor left and formed the 4th Tank Battalion. The 13th Tank Battalion now had an effective strength of 804 tanks, and it soon began preparing to meet the next formidable German defensive position; the [[Gothic Line]].<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\n====North Apennines====\n[[File:B Co 13th Armor in Italy.jpg|thumb|B Co 13th Tank Battalion in Italy]]\nDespite a rapid Allied advance into and beyond Rome, the Italian Front had stalemated once again at the German Gothic Line. The 13th Tank Battalion, commanded by LTC Henry E. Gardiner, was assigned to Combat Command B (CCB), commanded by COL [[Lawrence Russell Dewey]], for the coming offensive. On 1 September 1944, CCB crossed the Arno river with combined tank and infantry columns and met only scant resistance. Swiftly advancing, CCB captured the town of [[Altopascio]] on 4 September, and the 13th Tank Battalion continued its steady advance.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> On 10 September, the tankers faced their first real German resistance of the offensive, but they continued to apply pressure to the enemy\u2019s western flank to divert German troops from Fifth Army\u2019s main effort at [[Il Giogo Pass]]. On 25 September 1st Armored Division was split up. The steep mountains and foothills of the [[Apennine Range]] were ill-suited to rapid armored assaults, and the Combat Commands of the Division were attached to infantry units to provide them with necessary tank support. 13th Tank Battalion was assigned to \u201cTask Force 92\u201d under BG John E. Wood. TF 92 was a component of the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Division]], a \u201cColored Division\u201d in the segregated Army of WWII. TF 92 and 13th Tank Battalion worked together well, and from 26-29 September, they launched a large attack on German positions on the Gothic Line.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> They managed to capture the town of [[Lucchio]] and push the enemy out of the [[Serchio|Serchio Valley]]. By the end of September 13th Tank Battalion and TF 92 was attacking down Highway 64 toward [[Vergato]], operating independently of the 1st Armored or the 92nd Infantry Divisions.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n  \nOn 6 October 13th Tank was temporarily attached to the \u201c[[6th Armoured Division (South Africa)|6 South African Armoured Division]].\u201d The 1st Armored Division now held the extreme western flank of the [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]] Zone.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Throughout October, the 13th Tank Battalion, on the left flank of CCB, pushed up the mountain slopes along Highway 64. First they reached [[Porretta Terme]], and then near the end of the month, arrived beyond the town of [[Riola]]. An attack on 29 October against German positions at [[Castelnuovo Rangone|Castelnuovo]] was stopped short. The Germans counterattacked, but 13th Tank defeated them. In a last-ditch effort, the enemy destroyed all nearby bridges, forcing CCB to halt its attack. On 10 December 1944, after a month of inactivity on the front-line, 13th Tank Battalion was attached to the Allied [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] in an attack against [[Monte Castello]], but they were repulsed by the Germans.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> As the winter cold and rain set in, both sides in this sector maintained defensive positions along the stalemated front. Late in 1944 and in early 1945, D Company\u2019s M5 Stuart light tanks began to be replaced by the more modern [[M24 Chaffee]] light tanks. The Chaffee was a vast improvement over the Stuart, as its 75mm gun more than doubled the firepower of the Stuart\u2019s 37mm gun. Throughout the winter, Companies A, B, C, and D conducted training and refitting for the coming campaign.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\n====Po Valley====\n[[File:1st Armored Division tanks in Milan.jpg|thumb|1st Armored Division tanks reach Milan, 29 May 1945.]]\nBy early 1945, German forces in [[Western Europe]] had been defeated at the [[Battle of the Bulge]], and Allied units were steadily advancing into [[Germany]]. In Italy, the German and [[Italian Social Republic|Fascist Italian]] remnants were depleted, but still occupied strong defensive positions anchored by steep mountains ranges. Beyond this line, lay the [[Po Valley]] to the north. The Po Valley is flat, wide, and perfect for offensive armored warfare; if Allied forces could break through to it, the war in Italy could be swiftly won.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Furthermore, Allied units needed to reach the valley in order to cut off retreating German forces before they could reach the [[Alps]] in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]] and set up stronger defenses. 1st Armored Division began its attack on 14 April 1945. A Co, and 2nd Platoon of C Co, were in Combat Command B (CCB), the Division\u2019s main effort, while the remainder of 13th Tank Battalion was placed in reserve. A Co and 2nd Platoon of C Co had 34 tanks, including 17 Shermans equipped with high velocity 76mm guns, and 9 M4A3 Shermans equipped with 105mm guns. The tanks were to support the 6th, 11th, and 14th Armored Infantry Battalions in their advance. At 1630, the attack jumped off under the cover of a smoke screen laid down by Division Artillery. The tanks and infantry met determined German resistance but captured their objectives by 17 April.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" />\n\nMeanwhile, an M4 Sherman platoon from 13th Armor was detached to assist the 81st Cavalry Squadron in seizing [[Piano di Venola]]. After meeting stiff resistance along Highway 64, the Troopers and Tankers of the force were near their objective by 17 April as well.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> During the advance, the rest of 13th Tank Battalion remained in Division reserve, ready to exploit a breakthrough. On 20 April, 13th Tank Battalion was attached to Combat Command A (CCA). With A Co on the right, B Co on the left, and C Co in reserve, 13th Tank Battalion attacked alongside the 6th Armored Infantry Battalion into the Po Valley. After a rapid advance, 13th Tank encountered fierce resistance at the town of [[Oliveto Lario|Oliveto]], losing 3 tanks from C Co, but ultimately securing victory, and taking 179 German prisoners. 1st Armored Division elements had at last reached the Po Valley, and were ready to strike. 13th Tank Battalion\u2019s Commander, LTC Henry E. Gardiner, took A Co and D Co to cut Highway 9, while the Executive Officer, MAJ John C. Elliot, took B Co and C Co northwest to occupy [[Castelfranco Emilia|Castelfranco]]. By the end of 21 April, these objectives were secured, and many Germans were taken prisoner. The 13th Tank Battalion continued its audacious drive north and west, cutting through German lines and defeating or capturing any enemies it encountered. By the end of 23 April, the Battalion had crossed the [[Po River]], and it captured the city of [[Verona]] by 26 April.<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> Speeding to the northwest, the 1st AD began capturing thousands of German prisoners; they knew the war was lost and were not keen on fighting powerful Allied armored units anymore. On 28 April, it was revealed that [[Mussolini]] had been captured and executed by [[Italian partisans]], and soon after, C Co of the 13th Tank Battalion entered the city of [[Milan]].<ref name=\"HoweGeorge\" /> The next day, the German commander, General [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]], surrendered and the fighting in Italy ceased on 2 May 1945. [[Hitler]] committed suicide soon after, and WWII in Europe ended on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]].\nThe 13th Tank Battalion soon moved into occupied [[West Germany]] to begin its post-war duties. WWII was the 13th\u2019s longest and deadliest conflict. Despite a steep learning curve at Kasserine Pass, the unit proved itself in Tunisia and Italy, earning itself a decorated place in American military history.\n\n===Cold War===\nAs part of the post-war [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied Occupation of Germany]], The 13th Tank Battalion was converted, reorganized, and redesignated on 1 May 1946 as the [[US Constabulary|13th Constabulary Squadron]], an element of the 10th Constabulary Regiment.<ref name=\"historyArmyMilLineageAndHonors\">{{Cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/armor-cav/013cv002sq.htm|title=2d Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment {{!}} Lineage and Honors {{!}} U.S. Army Center of Military History (CMH)|website=history.army.mil|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> It was inactivated on 20 September 1947 in [[Coburg]], [[West Germany]] and relieved from assignment to the 10th Constabulary Regiment. On 7 March 1951, it was reactivated as the 13th Medium Tank Battalion and was assigned, once again, to the 1st Armored Division at [[Fort Hood, Texas]]. On 20 May 1953, its designation was changed back to the 13th Tank Battalion. The Battalion was inactivated on 15 February 1957 at [[Fort Polk, Louisiana]] and was reactivated later that year, 1 October 1957, and was assigned to the [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] in Germany.<ref name=\"historyArmyMilLineageAndHonors\" />\n\nOn 3 February 1962 2nd Battalion, 13th Armor was relieved from assignment to the 3rd Armored Division and was assigned to the 1st Armored Division.<ref name=\"historyArmyMilLineageAndHonors\" /> On 5 May 1971 it was relieved from assignment to the 1st Armored Division and was assigned to the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] at Fort Hood and was inactivated on 23 April 1973. On 20 June 1974, 1st Battalion, 13th Armor rejoined the 1st Armored Division at [[Illesheim]], Germany until 20 February 1987, when the Battalion moved to [[Vilseck]], Germany. 13th Tank remained here until 1988, when it was inactivated and re-designated as 2nd Battalion, 13th Armor at [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]].<ref name=\"historyArmyMilLineageAndHonors\" />\n\n===Bosnia===\nAt Fort Riley, Kansas in March 1996, 3rd Battalion, [[37th Armor Regiment]] cased its colors and reflagged as the 1st Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment, with the Soldiers exchanging their [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] patches for the \"Old Ironsides\" patches of the 1st Armored Division. LTC Richard G. Jung Sr. commanded the \"Dakota\" Battalion from 1996\u201398, honoring the Regiment's history with the Battalion name and call sign. Called \"13th Tank\" by those who served in the unit, 1-13 Armor was one of two armor battalions in 3rd Brigade, 1st AD (Bulldogs) under the command of COL Joseph F.H. Peterson.\n\nIn January 1997, A Company (Ironhorse), 1-13 Armor, under CPT Paul P. Reese, was alerted for deployment to [[Europe]] as part of the ongoing peacekeeping effort in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. In March, A Company was attached to 1st Battalion, [[41st Infantry Regiment (United States)|41st Infantry Regiment]], 1-41 Infantry, and deployed to [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] in support of [[Operation Joint Guard]]. The Company was stationed at [[Camp Dobol]] near the zone of separation (ZOS) as the first iteration of \"[[SFOR]]\" or the \"Stabilization Force\" after the designation changed from \"[[IFOR]]\" or the \"Implementation Force\" in early 1997, \"Team Tank\" conducted a variety of missions and patrols in accordance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP) and corresponding rules of engagement (ROE) while operating within its area of responsibility. The company operated near the Bosnian-Serbian ([[Republika Srpska]]) towns of [[\u0160ekovi\u0107i]], [[Bratunac]] and the infamous [[Srebrenica]]. A/1-13 AR consisted of 2 [[M1A1 tank]] platoons and 1 [[M2A2 Bradley]] platoon (1 organic tank platoon was detached and assigned to A/1-41 IN at Camp Demi). Ironhorse company returned to the 1st Battalion, 13th Armored Regiment in December, 1997 upon redeployment to Fort Riley at the successful completion of their mission.\n\n===Iraq War===\n[[File:2-13 Cavalry.

The Squadron deployed to Iraq in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] from May 2009 to May 2010. The 1st Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment (Warhorse) stood up in 2009 as part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division at Fort Bliss, TX. In April 2009, 4th Brigade, including 2-13 Cavalry, deployed to the southern Iraqi provinces of [[Dhi Qar]], [[Maysan]], and Al-Muthanna, as the Army's first \"advise and assist brigade,\" a concept in which US forces would take a backseat to [[Iraqi Armed Forces|Iraqi Security Forces]] (ISF) and local government officials. The Brigade, under the command of COL Peter A. Newell and CSM Phillip D. Pandy, partnered with provincial reconstruction teams, civil affairs teams, [[US Department of State]] officials, and military transition teams, while assisting ISF and the Government of Iraq. The Brigade's partnership allowed over one million voters to participate in the election of 2010. For their actions in assisting elections in Iraq, 2nd Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment earned the [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]].\n\nIn July 2011, the 4/1 AD Highlanders deployed to Iraq in support of [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|Operation New Dawn]]. The Brigade deployed under the command of COL [[Scott McKean]], who later served as the 1AD Deputy Commanding General for Operations. 2-13 Cavalry served with the Brigade for the entirety of this deployment and was a key part in maintaining security while US forces withdrew from Iraq. 4th Brigade was one of the last units to withdraw from Iraq as part of the closing of Operation New Dawn.\n\n===Afghanistan War===\n1st Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment (TF 1-13 Cavalry), as part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, (TF 3-1AD), deployed from Fort Bliss, Texas to eastern Afghanistan ([[Train Advise Assist Command \u2013 East|RC-East]]) on 16 October 2011. The Brigade conducted combined, population-centric [[counterinsurgency]] operations in [[Logar Province|Logar]], [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]], and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]] provinces, relieving the 4th Brigade, [[10th Mountain Division]]. TF 3-1 AD and partners worked to secure Highway 1, a vital line of communication, neutralize insurgent and criminal networks, and train the [[Afghan Armed Forces|Afghan National Security Forces]] in order to expand the [[Kabul]] Security Zone and extend the Afghan Government's influence among the local people. In mid-October, TF 3-1 AD launched the brigade's first operation, Operation Shamshir. Planned in support of an RC-East operation to disrupt insurgents from the [[Haqqani Network]] across eastern [[Afghanistan]], the operation disrupted and dislodged insurgents from their entrenched positions and forced them into the open. A total of 14 villages in the [[Kharwar District]] were cleared and the operation concluded with a [[Shura]] among key leaders. As the Afghan winter set in, TF 3-1 AD continued to target insurgent supply caches, disrupt support zones, and expand the Afghan government's authority. The Brigade and their Afghan partners continued to push the enemy south, expanding the Kabul security zone.  \n\nOn 15 April 2012, insurgents launched the opening salvos of their spring offensive. Coordinated attacks targeting coalition and Afghan military bases and embassies were carried out in Kabul, [[Paktiya]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], and Logar Provinces. The enemy attacks were defeated by a combination of TF 3-1 AD Soldiers, Afghan partners, and close air support. In all, 11 insurgents were killed in action. In May 2012, TF 1-13 Cavalry assumed control for all of northern Logar Province and planned and resourced the movement of two additional [[Afghan National Army]] battalions (Kandaks) into the area. On 15 July 2012, TF 1-13 Cavalry and the rest of TF 3-1 AD returned to Fort Bliss, Texas. \n\n===Global Security Rotations===\nFollowing the 4th Brigade's re-flagging as 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division in 2015, 1-13 Cavalry inactivated on 15 April 2015 as part of the Brigade's inactivation, and the 2nd Squadron 13th Cavalry Regiment, now part of 3rd ABCT, participated in the Brigade's Regionally Aligned Force mission throughout the continent of [[Africa]]. The Squadron sent Troopers on various train and assist missions to multiple countries on the African continent to include: [[Malawi]], [[Morocco]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Namibia]], and [[Zambia]]. As a result of these missions, the Squadron directly supported the [[United Nations]]' Peace Keeping operations, enhanced the Army's geo-political impact, and increased the readiness of America's African allies and partners throughout the continent.\n\nIn July 2016, 2-13 Cavalry Squadron assumed responsibility of the [[US Army Central Command]] theater security cooperation and partnership missions at [[Camp Buehring]], [[Kuwait]], in support of [[Operation Spartan Shield]]. By strengthening partnerships with the [[United Arab Emirates Armed Forces]], the [[Royal Army of Oman]], and the [[Kingdom of Bahrain]], the efforts of the entire Squadron contributed to peace and stability in the region.<ref>https://www.bliss.army.mil/3BCT1ARM/2-13.html</ref>\n\nFrom fall 2018 to the summer of 2019, 2-13 Cavalry served in the [[Republic of Korea]], working closely and training with the [[ROK Army]]. Their rotation on the [[Korean Peninsula]] helped deter [[North Korea]]n aggression and maintained peace in the region.\n\n==Current status==\n2nd Squadron is the armored reconnaissance squadron of the [[3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division (United States)|3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division]] stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas. With the inactivation of 1-13 CAV in April 2015, 2nd Squadron became the Regimental Home-Base Squadron.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.benning.army.mil/armor/ocoa/content/PDF/Regimental%20Guide.pdf|title=Armor and Cavalry Regimental Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723001158/http://www.benning.army.mil/armor/ocoa/content/PDF/Regimental%20Guide.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2015|access-date=12 January 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It currently remains the only active Squadron in the 13th Cavalry Regiment.\n\nThe Squadron's composition is as follows:\n* Hatchet Troop - Headquarters\n* Apache Troop - [[M2A3 Bradley]] Reconnaissance\n* Blackfoot Troop - M2A3 Bradley Reconnaissance\n* Crazy Horse Troop - M2A3 Bradley Reconnaissance\n* Damage Troop - [[M1A2 Abrams]] Tank\n* Dagger Company - Forward Support Company\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of armored and cavalry regiments of the United States Army]]\n* [[78th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)]]\n* [[79th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/1-13ar.htm 1-13 Armored History, globalsecurity.org]\n\n[[Category:Cavalry regiments of the United States Army|013]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1901|013]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIraq War:Fixing links to disambiguation pages, improving links, other minor cleanup tasks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_Cavalry_Regiment"}

With Partizan, he won the national Championship in 1976.\n\nIn the summer of 1976, Anti\u0107 signed for [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]] in Turkey. He spent two seasons in [[Istanbul]] before moving to the Spanish [[La Liga]], where he played for [[Real Zaragoza]].\n\nIn 1980, Anti\u0107 moved on to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], a team in England's [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] (which was then the second tier). Known in England as \"Raddy\", he helped Luton to the Second Division title in 1982, and stayed with the club for two seasons in the [[Football League First Division|top division]] before leaving in 1984. At the end of the [[1982\u201383 Football League|1982\u201383 season]], he played a key role in saving Luton from relegation, scoring a winning goal four minutes from time in the final League match of the season, away against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. City, the home team, were themselves relegated as a result. At full-time, Luton manager [[David Pleat]] ran across the pitch, hopping and waving his arms wildly in celebration.<ref>{{cite web|author=mattyredman |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyAUkaC6nsI |title=Manchester City vs. Luton Town, May 1983 |publisher=Uk.youtube.com |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlready in his 30s when he arrived at Luton, Anti\u0107 already looked to coaching as a career option once his playing days are finished. While an active player in England, he enrolled in and completed the coaching college in [[Belgrade]], Vi\u0161a trenerska \u0161kola. In that regard, he often cites Pleat as an influence on his later coaching style.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130724055810/http://www.kurir-info.rs/moj-ucitelj-dejvid-plit-clanak-14439 Moj u\u010ditelj Dejvid Plit], ''Kurir'', 16 November 2009</ref>\n\nAfter helping save Luton's First Division status, Anti\u0107 spent [[1983\u201384 in English football|one more season]] at [[Kenilworth Road]] before retiring at age 36.\n\nAnti\u0107 made one appearance for the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia national team]], appearing as a substitute in the 80th minute for injured [[Franjo Vladi\u0107]] (who himself came on as a sub for [[Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 Pi\u017eon]] some 18 minutes prior) in a friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 26 September 1973 in Belgrade.\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Early career===\nAfter finishing his playing career at age 36, Anti\u0107 started a career in coaching as an assistant with Partizan (1985\u201387), working under head coach [[Nenad Bjekovi\u0107]]. Partizan won the [[1985\u201386 Yugoslav First League|1985\u201386 league]] title amid a match-fixing controversy. They also won the [[1986\u201387 Yugoslav First League|1986\u201387 league]].\n\nIn early July 1987, [[Fahrudin Jusufi]] was brought in as the new head coach and initially Anti\u0107 continued his assistant role. For the pre-season training ahead of the 1987\u201388 season, the team went abroad where Jusufi and Anti\u0107 got into a row over player personnel issues that resulted in Anti\u0107 being essentially demoted to the position of Partizan under-16 youth team (cadet squad) coach.\n\n===Real Zaragoza===\nAnti\u0107's first head coaching position was with Real Zaragoza. In addition to formerly playing for the club, his appointment owed a lot to being recommended for the job by countryman [[Vujadin Bo\u0161kov]], who successfully led Italian side [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] at the time, but still enjoyed a lot of clout in Spain having led Zaragoza (coached Anti\u0107 there for two years) and other La Liga clubs during the late 1970s and early '80s.\n\nThe squad was a fairly modest one without any really big names; the most notable players being the aging Spanish international midfielder [[Juan Antonio Se\u00f1or|Juan Se\u00f1or]] and forward [[Miguel Pardeza]], who came up through [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]'s youth system as part of ''[[La Quinta del Buitre]]'' generation. The club also had some young assets: a pair of 22-year-olds [[Francisco Villarroya]] and [[Juan Vizca\u00edno]] who were well on their way to becoming future Spanish internationals as well as eccentric Paraguayan goalie [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Chilavert]] who came to the club from Argentina's [[Club Atl\u00e9tico San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] the same summer Anti\u0107 did. Anti\u0107's made his La Liga coaching debut on 4 September 1988 against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], a 0\u20130 draw. The initial period was rough, with the club hovering in and around relegation zone, followed by a period of slight improvement, but still stuck in the lower half of the table. The sudden and somewhat unexpected breakthrough came during last eight league matches of the season as Anti\u0107's Zaragoza started posting win after win in a rapid climb up the table, finishing the [[1988\u201389 La Liga|season]] in fifth place, thus qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].\n\nHe ended up spending two full seasons (1988\u20131990) managing a club he also turned out for as a player.\n\n===Real Madrid===\nReal Madrid came calling in late March 1991 and Anti\u0107 took over from club legend [[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]] following ''los Merengues''' elimination from the [[1990\u201391 European Cup|European Cup]] by [[Oleg Romantsev]]'s [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] at the quarter-final stage. Di St\u00e9fano had been on thin ice since the 1\u20130 league defeat in mid-March away to mid-table [[CD Logro\u00f1\u00e9s|Logro\u00f1\u00e9s]] (Real Madrid's third league loss in a row), but it was the 1\u20133 return leg quarter-final European Cup home loss against the Russians at the [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]] on 20 March 1991 that served as the last straw that prompted Di St\u00e9fano's removal. In La Liga, at the time, after 26 matches, the club occupied the seventh position in the standings.\n\nUsed to winning major trophies, the royal club was in turmoil with Anti\u0107 coming in as their third head coach of the [[1990\u201391 Real Madrid C.F. season|season]] after [[John Toshack]] and Di St\u00e9fano.\n\n==== 1990\u201391: Stopping the bleeding ====\nWith [[Emilio Butrague\u00f1o]], [[M\u00edchel (footballer)|M\u00edchel]], [[Fernando Hierro]], [[Manuel Sanch\u00eds Hontiyuelo|Manolo Sanch\u00eds]], [[Gheorghe Hagi]] and the aging [[Hugo S\u00e1nchez]] as the club's established stars, Anti\u0107's debut took place at the Bernab\u00e9u against [[Real Oviedo]] on 24 March 1991, ending in somewhat disappointing 1\u20131 draw considering Oviedo played with ten men since the 68th minute.<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18066 Real Madrid-Real Oviedo 1:1];La Liga, 24 March 1991</ref>\n\nThings would get even worse the following week with the 0\u20131 home loss to mid-table [[Real Burgos CF|Real Burgos]]<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18076 Real Madrid-Real Burgos 0:1];La Liga, 31 March 1991</ref> and downright critical the week after as Madrid was beaten 3\u20131 away at [[Luis Aragon\u00e9s]]' relegation-battling [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] by conceding two late goals,<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18085 Espanyol-Real Madrid 3:1];La Liga, 7 April 1991</ref> dropping ''los Merengues'' to the 10th spot in La Liga. After only three league matches, Anti\u0107 was feeling the full pressure of the Real hotseat.\n\nThings finally started clicking with the 4\u20130 home win versus Valencia on 14 April, that started a five-match winning streak. The 3\u20133 away draw at Osasuna ended the streak, but the team quickly put together another 3-match winning run to end the season. On 8 June, the season ended on a high note with a 1\u20130 home win against champions-elect [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in ''[[El Cl\u00e1sico]]''. In total, Anti\u0107 led Real in the final 12 league matches (8 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses) of the [[1990\u201391 La Liga|1990\u201391 season]], improving Real's standing to third in the league, and qualifying for the UEFA Cup.\nHe died in 2020\n\n==== 1991\u201392: Success and sacking ====\nDuring the 1991 summer transfer window, Anti\u0107 brought in [[Robert Prosine\u010dki]], prominent member of the [[Red Star Belgrade]]'s [[1990\u201391 European Cup|1991]] European Cup-winning side, as well as promising 21-year-old [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Lu\u00eds Enrique]] from [[Sporting de Gij\u00f3n]].\n\nAnti\u0107's team began the season in furious fashion with five straight [[1991\u201392 La Liga|league]] wins, grabbing the La Liga top spot ahead of ''El Cl\u00e1sico'' on 19 October 1991. Playing [[Johan Cruyff]]'s ''Bar\u00e7a'' \"dream team\" at home at the Bernab\u00e9u, Real went ahead via a Prosine\u010dki first half free-kick, one shining moment in the highly rated signing's otherwise disastrous season, before [[Ronald Koeman]] equalized courtesy of a second half penalty shot.<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18066 Real Madrid-FC Barcelona 1:1];La Liga, 19 October 1991</ref> Real's winning streak in the league had thus been broken, however, with the very next league match, a 3\u20130 home win over Logro\u00f1\u00e9s,<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18265 Real Madrid-CD Logro\u00f1\u00e9s 3:0];La Liga, 27 October 1991</ref> ''los Merengues'' commenced another winning streak, this time recording seven straight league wins as they tangibly separated themselves from the pack of chasers atop the La Liga standings.\n\nOne player especially excelled under Anti\u0107: 23-year-old Hierro, normally a defender, was moved up further into midfield and responded by scoring in numbers, eventually ending the season on 21 league goals, the greatest single-season offensive output of his career. The second winning streak in the league ended with a draw away at Zaragoza in mid-December 1991.<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18339 Real Zaragoza-Real Madrid 1:1];La Liga, 15 December 1991</ref> This was followed by a slight dip in form as Real recorded another draw the following week at home against Oviedo, before experiencing its first league loss of the season away at cross-town rivals [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], though still retaining top league spot by a comfortable margin. During this three-match period without a league win, club president [[Ram\u00f3n Mendoza]] opted to bring [[Leo Beenhakker]] into the organization in a vaguely defined sporting director role, though Anti\u0107 remained the team's head coach. The three-match winless streak ended with an emphatic 5\u20132 win at home versus [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]], but was followed by the second league loss of the season when [[Guus Hiddink]]'s Valencia managed to overturn Real's 0\u20131 lead with two late goals and record a famous home win over the league leaders.<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18370 Valencia CF-Real Madrid 2:1];La Liga, 18 January 1992</ref> Although Anti\u0107's team quickly got back on winning track with a 2\u20131 home win against [[CD Tenerife|Tenerife]] on 26 January 1992,<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18388 Real Madrid-CD Tenerife 2:1];La Liga, 26 January 1992</ref> the 43-year-old coach was terminated. At the time of Anti\u0107's termination, 19 league matches into the season, Madrid was holding the top spot in La Liga by a seven-point margin and was also smoothly through to the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] quarter-finals with previous wins over [[\u0160K Slovan Bratislava|Slovan Bratislava]], [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax]].\n\nLed by Beenhakker, Real Madrid squandered its seven-point lead, losing the title to bitter rivals Barcelona on the last matchday of the season. Madrid was also eliminated from UEFA Cup by [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in the semi-finals.\n\n===Real Oviedo===\nAnti\u0107 was hired to coach Real Oviedo when the club's brass fired previous longtime coach [[Javier Irureta]] after matchday 19 of the [[1992\u201393 La Liga|1992\u201393 season]] with the club dangerously close to the relegation zone in 16th spot and a one match stint of caretaker Julio Marigil Mar\u00edn. Anti\u0107 took over from matchday 21 and completed the season with the club, managing to avoid relegation by finishing two spots above the relegation zone. He remained at the club for two additional seasons.\n\nDuring the 1993 summer transfer window, Anti\u0107 signed [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]] from Partizan, whose midfield presence greatly helped the squad. The expectations at Oviedo were obviously much more modest compared to Real Madrid, with mere top league survival being the main goal. It was therefore no small surprise that a very low budget Anti\u0107-led Oviedo team finished the [[1993\u201394 La Liga|1993\u201394]] league season in ninth place.\n\nAnti\u0107's most notable signing at Oviedo came before the start of [[1994\u201395 La Liga|1994\u201395 season]] when he brought often injured Robert Prosine\u010dki from Real Madrid, thus reuniting with a player he first signed to Madrid. Oviedo again finished the La Liga season in respectable ninth position, missing a European spot by mere points.\n\n===Atl\u00e9tico Madrid===\nAnti\u0107's greatest coaching successes are tied to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, a club he ended up coaching in three separate stints.\n\nHis achievements with transforming Oviedo's fortunes led to offers from bigger Spanish clubs. Despite having been in final stages of the negotiations with Valencia with even a pre-contract signed, Anti\u0107 opted to take the offer by Atl\u00e9tico club president [[Jes\u00fas Gil]], leading to the Serb's first engagement with the club that ended up lasting three seasons (1995\u201398). The squad he took over during summer 1995 was a talented one featuring the quality core of [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Caminero]], [[Kiko Narv\u00e1ez]] and [[Diego Simeone]], but with a reputation of continuous underachievement. In the [[1994\u201395 La Liga|season prior to his arrival]], the club finished one point above relegation zone by earning a 2\u20132 draw versus [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] on the last matchday of the season.\n\n==== 1995\u201396: Double title ====\nOut of the 35-player squad he inherited, Anti\u0107 quickly identified 20 players he was counting on for the following season before setting about adding five to six more players during the transfer window. That meant the end of Atl\u00e9tico days for a slew of players including aging goalie [[Abel Resino]], embattled Colombian striker [[Adolfo Valencia]], Brazilian [[Iv\u00e1n Rocha]], Polish striker [[Roman Kosecki]] and Russian winger [[Igor Dobrovolski]], among others.\n\nFirst on Anti\u0107's wish list was defender [[Viktor Onopko]] whom he coached at Real Oviedo: Atl\u00e9tico and the player agreed terms, however, Oviedo management were not satisfied and the case ended up before a [[FIFA]] arbitration commission, which ruled in Oviedo's favour. Anti\u0107 then tried to sign 19-year-old [[Fernando Morientes]] from [[Albacete Balompi\u00e9|Albacete]], but the talented striker instead signed with Zaragoza.<ref>{{cite web|last=Antic |first=Radomir |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4167681.stm |title=Morientes to cast off Ronaldo shadow |publisher=BBC News  |date=12 January 2005 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> Out of the players Anti\u0107 did manage to sign, the biggest find turned out to be unheralded winger [[Milinko Panti\u0107]], whom Anti\u0107 plucked from obscurity in [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]] for very little money. The move initially raised eyebrows with many questioning the usefulness of a complete unknown who is about to turn 29 years of age, however over the coming season, Panti\u0107 would prove himself to be the missing piece this team needed with key goals and assists. Another key acquisition was 29-year-old Bulgarian tall centre forward [[Luboslav Penev]], brought in from Valencia despite questions about his health due to a recent bout with [[testicular cancer]]. Other incoming transfers included goalkeeper [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Molina]] and central defender [[Santiago Denia|Santi Denia]] from Albacete, midfielder [[Roberto Fresnedoso]] from Espanyol and young Argentine striker [[Leonardo Biagini|Leo Biagini]] from [[Newell's Old Boys]], who starred at the [[1995 FIFA World Youth Championship]].\n\nPlaying in the domestic league that was just expanded from 20 to 22 teams along with a new points system with three points awarded for a win, under Anti\u0107's command, the Atl\u00e9tico squad featuring Molina in goal, [[Delf\u00ed Geli]] and Santi Denia in central defence, [[Roberto Soloz\u00e1bal]] and [[Antonio Mu\u00f1oz G\u00f3mez|Toni]] on right and left back respectively, [[Juan Vizca\u00edno]] (whom Anti\u0107 previously coached at Zaragoza) and Caminero in centre midfield, Simeone and Panti\u0107 on right and left wing respectively, and finally Penev and Kiko upfront gelled together masterfully en route to a historic [[La Liga]]/[[Copa del Rey]] double in the [[1995\u201396 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid season|1995\u201396 season]]. Other players that didn't start as often, but nevertheless contributed significantly throughout the season were Fresnedoso, [[Juan Manuel L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Juan Manuel L\u00f3pez]], Biagini, [[Francisco Javier Mori|Pirri Mori]], etc.\n\nAnti\u0107's Atl\u00e9tico began the league campaign in furious fashion with four impressive wins. Once they took the top league spot after week 2, ''los Colchoneros'' gave it up only once (after the week 5 scoreless draw at Sevilla), before reclaiming it the very next week and impressively continuing on top until the end with Penev scoring 16 league goals, Simeone 12, Kiko 11, Panti\u0107 10, and Caminero 9. Atl\u00e9tico also featured a stingy defence that allowed 32 goals \u2013 less than any other team in the league. Still, the title wasn't secure until the very last match, as Valencia stayed in close pursuit until the end. Going into the last round of matches on Saturday 25 May 1996, Atl\u00e9tico was on 84 points with Alabacete to play at home while Valencia had 82 and Celta away. The victory was never in doubt as Simeone and Kiko scored in the first half sparking off jubilant scenes at [[Vicente Calder\u00f3n Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Zarateh64 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiJ-tXfJyzQ |title=Atl\u00e9tico Madrid-Albacete |date= 25 May 1996 |work=Youtube |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nMonth and a half earlier Anti\u0107 already claimed his first trophy of the season, beating [[Johan Cruyff]]'s Bar\u00e7a in the [[Copa del Rey]] [[1996 Copa del Rey Final|final]] in [[Zaragoza]] after extra time on a goal by Panti\u0107.\n\nWinning the double endeared Anti\u0107 to Atl\u00e9tico faithful and more importantly to club's controversial president [[Jes\u00fas Gil]]. Notorious for quickly and impulsively going through coaches, Gil kept Anti\u0107 at the helm of his team for two more seasons (three consecutive seasons in total) \u2013 a record of sorts considering Gil's trigger-happy nature when it came to gaffers.\n\n==== 1996\u201397: Champions League participation ====\nDuring the 1996 summer transfer window, the squad upgrade was in order ahead of the 1996\u201397 season that saw Atl\u00e9tico compete in the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in addition to [[1996\u201397 La Liga|defending the La Liga title]].\n\nAs replacement for aging Luboslav Penev who was impressive during the double title season despite simultaneously recovering and also as general statement of intent for the coming season, Atl\u00e9tico was in the market for a marquee forward. Anti\u0107 wanted to bring in promising 19-year-old Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] from [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and pushed hard within the club hierarchy for that to be done.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/video/video.php?nav_category=899&nav_id=353706 |title=Poligraf Plus, B92, |date= 3 April 2009 |publisher=B92.net |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> However, he ultimately got overruled by higher instances and Ronaldo signed with Barcelona about a month later. Instead, Atl\u00e9tico acquired 23-year-old Argentine striker [[Juan Esn\u00e1ider]] from Real Madrid. Another big acquisition was 24-year-old Czech defensive midfielder [[Radek Bejbl]] from [[SK Slavia Prague|Slavia Prague]], who was coming off a great showing at [[UEFA Euro 1996]] where Czechs finished runners-up. The arrival of Bejbl meant that 30-year-old Vizca\u00edno lost his starting spot in defensive midfield.\n\nSimultaneously playing on two difficult fronts proved to be much more demanding and the team quickly started lagging behind Real and Barcelona in La Liga, while in the Champions League they progressed to the quarter-finals on top of the group featuring [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] and [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. In the second part of league campaign Atl\u00e9tico somewhat steadied its form, but was unable to make up the minus from early part of the season. In Champions League, the quarter-final clash against [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] turned into an epic battle with tensions often spilling outside the pitch like when Jes\u00fas Gil publicly referred to Ajax as \"FC Congo\" due to the large number of black players of African and Surinamese origin on their team. Atl\u00e9tico achieved a great 1\u20131 result away as Esn\u00e1ider scored a header after fine work from Delf\u00ed Geli on the right.<ref>{{YouTube|quYhF_snPMc|Ajax-Atetico Esnaider goal}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> The return leg in Madrid was a tense affair that saw ''los Colchoneros'' go up through Kiko in the first half before Overmars equalized just after halftime. With the score tied at one a piece and the match heading into extra-time, Anti\u0107 decided to put Biagini on instead of Esn\u00e1ider who was not pleased about the substitution and got into a vicious shouting match with the coach as he exited the pitch.<ref>{{YouTube|u8y1YIpQiuM|Esn\u00e1ider-Anti\u0107 verbal duel}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> Ten minutes into the extra period, Ajax's Portuguese forward [[Daniel da Cruz Carvalho|Dani]] scored on a beautiful effort for 1\u20132,<ref>{{YouTube|DHbzT9s1ig0|Dani scores for 1\u20132}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> which meant that due to away-goals, Atl\u00e9tico would now have to score twice more to go through. Within five minutes they got a penalty, which Panti\u0107 converted, but couldn't manage one more goal despite attacking in waves for the remaining fifteen minutes. Due to Atl\u00e9tico's all out attack, Ajax even scored a third goal on the quick counter-attack through [[Tijani Babangida]].\n\n==== 1997\u201398: Heavy spending ====\nAhead of the [[1997\u201398 La Liga|1997\u201398 season]], Gil invested heavily into the team, bringing 24-year-old Italian superstar [[Christian Vieri]] fresh from winning the [[Serie A]] title with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. He also bought crafty 25-year-old Brazilian [[Juninho Paulista|Juninho]] from [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]12&nbsp;million. In order to somewhat offset the costs, inspirational midfielder Diego Simeone was sold to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]]. Naturally the expectations were high, with spotlight especially focused on expensive new signings. Though both struggled with injuries causing them to miss significant chunk of the season, Vieri still managed to produce excellent form when fit to play with 24 goals in 24 league appearances, while Juninho struggled to make similar impact with only 6 goals in 23 league appearances.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=728936&sec=england&root=england&cc=5901 Juninho: Samba star]; ESPN Soccernet, 22 January 2010</ref> When Atletico started sputtering in La Liga, the rumblings about Anti\u0107's possible dismissal were heard for the first time. When Atl\u00e9tico got eliminated by [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] at the semi-final stage of [[1997\u201398 UEFA Cup]], Gil launched into an obscenity-laced tirade against Spanish television for reporting he has lined up an Italian coach to replace Anti\u0107.\n\nIn the end, that is exactly what happened as he was let go at season's end during the summer of 1998 to make way for [[Arrigo Sacchi]].\n\n===Return to Atl\u00e9tico===\nAnti\u0107, however, would not be away from Atl\u00e9tico for long, as Sacchi got sacked midway through 1998\u201399 season after matchday 22, and following a five-match stint of caretaker coach [[Carlos S\u00e1nchez Aguiar]], the Serb returned for a second spell that lasted from matchday 28 until the end of the season (11 league matches). With Atl\u00e9tico clinging to lowly 13th spot in league standings when Anti\u0107 returned, the repeat of league success proved elusive as the team recorded three wins, four losses and four draws under his command to finish the season in the same 13th place. Anti\u0107, however, managed to inspire the team all the way to [[1999 Copa del Rey Final|1999 Copa del Rey final]] at the freshly opened [[Estadio Ol\u00edmpico de Sevilla|La Cartuja Stadium]] in [[Seville]], where they lost heavily to [[Claudio Ranieri]]'s Valencia, 0\u20133.\n\nAnti\u0107 was again let go at season's end, and eventually replaced with Ranieri.\n\n===Third time at Atl\u00e9tico===\nAnti\u0107's third stint at the club, which came during the second part of [[1999\u20132000 La Liga|1999\u20132000 season]] (started in February 2000) turned out to be the most difficult. Following Ranieri's dismissal after matchday 26 with the club in administration due to accumulated debts, Anti\u0107 took over a squad that was already in a tailspin, sitting in 17th league spot barely hovering above relegation zone.\n\nAnti\u0107's third arrival to the club ahead of matchday 27 did little to change matters as Atl\u00e9tico lost on his return, falling back into the relegation zone and never coming out of it until the end of the season. Despite the goalscoring exploits of [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]], they were eliminated from [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup]] at the eight-final stage by [[RC Lens|Lens]], but [[1999\u20132000 La Liga|relegation from La Liga]] several months later came as the most painful blow of all. Anti\u0107 was terminated after matchday 37 after Atl\u00e9tico was already mathematically relegated with one league match left in the season; for the final match, the team was coached by [[Fernando Zambrano]].\n\nMaking the Copa del Rey final for the second consecutive season came as one bright spot in an otherwise disastrous season, but even that was not to be as they were beaten to the trophy by Espanyol.\n\n===Return to Real Oviedo===\nAnti\u0107 returned to Real Oviedo in the summer of 2000. His team suffered their first relegation for 13 years, and he was sacked on 6 July 2001.<ref>{{cite news |title=El Oviedo despide a Antic |url=https://as.com/futbol/2001/07/06/mas_futbol/994370402_850215.html |accessdate=6 April 2020 |work=Diario AS |date=6 July 2001}}</ref>\n\n===Barcelona===\nAfter taking a year and a half long break from coaching, Anti\u0107 joined Barcelona in late January 2003 on initiative by club president [[Joan Gaspart]] to take over from recently sacked [[Louis van Gaal]]. Caretaker head coach [[Antonio de la Cruz]] took temporary charge of team affairs until Anti\u0107 took the reins with the team occupying the 15th spot in the Liga standings with only 23 points from 20 league matches (six wins, five draws and nine losses), but well placed in the Champions League [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League second group stage|second phase]] with two wins from as many matches. The club's league position was so weak that mere top-flight survival was put forth as Anti\u0107's immediate goal. On the other hand, in Champions League, the expectations were substantial. Some press outlets reported that his six-month \u20ac600,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2003/02/02/srpski/S03020103.shtml |title=Barselona \u0107e upoznati novog Anti\u0107a!, '&#39;Glas javnosti'&#39; |date= 2 February 2003 |publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> contract with ''Bar\u00e7a'' was incentive based, stipulating automatic one-year extension at the end of the season if the club qualifies for the following season's Champions League based on the domestic league finish (top-four).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2003/02/01/srpski/S03013101.shtml |title=Barselona izabrala Radomira Anti\u0107a!, '&#39;Glas javnosti'&#39;|date= 1 February 2003 |publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAnti\u0107 immediately brought in [[Juan Pablo Sor\u00edn]] from Lazio.

With Partizan, he won the national Championship in 1976.\n\nIn the summer of 1976, Anti\u0107 signed for [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]] in Turkey. He spent two seasons in [[Istanbul]] before moving to the Spanish [[La Liga]], where he played for [[Real Zaragoza]].\n\nIn 1980, Anti\u0107 moved on to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], a team in England's [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] (which was then the second tier). Known in England as \"Raddy\", he helped Luton to the Second Division title in 1982, and stayed with the club for two seasons in the [[Football League First Division|top division]] before leaving in 1984. At the end of the [[1982\u201383 Football League|1982\u201383 season]], he played a key role in saving Luton from relegation, scoring a winning goal four minutes from time in the final League match of the season, away against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. City, the home team, were themselves relegated as a result. At full-time, Luton manager [[David Pleat]] ran across the pitch, hopping and waving his arms wildly in celebration.<ref>{{cite web|author=mattyredman |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyAUkaC6nsI |title=Manchester City vs. Luton Town, May 1983 |publisher=Uk.youtube.com |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlready in his 30s when he arrived at Luton, Anti\u0107 already looked to coaching as a career option once his playing days are finished. While an active player in England, he enrolled in and completed the coaching college in [[Belgrade]], Vi\u0161a trenerska \u0161kola. In that regard, he often cites Pleat as an influence on his later coaching style.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130724055810/http://www.kurir-info.rs/moj-ucitelj-dejvid-plit-clanak-14439 Moj u\u010ditelj Dejvid Plit], ''Kurir'', 16 November 2009</ref>\n\nAfter helping save Luton's First Division status, Anti\u0107 spent [[1983\u201384 in English football|one more season]] at [[Kenilworth Road]] before retiring at age 36.\n\nAnti\u0107 made one appearance for the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia national team]], appearing as a substitute in the 80th minute for injured [[Franjo Vladi\u0107]] (who himself came on as a sub for [[Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 Pi\u017eon]] some 18 minutes prior) in a friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 26 September 1973 in Belgrade.\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Early career===\nAfter finishing his playing career at age 36, Anti\u0107 started a career in coaching as an assistant with Partizan (1985\u201387), working under head coach [[Nenad Bjekovi\u0107]]. Partizan won the [[1985\u201386 Yugoslav First League|1985\u201386 league]] title amid a match-fixing controversy. They also won the [[1986\u201387 Yugoslav First League|1986\u201387 league]].\n\nIn early July 1987, [[Fahrudin Jusufi]] was brought in as the new head coach and initially Anti\u0107 continued his assistant role. For the pre-season training ahead of the 1987\u201388 season, the team went abroad where Jusufi and Anti\u0107 got into a row over player personnel issues that resulted in Anti\u0107 being essentially demoted to the position of Partizan under-16 youth team (cadet squad) coach.\n\n===Real Zaragoza===\nAnti\u0107's first head coaching position was with Real Zaragoza. In addition to formerly playing for the club, his appointment owed a lot to being recommended for the job by countryman [[Vujadin Bo\u0161kov]], who successfully led Italian side [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] at the time, but still enjoyed a lot of clout in Spain having led Zaragoza (coached Anti\u0107 there for two years) and other La Liga clubs during the late 1970s and early '80s.\n\nThe squad was a fairly modest one without any really big names; the most notable players being the aging Spanish international midfielder [[Juan Antonio Se\u00f1or|Juan Se\u00f1or]] and forward [[Miguel Pardeza]], who came up through [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]'s youth system as part of ''[[La Quinta del Buitre]]'' generation. The club also had some young assets: a pair of 22-year-olds [[Francisco Villarroya]] and [[Juan Vizca\u00edno]] who were well on their way to becoming future Spanish internationals as well as eccentric Paraguayan goalie [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Chilavert]] who came to the club from Argentina's [[Club Atl\u00e9tico San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] the same summer Anti\u0107 did. Anti\u0107's made his La Liga coaching debut on 4 September 1988 against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], a 0\u20130 draw. The initial period was rough, with the club hovering in and around relegation zone, followed by a period of slight improvement, but still stuck in the lower half of the table. The sudden and somewhat unexpected breakthrough came during last eight league matches of the season as Anti\u0107's Zaragoza started posting win after win in a rapid climb up the table, finishing the [[1988\u201389 La Liga|season]] in fifth place, thus qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].\n\nHe ended up spending two full seasons (1988\u20131990) managing a club he also turned out for as a player.\n\n===Real Madrid===\nReal Madrid came calling in late March 1991 and Anti\u0107 took over from club legend [[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]] following ''los Merengues''' elimination from the [[1990\u201391 European Cup|European Cup]] by [[Oleg Romantsev]]'s [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] at the quarter-final stage. Di St\u00e9fano had been on thin ice since the 1\u20130 league defeat in mid-March away to mid-table [[CD Logro\u00f1\u00e9s|Logro\u00f1\u00e9s]] (Real Madrid's third league loss in a row), but it was the 1\u20133 return leg quarter-final European Cup home loss against the Russians at the [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]] on 20 March 1991 that served as the last straw that prompted Di St\u00e9fano's removal. In La Liga, at the time, after 26 matches, the club occupied the seventh position in the standings.\n\nUsed to winning major trophies, the royal club was in turmoil with Anti\u0107 coming in as their third head coach of the [[1990\u201391 Real Madrid C.F. season|season]] after [[John Toshack]] and Di St\u00e9fano.\n\n==== 1990\u201391: Stopping the bleeding ====\nWith [[Emilio Butrague\u00f1o]], [[M\u00edchel (footballer)|M\u00edchel]], [[Fernando Hierro]], [[Manuel Sanch\u00eds Hontiyuelo|Manolo Sanch\u00eds]], [[Gheorghe Hagi]] and the aging [[Hugo S\u00e1nchez]] as the club's established stars, Anti\u0107's debut took place at the Bernab\u00e9u against [[Real Oviedo]] on 24 March 1991, ending in somewhat disappointing 1\u20131 draw considering Oviedo played with ten men since the 68th minute.<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18066 Real Madrid-Real Oviedo 1:1];La Liga, 24 March 1991</ref>\n\nThings would get even worse the following week with the 0\u20131 home loss to mid-table [[Real Burgos CF|Real Burgos]]<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18076 Real Madrid-Real Burgos 0:1];La Liga, 31 March 1991</ref> and downright critical the week after as Madrid was beaten 3\u20131 away at [[Luis Aragon\u00e9s]]' relegation-battling [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] by conceding two late goals,<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18085 Espanyol-Real Madrid 3:1];La Liga, 7 April 1991</ref> dropping ''los Merengues'' to the 10th spot in La Liga. After only three league matches, Anti\u0107 was feeling the full pressure of the Real hotseat.\n\nThings finally started clicking with the 4\u20130 home win versus Valencia on 14 April, that started a five-match winning streak. The 3\u20133 away draw at Osasuna ended the streak, but the team quickly put together another 3-match winning run to end the season. On 8 June, the season ended on a high note with a 1\u20130 home win against champions-elect [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in ''[[El Cl\u00e1sico]]''. In total, Anti\u0107 led Real in the final 12 league matches (8 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses) of the [[1990\u201391 La Liga|1990\u201391 season]], improving Real's standing to third in the league, and qualifying for the UEFA Cup.\nHe died in 2020\n\n==== 1991\u201392: Success and sacking ====\nDuring the 1991 summer transfer window, Anti\u0107 brought in [[Robert Prosine\u010dki]], prominent member of the [[Red Star Belgrade]]'s [[1990\u201391 European Cup|1991]] European Cup-winning side, as well as promising 21-year-old [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Lu\u00eds Enrique]] from [[Sporting de Gij\u00f3n]].\n\nAnti\u0107's team began the season in furious fashion with five straight [[1991\u201392 La Liga|league]] wins, grabbing the La Liga top spot ahead of ''El Cl\u00e1sico'' on 19 October 1991. Playing [[Johan Cruyff]]'s ''Bar\u00e7a'' \"dream team\" at home at the Bernab\u00e9u, Real went ahead via a Prosine\u010dki first half free-kick, one shining moment in the highly rated signing's otherwise disastrous season, before [[Ronald Koeman]] equalized courtesy of a second half penalty shot.<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18066 Real Madrid-FC Barcelona 1:1];La Liga, 19 October 1991</ref> Real's winning streak in the league had thus been broken, however, with the very next league match, a 3\u20130 home win over Logro\u00f1\u00e9s,<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18265 Real Madrid-CD Logro\u00f1\u00e9s 3:0];La Liga, 27 October 1991</ref> ''los Merengues'' commenced another winning streak, this time recording seven straight league wins as they tangibly separated themselves from the pack of chasers atop the La Liga standings.\n\nOne player especially excelled under Anti\u0107: 23-year-old Hierro, normally a defender, was moved up further into midfield and responded by scoring in numbers, eventually ending the season on 21 league goals, the greatest single-season offensive output of his career. The second winning streak in the league ended with a draw away at Zaragoza in mid-December 1991.<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18339 Real Zaragoza-Real Madrid 1:1];La Liga, 15 December 1991</ref> This was followed by a slight dip in form as Real recorded another draw the following week at home against Oviedo, before experiencing its first league loss of the season away at cross-town rivals [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], though still retaining top league spot by a comfortable margin. During this three-match period without a league win, club president [[Ram\u00f3n Mendoza]] opted to bring [[Leo Beenhakker]] into the organization in a vaguely defined sporting director role, though Anti\u0107 remained the team's head coach. The three-match winless streak ended with an emphatic 5\u20132 win at home versus [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]], but was followed by the second league loss of the season when [[Guus Hiddink]]'s Valencia managed to overturn Real's 0\u20131 lead with two late goals and record a famous home win over the league leaders.<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18370 Valencia CF-Real Madrid 2:1];La Liga, 18 January 1992</ref> Although Anti\u0107's team quickly got back on winning track with a 2\u20131 home win against [[CD Tenerife|Tenerife]] on 26 January 1992,<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/p.php?id=18388 Real Madrid-CD Tenerife 2:1];La Liga, 26 January 1992</ref> the 43-year-old coach was terminated. At the time of Anti\u0107's termination, 19 league matches into the season, Madrid was holding the top spot in La Liga by a seven-point margin and was also smoothly through to the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] quarter-finals with previous wins over [[\u0160K Slovan Bratislava|Slovan Bratislava]], [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax]].\n\nLed by Beenhakker, Real Madrid squandered its seven-point lead, losing the title to bitter rivals Barcelona on the last matchday of the season. Madrid was also eliminated from UEFA Cup by [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in the semi-finals.\n\n===Real Oviedo===\nAnti\u0107 was hired to coach Real Oviedo when the club's brass fired previous longtime coach [[Javier Irureta]] after matchday 19 of the [[1992\u201393 La Liga|1992\u201393 season]] with the club dangerously close to the relegation zone in 16th spot and a one match stint of caretaker Julio Marigil Mar\u00edn. Anti\u0107 took over from matchday 21 and completed the season with the club, managing to avoid relegation by finishing two spots above the relegation zone. He remained at the club for two additional seasons.\n\nDuring the 1993 summer transfer window, Anti\u0107 signed [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]] from Partizan, whose midfield presence greatly helped the squad. The expectations at Oviedo were obviously much more modest compared to Real Madrid, with mere top league survival being the main goal. It was therefore no small surprise that a very low budget Anti\u0107-led Oviedo team finished the [[1993\u201394 La Liga|1993\u201394]] league season in ninth place.\n\nAnti\u0107's most notable signing at Oviedo came before the start of [[1994\u201395 La Liga|1994\u201395 season]] when he brought often injured Robert Prosine\u010dki from Real Madrid, thus reuniting with a player he first signed to Madrid. Oviedo again finished the La Liga season in respectable ninth position, missing a European spot by mere points.\n\n===Atl\u00e9tico Madrid===\nAnti\u0107's greatest coaching successes are tied to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, a club he ended up coaching in three separate stints.\n\nHis achievements with transforming Oviedo's fortunes led to offers from bigger Spanish clubs. Despite having been in final stages of the negotiations with Valencia with even a pre-contract signed, Anti\u0107 opted to take the offer by Atl\u00e9tico club president [[Jes\u00fas Gil]], leading to the Serb's first engagement with the club that ended up lasting three seasons (1995\u201398). The squad he took over during summer 1995 was a talented one featuring the quality core of [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Caminero]], [[Kiko Narv\u00e1ez]] and [[Diego Simeone]], but with a reputation of continuous underachievement. In the [[1994\u201395 La Liga|season prior to his arrival]], the club finished one point above relegation zone by earning a 2\u20132 draw versus [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] on the last matchday of the season.\n\n==== 1995\u201396: Double title ====\nOut of the 35-player squad he inherited, Anti\u0107 quickly identified 20 players he was counting on for the following season before setting about adding five to six more players during the transfer window. That meant the end of Atl\u00e9tico days for a slew of players including aging goalie [[Abel Resino]], embattled Colombian striker [[Adolfo Valencia]], Brazilian [[Iv\u00e1n Rocha]], Polish striker [[Roman Kosecki]] and Russian winger [[Igor Dobrovolski]], among others.\n\nFirst on Anti\u0107's wish list was defender [[Viktor Onopko]] whom he coached at Real Oviedo: Atl\u00e9tico and the player agreed terms, however, Oviedo management were not satisfied and the case ended up before a [[FIFA]] arbitration commission, which ruled in Oviedo's favour. Anti\u0107 then tried to sign 19-year-old [[Fernando Morientes]] from [[Albacete Balompi\u00e9|Albacete]], but the talented striker instead signed with Zaragoza.<ref>{{cite web|last=Antic |first=Radomir |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4167681.stm |title=Morientes to cast off Ronaldo shadow |publisher=BBC News  |date=12 January 2005 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> Out of the players Anti\u0107 did manage to sign, the biggest find turned out to be unheralded winger [[Milinko Panti\u0107]], whom Anti\u0107 plucked from obscurity in [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]] for very little money. The move initially raised eyebrows with many questioning the usefulness of a complete unknown who is about to turn 29 years of age, however over the coming season, Panti\u0107 would prove himself to be the missing piece this team needed with key goals and assists. Another key acquisition was 29-year-old Bulgarian tall centre forward [[Luboslav Penev]], brought in from Valencia despite questions about his health due to a recent bout with [[testicular cancer]]. Other incoming transfers included goalkeeper [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Molina]] and central defender [[Santiago Denia|Santi Denia]] from Albacete, midfielder [[Roberto Fresnedoso]] from Espanyol and young Argentine striker [[Leonardo Biagini|Leo Biagini]] from [[Newell's Old Boys]], who starred at the [[1995 FIFA World Youth Championship]].\n\nPlaying in the domestic league that was just expanded from 20 to 22 teams along with a new points system with three points awarded for a win, under Anti\u0107's command, the Atl\u00e9tico squad featuring Molina in goal, [[Delf\u00ed Geli]] and Santi Denia in central defence, [[Roberto Soloz\u00e1bal]] and [[Antonio Mu\u00f1oz G\u00f3mez|Toni]] on right and left back respectively, [[Juan Vizca\u00edno]] (whom Anti\u0107 previously coached at Zaragoza) and Caminero in centre midfield, Simeone and Panti\u0107 on right and left wing respectively, and finally Penev and Kiko upfront gelled together masterfully en route to a historic [[La Liga]]/[[Copa del Rey]] double in the [[1995\u201396 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid season|1995\u201396 season]]. Other players that didn't start as often, but nevertheless contributed significantly throughout the season were Fresnedoso, [[Juan Manuel L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Juan Manuel L\u00f3pez]], Biagini, [[Francisco Javier Mori|Pirri Mori]], etc.\n\nAnti\u0107's Atl\u00e9tico began the league campaign in furious fashion with four impressive wins. Once they took the top league spot after week 2, ''los Colchoneros'' gave it up only once (after the week 5 scoreless draw at Sevilla), before reclaiming it the very next week and impressively continuing on top until the end with Penev scoring 16 league goals, Simeone 12, Kiko 11, Panti\u0107 10, and Caminero 9. Atl\u00e9tico also featured a stingy defence that allowed 32 goals \u2013 less than any other team in the league. Still, the title wasn't secure until the very last match, as Valencia stayed in close pursuit until the end. Going into the last round of matches on Saturday 25 May 1996, Atl\u00e9tico was on 84 points with Alabacete to play at home while Valencia had 82 and Celta away. The victory was never in doubt as Simeone and Kiko scored in the first half sparking off jubilant scenes at [[Vicente Calder\u00f3n Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Zarateh64 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiJ-tXfJyzQ |title=Atl\u00e9tico Madrid-Albacete |date= 25 May 1996 |work=Youtube |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nMonth and a half earlier Anti\u0107 already claimed his first trophy of the season, beating [[Johan Cruyff]]'s Bar\u00e7a in the [[Copa del Rey]] [[1996 Copa del Rey Final|final]] in [[Zaragoza]] after extra time on a goal by Panti\u0107.\n\nWinning the double endeared Anti\u0107 to Atl\u00e9tico faithful and more importantly to club's controversial president [[Jes\u00fas Gil]]. Notorious for quickly and impulsively going through coaches, Gil kept Anti\u0107 at the helm of his team for two more seasons (three consecutive seasons in total) \u2013 a record of sorts considering Gil's trigger-happy nature when it came to gaffers.\n\n==== 1996\u201397: Champions League participation ====\nDuring the 1996 summer transfer window, the squad upgrade was in order ahead of the 1996\u201397 season that saw Atl\u00e9tico compete in the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in addition to [[1996\u201397 La Liga|defending the La Liga title]].\n\nAs replacement for aging Luboslav Penev who was impressive during the double title season despite simultaneously recovering and also as general statement of intent for the coming season, Atl\u00e9tico was in the market for a marquee forward. Anti\u0107 wanted to bring in promising 19-year-old Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] from [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and pushed hard within the club hierarchy for that to be done.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/video/video.php?nav_category=899&nav_id=353706 |title=Poligraf Plus, B92, |date= 3 April 2009 |publisher=B92.net |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> However, he ultimately got overruled by higher instances and Ronaldo signed with Barcelona about a month later. Instead, Atl\u00e9tico acquired 23-year-old Argentine striker [[Juan Esn\u00e1ider]] from Real Madrid. Another big acquisition was 24-year-old Czech defensive midfielder [[Radek Bejbl]] from [[SK Slavia Prague|Slavia Prague]], who was coming off a great showing at [[UEFA Euro 1996]] where Czechs finished runners-up. The arrival of Bejbl meant that 30-year-old Vizca\u00edno lost his starting spot in defensive midfield.\n\nSimultaneously playing on two difficult fronts proved to be much more demanding and the team quickly started lagging behind Real and Barcelona in La Liga, while in the Champions League they progressed to the quarter-finals on top of the group featuring [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] and [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. In the second part of league campaign Atl\u00e9tico somewhat steadied its form, but was unable to make up the minus from early part of the season. In Champions League, the quarter-final clash against [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] turned into an epic battle with tensions often spilling outside the pitch like when Jes\u00fas Gil publicly referred to Ajax as \"FC Congo\" due to the large number of black players of African and Surinamese origin on their team. Atl\u00e9tico achieved a great 1\u20131 result away as Esn\u00e1ider scored a header after fine work from Delf\u00ed Geli on the right.<ref>{{YouTube|quYhF_snPMc|Ajax-Atetico Esnaider goal}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> The return leg in Madrid was a tense affair that saw ''los Colchoneros'' go up through Kiko in the first half before Overmars equalized just after halftime. With the score tied at one a piece and the match heading into extra-time, Anti\u0107 decided to put Biagini on instead of Esn\u00e1ider who was not pleased about the substitution and got into a vicious shouting match with the coach as he exited the pitch.<ref>{{YouTube|u8y1YIpQiuM|Esn\u00e1ider-Anti\u0107 verbal duel}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> Ten minutes into the extra period, Ajax's Portuguese forward [[Daniel da Cruz Carvalho|Dani]] scored on a beautiful effort for 1\u20132,<ref>{{YouTube|DHbzT9s1ig0|Dani scores for 1\u20132}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> which meant that due to away-goals, Atl\u00e9tico would now have to score twice more to go through. Within five minutes they got a penalty, which Panti\u0107 converted, but couldn't manage one more goal despite attacking in waves for the remaining fifteen minutes. Due to Atl\u00e9tico's all out attack, Ajax even scored a third goal on the quick counter-attack through [[Tijani Babangida]].\n\n==== 1997\u201398: Heavy spending ====\nAhead of the [[1997\u201398 La Liga|1997\u201398 season]], Gil invested heavily into the team, bringing 24-year-old Italian superstar [[Christian Vieri]] fresh from winning the [[Serie A]] title with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. He also bought crafty 25-year-old Brazilian [[Juninho Paulista|Juninho]] from [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]12&nbsp;million. In order to somewhat offset the costs, inspirational midfielder Diego Simeone was sold to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]]. Naturally the expectations were high, with spotlight especially focused on expensive new signings. Though both struggled with injuries causing them to miss significant chunk of the season, Vieri still managed to produce excellent form when fit to play with 24 goals in 24 league appearances, while Juninho struggled to make similar impact with only 6 goals in 23 league appearances.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=728936&sec=england&root=england&cc=5901 Juninho: Samba star]; ESPN Soccernet, 22 January 2010</ref> When Atletico started sputtering in La Liga, the rumblings about Anti\u0107's possible dismissal were heard for the first time. When Atl\u00e9tico got eliminated by [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] at the semi-final stage of [[1997\u201398 UEFA Cup]], Gil launched into an obscenity-laced tirade against Spanish television for reporting he has lined up an Italian coach to replace Anti\u0107.\n\nIn the end, that is exactly what happened as he was let go at season's end during the summer of 1998 to make way for [[Arrigo Sacchi]].\n\n===Return to Atl\u00e9tico===\nAnti\u0107, however, would not be away from Atl\u00e9tico for long, as Sacchi got sacked midway through 1998\u201399 season after matchday 22, and following a five-match stint of caretaker coach [[Carlos S\u00e1nchez Aguiar]], the Serb returned for a second spell that lasted from matchday 28 until the end of the season (11 league matches). With Atl\u00e9tico clinging to lowly 13th spot in league standings when Anti\u0107 returned, the repeat of league success proved elusive as the team recorded three wins, four losses and four draws under his command to finish the season in the same 13th place. Anti\u0107, however, managed to inspire the team all the way to [[1999 Copa del Rey Final|1999 Copa del Rey final]] at the freshly opened [[Estadio Ol\u00edmpico de Sevilla|La Cartuja Stadium]] in [[Seville]], where they lost heavily to [[Claudio Ranieri]]'s Valencia, 0\u20133.\n\nAnti\u0107 was again let go at season's end, and eventually replaced with Ranieri.\n\n===Third time at Atl\u00e9tico===\nAnti\u0107's third stint at the club, which came during the second part of [[1999\u20132000 La Liga|1999\u20132000 season]] (started in February 2000) turned out to be the most difficult. Following Ranieri's dismissal after matchday 26 with the club in administration due to accumulated debts, Anti\u0107 took over a squad that was already in a tailspin, sitting in 17th league spot barely hovering above relegation zone.\n\nAnti\u0107's third arrival to the club ahead of matchday 27 did little to change matters as Atl\u00e9tico lost on his return, falling back into the relegation zone and never coming out of it until the end of the season. Despite the goalscoring exploits of [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]], they were eliminated from [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup]] at the eight-final stage by [[RC Lens|Lens]], but [[1999\u20132000 La Liga|relegation from La Liga]] several months later came as the most painful blow of all. Anti\u0107 was terminated after matchday 37 after Atl\u00e9tico was already mathematically relegated with one league match left in the season; for the final match, the team was coached by [[Fernando Zambrano]].\n\nMaking the Copa del Rey final for the second consecutive season came as one bright spot in an otherwise disastrous season, but even that was not to be as they were beaten to the trophy by Espanyol.\n\n===Return to Real Oviedo===\nAnti\u0107 returned to Real Oviedo in the summer of 2000. His team suffered their first relegation for 13 years, and he was sacked on 6 July 2001.<ref>{{cite news |title=El Oviedo despide a Antic |url=https://as.com/futbol/2001/07/06/mas_futbol/994370402_850215.html |accessdate=6 April 2020 |work=Diario AS |date=6 July 2001}}</ref>\n\n===Barcelona===\nAfter taking a year and a half long break from coaching, Anti\u0107 joined Barcelona in late January 2003 on initiative by club president [[Joan Gaspart]] to take over from recently sacked [[Louis van Gaal]]. Caretaker head coach [[Antonio de la Cruz]] took temporary charge of team affairs until Anti\u0107 took the reins with the team occupying the 15th spot in the Liga standings with only 23 points from 20 league matches (six wins, five draws and nine losses), but well placed in the Champions League [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League second group stage|second phase]] with two wins from as many matches. The club's league position was so weak that mere top-flight survival was put forth as Anti\u0107's immediate goal. On the other hand, in Champions League, the expectations were substantial. Some press outlets reported that his six-month \u20ac600,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2003/02/02/srpski/S03020103.shtml |title=Barselona \u0107e upoznati novog Anti\u0107a!, '&#39;Glas javnosti'&#39; |date= 2 February 2003 |publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref> contract with ''Bar\u00e7a'' was incentive based, stipulating automatic one-year extension at the end of the season if the club qualifies for the following season's Champions League based on the domestic league finish (top-four).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2003/02/01/srpski/S03013101.shtml |title=Barselona izabrala Radomira Anti\u0107a!, '&#39;Glas javnosti'&#39;|date= 1 February 2003 |publisher=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAnti\u0107 immediately brought in [[Juan Pablo Sor\u00edn]] from Lazio. He also started giving regular first team appearances to young goalkeeper [[V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s]] as well as throwing another youngster, [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]], into the first team. Additionally, Anti\u0107 moved [[Xavi]] further up the field, just behind the line of forwards thus freeing him up from the defensive duties he had under Van Gaal, which allowed the diminutive midfielder to fully showcase his creativity.<ref>[http://www.kurir-info.rs/sport/cavi-antic-me-napravio-68287.php Jedan od najboljih fudbalera dana\u0161njice \u0106avi u autobiografskom romanu odao priznanje biv\u0161em srpskom selektoru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109002624/http://www.kurir-info.rs/sport/cavi-antic-me-napravio-68287.php |date=9 January 2011 }};''Kurir'', 6 January 2010</ref> \n\nAnti\u0107 managed to stabilize the squad and lead it to sixth-place Liga finish, ensuring UEFA Cup qualification.

In 1899 they agreed that a new and permanent synagogue should be built, to search for the right field, Emmanuel Raphael, a successful Jewish merchant who was also a member of the board of the [[The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank]] found a place he thought was suitable for the construction of the new synagogue on Kennedy Street. Despite this, the synagogue was not built there because it was not possible to collect enough money to buy the land, and also because of differences of opinion with the rest of the community regarding how much of the land would be devoted to the construction of the synagogue. Finally, it was decided to build a synagogue on [[Robinson Road, Hong Kong|Robinson Road]] at a cost of $26,000, paid by the [[Sassoon family]]. The cornerstone was laid by Avraham Haim Yaakov Rahamim and Sasson & Co. on 7 August 1901. The synagogue called \"Ohel Leah\" Memory mother of founder Yakov Eliyahu David Sassoon, who died in May 1878. Construction of the synagogue was completed in 1902.<ref name=\"ohel\">{{cite book |title=[[:he:\u05e4\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05dd]] |pages=98-99}}</ref><ref name=\"jhk\">{{cite book |title=\u05e1\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5-\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8\u05e3 \u05ea\u05e9\u05e1\"\u05d5 |pages=333-350}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the synagogue's board of governors discussed the possibility of demolishing the synagogue and building it elsewhere. The land on which the synagogue was built cost much more than the price at which it was purchased, and it seemed to them that it would be better to sell the land and to receive a new synagogue. The idea of demolishing the synagogue was dropped after one of the women who was present insisted that a synagogue should not be destroyed. However, the idea of selling the land did not come out of the chapter, and the land was finally sold, but only in half. The synagogue area remained intact, the synagogue was renovated, and the second area was built with two very tall residential buildings known as Robinson one. The lower five floors are owned by the Jewish community, including a kosher restaurant, pool, library and other community needs.<ref name=\"ohel\"/>\n\nThe synagogue was built by Iraqi merchants, over the years, however, the synagogue underwent many vicissitudes, and today the style of the prayer is Sephardic with an Israeli accent. Almost all prayers are held in the synagogue, except for [[Mincha]] and Arabic prayers on weekdays (not including Sundays and holidays).<ref name=\"ohel\"/>\n\n===Shuva Israel===\n \nThe Shuva Israel community ({{lang-he-n|\u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc}}) located on the Connaught road in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] was established in October 1991 by the Darwish family following differences of opinion between David Darwish, then head of the Jewish Community Department, and other Jewish officials in Hong Kong. \"Shuva Israel\" was intended for a more ultra-Orthodox public.<ref name=\"jhk\"/>\n\nThe first rabbi of the community was Rabbi David Avraham. The community also operates kollel students and a kosher restaurant. The community had an ultra-Orthodox school, which was closed in 2006, when the founding family moved to Israel.<ref name=\"jhk\"/>\n\n===Chabad Hong Kong and Kowloon===\n\nThe [[Chabad]] of Hong Kong was established in the 1980s by Rabbi Mordechai Avtzon and his wife Goldie. Chabad House Hong Kong was the first in the [[Far East]]. In addition, he founded the \"Lubavitch of the Far East\" (LIFE Lubavitch of the Far East). In 2009, another Chabad house was established in the [[Kowloon Peninsula]], led by Rabbi Yisrael Liberman.\n\n===Kehilat Zion===\n\nKehilat Zion ({{lang-he-n|\u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05e6\u05d9\u05d5\u05df}}) located in [[Kowloon]] was established in 1995 by Rabbi Shlomo Katsin. At first Rabbi Zion Mizrachi was sent to serve as rabbi of the community, named after him. The community is mainly used by local businessmen and those who are invited to visit their businesses. Rabbi Meoded serves as the chief rabbi of the Sephardic community in Hong Kong and also serves as the Chief Rabbi of Hong Kong, where there is a synagogue and a kosher restaurant serving kosher food and Shabbat meals.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Judaism]]\n*[[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]]\n*[[History of the Jews in China]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.jcc.org.hk/ Jewish community center (JCC) in Hong Kong website]\n* [http://www.ohelleah.org/ Ohel Leah Synagogue website]\n* [http://www.shuva-israel.com/ Shuva Israel community website] (in Hebrew)\n* [http://www.chabadhongkong.org/ Chabad Hong Kong website]\n* [http://kehilat-zion.org/index_he.php Kiryat Zion website] (in Hebrew)\n* [https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4269702,00.html \u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d1\u05d4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2 \u2013 \u05d4\u05e0\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea (more in Hong Kong - the Jews)], 2012 (in Hebrew)\n* [http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=lY2hYO6P6VPo3g%2BftVJ%2FNKUEvlQuu4s4wx7yHMeE2z%2FHdTbTtpNAZ68czjvVd94fYw%3D%3D&mode=image&href=HZF%2f1888%2f01%2f10&page=1&rtl=true \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2 \u05d5\u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (Jews in Hong Kong and China)], 1888 (in Hebrew)\n*[https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/hong-kong The Jewish Community of Hong Kong - The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot]\n*[http://www.urbanphoto.net/blog/2010/12/09/judaism-with-a-hong-kong-flavour/ Judaism With a Hong Kong Flavour] at Urbanphoto.net\n\n{{Asia in topic|History of the Jews in}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Hong Kong|Jews]]\n[[Category:History of Hong Kong|Jewish]]\n[[Category:Jewish history by city|Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Jewish Hong Kong history| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Hong Kong English|date=December 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2018}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n|group     = Jews in Hong Kong<br>{{Hebrew|\u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2}}\n|pop       = about '''2,500'''<ref>[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about/communities/HK Community in Hong Kong :: World Jewish Congress]</ref>\n|region1   = {{flag|Hong Kong SAR}}\n|pop1      = about '''2,500'''\n|languages = [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], English, [[French language|French]], [[Cantonese]]\n|religions = [[Judaism]]\n|related   = Other [[Jew]]ish groups<br />{{smaller|([[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]], [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]], etc.)}}\n}}\n{{Ethnic Hong Kong sidebar}}\n{{Demographics and Culture of Hong Kong}}\n\n[[Jews]] have been present in [[Hong Kong]] since the mid-19th century.

In 1899 they agreed that a new and permanent synagogue should be built, to search for the right field, Emmanuel Raphael, a successful Jewish merchant who was also a member of the board of the [[The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank]] found a place he thought was suitable for the construction of the new synagogue on Kennedy Street. Despite this, the synagogue was not built there because it was not possible to collect enough money to buy the land, and also because of differences of opinion with the rest of the community regarding how much of the land would be devoted to the construction of the synagogue. Finally, it was decided to build a synagogue on [[Robinson Road, Hong Kong|Robinson Road]] at a cost of $26,000, paid by the [[Sassoon family]]. The cornerstone was laid by Avraham Haim Yaakov Rahamim and Sasson & Co. on 7 August 1901. The synagogue called \"Ohel Leah\" Memory mother of founder Yakov Eliyahu David Sassoon, who died in May 1878. Construction of the synagogue was completed in 1902.<ref name=\"ohel\">{{cite book |title=[[:he:\u05e4\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05dd]] |pages=98-99}}</ref><ref name=\"jhk\">{{cite book |title=\u05e1\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5-\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8\u05e3 \u05ea\u05e9\u05e1\"\u05d5 |pages=333-350}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the synagogue's board of governors discussed the possibility of demolishing the synagogue and building it elsewhere. The land on which the synagogue was built cost much more than the price at which it was purchased, and it seemed to them that it would be better to sell the land and to receive a new synagogue. The idea of demolishing the synagogue was dropped after one of the women who was present insisted that a synagogue should not be destroyed. However, the idea of selling the land did not come out of the chapter, and the land was finally sold, but only in half. The synagogue area remained intact, the synagogue was renovated, and the second area was built with two very tall residential buildings known as Robinson one. The lower five floors are owned by the Jewish community, including a kosher restaurant, pool, library and other community needs.<ref name=\"ohel\"/>\n\nThe synagogue was built by Iraqi merchants, over the years, however, the synagogue underwent many vicissitudes, and today the style of the prayer is Sephardic with an Israeli accent. Almost all prayers are held in the synagogue, except for [[Mincha]] and Arabic prayers on weekdays (not including Sundays and holidays).<ref name=\"ohel\"/>\n\n===Shuva Israel===\n \nThe Shuva Israel community ({{lang-he-n|\u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc}}) located on the Connaught road in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] was established in October 1991 by the Darwish family following differences of opinion between David Darwish, then head of the Jewish Community Department, and other Jewish officials in Hong Kong. \"Shuva Israel\" was intended for a more ultra-Orthodox public.<ref name=\"jhk\"/>\n\nThe first rabbi of the community was Rabbi David Avraham. The community also operates kollel students and a kosher restaurant. The community had an ultra-Orthodox school, which was closed in 2006, when the founding family moved to Israel.<ref name=\"jhk\"/>\n\n===Chabad Hong Kong and Kowloon===\n\nThe [[Chabad]] of Hong Kong was established in the 1980s by Rabbi Mordechai Avtzon and his wife Goldie. Chabad House Hong Kong was the first in the [[Far East]]. In addition, he founded the \"Lubavitch of the Far East\" (LIFE Lubavitch of the Far East). In 2009, another Chabad house was established in the [[Kowloon Peninsula]], led by Rabbi Yisrael Liberman.\n\n===Kehilat Zion===\n\nKehilat Zion ({{lang-he-n|\u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05e6\u05d9\u05d5\u05df}}) located in [[Kowloon]] was established in 1995 by Rabbi Shlomo Katsin. At first Rabbi Zion Mizrachi was sent to serve as rabbi of the community, named after him. The community is mainly used by local businessmen and those who are invited to visit their businesses. Rabbi Meoded serves as the chief rabbi of the Sephardic community in Hong Kong and also serves as the Chief Rabbi of Hong Kong, where there is a synagogue and a kosher restaurant serving kosher food and Shabbat meals.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Judaism]]\n*[[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]]\n*[[History of the Jews in China]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.jcc.org.hk/ Jewish community center (JCC) in Hong Kong website]\n* [http://www.ohelleah.org/ Ohel Leah Synagogue website]\n* [http://www.shuva-israel.com/ Shuva Israel community website] (in Hebrew)\n* [http://www.chabadhongkong.org/ Chabad Hong Kong website]\n* [http://kehilat-zion.org/index_he.php Kiryat Zion website] (in Hebrew)\n* [https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4269702,00.html \u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d1\u05d4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2 \u2013 \u05d4\u05e0\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea (more in Hong Kong - the Jews)], 2012 (in Hebrew)\n* [http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=lY2hYO6P6VPo3g%2BftVJ%2FNKUEvlQuu4s4wx7yHMeE2z%2FHdTbTtpNAZ68czjvVd94fYw%3D%3D&mode=image&href=HZF%2f1888%2f01%2f10&page=1&rtl=true \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2 \u05d5\u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (Jews in Hong Kong and China)], 1888 (in Hebrew)\n*[https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/hong-kong The Jewish Community of Hong Kong - The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot]\n*[http://www.urbanphoto.net/blog/2010/12/09/judaism-with-a-hong-kong-flavour/ Judaism With a Hong Kong Flavour] at Urbanphoto.net\n\n{{Asia in topic|History of the Jews in}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Hong Kong|Jews]]\n[[Category:History of Hong Kong|Jewish]]\n[[Category:Jewish history by city|Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Jewish Hong Kong history| ]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOhel Leah Synagogue:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: ,  \u2192 ,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Hong_Kong"}
