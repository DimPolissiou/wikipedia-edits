Noa, claiming she feels bad for him, picks Daniel up and offers him \"three wishes\" for the night. They visit a restaurant owned by Noa's friend, where the two begin to realize how attracted they are to each other. Daniel uses one of his wishes to have Noa call his sister Natalie and offer her advice on how to handle starting a new school. While at a club, Noa's ex Colin tries to win her back. Her manager Lewis reveals to Daniel that Noa has a history of fooling around with strangers, and that she doesn't really love him. Daniel leaves in disgust and walks home, but discovers the next day that his family's bakery has dozens of new customers after Noa gave them a shout-out on social media. He then finds Noa waiting for him outside, saying she still owes him a third wish. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Ruin My Life\n |DirectedBy      = David Frankel\n |WrittenBy       = Dean Georgaris & [[Becky Hartman Edwards]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n |Viewers         = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

Noa, claiming she feels bad for him, picks Daniel up and offers him \"three wishes\" for the night. They visit a restaurant owned by Noa's friend, where the two begin to realize how attracted they are to each other. Daniel uses one of his wishes to have Noa call his sister Natalie and offer her advice on how to handle starting a new school. While at a club, Noa's ex Colin tries to win her back. Her manager Lewis reveals to Daniel that Noa has a history of fooling around with strangers, and that she doesn't really love him. Daniel leaves in disgust and walks home, but discovers the next day that his family's bakery has dozens of new customers after Noa gave them a shout-out on social media. He then finds Noa waiting for him outside, saying she still owes him a third wish. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Ruin My Life\n |RTitle          = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20200406abc01/|title=(#102) \"Ruin My Life\"|website=The Futon Critic|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy      = David Frankel\n |WrittenBy       = Dean Georgaris & [[Becky Hartman Edwards]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n |Viewers         = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

The office was established in 1789 by [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 2: House of Representatives|Article I, Section 2]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. The speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives, and is simultaneously the House's presiding officer, ''de facto'' leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's administrative head. Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions. Given these several roles and responsibilities, the speaker usually does not personally preside over debates. That duty is instead delegated to members of the House from the majority party.

It happened most recently in 2015 ([[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]]), when [[John Boehner]] was elected with 216 votes (as opposed to 218). Such a variation in the number of votes necessary to win a given election might arise due to vacancies, absentees, or members being present but not voting. If no candidate wins a majority of the \"votes cast for a person by name\", then the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected.<ref name=CRS-RL30857/> Multiple roll calls have been necessary only 14 times (out of 126 speakership elections) since 1789; and not since 1923 ([[68th United States Congress|68th Congress]]), when a closely divided House needed nine ballots to elect [[Frederick H.

A partisan position from early in its existence, the speakership began to gain power in legislative development under [[Henry Clay]] (1811\u20131814, 1815\u20131820, and 1823\u20131825).<ref>C. Stewart III, \"Architect or tactician? Henry Clay and the institutional development of the US House of Representatives\" [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/18148/clay.pdf?sequence=1 1998, online]</ref> In contrast to many of his predecessors, Clay participated in several debates, and used his influence to procure the passage of measures he supported\u2014for instance, the declaration of the [[War of 1812]], and various laws relating to Clay's \"[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]\" economic plan. Furthermore, when no candidate received an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] majority in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]] causing the president to be elected by the House, Speaker Clay threw his support to [[John Quincy Adams]] instead of [[Andrew Jackson]], thereby ensuring Adams' victory. Following Clay's retirement in 1825, the power of the speakership once again began to decline, despite speakership elections becoming increasingly bitter. As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] approached, several sectional factions nominated their own candidates, often making it difficult for any candidate to attain a majority. In 1855 and again in 1859, for example, the contest for speaker lasted for two months before the House achieved a result. During this time, speakers tended to have very short tenures. For example, from 1839 to 1863 there were eleven speakers, only one of whom served for more than one term. To date, [[James K. Polk]] is the only speaker of the House later elected president of the United States.\n\n[[File:JGCannon.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|[[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] (1903\u20131911) was one of the most powerful speakers.]]\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the office of speaker began to develop into a very powerful one. At the time, one of the most important sources of the speaker's power was his position as Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Rules|Committee on Rules]], which, after the reorganization of the committee system in 1880, became one of the most powerful standing committees of the House. Furthermore, several speakers became leading figures in their political parties; examples include Democrats [[Samuel J. Randall]], [[John Griffin Carlisle]], and [[Charles Frederick Crisp|Charles F. Crisp]], and Republicans [[James G. Blaine]], [[Thomas Brackett Reed]], and [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]].\n\nThe power of the speaker was greatly augmented during the tenure of the Republican [[Thomas Brackett Reed]] (1889\u20131891, 1895\u20131899). \"Czar Reed\", as he was called by his opponents,<ref>Robinson, William A. \"Thomas B. Reed, Parliamentarian\". ''The American Historical Review'', October 1931. pp. 137\u2013138.</ref> sought to end the obstruction of bills by the minority, in particular by countering the tactic known as the \"[[disappearing quorum]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Oleszek|first=Walter J. |url=http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/pre20th_rules.htm |title=A Pre-Twentieth Century Look at the House Committee on Rules |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|date=December 1998|accessdate=July 5, 2007|url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050825205640/http://rules.house.gov/archives/pre20th_rules.htm |archivedate=August 25, 2005}}</ref> By refusing to vote on a motion, the minority could ensure that a quorum would not be achieved, and that the result would be invalid. Reed, however, declared that members who were in the chamber but refused to vote would still count for the purposes of determining a quorum. Through these and other rulings, Reed ensured that the Democrats could not block the Republican agenda.\n\nThe speakership reached its apogee during the term of Republican [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] (1903\u20131911). Cannon exercised extraordinary control over the legislative process. He determined the agenda of the House, appointed the members of all committees, chose committee chairmen, headed the Rules Committee, and determined which committee heard each bill. He vigorously used his powers to ensure that Republican proposals were passed by the House. In 1910, however, Democrats and several dissatisfied Republicans joined together to strip Cannon of many of his powers, including the ability to name committee members and his chairmanship of the Rules Committee.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Charles O.|author-link=Charles O.

He helped shape many bills, working quietly in the background with House committees. He also helped ensure the passage of several domestic measures and foreign assistance programs advocated by Presidents [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Harry Truman]].\n\nRayburn's successor, Democrat [[John W. McCormack]] (served 1962\u20131971), was a somewhat less influential speaker, particularly because of dissent from younger members of the Democratic Party. During the mid-1970s, the power of the speakership once again grew under Democrat [[Carl Albert]]. The Committee on Rules ceased to be a semi-independent panel, as it had been since 1910. Instead, it once again became an arm of the party leadership. Moreover, in 1975, the speaker was granted the authority to appoint a majority of the members of the Rules Committee. Meanwhile, the power of committee chairmen was curtailed, further increasing the relative influence of the speaker.\n\nAlbert's successor, Democrat [[Tip O'Neill]], was a prominent speaker because of his public opposition to the policies of President [[Ronald Reagan]]. O'Neill is the longest continually serving speaker, from 1977 through 1987. He challenged Reagan on domestic programs and on defense expenditures. Republicans made O'Neill the target of their election campaigns in 1980 and 1982 but Democrats managed to retain their majorities in both years.\n\nThe roles of the parties reversed in 1994 when, after spending forty years in the minority, the Republicans regained control of the House with the \"[[Contract with America]]\", an idea spearheaded by [[Minority Whip]] [[Newt Gingrich]]. Speaker Gingrich would regularly clash with Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]], leading to the [[United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996]], in which Clinton was largely seen to have prevailed. Gingrich's hold on the leadership was weakened significantly by that and several other controversies, and he faced a caucus revolt in 1997. After the Republicans lost House seats in 1998 (although retaining a majority) he did not stand for a third term as speaker. His successor, [[Dennis Hastert]], had been chosen as a compromise candidate, since the other Republicans in the leadership were more controversial. Hastert played a much less prominent role than other contemporary speakers, being overshadowed by House Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]] and President [[George W. Bush]]. The Republicans came out of the 2000 elections with a further reduced majority but made small gains in 2002 and 2004. The periods of 2001\u20132002 and 2003\u20132007 were the first times since 1953\u20131955 that there was single-party Republican leadership in Washington, interrupted from 2001\u20132003 as Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]] left the Republican Party to become independent and caucused with Senate Democrats to give them a 51\u201349 majority.\n\nIn the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], the Democrats won a majority in the House. [[Nancy Pelosi]] became speaker when the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] convened on January 4, 2007, making her the first woman to hold the office.

In that case, even though the [[26th United States Congress]] convened on December 2, the House could not begin the speakership election until December 14 because of an election dispute in [[New Jersey]] known as the \"[[Broad Seal War]]\". Two rival delegations, one [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and the other Democrat, had been certified as elected by different branches of the New Jersey government. The problem was compounded by the fact that the result of the dispute would determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the majority. Neither party agreed to permit a speakership election with the opposite party's delegation participating. Finally, it was agreed to exclude both delegations from the election and a speaker was finally chosen on December 17.\n\nAnother, more prolonged fight occurred in 1855 in the [[34th United States Congress]]. The old [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] had collapsed but no single party had emerged to replace it. Candidates opposing the Democrats had run under a bewildering variety of labels, including Whig, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], American ([[Know Nothing]]), and simply \"[[Opposition Party (Northern U.S.)|Opposition]]\". By the time Congress actually met in December 1855, most of the northerners were concentrated together as Republicans, while most of the southerners and a few northerners used the American or Know Nothing label. Opponents of the Democrats held a majority in House, with the party makeup of the 234 representatives being 83 Democrats, 108 Republicans, and 43 Know Nothings (primarily southern oppositionists). The Democratic minority nominated [[William Alexander Richardson]] of Illinois as speaker, but because of sectional distrust, the various oppositionists were unable to agree on a single candidate for speaker. The Republicans supported [[Nathaniel Prentice Banks]] of Massachusetts, who had been elected as a Know Nothing but was now largely identified with the Republicans. The southern Know Nothings supported first [[Humphrey Marshall (general)|Humphrey Marshall]] of Kentucky, and then [[Henry M. Fuller]] of Pennsylvania. The voting went on for almost two months with no candidate able to secure a majority, until it was finally agreed to elect the speaker by plurality vote, and Banks was elected.<ref>Allan Nevins. ''Ordeal of the Union, Volume II: A House Dividing 1852\u20131857'' (New York, 1947), 413\u2013415.</ref> The House found itself in a similar dilemma when the [[36th United States Congress|36th Congress]] met in December 1859. Although the Republicans held a plurality, the Republican candidate, [[John Sherman]], was unacceptable to southern oppositionists due to his anti-slavery views, and once again the House was unable to elect a speaker. After Democrats allied with southern oppositionists to nearly elect the North Carolina oppositionist [[William N. H. Smith]], Sherman finally withdrew in favor of compromise candidate [[William Pennington]] of New Jersey, a former Whig of unclear partisan loyalties, who was finally elected speaker on February 1, 1860.<ref>Allan Nevins. ''The Emergence of Lincoln, Volume II: Prologue to Civil War, 1859\u20131861'' (New York, 1950), 116\u2013123.</ref>\n\nThe last time that an election for speaker went beyond one ballot was in December 1923 at the start of the [[68th United States Congress|68th Congress]], when Republican [[Frederick H. Gillett]] needed nine ballots to win reelection. [[Progressive Republican]]s had refused to support Gillett in the first eight ballots. Only after winning concessions from Republican conference leaders (a seat on the [[House Rules Committee]] and a pledge that requested House rules changes would be considered) did they agree to support him.<ref>{{cite news| last=Wolfensberger| first=Don| title=Opening day of new Congress: Not always total joy| work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]| date=December 12, 2018| url=https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/420984-opening-day-of-new-congress-not-always-total-joy| accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref><ref name=WaPo162015>{{cite news| last=Blake| first=Blake| date=January 6, 2015| title=John Boehner just endured the biggest revolt against a House speaker in more than 150 years| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/06/boehner-could-face-biggest-speaker-defection-since-1923/?noredirect=on| work=[[The Washington Post]]| accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, several Republican congressional leaders tried to force Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] to resign. However, Gingrich refused since that would have required a new election for speaker, which could have led to Democrats along with dissenting Republicans voting for Democrat [[Dick Gephardt]] (then minority leader) as speaker. After the 1998 midterm elections where the Republicans lost seats, Gingrich did not stand for re-election. The next two figures in the House Republican leadership hierarchy, Majority Leader [[Richard Armey]] and Majority Whip [[Tom DeLay]], chose not to run for the office. The chairman of [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|the House Appropriations Committee]], [[Bob Livingston]], declared his bid for the speakership, which was unopposed, making him speaker-designate. It was then revealed, by Livingston himself, who had been publicly critical of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[perjury]] during his sexual harassment trial, that he had engaged in an extramarital affair. He opted to resign from the House, despite being urged to stay on by House Democratic leader Gephardt. Subsequently, chief deputy whip [[Dennis Hastert]] was selected as speaker. The Republicans retained their majorities in the 2000, 2002, and 2004 elections.\n\nThe Democrats won a majority of seats in the 2006 midterm elections. On November 16, 2006, [[Nancy Pelosi]], who was then minority leader, was selected as speaker-designate by House Democrats.<ref>[http://www.sfgov.org/site/cosw_page.asp?id=51838 San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015709/http://www.sfgov.org/site/cosw_page.asp?id=51838 |date=September 30, 2007}}.

As the office has developed historically, however, it has taken on a clearly partisan cast, very different from the speakership of most Westminster-style legislatures, such as the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|speaker of the British House of Commons]], which is meant to be scrupulously non-partisan. The speaker in the United States, by tradition, is the head of the majority party in the House of Representatives, outranking the majority leader. However, despite having the right to vote, the speaker usually does not participate in debate.\n\nThe speaker is responsible for ensuring that the House passes legislation supported by the majority party. In pursuing this goal, the speaker may use their power to determine when each bill reaches the floor. They also chair the majority party's steering committee in the House. While the speaker is the functioning head of the House majority party, the same is not true of the president ''pro tempore'' of the Senate, whose office is primarily ceremonial and honorary.\n\nWhen the speaker and the president belong to the same party, the speaker tends to play the role in a more ceremonial light, as seen when [[Dennis Hastert]] played a very restrained role during the presidency of fellow Republican [[George W. Bush]]. Nevertheless, when the speaker and the president belong to the same party, there are also times that the speaker plays a much larger role, and the speaker is tasked, e.g., with pushing through the agenda of the majority party, often at the expense of the minority opposition. This can be seen, most of all, in the speakership of [[Democratic-Republican]] [[Henry Clay]], who personally ensured the presidential victory of fellow Democratic-Republican [[John Quincy Adams]]. Democrat [[Sam Rayburn]] was a key player in the passing of [[New Deal]] legislation under the presidency of fellow Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. Republican [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] (under [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) was particularly infamous for his marginalization of the minority Democrats and centralizing of authority to the speakership. In more recent times, Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] played a role in continuing the push for health care reform during the presidency of fellow Democrat [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2010/03/pelosi-steeled-wh-for-health-push-034753|title=Nancy Pelosi steeled White House for health push \u2013 Carrie Budoff Brown and Glenn Thrush|last=Thrush|first=Glenn|date=March 20, 2010|work=[[Politico]]|accessdate=December 6, 2011|last2=Brown|first2=Carrie Budoff|author-link=Glenn Thrush|author-link2=Carrie Budoff Brown}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, when the speaker and the president belong to opposite parties, the public role and influence of the speaker tend to increase. As the highest-ranking member of the opposition party (and ''de facto'' [[Leader of the Opposition|leader of the opposition]]), the speaker is normally the chief public opponent of the president's agenda. In this scenario, the speaker is known for undercutting the president's agenda by blocking measures by the minority party or rejecting bills by the Senate. One famous instance came in the form of [[Thomas Brackett Reed]] (under [[Grover Cleveland]]), a speaker notorious for his successful attempt to force the Democrats to vote on measures where the Republicans had clear majorities, which ensured that Cleveland's Democrats were in no position to challenge the Republicans in the House. Joseph Cannon was particularly unique in that he led the conservative \"Old Guard\" wing of the Republican Party, while his president \u2013 Theodore Roosevelt \u2013 was of the more progressive clique, and more than just marginalizing the Democrats, Cannon used his power to punish the dissidents in his party and obstruct the progressive wing of the Republican Party.\n\nMore modern examples include [[Tip O'Neill]], who was a vocal opponent of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s economic and defense policies; [[Newt Gingrich]], who fought a bitter battle with President [[Bill Clinton]] for control of domestic policy; [[Nancy Pelosi]], who argued with President [[George W.

Retrieved March 16, 2015.</ref> During important debates, the speaker ''pro tempore'' is ordinarily a senior member of the majority party who may be chosen for his or her skill in presiding. At other times, more junior members may be assigned to preside to give them experience with the rules and procedures of the House. The speaker may also designate, with approval of the House, a speaker ''pro tempore'' for special purposes, such as designating a representative whose district is near Washington, D.C. to sign [[enrolled bill]]s during long recesses.\n\nUnder the [[Procedures of the United States House of Representatives|rules of the House]], the speaker, \"as soon as practicable after the election of the speaker and whenever appropriate thereafter\", must deliver to the clerk of the House a confidential list of members who are designated to act as speaker in the case of a vacancy or physical inability of the speaker to perform their duties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/house-rules.pdf|title=Rules of the House of Representatives|date=January 6, 2015|accessdate=October 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn the floor of the House, the presiding officer is always addressed as \"Mister Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker\", even if that person is serving as speaker ''pro tempore''. When the House resolves itself into a [[Committee of the Whole (United States House of Representatives)|Committee of the Whole]], the speaker designates a member to preside over the committee, who is addressed as \"Mister Chairman\" or \"Madam Chairwoman\". To speak, members must seek the presiding officer's recognition. The presiding officer also rules on all points of order but such rulings may be appealed to the whole House. The speaker is responsible for maintaining decorum in the House and may order the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|Sergeant-at-Arms]] to enforce House rules.\n\nThe speaker's powers and duties extend beyond presiding in the chamber. In particular, the speaker has great influence over the committee process. The speaker selects nine of the thirteen members of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Rules|Committee on Rules]], subject to the approval of the entire majority party. The leadership of the minority party chooses the remaining four members. Furthermore, the speaker appoints all members of select committees and conference committees. Moreover, when a bill is introduced, the speaker determines which committee will consider it. As a member of the House, the speaker is entitled to participate in debate and to vote. Ordinarily, the speaker votes only when the speaker's vote would be decisive or on matters of great importance, such as constitutional amendments or major legislation.<ref>''Americapedia: Taking the Dumb Out of Freedom''  Jodi Lynn Anderson, Daniel Ehrenhaft & Andisheh Nouraee 2011, Bloomsbury Publishing Page 26.</ref>\n\n== Other functions ==\n[[File:OFFICE OF THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C..jpg|thumb|The speaker's office in the US Capitol, during the term of [[Dennis Hastert]] (1999\u20132007)]]\n\nIn addition to being the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives and representing their congressional district, the speaker also perform various other administrative and procedural functions, such as:\n* Oversees the officers of the House: the [[Clerk of the United States House of Representatives|clerk]], the [[Sergeant-at-Arms of the United States House of Representatives|sergeant-at-arms]], the [[Chief Administrative Officer of the United States House of Representatives|chief administrative officer]], and the [[Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives|chaplain]];\n* Serves as the chairperson of the [[House Office Building Commission]];<ref name=RL97-780>{{cite web| last=Heitshusen| first=Valerie| url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/97-780| title=The Speaker of the House: House Officer, Party Leader, and Representative| work=CRS Report for Congress RL97-780| publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], [[Library of Congress]]| location=Washington, D.C.| date=May 16, 2017| accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref>\n* Appoints the House's [[Parliamentarian of the United States House of Representatives|parliamentarian]],<ref>{{cite web| title=Parliamentarians of the House| url=https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Parliamentarians/| website=history.house.gov| publisher=United States House of Representatives| accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref> [[Historian of the United States House of Representatives|historian]], general counsel, and inspector general;<ref>{{cite web| last=Forte| first=David F.| title=Essays on Article I: Speaker of the House| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/10/speaker-of-the-house| work=The Heritage Guide to The Constitution| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref>\n* Administers the House audio and video broadcasting system, and, in consultation with the minority leader, devising a system of drug testing in the House.<ref name=RL97-780/>\n* Receives reports or other communications from the president, government agencies, boards, and commissions.<ref name=RL97-780/>\n* Receives, along with the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the Senate]], written declarations that a U.S. president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, or is able to resume them, under Sections 3 and 4 of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]].<ref>{{cite web| last=Neale| first=Thomas H.| title=Presidential Disability Under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment: Constitutional Provisions and Perspectives for Congress| work=CRS Report for Congress R45394| publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], the [[Library of Congress]]|location=Washington, D.C.| date=November 5, 2018| url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45394.pdf|accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the speaker is second in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] under the [[Presidential Succession Act]] of 1947, immediately after the vice president and before the president pro tempore of the Senate (who is followed by members of the president's [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]).

The speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives, and is simultaneously the House's presiding officer, ''de facto'' leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's administrative head. Speakers also perform various other administrative and procedural functions. Given these several roles and responsibilities, the speaker usually does not personally preside over debates. That duty is instead delegated to members of the House from the majority party.

A partisan position from early in its existence, the speakership began to gain power in legislative development under [[Henry Clay]] (1811\u20131814, 1815\u20131820, and 1823\u20131825).<ref>C. Stewart III, \"Architect or tactician? Henry Clay and the institutional development of the US House of Representatives\" [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/18148/clay.pdf?sequence=1 1998, online]</ref> In contrast to many of his predecessors, Clay participated in several debates, and used his influence to procure the passage of measures he supported\u2014for instance, the declaration of the [[War of 1812]], and various laws relating to Clay's \"[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]\" economic plan. Furthermore, when no candidate received an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] majority in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]] causing the president to be elected by the House, Speaker Clay threw his support to [[John Quincy Adams]] instead of [[Andrew Jackson]], thereby ensuring Adams' victory. Following Clay's retirement in 1825, the power of the speakership once again began to decline, despite speakership elections becoming increasingly bitter. As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] approached, several sectional factions nominated their own candidates, often making it difficult for any candidate to attain a majority. In 1855 and again in 1859, for example, the contest for speaker lasted for two months before the House achieved a result. During this time, speakers tended to have very short tenures. For example, from 1839 to 1863 there were eleven speakers, only one of whom served for more than one term. To date, [[James K. Polk]] is the only speaker of the House later elected president of the United States.\n\n[[File:JGCannon.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|[[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] (1903\u20131911) was one of the most powerful speakers.]]\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the office of speaker began to develop into a very powerful one. At the time, one of the most important sources of the speaker's power was his position as Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Rules|Committee on Rules]], which, after the reorganization of the committee system in 1880, became one of the most powerful standing committees of the House. Furthermore, several speakers became leading figures in their political parties; examples include Democrats [[Samuel J. Randall]], [[John Griffin Carlisle]], and [[Charles Frederick Crisp|Charles F. Crisp]], and Republicans [[James G. Blaine]], [[Thomas Brackett Reed]], and [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]].\n\nThe power of the speaker was greatly augmented during the tenure of the Republican [[Thomas Brackett Reed]] (1889\u20131891, 1895\u20131899). \"Czar Reed\", as he was called by his opponents,<ref>Robinson, William A. \"Thomas B. Reed, Parliamentarian\". ''The American Historical Review'', October 1931. pp. 137\u2013138.</ref> sought to end the obstruction of bills by the minority, in particular by countering the tactic known as the \"[[disappearing quorum]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Oleszek|first=Walter J. |url=http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/pre20th_rules.htm |title=A Pre-Twentieth Century Look at the House Committee on Rules |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|date=December 1998|accessdate=July 5, 2007|url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050825205640/http://rules.house.gov/archives/pre20th_rules.htm |archivedate=August 25, 2005}}</ref> By refusing to vote on a motion, the minority could ensure that a quorum would not be achieved, and that the result would be invalid. Reed, however, declared that members who were in the chamber but refused to vote would still count for the purposes of determining a quorum. Through these and other rulings, Reed ensured that the Democrats could not block the Republican agenda.\n\nThe speakership reached its apogee during the term of Republican [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] (1903\u20131911). Cannon exercised extraordinary control over the legislative process. He determined the agenda of the House, appointed the members of all committees, chose committee chairmen, headed the Rules Committee, and determined which committee heard each bill. He vigorously used his powers to ensure that Republican proposals were passed by the House. In 1910, however, Democrats and several dissatisfied Republicans joined together to strip Cannon of many of his powers, including the ability to name committee members and his chairmanship of the Rules Committee.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Charles O.|author-link=Charles O.

He helped shape many bills, working quietly in the background with House committees. He also helped ensure the passage of several domestic measures and foreign assistance programs advocated by Presidents [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Harry Truman]].\n\nRayburn's successor, Democrat [[John W. McCormack]] (served 1962\u20131971), was a somewhat less influential speaker, particularly because of dissent from younger members of the Democratic Party. During the mid-1970s, the power of the speakership once again grew under Democrat [[Carl Albert]]. The Committee on Rules ceased to be a semi-independent panel, as it had been since 1910. Instead, it once again became an arm of the party leadership. Moreover, in 1975, the speaker was granted the authority to appoint a majority of the members of the Rules Committee. Meanwhile, the power of committee chairmen was curtailed, further increasing the relative influence of the speaker.\n\nAlbert's successor, Democrat [[Tip O'Neill]], was a prominent speaker because of his public opposition to the policies of President [[Ronald Reagan]]. O'Neill is the longest continually serving speaker, from 1977 through 1987. He challenged Reagan on domestic programs and on defense expenditures. Republicans made O'Neill the target of their election campaigns in 1980 and 1982 but Democrats managed to retain their majorities in both years.\n\nThe roles of the parties reversed in 1994 when, after spending forty years in the minority, the Republicans regained control of the House with the \"[[Contract with America]]\", an idea spearheaded by [[Minority Whip]] [[Newt Gingrich]]. Speaker Gingrich would regularly clash with Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]], leading to the [[United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996]], in which Clinton was largely seen to have prevailed. Gingrich's hold on the leadership was weakened significantly by that and several other controversies, and he faced a caucus revolt in 1997. After the Republicans lost House seats in 1998 (although retaining a majority) he did not stand for a third term as speaker. His successor, [[Dennis Hastert]], had been chosen as a compromise candidate, since the other Republicans in the leadership were more controversial. Hastert played a much less prominent role than other contemporary speakers, being overshadowed by House Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]] and President [[George W. Bush]]. The Republicans came out of the 2000 elections with a further reduced majority but made small gains in 2002 and 2004. The periods of 2001\u20132002 and 2003\u20132007 were the first times since 1953\u20131955 that there was single-party Republican leadership in Washington, interrupted from 2001\u20132003 as Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]] left the Republican Party to become independent and caucused with Senate Democrats to give them a 51\u201349 majority.\n\nIn the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], the Democrats won a majority in the House. [[Nancy Pelosi]] became speaker when the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] convened on January 4, 2007, making her the first woman to hold the office.

In that case, even though the [[26th United States Congress]] convened on December 2, the House could not begin the speakership election until December 14 because of an election dispute in [[New Jersey]] known as the \"[[Broad Seal War]]\". Two rival delegations, one [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and the other Democrat, had been certified as elected by different branches of the New Jersey government. The problem was compounded by the fact that the result of the dispute would determine whether the Whigs or the Democrats held the majority. Neither party agreed to permit a speakership election with the opposite party's delegation participating. Finally, it was agreed to exclude both delegations from the election and a speaker was finally chosen on December 17.\n\nAnother, more prolonged fight occurred in 1855 in the [[34th United States Congress]]. The old [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] had collapsed but no single party had emerged to replace it. Candidates opposing the Democrats had run under a bewildering variety of labels, including Whig, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], American ([[Know Nothing]]), and simply \"[[Opposition Party (Northern U.S.)|Opposition]]\". By the time Congress actually met in December 1855, most of the northerners were concentrated together as Republicans, while most of the southerners and a few northerners used the American or Know Nothing label. Opponents of the Democrats held a majority in House, with the party makeup of the 234 representatives being 83 Democrats, 108 Republicans, and 43 Know Nothings (primarily southern oppositionists). The Democratic minority nominated [[William Alexander Richardson]] of Illinois as speaker, but because of sectional distrust, the various oppositionists were unable to agree on a single candidate for speaker. The Republicans supported [[Nathaniel Prentice Banks]] of Massachusetts, who had been elected as a Know Nothing but was now largely identified with the Republicans. The southern Know Nothings supported first [[Humphrey Marshall (general)|Humphrey Marshall]] of Kentucky, and then [[Henry M. Fuller]] of Pennsylvania. The voting went on for almost two months with no candidate able to secure a majority, until it was finally agreed to elect the speaker by plurality vote, and Banks was elected.<ref>Allan Nevins. ''Ordeal of the Union, Volume II: A House Dividing 1852\u20131857'' (New York, 1947), 413\u2013415.</ref> The House found itself in a similar dilemma when the [[36th United States Congress|36th Congress]] met in December 1859. Although the Republicans held a plurality, the Republican candidate, [[John Sherman]], was unacceptable to southern oppositionists due to his anti-slavery views, and once again the House was unable to elect a speaker. After Democrats allied with southern oppositionists to nearly elect the North Carolina oppositionist [[William N. H. Smith]], Sherman finally withdrew in favor of compromise candidate [[William Pennington]] of New Jersey, a former Whig of unclear partisan loyalties, who was finally elected speaker on February 1, 1860.<ref>Allan Nevins. ''The Emergence of Lincoln, Volume II: Prologue to Civil War, 1859\u20131861'' (New York, 1950), 116\u2013123.</ref>\n\nThe last time that an election for speaker went beyond one ballot was in December 1923 at the start of the [[68th United States Congress|68th Congress]], when Republican [[Frederick H. Gillett]] needed nine ballots to win reelection. [[Progressive Republican]]s had refused to support Gillett in the first eight ballots. Only after winning concessions from Republican conference leaders (a seat on the [[House Rules Committee]] and a pledge that requested House rules changes would be considered) did they agree to support him.<ref>{{cite news| last=Wolfensberger| first=Don| title=Opening day of new Congress: Not always total joy| work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]| date=December 12, 2018| url=https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/420984-opening-day-of-new-congress-not-always-total-joy| accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref><ref name=WaPo162015>{{cite news| last=Blake| first=Blake| date=January 6, 2015| title=John Boehner just endured the biggest revolt against a House speaker in more than 150 years| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/06/boehner-could-face-biggest-speaker-defection-since-1923/?noredirect=on| work=[[The Washington Post]]| accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, several Republican congressional leaders tried to force Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] to resign. However, Gingrich refused since that would have required a new election for speaker, which could have led to Democrats along with dissenting Republicans voting for Democrat [[Dick Gephardt]] (then minority leader) as speaker. After the 1998 midterm elections where the Republicans lost seats, Gingrich did not stand for re-election. The next two figures in the House Republican leadership hierarchy, Majority Leader [[Richard Armey]] and Majority Whip [[Tom DeLay]], chose not to run for the office. The chairman of [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|the House Appropriations Committee]], [[Bob Livingston]], declared his bid for the speakership, which was unopposed, making him speaker-designate. It was then revealed, by Livingston himself, who had been publicly critical of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[perjury]] during his sexual harassment trial, that he had engaged in an extramarital affair. He opted to resign from the House, despite being urged to stay on by House Democratic leader Gephardt. Subsequently, chief deputy whip [[Dennis Hastert]] was selected as speaker. The Republicans retained their majorities in the 2000, 2002, and 2004 elections.\n\nThe Democrats won a majority of seats in the 2006 midterm elections. On November 16, 2006, [[Nancy Pelosi]], who was then minority leader, was selected as speaker-designate by House Democrats.<ref>[http://www.sfgov.org/site/cosw_page.asp?id=51838 San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015709/http://www.sfgov.org/site/cosw_page.asp?id=51838 |date=September 30, 2007}}.

As the office has developed historically, however, it has taken on a clearly partisan cast, very different from the speakership of most Westminster-style legislatures, such as the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|speaker of the British House of Commons]], which is meant to be scrupulously non-partisan. The speaker in the United States, by tradition, is the head of the majority party in the House of Representatives, outranking the majority leader. However, despite having the right to vote, the speaker usually does not participate in debate.\n\nThe speaker is responsible for ensuring that the House passes legislation supported by the majority party. In pursuing this goal, the speaker may use their power to determine when each bill reaches the floor. They also chair the majority party's steering committee in the House. While the speaker is the functioning head of the House majority party, the same is not true of the president ''pro tempore'' of the Senate, whose office is primarily ceremonial and honorary.\n\nWhen the speaker and the president belong to the same party, the speaker tends to play the role in a more ceremonial light, as seen when [[Dennis Hastert]] played a very restrained role during the presidency of fellow Republican [[George W. Bush]]. Nevertheless, when the speaker and the president belong to the same party, there are also times that the speaker plays a much larger role, and the speaker is tasked, e.g., with pushing through the agenda of the majority party, often at the expense of the minority opposition. This can be seen, most of all, in the speakership of [[Democratic-Republican]] [[Henry Clay]], who personally ensured the presidential victory of fellow Democratic-Republican [[John Quincy Adams]]. Democrat [[Sam Rayburn]] was a key player in the passing of [[New Deal]] legislation under the presidency of fellow Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. Republican [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] (under [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) was particularly infamous for his marginalization of the minority Democrats and centralizing of authority to the speakership. In more recent times, Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] played a role in continuing the push for health care reform during the presidency of fellow Democrat [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2010/03/pelosi-steeled-wh-for-health-push-034753|title=Nancy Pelosi steeled White House for health push \u2013 Carrie Budoff Brown and Glenn Thrush|last=Thrush|first=Glenn|date=March 20, 2010|work=[[Politico]]|accessdate=December 6, 2011|last2=Brown|first2=Carrie Budoff|author-link=Glenn Thrush|author-link2=Carrie Budoff Brown}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, when the speaker and the president belong to opposite parties, the public role and influence of the speaker tend to increase. As the highest-ranking member of the opposition party (and ''de facto'' [[Leader of the Opposition|leader of the opposition]]), the speaker is normally the chief public opponent of the president's agenda. In this scenario, the speaker is known for undercutting the president's agenda by blocking measures by the minority party or rejecting bills by the Senate. One famous instance came in the form of [[Thomas Brackett Reed]] (under [[Grover Cleveland]]), a speaker notorious for his successful attempt to force the Democrats to vote on measures where the Republicans had clear majorities, which ensured that Cleveland's Democrats were in no position to challenge the Republicans in the House. Joseph Cannon was particularly unique in that he led the conservative \"Old Guard\" wing of the Republican Party, while his president \u2013 Theodore Roosevelt \u2013 was of the more progressive clique, and more than just marginalizing the Democrats, Cannon used his power to punish the dissidents in his party and obstruct the progressive wing of the Republican Party.\n\nMore modern examples include [[Tip O'Neill]], who was a vocal opponent of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s economic and defense policies; [[Newt Gingrich]], who fought a bitter battle with President [[Bill Clinton]] for control of domestic policy; [[Nancy Pelosi]], who argued with President [[George W.

Retrieved March 16, 2015.</ref> During important debates, the speaker ''pro tempore'' is ordinarily a senior member of the majority party who may be chosen for his or her skill in presiding. At other times, more junior members may be assigned to preside to give them experience with the rules and procedures of the House. The speaker may also designate, with approval of the House, a speaker ''pro tempore'' for special purposes, such as designating a representative whose district is near Washington, D.C. to sign [[enrolled bill]]s during long recesses.\n\nUnder the [[Procedures of the United States House of Representatives|rules of the House]], the speaker, \"as soon as practicable after the election of the speaker and whenever appropriate thereafter\", must deliver to the clerk of the House a confidential list of members who are designated to act as speaker in the case of a vacancy or physical inability of the speaker to perform their duties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/house-rules.pdf|title=Rules of the House of Representatives|date=January 6, 2015|accessdate=October 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn the floor of the House, the presiding officer is always addressed as \"Mister Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker\", even if that person is serving as speaker ''pro tempore''. When the House resolves itself into a [[Committee of the Whole (United States House of Representatives)|Committee of the Whole]], the speaker designates a member to preside over the committee, who is addressed as \"Mister Chairman\" or \"Madam Chairwoman\". To speak, members must seek the presiding officer's recognition. The presiding officer also rules on all points of order but such rulings may be appealed to the whole House. The speaker is responsible for maintaining decorum in the House and may order the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|Sergeant-at-Arms]] to enforce House rules.\n\nThe speaker's powers and duties extend beyond presiding in the chamber. In particular, the speaker has great influence over the committee process. The speaker selects nine of the thirteen members of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Rules|Committee on Rules]], subject to the approval of the entire majority party. The leadership of the minority party chooses the remaining four members. Furthermore, the speaker appoints all members of select committees and conference committees. Moreover, when a bill is introduced, the speaker determines which committee will consider it. As a member of the House, the speaker is entitled to participate in debate and to vote. Ordinarily, the speaker votes only when the speaker's vote would be decisive or on matters of great importance, such as constitutional amendments or major legislation.<ref>''Americapedia: Taking the Dumb Out of Freedom''  Jodi Lynn Anderson, Daniel Ehrenhaft & Andisheh Nouraee 2011, Bloomsbury Publishing Page 26.</ref>\n\n== Other functions ==\n[[File:OFFICE OF THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C..jpg|thumb|The speaker's office in the US Capitol, during the term of [[Dennis Hastert]] (1999\u20132007)]]\n\nIn addition to being the political and parliamentary leader of the House of Representatives and representing their congressional district, the speaker also perform various other administrative and procedural functions, such as:\n* Oversees the officers of the House: the [[Clerk of the United States House of Representatives|clerk]], the [[Sergeant-at-Arms of the United States House of Representatives|sergeant-at-arms]], the [[Chief Administrative Officer of the United States House of Representatives|chief administrative officer]], and the [[Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives|chaplain]];\n* Serves as the chairperson of the [[House Office Building Commission]];<ref name=RL97-780>{{cite web| last=Heitshusen| first=Valerie| url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/97-780| title=The Speaker of the House: House Officer, Party Leader, and Representative| work=CRS Report for Congress RL97-780| publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], [[Library of Congress]]| location=Washington, D.C.| date=May 16, 2017| accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref>\n* Appoints the House's [[Parliamentarian of the United States House of Representatives|parliamentarian]],<ref>{{cite web| title=Parliamentarians of the House| url=https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Parliamentarians/| website=history.house.gov| publisher=United States House of Representatives| accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref> [[Historian of the United States House of Representatives|historian]], general counsel, and inspector general;<ref>{{cite web| last=Forte| first=David F.| title=Essays on Article I: Speaker of the House| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/10/speaker-of-the-house| work=The Heritage Guide to The Constitution| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref>\n* Administers the House audio and video broadcasting system, and, in consultation with the minority leader, devising a system of drug testing in the House.<ref name=RL97-780/>\n* Receives reports or other communications from the president, government agencies, boards, and commissions.<ref name=RL97-780/>\n* Receives, along with the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the Senate]], written declarations that a U.S. president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, or is able to resume them, under Sections 3 and 4 of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]].<ref>{{cite web| last=Neale| first=Thomas H.| title=Presidential Disability Under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment: Constitutional Provisions and Perspectives for Congress| work=CRS Report for Congress R45394| publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], the [[Library of Congress]]|location=Washington, D.C.| date=November 5, 2018| url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45394.pdf|accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the speaker is second in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] under the [[Presidential Succession Act]] of 1947, immediately after the vice president and before the president pro tempore of the Senate (who is followed by members of the president's [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]).

His literary name was '''Ibukinoya'''.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nHirata was born as the fourth son of \u014cwada Yoshitane, an ''Obangashira'' (low-ranking) ''[[samurai]]'' of [[Kubota Domain]],  in what is now part of the city of [[Akita (city)|Akita]] in northern Japan. Little is known of his early childhood, but it appears to have been troubled by poverty and by hostility from his step-mother. He left home in 1795, renouncing his ties to his family and to the Domain and traveled to [[Edo]] and worked as a laborer and as a servant, while pushing opportunities to study ''[[rangaku]]'', geography, and astronomy. In 1800, at the age of 25, he caught the attention of Hirata T\u014dbei, a scholar formerly of [[Bitch\u016b-Matsuyama Domain]], who adopted him and from whom he received the family name of Hirata. Around this time, he met Orose, the daughter of a ''[[hatamoto]]'' of [[Numazu Domain]], whom he married the following year.\n\n===Development of Kokugaku studies===\n[[File:Hirata Atsutane02.jpg|thumb|200px|Atsutane's Portrait by his pupil]]\nWhile in Edo, Hirata was a student of the [[Neo-Confucianism]] of [[Yamazaki Ansai]] (1619\u20131682); however, his interests were very broad. He later turned towards [[Daoism]] as found in the works of the Chinese philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]. He learned about the works of [[Motoori Norinaga]], the founder of the ''kokugaku'' movement, in 1803,  two years after Motoori's death. Hirata claimed later to have received the mantle of ''kokugaku'' teacher in a dream directly from Motoori Norinaga, but the story is apocryphal. He became a student of [[Motoori Haruniwa]], and read voraciously the ancient and Chinese classics, foreign works by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and [[Isaac Newton]] and treatises on Buddhism and Shinto. He was also a prolific writer. Representative works in the study of ancient Japanese traditions include ''Tama no mihashira'' (The True Pillar of Spirit), ''Koshi seibun'' (Treatise on Ancient History), ''Kod\u014d taii'' (True Meaning of the Ancient Way) and ''Zoku Shint\u014d taii'' (True Meaning of Common Shint\u014d), and the commentaries ''Koshi-ch\u014d'' and ''Koshi-den''. He is also noted for his studies of ancient Indian and Chinese tradition (''Indo z\u014dshi'' and ''Morokoshi taikoden''), and texts dealing with the spirit world, including ''Senky\u014d ibun'' (Strange Tales of the Land of Immortals) and ''Katsugor\u014d saisei kibun'' (Chronicle of the Rebirth of Katsugor\u014d). His early work ''Honky\u014d gaihen'' indicates an acquaintance with Christian literature that had been authored by Jesuits in China\n\nThough he is traditionally ranked fourth in the lineage of ''kokugaku'' scholars, Hirata actually represents a break with the purely scholarly urban culture characteristic of the revival of classical nativist learning, and represents a trend toward a populist message. Hirata laid particular emphasis on reaching the average man, and adapted his own style to them by employing at times the vernacular idiom. Hirata frequently expressed hostility to the Confucian and Buddhist scholars of the day, advocating instead a revival of the \u201cancient ways\u201d in which the [[Imperial House of Japan|emperor]] was to be revered. Hirata's first published work, ''Kamosho'' (1803) was a scathing attack on the works of Confucian philosopher [[Dazai Shundai]] (1680\u20131747)  on Buddhism, and resulted in an invitation to teach from the Yoshida family, the hereditary clan leading [[Yoshida Shinto]].\n\nThe contents of his 1841 treatise ''Tench\u014d muky\u016breki'' (Chronicle of the Perpetual Rule of the Emperor) angered the ruling [[Tokugawa bakufu]] government, and he was sentenced to confinement in Akita until his death in 1843.\n\n==Influence==\nHirata's activities eventually attracted over 500 pupils, including [[Okuni Takamasa]] and [[Suzuki Shigetane]]. His [[Japanese nationalism|nationalist]] writings had considerable impact on the ''samurai'' who supported the ''[[Sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' movement and who fought in the [[Boshin War]] to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate during the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nHirata's influence on ''kokugaku'' has recently been thought to be overestimated. While he is called one of the \"four great men of kokugaku\", this is a phrase he invented himself.  His work more often influenced religious groups than the government in the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nAmong Hirata's more enduring contributions to Japanese thought was the idea that all Japanese were descended from the gods, not only the Imperial family and certain aristocratic families.

His literary name was '''Ibukinoya'''.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nHirata was born as the fourth son of \u014cwada Yoshitane, an ''Obangashira'' (low-ranking) ''[[samurai]]'' of [[Kubota Domain]],  in what is now part of the city of [[Akita (city)|Akita]] in northern Japan. Little is known of his early childhood, but it appears to have been troubled by poverty and by hostility from his step-mother. He left home in 1795, renouncing his ties to his family and to the Domain and traveled to [[Edo]] and worked as a laborer and as a servant, while pushing opportunities to study ''[[rangaku]]'', geography, and astronomy. In 1800, at the age of 25, he caught the attention of Hirata T\u014dbei, a scholar formerly of [[Bitch\u016b-Matsuyama Domain]], who adopted him and from whom he received the family name of Hirata. Around this time, he met Orose, the daughter of a ''[[hatamoto]]'' of [[Numazu Domain]], whom he married the following year.\n\n===Development of Kokugaku studies===\n[[File:Hirata Atsutane02.jpg|thumb|200px|Atsutane's Portrait by his pupil]]\nWhile in Edo, Hirata was a student of the [[Neo-Confucianism]] of [[Yamazaki Ansai]] (1619\u20131682); however, his interests were very broad. He later turned towards [[Daoism]] as found in the works of the Chinese philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]. He learned about the works of [[Motoori Norinaga]], the founder of the ''kokugaku'' movement, in 1803,  two years after Motoori's death. Hirata claimed later to have received the mantle of ''kokugaku'' teacher in a dream directly from Motoori Norinaga, but the story is apocryphal. He became a student of [[Motoori Haruniwa]], and read voraciously the ancient and Chinese classics, foreign works by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and [[Isaac Newton]] and treatises on Buddhism and Shinto. He was also a prolific writer. Representative works in the study of ancient Japanese traditions include ''Tama no mihashira'' (The True Pillar of Spirit), ''Koshi seibun'' (Treatise on Ancient History), ''Kod\u014d taii'' (True Meaning of the Ancient Way) and ''Zoku Shint\u014d taii'' (True Meaning of Common Shint\u014d), and the commentaries ''Koshi-ch\u014d'' and ''Koshi-den''. He is also noted for his studies of ancient Indian and Chinese tradition (''Indo z\u014dshi'' and ''Morokoshi taikoden''), and texts dealing with the spirit world, including ''Senky\u014d ibun'' (Strange Tales of the Land of Immortals) and ''Katsugor\u014d saisei kibun'' (Chronicle of the Rebirth of Katsugor\u014d). His early work ''Honky\u014d gaihen'' indicates an acquaintance with Christian literature that had been authored by Jesuits in China\n\nThough he is traditionally ranked fourth in the lineage of ''kokugaku'' scholars, Hirata actually represents a break with the purely scholarly urban culture characteristic of the revival of classical nativist learning, and represents a trend toward a populist message. Hirata laid particular emphasis on reaching the average man, and adapted his own style to them by employing at times the vernacular idiom. Hirata frequently expressed hostility to the Confucian and Buddhist scholars of the day, advocating instead a revival of the \u201cancient ways\u201d in which the [[Imperial House of Japan|emperor]] was to be revered. Hirata's first published work, ''Kamosho'' (1803) was a scathing attack on the works of Confucian philosopher [[Dazai Shundai]] (1680\u20131747)  on Buddhism, and resulted in an invitation to teach from the Yoshida family, the hereditary clan leading [[Yoshida Shinto]].\n\nThe contents of his 1841 treatise ''Tench\u014d muky\u016breki'' (Chronicle of the Perpetual Rule of the Emperor) angered the ruling [[Tokugawa bakufu]] government, and he was sentenced to confinement in Akita until his death in 1843.\n\n==Influence==\nHirata's activities eventually attracted over 500 pupils, including [[Okuni Takamasa]] and [[Suzuki Shigetane]]. His [[Japanese nationalism|nationalist]] writings had considerable impact on the ''samurai'' who supported the ''[[Sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' movement and who fought in the [[Boshin War]] to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate during the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nHIrata's influence on ''kokugaku'' has recently been thought to be overestimated. While he is called one of the \"four great men of kokugaku\", this is a phrase he invented himself.  His work more often influenced religious groups than the government in the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nAmong Hirata's more enduring contributions to Japanese thought was the idea that all Japanese were descended from the gods, not only the Imperial family and certain aristocratic families. As he put it, \"this, our glorious land, is the land in which the gods have their origin, and we are one and all descendants of the gods. For this reason, if we go back from the parents who gave us life and being, beyond the grandparents and great-grandparents, and consider the ancestors of ancient times, then the original ancestors of those must necessarily have been the gods.\"<ref>Earl, David Margarey, Emperor and Nation in Japan, Political Thinkers of the Tokugawa Period, University of Washington Press, 1964, p. 80</ref>\n\n==Hirata Atsutane grave==\n[[file:\u5e73\u7530\u7be4\u80e4.JPG|right|thumb|250 px|Hirata Atsutane grave]]\nHirata died at his home in Nakakame-cho, Akita in 1843, and as per the provisions of his will, was buried on a hillside in the city. {{coord|39.72863931|140.1372221|format=dms|display=inline}} The tombstone is a natural stone simply inscribed with his name, surrounded by a stone fence and a stone ''[[torii]]'' gate are placed at the entrance.

Daley was elected mayor in 1989 and was reelected five times until declining to run for a seventh term. At 22 years, he was the longest-serving Chicago mayor, surpassing the tenure of his father, [[Richard J. Daley]].\n\nAs Mayor, Daley took over the [[Chicago Public Schools]], developed tourism, oversaw the construction of [[Millennium Park]], increased environmental efforts and the rapid development of the city's central business district downtown and adjacent near North, near South and near West sides. He also expanded employee benefits to same-sex partners of city workers, and advocated for gun control.\n\nDaley received criticism when family, personal friends, and political allies disproportionately benefited from city contracting. He took office in a city with regular annual budget surpluses and left the city with massive structural deficits. His budgets ran up the largest deficits in [[Chicago]] history. A national leader in [[privatization]], he temporarily reduced budgetary shortfalls by leasing and selling public assets to private corporations, but this practice removed future sources of revenue, contributing to the city's near insolvency at the end of his tenure. Police brutality was a recurring issue during his mayorship.\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nRichard M. Daley is the fourth of seven children and eldest son of [[Richard J.

Huels attended De La Salle Institute, the same high school attended by Daley, his father, and [[Michael Bilandic]]. Huels worked for the city's [[Public Works]] Department as a laborer and tree trimmer, then as an administrative assistant in the Environment Department, and then as a City Council investigator. He answered phones for the 11th Ward Democratic organization, and was its secretary for several years. When Mayor [[Richard J.

Burke]] (14th) was secretary. Huels and Burke authorized $633,971 in legal consulting fees from their respective Council committees to attorney Michael A. Pedicone, a long-time officer of SDI. In March 1995 the [[Internal Revenue Service]] placed a [[lien]] on SDI for $326,951 and in June 1996 for $997,382 for failing to pay [[payroll taxes]], including money withheld from its employees' pay checks.<ref name=loan/><ref>{{cite news |title=Huels, Burke paid city cash to colleague |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=October 17, 1997 |first2=Chuck |last2=Neubauer |first1=Charles |last1=Nicodemus |first3=Robert A. |last3=Davis}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, after high school, Tadin went to work for Marina Cartage; within a decade, he owned the company, and over the next 15 years expanded it from 20 trucks to 150.

Daley was elected mayor in 1989 and was reelected five times until declining to run for a seventh term. At 22 years, he was the longest-serving Chicago mayor, surpassing the tenure of his father, [[Richard J. Daley]].\n\nAs Mayor, Daley took over the [[Chicago Public Schools]], developed tourism, oversaw the construction of [[Millennium Park]], increased environmental efforts and the rapid development of the city's central business district downtown and adjacent near North, near South and near West sides. He also expanded employee benefits to same-sex partners of city workers, and advocated for gun control.\n\nDaley received criticism when family, personal friends, and political allies disproportionately benefited from city contracting. He took office in a city with regular annual budget surpluses and left the city with massive structural deficits. His budgets ran up the largest deficits in [[Chicago]] history. A national leader in [[privatization]], he temporarily reduced budgetary shortfalls by leasing and selling public assets to private corporations, but this practice removed future sources of revenue, contributing to the city's near insolvency at the end of his tenure. Police brutality was a recurring issue during his mayorship.\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nRichard M. Daley is the fourth of seven children and eldest son of [[Richard J.

[[Miss Saigon]],'' is an American musical with examples of this as well. \n\nAnother example of its usage is in the popular sci-fi film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', where Corporal Jake Sully refers to his eventual mother-in-law Mo'at, [[high priestess]] of the Omaticaya Na'vi [[clan]] of Pandora, as ''Dragon lady'' while speaking about her to his boss Dr. Grace Augustine. This follows his first meeting with Mo'at, during which she successfully cows all of her fellow Omaticayas, including her husband the [[chieftain]], into submitting to her wishes for Sully when prior to her arrival they had clearly all been resolved to kill him for trespassing on their land. \n\nIn the 2008 film [[Gran Torino|''Gran Torino'']], [[Clint Eastwood]]'s character [[Walt Kowalski]] uses the term<ref>{{Cite AV media|people=Eastwood, Clint (Director)|year=2008|title=Gran Torino|medium=Motion Picture||url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6_ieAMNS9w||quote=(YouTube title: Get Me Another Beer...)|via=YouTube}}</ref> in directing his [[Hmong people|Hmong]] neighbor to get him another beer.\n\n== Hollywood costuming ==\n[[File:Nancy Kwan cheongsam scene in Suzie Wong.jpg|thumb|Nancy Kwan's Costume in ''The World of Suzie Wong'']]\nDragon Lady characters are visually defined by their emphasis on \u201cotherness\u201d and sexual promiscuity.

That stereotype\u2014as is the case with other racial caricatures\u2014has generated a large quantity of sociological literature.\n\nToday, \"Dragon Lady\" is often applied anachronistically to refer to persons who lived before the term became part of American slang in the 1930s.  For example, one finds the term in recent works about the  \"Dragon Lady\" [[Empress Dowager]] [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Cixi]] (Empress Dowager Tzu-hsi; {{zh|c=\u6148\u79a7\u592a\u540e|p=C\u00edx\u012b T\u00e0ih\u00f2u|w=Tz'u<sup>2</sup>-hsi<sup>1</sup> T'ai<sup>4</sup>-hou<sup>4</sup>}}), who was alive at the turn of the 20th century,<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Seagrave\n| first = Sterling\n| title = Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China\n| year = 1992 \n| publisher = Vintage Books\n| place = New York\n| isbn = 0-679-73369-8}}</ref> or references to Chinese-American actress [[Anna May Wong]] as having started her career in the 1920s and early 1930s in \"Dragon Lady\" roles.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Hodges\n| first = G.

This follows his first meeting with Mo'at, during which she successfully cows all of her fellow Omaticayas, including her husband the [[chieftain]], into submitting to her wishes for Sully when prior to her arrival they had clearly all been resolved to kill him for trespassing on their land. \n\nIn the 2008 film, [[Gran Torino]], [[Clint Eastwood]]'s character [[Walt Kowalski]] uses the term<ref>{{Cite AV media|people=Eastwood, Clint (Director)|year=2008|title=Gran Torino|medium=Motion Picture||url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6_ieAMNS9w||quote=(YouTube title: Get Me Another Beer...)|via=YouTube}}</ref> in directing his [[Hmong people|Hmong]] neighbor to get him another beer.\n\n== Hollywood costuming ==\n[[File:Nancy Kwan cheongsam scene in Suzie Wong.jpg|thumb|Nancy Kwan's Costume in ''The World of Suzie Wong'']]\nDragon Lady characters are visually defined by their emphasis on \u201cotherness\u201d and sexual promiscuity.

He tumbles down the long entrance staircase, apparently the victim of a fatal heart attack. Knowing that Enderby had a pathological fear of cats, Miss Marple becomes suspicious when she finds one in the house. She also finds a piece of mud bearing the print of a riding boot, but when she goes to Inspector Craddock ([[Bud Tingwell]]), he is sceptical, believing that Enderby died of natural causes.\n\nUndeterred, Miss Marple eavesdrops when Enderby's family gather for the reading of the [[Will (law)|Will]]. There are four beneficiaries: fourth cousin George Crossfield ([[Robert Urquhart (actor)|Robert Urquhart]]), niece Rosamund Shane (Katya Douglas), nephew Hector Enderby ([[Robert Morley]]) and sister Cora Lansquenet. Each receives an equal share of the estate. Cora declares that she believes Enderby was murdered. The next day, when Miss Marple goes to see her, she finds Cora dead, stabbed in the back with a hatpin. Cora's companion of many years, timid Miss Milchrest ([[Flora Robson]]), can provide little information.\n\nMiss Marple decides to take a \"holiday\" at the Gallop Hotel/riding school, as it is run by Hector Enderby and the other two surviving heirs and Miss Milchrest are staying there. When Inspector Craddock questions them and Rosamund Shane's spendthrift husband Michael ([[James Villiers]]), none of them can produce a satisfactory alibi for the time of Cora Lansquenet's death.\n\nAn attempt is made to do away with Miss Marple, but is foiled by the intended victim (without her even realising it). Miss Marple then discovers that the piece of mud found in Enderby's house came from shady art dealer George Crossfield's riding boot, but her case against him is dashed when she learns that each of the heirs visited Enderby on the day he died, to ask for money. Crossfield has meanwhile found out who the murderer is, but he is locked in a stall with an excitable horse and is trampled to death.\n\nBy this point, Miss Marple knows the identity and motive of the killer, but has no definite proof. She therefore lays a trap, pretending to have a heart attack at a dance at the hotel while doing the [[Twist (dance)|twist]] with Stringer. The police doctor places her in a room by herself, declaring it to be too dangerous to move her until morning. During the night, the criminal makes one last attempt to silence her, but Miss Marple is ready. The killer's motive is revealed to be a seemingly worthless painting owned by Cora, which actually was very valuable.\n  \nHector Enderby later proposes marriage to Miss Marple but she turns him down, as she is opposed to blood sports and he is an enthusiastic fox-hunter. After she leaves, he mutters to himself \"That was a narrow escape!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Margaret Rutherford|Dame Margaret Rutherford]] as Miss Marple\n* [[Stringer Davis]] as Mr. Stringer\n* [[Robert Morley]] as Hector Enderby\n* [[Flora Robson|Dame Flora Robson]] as Miss Milchrest\n* [[Bud Tingwell]] as Inspector Craddock\n* [[Gordon Harris (actor)|Gordon Harris]] as Sergeant Bacon\n* [[Robert Urquhart (actor)|Robert Urquhart]] as George Crossfield\n* Katya Douglas[[:de:Katya Douglas|<sup>(de)</sup>]] as Rosamund Shane\n* [[James Villiers]] as Michael Shane, Rosamund's husband\n* [[Noel Howlett]] as Mr. Trundell\n* [[Finlay Currie]] as Old Enderby\n* [[Duncan Lamont]] as Hillman\n* [[Kevin Stoney]] as Doctor Markwell\n* [[Frank Atkinson (actor)|Frank Atkinson]] as Hotel Night Porter (uncredited)\n* [[Roger Avon]] as Police Photographer (uncredited)\n\n==Notes==\n\nChristie is mentioned by name early in the film when Miss Marple speaks to the police inspector after the first death.

When Inspector Craddock questions them and Rosamund Shane's spendthrift husband Michael ([[James Villiers]]), none of them can produce a satisfactory alibi for the time of Cora Lansquenet's death.\n\nAn attempt is made to do away with Miss Marple, but is foiled by the intended victim (without her even realising it). Miss Marple then discovers that the piece of mud found in Enderby's house came from shady art dealer George Crossfield's riding boot, but her case against him is dashed when she learns that each of the heirs visited Enderby on the day he died, to ask for money. Crossfield has meanwhile found out who the murderer is, but he is locked in a stall with an excitable horse and is trampled to death.\n\nBy this point, Miss Marple knows the identity and motive of the killer, but has no definite proof. She therefore lays a trap, pretending to have a heart attack at a dance at the hotel while doing the [[Twist (dance)|twist]] with Stringer. The police doctor places her in a room by herself, declaring it to be too dangerous to move her until morning. During the night, the criminal makes one last attempt to silence her, but Miss Marple is ready. The killer's motive is revealed to be a seemingly worthless painting owned by Cora, which actually was very valuable.\n  \nHector Enderby later proposes marriage to Miss Marple but she turns him down, as she is opposed to blood sports and he is an enthusiastic fox-hunter. After she leaves, he mutters to himself \"That was a narrow escape!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Margaret Rutherford|Dame Margaret Rutherford]] as Miss Marple\n* [[Stringer Davis]] as Mr. Stringer\n* [[Robert Morley]] as Hector Enderby\n* [[Flora Robson|Dame Flora Robson]] as Miss Milchrest\n* [[Bud Tingwell]] as Inspector Craddock\n* [[Gordon Harris (actor)|Gordon Harris]] as Sergeant Bacon\n* [[Robert Urquhart (actor)|Robert Urquhart]] as George Crossfield\n* Katya Douglas[[:de:Katya Douglas|<sup>(de)</sup>]] as Rosamund Shane\n* [[James Villiers]] as Michael Shane, Rosamund's husband\n* [[Noel Howlett]] as Mr. Trundell\n* [[Finlay Currie]] as Old Enderby\n* [[Duncan Lamont]] as Hillman\n* [[Kevin Stoney]] as Doctor Markwell\n* [[Frank Atkinson (actor)|Frank Atkinson]] as Hotel Night Porter (uncredited)\n* [[Roger Avon]] as Police Photographer (uncredited)\n\n==Notes==\n\nChristie is mentioned by name early in the film when Miss Marple speaks to the police inspector after the first death.
