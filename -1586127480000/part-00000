By the 1970s, however, it had become clear that Page Field would be too small to handle increasing future demand for commercial flights into the region.  Expanding Page Field was determined to be impractical because its airfield was constrained by U.S. 41 to the west and expanding the airfield to the east would require bridging the [[Ten Mile Canal]] and relocating a railroad track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Florida Regional Airport Environmental Impact Statement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_k0AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nA number of sites were considered for a new regional airport, including southern [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte County]], [[Estero, Florida|Estero]], and northeast Cape Coral near [[Burnt Store Marina, Florida|Burnt Store Marina]].  The government of Lee County ultimately selected a site near the end of [[County Road 876 (Lee County, Florida)|Daniels Road]] which was a dirt road at the time.  An advantage to this location was its proximity to [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]], which was under construction and would have an interchange with Daniels Road, providing easy access (Interstate 75 was opened to traffic through Fort Myers in 1979).<ref>{{cite web|title=Interstate 75|url=http://www.aaroads.com/guide.php?page=i0075fl|website=AA Roads|accessdate=28 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225161123/http://www.aaroads.com/guide.php?page=i0075fl|archive-date=February 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the airport began in 1980, and it opened on schedule on May 14, 1983, with a single 8400-ft runway.

The original terminal was located on the north side of the runway at the end of Chamberlin Parkway.\n\nThe airport was renamed '''Southwest Florida International Airport''' in 1993, though it had hosted international flights since 1984 and U.S. Customs since 1987. The name change coincided with the completion of a 55,000 square foot Federal Inspection facility annexed to the original terminal's Concourse A.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of Aviation in Lee County|url=http://www.flylcpa.com/uploads/pagesfiles/511.pdf|website=Southwest Florida International Airport|accessdate=12 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213624/http://www.flylcpa.com/uploads/pagesfiles/511.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The runway was also lengthened to 12,000&nbsp;ft (3,658 m) at the same time to better accommodate international service (making it the fourth-longest runway in Florida).<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Florida International Airport|url=http://www.freightmovesflorida.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/634665599509832500-southwest_florida_international_airport_12_22_11_2_.pdf?sfvrsn=0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016142025/http://www.freightmovesflorida.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/634665599509832500-southwest_florida_international_airport_12_22_11_2_.pdf?sfvrsn=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 October 2015|website=Freight Moves Florida|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988 the airport exceeded its annual capacity of 3 million passengers; by 2004, the airport was serving nearly 7 million passengers annually.  The original terminal had 17 gates on two concourses.  While three of the gates were added in a minor expansion of the B concourse in the late 1990s, the original terminal's design was not conducive to a major expansion.\n\nWith the terminal operating at more than double its intended capacity, construction of a new Midfield Terminal Complex began in February 2002. The $438 million terminal opened on September 9, 2005.

Demolition of the former terminal north of the airfield was completed in spring 2006.  However, the original terminal's parking lot and other related infrastructure still stand at the end of Chamberlin Parkway.\n\nIn early 2015, Terminal Access Road, the airport's main entrance road, was extended past Treeline Avenue to connect directly to Interstate 75, allowing airport-related traffic to avoid local streets.

There has been over 2.67 million aircraft operations at the airport since its opening.\n\n==Current and future projects==\nA new $16 million Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting facility (Lee County Station 92) opened in July 2013. A {{convert|9100|ft|m|abbr=on}} parallel runway is in planning. The project includes a relocated air traffic control tower, apron expansion, crossfield taxiway system, mitigation activities and FPL electrical line relocation. The new air traffic control tower and parallel runway were expected to be completed by 2019, however this has been pushed back to late 2020. The apron expansion and crossfield taxiway system were completed in late 2013. The entire project is estimated to cost $454 million.\n\nIn early 2018, the Lee County Port Authority (LCPA) announced plans to ease seasonal security wait times by expanding and relocating the current security checkpoints for each concourse. By relocating each checkpoint, there will be more restaurants, shops, and post-security spaces. According to the announcement by the LCPA, this expansion could cost between $150 million - $180 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.news-press.com/story/news/2018/02/01/peak-season-checkpoint-waits-push-fort-myers-airport-toward-major-terminal-expansion/1042155001/ |title=Fort Myers airport to expand terminal, consolidate TSA screening to cut waits |publisher=News-press.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n\nPlans are in place for Skyplex \u2013 a commercial and industrial park in the location of the old terminal.

By the 1970s, however, it had become clear that Page Field would be too small to handle increasing future demand for commercial flights into the region.  Expanding Page Field was determined to be impractical because its airfield was constrained by U.S. 41 to the west and expanding the airfield to the east would require bridging the [[Ten Mile Canal]] and relocating a railroad track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Florida Regional Airport Environmental Impact Statement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_k0AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nA number of sites were considered for a new regional airport, including southern [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte County]], [[Estero, Florida|Estero]], and northeast Cape Coral near [[Burnt Store Marina, Florida|Burnt Store Marina]].  The government of Lee County ultimately selected a site near the end of [[County Road 876 (Lee County, Florida)|Daniels Road]] which was a dirt road at the time.  An advantage to this location was its proximity to [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]], which was under construction and would have an interchange with Daniels Road, providing easy access (Interstate 75 was opened to traffic through Fort Myers in 1979).<ref>{{cite web|title=Interstate 75|url=http://www.aaroads.com/guide.php?page=i0075fl|website=AA Roads|accessdate=28 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225161123/http://www.aaroads.com/guide.php?page=i0075fl|archive-date=February 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the airport began in 1980, and it opened on schedule on May 14, 1983, with a single 8400-ft runway.

The original terminal was located on the north side of the runway at the end of Chamberlin Parkway.\n\nThe airport was renamed '''Southwest Florida International Airport''' in 1993, though it had hosted international flights since 1984 and U.S. Customs since 1987. The name change coincided with the completion of a 55,000 square foot Federal Inspection facility annexed to the original terminal's Concourse A.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of Aviation in Lee County|url=http://www.flylcpa.com/uploads/pagesfiles/511.pdf|website=Southwest Florida International Airport|accessdate=12 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213624/http://www.flylcpa.com/uploads/pagesfiles/511.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The runway was also lengthened to 12,000&nbsp;ft (3,658 m) at the same time to better accommodate international service (making it the fourth-longest runway in Florida).<ref>{{cite web|title=Southwest Florida International Airport|url=http://www.freightmovesflorida.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/634665599509832500-southwest_florida_international_airport_12_22_11_2_.pdf?sfvrsn=0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016142025/http://www.freightmovesflorida.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/634665599509832500-southwest_florida_international_airport_12_22_11_2_.pdf?sfvrsn=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 October 2015|website=Freight Moves Florida|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988 the airport exceeded its annual capacity of 3 million passengers; by 2004, the airport was serving nearly 7 million passengers annually.  The original terminal had 17 gates on two concourses.  While three of the gates were added in a minor expansion of the B concourse in the late 1990s, the original terminal's design was not conducive to a major expansion.\n\nWith the terminal operating at more than double its intended capacity, construction of a new Midfield Terminal Complex began in February 2002. The $438 million terminal opened on September 9, 2005.

Demolition of the former terminal north of the airfield was completed in spring 2006.  However, the original terminal's parking lot and other related infrastructure still stand at the end of Chamberlin Parkway.\n\nIn early 2015, Terminal Access Road, the airport's main entrance road, was extended past Treeline Avenue to connect directly to Interstate 75, allowing airport-related traffic to avoid local streets.

The new air traffic control tower and parallel runway were expected to be completed by 2019, however this has been pushed back to late 2020. The apron expansion and crossfield taxiway system were completed in late 2013. The entire project is estimated to cost $454 million.\n\nIn early 2018, the Lee County Port Authority (LCPA) announced plans to ease seasonal security wait times by expanding and relocating the current security checkpoints for each concourse. By relocating each checkpoint, there will be more restaurants, shops, and post-security spaces. According to the announcement by the LCPA, this expansion could cost between $150 million - $180 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.news-press.com/story/news/2018/02/01/peak-season-checkpoint-waits-push-fort-myers-airport-toward-major-terminal-expansion/1042155001/ |title=Fort Myers airport to expand terminal, consolidate TSA screening to cut waits |publisher=News-press.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n\nPlans are in place for Skyplex \u2013 a commercial and industrial park in the location of the old terminal.

Tomasulo began his study of psychodrama and group therapy in 1980 with Jacquie Siroka and Bob Siroka. He was hired at [[Brookdale Community College]] in 1980 where he won the Master Teacher award and became professor of psychology. He worked there until 2001 and then moved to [[New Jersey City University]] where he developed the first online psychology courses and later the first permanent positive psychology course in the New Jersey state system. In 1998\u201399 he was a teaching fellow at [[Princeton University]] under the mentorship of [[John M. Darley]] in the psychology department and studied with Tony Award-winning playwright [[Christopher Durang]]. He won two international reTHINK Theatre playwriting competitions for his plays on mental health: ''Negatively Oriented Therapy N.O.T.'' (2012) and ''Sticks, Stones and the R Word'' (2010).<ref>[https://www.thebigidea.nz/stories/media-releases/202651-entry-call-for-international-arts-festival International Arts Festival]</ref><ref>[https://www.theatreview.org.nz/reviews/production.php?id=2811 Theatreview.org/reviews]</ref> Both plays premiered in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.\n\nMentored by the author [[Dani Shapiro]], Tomasulo studied creative nonfiction and earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] from [[The New School]] in 2001. He won the New School MFA Chapbook Competition for his essay \"Kettle of Fish,\" and later studied in the Master of Applied Positive Psychology (M.A.P.P.) at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. In 2012, he became an assistant instructor for [[Martin Seligman]], the Father of Positive Psychology, and James Pawelski, Director of Education and Senior Scholar at the Positive Psychology Center. He was the first psychologist and psychodramatist to graduate from the program and join the teaching staff.\n\nIn 1986, Tomasulo became licensed as a counselling psychologist in New Jersey. In 2005, he and Nancy Razza became the first psychologists to be given the New Jersey Healthcare Providers of the Year award for their work with people with intellectual disabilities. The American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama awarded him the David A. Kipper Scholar's Award for research<ref>[http://www.asgpp.org/pdf/Award%20Recipients.pdf American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama award recipients]</ref> and their Innovators Award for his clinical work in [[psychodrama]] with the developmentally disabled.<ref>[http://www.blatner.com/adam/pdntbk/asgppawards.html American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama award recipients]</ref> During 1992\u20132010, he served as contributing editor of their journal and in 2015 was guest editor for the ''New Jersey Psychologist Special Edition on Positive Psychology''. His most recent book ''American Snake Pit'' was published in 2018. In this memoir, Tomasulo chronicles the first experimental group home for the treatment of mentally ill patients coming from the infamous [[Willowbrook State School]], a hell on earth Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] called a \"snake pit.\" The Willowbrook Consent Decree was designed to protect the constitutional rights of these patients and move them out into the community.

They have won two Greek Cups (in 1979 and 1998), while they were runners-up in the Greek Championship during the 1950\u201351 and 1970\u201371 seasons.

They play their home games in [[Nea Smyrni Stadium]] with a capacity of 11,700 seats.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nThe club was founded in 1890 by a part of the sizeable Greek population of [[\u0130zmir]] ([[Greek (language)|Greek]]: \u03a3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7), under the name of \"[[Orpheus]] Music and Sports Club\".<ref>https://www.panioniosfc.gr/istoria-panionios</ref> In 1893, some Orpheus members keen on sports formed a separate organization, the \"Gymnasion Club\", and started holding yearly sports competitions. In 1898, Orpheus and Gymnasion merged again to form [[Panionios|Panionios GSS]].<ref>https://www.panioniosfc.gr/istoria-panionios</ref> Members of Panionios represented Greece in all international track and field games until these developed in the modern Olympic Games.\n\nAfter the Greek military defeat in [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|1922]] the club was forced to transfer, firstly to Athens and later, to the Athenian suburb of [[Nea Smyrni|New Smyrna]], where much of the population of [[Smyrna]] re-settled. The club always had a strong tradition of cultivating all major sports; it was the first Greek club to establish a [[track and field]] division for women, in 1925. Another major example of the club's contribution to Greek sports rests in the fact that it was Panionios that introduced Basketball and Volleyball in Greek sports society.\n\nWith the gradual transformation of men's football and basketball into professional sports, Panionios FC and [[Panionios Forthnet|Panionios BC]] became privately owned clubs operating under the auspices of the traditional \"amateur sports\" [[Panionios|Panionios GSS]]. To date, Panionios remains the only sports club in Greece that was awarded the Golden Cross from the Athens Academy as a recognition of the club's rich and continuous enrichment of Greek sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pgss.gr/default.asp?pid=24&la=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916230718/http://www.pgss.gr/default.asp?pid=24&la=2|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-09-16|title=Panionios' History|publisher=Panionios' Official Website}}</ref>\n\n===Recent years===\nPanionios has spent nearly its entire history in the Greek First Division (now called 'Super League'), having missed out from competing in Greek football's top division only twice in its more than 100-year history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Within this, Panionios rose quite often to high levels, with top achievement in terms of the league being the 2nd position that the club reached in 1971, losing the title from [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://omada.reporter.com.cy/football-greece/article/167181/|title=The best Panionios in professionally years!|publisher=omada.reporter.com|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> After 8 years, specifically on 9 June 1979, Panionios took his revenge back from AEK Athens in the final of the Greek Cup and conquering the title for the first time in his history after winning 3\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfootball.gr/k2/user-page/item/237-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CF%81%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%BA%CF%8D%CF%80%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B9%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85.html|title=The first Greek Cup of Panionios|publisher=oldfootball.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.panioniosfc.gr/2013/06/11/to-kupello-tou-1979/|title=The Cup of 1979|publisher=panioniosfc.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:20130814 AT-GR Alexandros Tziolis 2896 (cropped).jpg|thumb|110px|[[Alexandros Tziolis]]]]\n\nPanionios has produced all three major Greek strikers of the 1980s, namely [[Nikos Anastopoulos]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.contra.gr/Columns/Photostop/h-metagrafh-rekor-toy-anasto-to-moystaki-kai-h-polytelhs-zwh-sthn-italia.3421072.html|title=Nikos Anastopoulos|publisher=contra.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> (later of Olympiacos), [[Thomas Mavros]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfootball.gr/sansimera/item/76-poios-poios-o-mayros-o-theos.html|title=Thomas Mavros|publisher=oldfootball.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> (later of [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]), and [[Dimitris Saravakos]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfootball.gr/istoria-ppodosfairou/contact-page/item/42-2016-02-06-16-54-31.html|title=Dimitris Saravakos|publisher=oldfootball.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> (later of [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]]).

Karabatis and the Municipality of [[Nea Smyrni]] agreed to relocate the club in [[Nea Smyrni]], the Athens suburb that was mainly inhabited by Greek World War I refugees coming from [[\u0130zmir]], the club's historical home. Construction works started in 1938, and were completed one year later.\n\nIn the summer of 1940 the first football matches take place, with the club donating the money to support the repair of Greek Warship \"[[Greek cruiser Elli (1912)|''Elli'']]\" which was hit by Italian forces on World War II. On September later that year [[Panionios G.S.S.]] celebrated its 50th year together with the completion of building the new stadium.

The most recent ticket 'sold-out' was against [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] in 2008.\n\nApart from [[Panionios G.S.S.]] and its associated youth teams, the stadium was used for decades from [[Panionios G.S.S.]] athletes on track & field and numerous times from the Greek National U-21 and U-23 football teams. Additionally, due to the closing of many stadiums for renovation for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympic Games]], Nea Smyrni stadium was partly used from other football clubs as well. Those included [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] for the first half of the 2003\u201304 football season and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] for one match in February 2003 against [[OFI Crete F.C.|OFI]].

In this the shield had striped blue-colored colors and at the top left the Greek flag of the land and on the right an Ionic-style capital on a red background, referring to the Hellenism of the union and its Ionian roots. A similar crest has Panionios of [[Kalamata]]. Tsakiris reinstated the classic emblem of the club, the emblem that the club now uses, a shield with the colours of the group (cyan and red), used by the Greeks of the Ottoman Empire in a variety of events (for example the Hellenic-Ethos naval flag).\n\n===Colours===\nPanionios' colours are [[blue]], [[red]] and [[white]], mainly used as trim or as an alternative. However, after the destruction of Smyrna the colours for some took a different interpretation. The red is the blood of the Greeks who shed the persecution and the blue, the color of [[Greece]].\nOn the appearances of the team there was a characteristic diagonial strip, which can be seen today in the crest of the team.\n\n{|\n|\n{{Football kit\n| pattern_la= \n| pattern_b = \n| pattern_ra= \n| pattern_sh=\n| pattern_so=_band_white\n| leftarm   = ED2939\n| body      = ED2939\n| rightarm  = ED2939\n| shorts    = FFFFFF\n| socks     = FFFFFF\n| title   = 1908\n}}\n|\n{{Football kit\n| pattern_la= \n| pattern_b = _ redrightsash\n| pattern_ra= \n| pattern_sh=\n| pattern_so=_band_white\n| leftarm   = 045FB4\n| body      = 045FB4\n| rightarm  = 045FB4\n| shorts    = 045FB4\n| socks     = FF0000\n| title   = 1924\n}}\n|\n{{Football kit\n| pattern_la= \n| pattern_b = \n| pattern_ra= \n| pattern_sh=\n| pattern_so=_band_white\n| leftarm   = ED2939\n| body      = ED2939\n| rightarm  = ED2939\n| shorts    = 045FB4\n| socks     = 045FB4\n| title   = 1930\n}}\n|\n{{Football kit\n| pattern_la = _navylower\n| pattern_b = _3redstripes2\n| pattern_ra = _navylower\n| pattern_so = \n| leftarm = FF0000\n| body = 001A57\n| rightarm = FF0000\n| shorts = 001A57\n| socks = 001A57\n| title  = 2012\n}}\n|\n{{Football kit\n| pattern_la= \n| pattern_b =_blueredvertical-grey\n| pattern_ra=\n| pattern_so=_band_white\n| leftarm   = 000000\n| body      = 000000\n| rightarm  = 000000\n| shorts    = 000000\n| socks     = 000000\n| title  = 2013\u201314 (A)\n}}\n|\n{{Football kit\n |pattern_la=\n |pattern_b = _redblue_vertical\n |pattern_sh=\n |pattern_ra=\n |rightarm  =FFFFFF\n |body      =FFFFFF\n |leftarm   =FFFFFF\n |shorts    =FFFFFF\n| title  = 2014\u201315 (A)\n}}\n|\n{{Football kit\n|pattern_la  = _panioniosfc1617h\n|pattern_b    = _panioniosfc1617h\n|pattern_ra   = _panioniosfc1617h\n|pattern_sh   = \n|pattern_so  = \n|leftarm     = FFFFFF\n|body        = FFFFFF\n|rightarm   = FFFFFF\n|shorts       = 2447D5\n|socks       = F20D2F\n| title  = 2016\u201317\n}}\n|}\n\nCurrent sponsorships:\n*Great Shirt Sponsor: '''Car.gr'''\n*Official Sport Clothing Manufacturer: '''[[Luanvi]]'''\n*Golden Sponsor: '''Funky Buddha'''\n\n==Support==\nPanionios have a big fans base in [[Greece]].

Part of [[Panionios G.S.S.]] (founded in 1890 in [[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]], [[Ottoman Empire]]), '''Panionios F.C.''' is the oldest Greek football club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-fm.gr/article/podosfairo/paniwnios-i-istoria-tis-klironomias/3352445|title=Panionios' history from footballski.fr|publisher=sport-fm.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)]] and the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], the multi-sport club [[Panionios G.S.S.]] was transferred to Athens. They have won two Greek Cups (in 1979 and 1998), while they were runners-up in the Greek Championship during the 1950\u201351 and 1970\u201371 seasons. They have won also the [[1971 Balkans Cup]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panionianea.gr/2017/12/photos_15.html|title=Panionios wons Balkans Cup|publisher=panionianea.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> and reached the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1998\u201399 season.\n\nThe team currently competes in the [[Super League Greece]]. They play their home games in [[Nea Smyrni Stadium]] with a capacity of 11,700 seats.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nThe club was founded in 1890 by a part of the sizeable Greek population of [[Smyrna]] ([[Greek (language)|Greek]]: \u03a3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7), under the name of \"[[Orpheus]] Music and Sports Club\".<ref>https://www.panioniosfc.gr/istoria-panionios</ref> In 1893, some Orpheus members keen on sports formed a separate organization, the \"Gymnasion Club\", and started holding yearly sports competitions. In 1898, Orpheus and Gymnasion merged again to form [[Panionios|Panionios GSS]].<ref>https://www.panioniosfc.gr/istoria-panionios</ref> Members of Panionios represented Greece in all international track and field games until these developed in the modern Olympic Games.\n\nAfter the Greek military defeat in [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|1922]] the club was forced to transfer, firstly to Athens and later, to the Athenian suburb of [[Nea Smyrni|New Smyrna]], where much of the population of [[Smyrna]] re-settled. The club always had a strong tradition of cultivating all major sports; it was the first Greek club to establish a [[track and field]] division for women, in 1925. Another major example of the club's contribution to Greek sports rests in the fact that it was Panionios that introduced Basketball and Volleyball in Greek sports society.\n\nWith the gradual transformation of men's football and basketball into professional sports, Panionios FC and [[Panionios Forthnet|Panionios BC]] became privately owned clubs operating under the auspices of the traditional \"amateur sports\" [[Panionios|Panionios GSS]]. To date, Panionios remains the only sports club in Greece that was awarded the Golden Cross from the Athens Academy as a recognition of the club's rich and continuous enrichment of Greek sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pgss.gr/default.asp?pid=24&la=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916230718/http://www.pgss.gr/default.asp?pid=24&la=2|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-09-16|title=Panionios' History|publisher=Panionios' Official Website}}</ref>\n\n===Recent years===\nPanionios has spent nearly its entire history in the Greek First Division (now called 'Super League'), having missed out from competing in Greek football's top division only twice in its more than 100-year history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Within this, Panionios rose quite often to high levels, with top achievement in terms of the league being the 2nd position that the club reached in 1971, losing the title from [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://omada.reporter.com.cy/football-greece/article/167181/|title=The best Panionios in professionally years!|publisher=omada.reporter.com|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> After 8 years, specifically on 9 June 1979, Panionios took his revenge back from AEK Athens in the final of the Greek Cup and conquering the title for the first time in his history after winning 3\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfootball.gr/k2/user-page/item/237-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CF%81%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%BA%CF%8D%CF%80%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B9%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85.html|title=The first Greek Cup of Panionios|publisher=oldfootball.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.panioniosfc.gr/2013/06/11/to-kupello-tou-1979/|title=The Cup of 1979|publisher=panioniosfc.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:20130814 AT-GR Alexandros Tziolis 2896 (cropped).jpg|thumb|110px|[[Alexandros Tziolis]]]]\n\nPanionios has produced all three major Greek strikers of the 1980s, namely [[Nikos Anastopoulos]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.contra.gr/Columns/Photostop/h-metagrafh-rekor-toy-anasto-to-moystaki-kai-h-polytelhs-zwh-sthn-italia.3421072.html|title=Nikos Anastopoulos|publisher=contra.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> (later of Olympiacos), [[Thomas Mavros]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfootball.gr/sansimera/item/76-poios-poios-o-mayros-o-theos.html|title=Thomas Mavros|publisher=oldfootball.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> (later of [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]), and [[Dimitris Saravakos]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfootball.gr/istoria-ppodosfairou/contact-page/item/42-2016-02-06-16-54-31.html|title=Dimitris Saravakos|publisher=oldfootball.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> (later of [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]]).

Construction works started in 1938, and were completed one year later.\n\nIn the summer of 1940 the first football matches take place, with the club donating the money to support the repair of Greek Warship \"[[Greek cruiser Elli (1912)|''Elli'']]\" which was hit by Italian forces on World War II. On September later that year [[Panionios G.S.S.]] celebrated its 50th year together with the completion of building the new stadium.

The most recent ticket 'sold-out' was against [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] in 2008.\n\nApart from [[Panionios G.S.S.]] and its associated youth teams, the stadium was used for decades from [[Panionios G.S.S.]] athletes on track & field and numerous times from the Greek National U-21 and U-23 football teams. Additionally, due to the closing of many stadiums for renovation for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympic Games]], Nea Smyrni stadium was partly used from other football clubs as well.

In this the shield had striped blue-colored colors and at the top left the Greek flag of the land and on the right an Ionic-style capital on a red background, referring to the Hellenism of the union and its Ionian roots. A similar crest has Panionios of [[Kalamata]]. Tsakiris reinstated the classic emblem of the club, the emblem that the club now uses, a shield with the colours of the group (cyan and red), used by the Greeks of the Ottoman Empire in a variety of events (for example the Hellenic-Ethos naval flag).\n\n===Colours===\nPanionios' colours are [[blue]], [[red]] and [[white]], mainly used as trim or as an alternative. However, after the destruction of Smyrna the colours for some took a different interpretation.

In 1949, the Sunday edition, ''Sud Ouest Dimanche'' was launched. ''Sud Ouest'' covers the [[Gironde]], the [[Charente]], the [[Charente-Maritime]], the [[Dordogne]], the [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Atlantiques]] and the [[Lot et Garonne]] d\u00e9partements.

It served in [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|West Virginia]] before being transferred to the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]].\n\n==Initial Infantry Service==\nThe 17th Indiana was organized at [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], and mustered in June 12, 1861. It left the state for [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]], on July 1, 1861, and was subsequently attached to the District of the Kanawha until September, 1861. Cheat Mountain District, W. Va., to November, 1861. Governor Oliver P. Morton appointed [[John T. Wilder]] as the lieutenant colonel of the 17th Indiana Infantry Regiment three months after the regiment was organized. On March 2, 1862, Wilder became the regiment's colonel, replacing [[Milo Hascall]], who became a general.\n\n==Conversion to Mounted Infantry ==\n\nIn December 1862, the regiments colonel, [[John T.

After fruitless attempts to chase down rebel cavalry raiders on foot, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry.

The 17th drove the enemy before it along the seven mile length of the gap until they were halted by four brigades of infantry and four batteries of guns at the southeastern exit. The massive superiority of firepower the 17th and its brethren had with the Spencers allowed them to entrench and hold the southern entrance against numerous assaults by numerically superior rebel infantry and artillery through the rainy day until the sodden remainder of the XIV Corps slogged to join them at their position.\n\nWith the Lightning Brigade, the 17th found itself detached from the XIV Corps to serve as a mobile reserve for all three of the Corps within the Cumberland. After playing a key role in the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|feint]] that forced Bragg from Chattanooga, the regiment raided, skirmished, and scouted through the summer into the [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps. The 17th and the [[98th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|98th Illinois Mounted Infantry]] were assigned to 2nd Brigade under Colonel [[Eli Long]] of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps under Major General [[George Crook]].\n\nOn the 1st of October it started, as part of General Crook's command, in pursuit of General Wheeler, then in the Sequatchie Valley. On the night of the 3d the regiment attacked Crews rebel brigade at Thompson's Cove and routed them, capturing a number of arms and the battle flag ( ,i the Second Kentucky Cavalry, presented to them by the ladies of Elizabethtown, Kentucky; the regiment lost but one wounded. The next day it marched to McMinnville, where it skirmished with the enemy and drove him out of and beyond the town, losing two killed and four wounded. \n\nOn the 7th of October, when beyond Shelbyville, the regiment struck the enemy and attacked him, driving him from the field and into Parmington, where he made a stand. Here the Seventeenth charged the rebels, capturing three \nof Wheeler's guns, a great number of small arms and three hundred prisoners. The regiment lost forty-eight killed and wounded, including three commissioned officers. Crossing the Tennessee River at Lamb's Ferry on the \n9th, further pursuit was abandoned and the regiment moved to Huntsville, Alabama, from whence it started, on the 13th, in pursuit of the enemy under Forrest, Roddy, Wharton and others.\n\n==Service History==\n\nIts assignments are as follows:\n* 15th Brigade, Army of the Ohio, to January, 1862. \n* 15th Brigade, 4th Division, [[Army of the Ohio]], January, 1862. \n* 15th Brigade, 6th Division, Army of the Ohio, to September, 1862. \n* 15th Brigade, 6th Division, 2nd Corps, Army of the Ohio, to November, 1862. \n* 1st Brigade, 1st Division, Left Wing 14th Army Corps, Army of the Cumberland, to December, 1862. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division (Center), 14th Army Corps, to January, 1863. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, 14th Army Corps, to June, 1863. \n* 1st Brigade, 4th Division, 14th Army Corps, to October, 1863. \n* Wilder's Mounted Brigade, [[Army of the Cumberland]], to November, 1863. \n* 2nd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, November, 1863. \n* 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to October, 1864. \n* 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Wilson's Cavalry Corps, Military Division Mississippi, to August, 1865.<ref>[http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unininf2.htm Civil War Archive]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.
