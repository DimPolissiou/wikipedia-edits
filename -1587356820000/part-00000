From July to September 1792 [[Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez|General Dumouriez]] also misused the name Army of the Ardennes for the right wing of what was left of the Army of the North after the split, encamped at [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and the name of Army of the North for the left flank of the army.\n\nIt was reorganized by a decree of the [[Conseil ex\u00e9cutif]] on the first of March 1793, leading to only the right flank of the army keeping the name of Army of the Ardennes. The first division of the Army of the Ardennes re-merged back into the Army of the North on 5 October 1793, at which date the rest of the Army of the Ardennes continued as the Army of the Ardennes until 29 June 1794, when it merged with the Army of the North's right wing and the [[Army of the Moselle]]'s left wing to form the [[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]].\n\n== Command of the army ==\nAfter the command of La Fayette (July\u2013August 1792), Dumouriez leads the whole army from the 1st of October 1792 to the 4th of April 1793, but he is replaced by [[Ren\u00e9 Joseph de Lanoue|Lanoue]] and [[Alexis Le Veneur de Tilli\u00e8res|Leveneur]], both under the command of [[Francisco de Miranda|Miranda]], from the 12th of January to the 22nd of February.

The workshop has a number of staff and can modify and build vehicles. As of 2015, the site has expanded to house more vehicles.\n\n== Tiger 1 replica ==\n\nIn 2016, the museum workshop undertook construction of a Tiger 1 replica. This utilised a highly accurate, partially constructed Tiger 1 that was originally constructed for the movie [[Fury (2014 film)|Fury]], which in itself was an accurate replica of Tiger 131. The reconstruction utilised that upper portion of the Tiger, and also referenced original tiger parts the museum had purchased to make the whole tank. The bottom chassis was strengthened to be able to run, the first time the museum had produced its own tank from scratch. The Tiger reproduction uses a Scania truck engine. The running gear is T55 (Track,support arms and torsion bars) M110 Road wheels and the drive/ steering component is from a T62, but it is outwardly a running, almost completely accurate Tiger 1, except that the front drive sprocket (which due to the T62 T/case sits 200mm too high) and T55 Track. It was completed in November 2016, and is the only reproduction tank of this scale to be completed in Australia.\n\n== See also == \n*[[National Military Vehicle Museum]]\n*[[Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Army Tank Museum]]\n*[[The Army Museum Bandiana]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ausarmour.com Australian Armour and Artillery Museum] \u2013 official site\n* [http://www.travel-news-photos-stories.com/2014/12/new-tank-and-armour-museum-opens-in.html New Tank Museum Opens] \u2013 media report.

It was completed in November 2016, and is the only reproduction tank of this scale to be completed in Australia.\n\n== See also == \n*[[National Military Vehicle Museum]]\n*[[Royal Australian Armoured Corps Memorial and Army Tank Museum]]\n*[[The Army Museum Bandiana]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ausarmour.com Australian Armour and Artillery Museum] \u2013 official site\n* [http://www.travel-news-photos-stories.com/2014/12/new-tank-and-armour-museum-opens-in.html New Tank Museum Opens] \u2013 media report.

It is {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vancouver]]. Situated at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater]] rivers, it is the first major community encountered after travelling along [[British Columbia Highway 5|Phase One of the Coquihalla Highway]] and acts as the gateway to all other major highways to the B.C. Interior. The city developed in 1893 when part of the ranches owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and John Charters were surveyed for a town site.<ref name=history>{{Cite book|editor=Nicola Valley Museum Archives Association|title=Merritt & The Nicola Valley: An Illustrated History|year=1998|publisher=Sonotek Publishing|location=Merritt, BC|pages=32\u201337|isbn=0-929069-11-0 }}</ref>\n\nOnce known as Forksdale, the community adopted its current name in 1906 in honour of mining engineer and railway promoter [[William Hamilton Merritt III]].<ref name=\"akrigg\">Akrigg, Helen B. and Akrigg, G.P.V; 1001 British Columbia Place Names; Discovery Press, Vancouver 1969, 1970, 1973, p. 114</ref> The {{convert|24|km2|adj=on}} city limits consist of the community, a number of civic parks, historical sites, an aquatic centre, a local arena, a public library (which is a branch of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library System) and a civic centre. Merritt has dozens of bronzed hand prints of country music stars who have been in the city for the annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] displayed throughout town. Merritt is also home to a local radio station, a weekly newspaper and the [[Nicola Valley Institute of Technology]] campus. Nearby, there are four [[List of British Columbia Provincial Parks|provincial park]]s, numerous lakes, and several recreational trails. Merritt is known as the \"Country Music Capital of Canada\" for its wealth of country music attractions, activities, and events.\n\n[[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]], and [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] intersect at Merritt with [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] East connecting the city to [[Kelowna]] and [[Penticton]], [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] Northwest to [[Logan Lake, British Columbia|Logan Lake]], [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]] to [[Spences Bridge, British Columbia|Spences Bridge]] and [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] South to [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] North to [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] South to [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]], and [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] North to [[Kamloops]]. Merritt's economy is dominated by the primary industries of forestry, tourism, and service.\n\n== History ==\n\nFor years, the Merritt area was a gathering place for local European colonists and [[First Nations]], as the area was a focus of transportation routes used by early [[settler|pioneers]]. The grasslands eventually drew the attention of settlers interested in [[ranching]], and the first ranches were staked in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the 1880s three ranches located at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater River]]s, owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and the John Charters Estate, became the focus of a farming community known as \"The Forks\". With the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through [[British Columbia]] in 1885, interest increased in the [[coal]] deposits south of The Forks.\n\nParts of the ranches owned by Voght, Garcia and Charters were surveyed in 1893 for the townsite of Forksdale, but the name did not catch on with locals. Instead, the name was changed in 1906 to honour [[William Hamilton Merritt III]], a mining engineer and railway promoter. By 1907, the [[coal]] mines were in operation and with the completion of the railway from [[Spences Bridge]], government and other offices starting moving from [[Lower Nicola|Lower]] and [[Upper Nicola Band|Upper Nicola]] to establish Merritt as the major settlement in the [[Nicola Valley]].\n\nArmstrong's Store moved from Lower Nicola to Nicola Avenue in Merritt in the spring of 1907. G.B. Armstrong became Merritt's first [[postmaster]] at this location in 1908. In 1910, Armstrong's Department Store moved to 2025 Quilchena Avenue. In 1909, the [[Bank of Montreal]] moved from the settlement of Nicola to Merritt. A.E. Howse moved his department store to the west end of Nicola Avenue. The ''Nicola Herald'', founded at Nicola Lake in 1905, moved from Nicola to Merritt in 1909 and the name was changed to the ''[[Merritt Herald]] and Nicola Valley Advocate''. Other industries developed in the [[Nicola Valley|Valley]], including [[ranching]], copper, nickel, gold and silver mining, and [[forestry]], and as a result, new business buildings were constructed.\n\nThe move toward incorporation began in 1910 and culminated on April 1, 1911 when Merritt was granted its city charter. The first Merritt [[City Hall]] was built in 1912. The top floor was police headquarters, the second for administration offices, and the bottom for the jail. The building included the fire hall and tower that housed a whistle to summon the [[volunteer fire department|volunteer fire fighters]].\n\nMerritt dedicated the names of its streets and avenues to early settlers. Among the names honoured were Charters, Chapman, Cleasby, Garcia, Voght, Coutlee, Nicola, Granite, and Quilchena.\n\nAs the town grew, it featured a drug store, a general store, a brewery and a jewellery store. The first electrical power service by the city was provided in February 1913.\n\nMerritt and the Nicola Valley experienced prosperity until the passage of restrictive trade legislation in the United States in 1930. Because the city had financially backed one of the major sawmills, the loss of lumber markets caused the city to go into receivership from 1933 to 1952.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe next wave of immigrants, primarily [[Sikh]], from the [[Punjab region]] of India, arrived in Merritt in the 1950s, followed by a large influx in the late 1960s and early 1970s to work in the booming forestry sector of the time and adding to the cultural mosaic of Merritt. Known as [[Indo-Canadians]], they continue to play a crucial part in the economy\u2014Aspen Planers Ltd., a major employer in the city, and many other businesses, restaurants and hotels in Merritt are owned by members of this group.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=SFU Archives|url=http://aabc.bc.ca/access/aabc/archbc/display/SFU-143}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn advance polls during the 2015 Canadian elections, an unexpectedly high turnout in Merritt resulted in there being an insufficient quantity of ballots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kamloops/democracy-watch-calls-for-audit-after-voting-mix-ups-1.3270400|title=Democracy Watch calls for audit after voting mix-ups - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n[[File:Merritt-panorama.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Merritt in winter]]\nMerritt is composed of four distinct residential areas: Bench, Collettville, Central and Diamondvale. The Bench is a residential mountain bench, hence the name, sited on the northwest side of the valley. Collettville, on the southwest edge of the community south of the Coldwater River, was the newest addition to Merritt. Central is situated at the south of the city centre. Diamond Vale is in the heart of the valley, and is the most populated. Each area is served by an elementary school: [[Merritt Bench Elementary School|Bench Elementary]], [[Collettville Elementary School|Collettville Elementary and French Immersion]], [[Merritt Central Elementary School|Central Elementary]], [[Diamond Vale Elementary School|Diamond Vale Elementary]]. Also, a high school, [[Merritt Secondary School]], that services the area. The main office for [[School District 58 Nicola-Similkameen]], which operates the schools in the area, is also located in Merritt. The town is also served by the [[Nicola Valley Museum and Archives]].\n\n== Commerce and industry ==\n\nToday, [[ranching]], [[farming]], [[forestry]], [[transport]]ation and [[tourism]] are the primary [[industry|industries]]. Merritt is the nearest large community to the [[Douglas Lake Cattle Company]], Canada's largest working cattle ranch.\n\nMerritt was once host to an annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] that is estimated to have drawn as many as 148,000 people at its peak in the summer of 2005. The Mountain Music Festival, combined with the development of the Merritt Walk of Stars - a display of bronzed handprints of Mountainfest artists placed around the community - the Mural Project, designed by artist [[Michelle Loughery]]{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} , the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, Music in the Square and in the Park along with other tourism development activities have been used to solidify the city's branding as the Country Music Capital of Canada.\n\nMerritt's prime location has provided the opportunity to host many events, the West Coast Rally Association's Pacific Forest Rally, an off-road rally conducted as part of the Canadian Rally Championship series every October, also the annual winter Thunderbird Rally often begins and ends in Merritt. The Bass Coast Festival held annually on the BC Day weekend and supports electronic music and creative arts draws attendees from all over North America. The annual Labour Day Rodeo and Fall Fair are long standing traditions in this ranching valley, drawing participants from all over Canada and the US.\n\n== Merritt on film ==\n\nMerritt provided the backdrop for the [[Academy Award]]-nominated movie ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120255/locations|title=Filming Locations for The Sweet Hereafter|publisher=The Internet Movie Database (IMDB)|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref> The debut episode of ''[[Smallville]]'' was partly filmed on location in Merritt. [[Jack Nicholson]]'s ''[[The Pledge (film)|The Pledge]]'' and the 2006 remake of ''[[The Wicker Man (2006 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' were also filmed partly in the area. In 2013 ''[[Shana: The Wolf's Music]]'' directed by Nino Jacusso was released, it is a drama about a First Nations girl coming of age set in a First Nations location. The Nicola Valley is also host to the shooting of numerous commercials. Merritt is a member of the Thompson-Nicola Film Commission, which is a full-time, full service film commission representing the Thompson Nicola Regional District.\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe Merritt Mountain Music Festival was an outdoor music festival in Merritt, British Columbia, Canada. In 2005 the festival hosted a record-breaking attendance of approximately 148,000 people throughout the 6-day event. Over the years it has hosted country stars such as [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Reba McEntire]], and [[Wynonna Judd]].

It is {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vancouver]]. Situated at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater]] rivers, it is the first major community encountered after travelling along [[British Columbia Highway 5|Phase One of the Coquihalla Highway]] and acts as the gateway to all other major highways to the B.C. Interior. The city developed in 1893 when part of the ranches owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and John Charters were surveyed for a town site.<ref name=history>{{Cite book|editor=Nicola Valley Museum Archives Association|title=Merritt & The Nicola Valley: An Illustrated History|year=1998|publisher=Sonotek Publishing|location=Merritt, BC|pages=32\u201337|isbn=0-929069-11-0 }}</ref>\n\nOnce known as Forksdale, the community adopted its current name in 1906 in honour of mining engineer and railway promoter [[William Hamilton Merritt III]].<ref name=\"akrigg\">Akrigg, Helen B. and Akrigg, G.P.V; 1001 British Columbia Place Names; Discovery Press, Vancouver 1969, 1970, 1973, p. 114</ref> The {{convert|24|km2|adj=on}} city limits consist of the community, a number of civic parks, historical sites, an aquatic centre, a local arena, a public library (which is a branch of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library System) and a civic centre. Merritt has dozens of bronzed hand prints of country music stars who have been in the city for the annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] displayed throughout town. Merritt is also home to a local radio station, a weekly newspaper and the [[Nicola Valley Institute of Technology]] campus. Nearby, there are four [[List of British Columbia Provincial Parks|provincial park]]s, numerous lakes, and several recreational trails. Merritt is known as the \"Country Music Capital of Canada\" for its wealth of country music attractions, activities, and events.\n\n[[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]], and [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] intersect at Merritt with [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] East connecting the city to [[Kelowna]] and [[Penticton]], [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] Northwest to [[Logan Lake, British Columbia|Logan Lake]], [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]] to [[Spences Bridge, British Columbia|Spences Bridge]] and [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] South to [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] North to [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] South to [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]], and [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] North to [[Kamloops]]. Merritt's economy is dominated by the primary industries of forestry, tourism, and service.\n\n== History ==\n\nFor years, the Merritt area was a gathering place for local European colonists and [[First Nations]], as the area was a focus of transportation routes used by early [[settler|pioneers]]. The grasslands eventually drew the attention of settlers interested in [[ranching]], and the first ranches were staked in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the 1880s three ranches located at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater River]]s, owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and the John Charters Estate, became the focus of a farming community known as \"The Forks\". With the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through [[British Columbia]] in 1885, interest increased in the [[coal]] deposits south of The Forks.\n\nParts of the ranches owned by Voght, Garcia and Charters were surveyed in 1893 for the townsite of Forksdale, but the name did not catch on with locals. Instead, the name was changed in 1906 to honour [[William Hamilton Merritt III]], a mining engineer and railway promoter. By 1907, the [[coal]] mines were in operation and with the completion of the railway from [[Spences Bridge]], government and other offices starting moving from [[Lower Nicola|Lower]] and [[Upper Nicola Band|Upper Nicola]] to establish Merritt as the major settlement in the [[Nicola Valley]].\n\nArmstrong's Store moved from Lower Nicola to Nicola Avenue in Merritt in the spring of 1907. G.B. Armstrong became Merritt's first [[postmaster]] at this location in 1908. In 1910, Armstrong's Department Store moved to 2025 Quilchena Avenue. In 1909, the [[Bank of Montreal]] moved from the settlement of Nicola to Merritt. A.E. Howse moved his department store to the west end of Nicola Avenue. The ''Nicola Herald'', founded at Nicola Lake in 1905, moved from Nicola to Merritt in 1909 and the name was changed to the ''[[Merritt Herald]] and Nicola Valley Advocate''. Other industries developed in the [[Nicola Valley|Valley]], including [[ranching]], copper, nickel, gold and silver mining, and [[forestry]], and as a result, new business buildings were constructed.\n\nThe move toward incorporation began in 1910 and culminated on April 1, 1911 when Merritt was granted its city charter. The first Merritt [[City Hall]] was built in 1912. The top floor was police headquarters, the second for administration offices, and the bottom for the jail. The building included the fire hall and tower that housed a whistle to summon the [[volunteer fire department|volunteer fire fighters]].\n\nMerritt dedicated the names of its streets and avenues to early settlers. Among the names honoured were Charters, Chapman, Cleasby, Garcia, Voght, Coutlee, Nicola, Granite, and Quilchena.\n\nAs the town grew, it featured a drug store, a general store, a brewery and a jewellery store. The first electrical power service by the city was provided in February 1913.\n\nMerritt and the Nicola Valley experienced prosperity until the passage of restrictive trade legislation in the United States in 1930. Because the city had financially backed one of the major sawmills, the loss of lumber markets caused the city to go into receivership from 1933 to 1952.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe next wave of immigrants, primarily [[Sikh]], from the [[Punjab region]] of India, arrived in Merritt in the 1950s, followed by a large influx in the late 1960s and early 1970s to work in the booming forestry sector of the time and adding to the cultural mosaic of Merritt.

This joke was pitched by [[Tom Gammill]], and there was a debate among the staff of the show about whether or not to include it in the episode as Native Americans could find it offensive.

But, hey, there's an embarrassment ''of riches'' at the Caesar's Pow-Wow Indian Casino. You can bet on it!'

It should not be confused with the [[Regular Reserve (United Kingdom)|Regular Reserve]] whose members have formerly served full-time. The Army Reserve was previously known as the '''[[Territorial Force]]''' from 1908 to 1921, the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1921 to 1967, the '''Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve''' (TAVR) from 1967 to 1979, and again the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1979 to 2014.\n\nThe Army Reserve was created as the Territorial Force in 1908 by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Haldane]], when the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] combined the previously civilian-administered [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], with the mounted [[Yeomanry]] (at the same time the [[Militia#United Kingdom|Militia]] was renamed the [[Special Reserve]]). Most Volunteer infantry units had unique identities, but lost these in the reorganisation, becoming Territorial battalions of Regular Army infantry regiments. Only one infantry unit, the [[London Regiment (1993)|London Regiment]], has maintained a separate identity.\n\nIts original purpose was home defence, although the establishment of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967 involved a restructuring and revised doctrine leading to the provision of routine support for the regular army overseas. Reservists in the past also served as [[constable]]s or [[bailiff]]s, even holding positions of civic duty as overseer of their parish. The more modern Yeomen of the 18th century were cavalry-based units, which were often used to suppress riots (see the [[Peterloo Massacre]]). Several units that are now part of the Army Reserve bear the title \"militia\",<ref>e.g. [[Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers]] (Militia), The Jersey Field Squadron (Militia), The [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]], 4th (Volunteer) Battalion, the [[Royal Irish Rangers|Royal Irish Rangers (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th)]] (North Irish Militia) (until 1993)</ref> reflecting their origins as part of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|that organisation]] prior to the formation of the Special Reserve in 1907.\n\nDuring periods of [[total war]], the Army Reserve is incorporated by the [[Royal Prerogative]] into Regular Service under one code of Military Law for the duration of hostilities or until de-activation is decided upon. After the [[Second World War]], for example, the Army Reserve \u2013 or Territorial Army as it was known then \u2013 was not demobilised until 1947. Army Reservists normally have a full-time civilian job or career, which in some cases provides skills and expertise that are directly transferable to a specialist military role, such as [[National Health Service|NHS]] employees serving in Reservist [[Army Medical Services]] units. All Army Reserve personnel have their civilian jobs protected to a limited extent by law should they be compulsorily mobilised. There is, however, no legal protection against discrimination in employment for membership of the Army Reserve in the normal course of events (i.e. when not mobilised).\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation to First World War===\n{{Main|Territorial Force}}\n\nThe Territorial Force was originally formed by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Burdon Haldane]], following the enactment of the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] which combined and re-organised the old [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] with the [[Yeomanry]]. As part of the same process, remaining units of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] were converted to the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]]. The TF was formed on 1 April 1908 and contained fourteen [[infantry]] [[division (military)|division]]s, and fourteen mounted yeomanry [[brigade]]s. It had an overall strength of approximately 269,000.\n\nThe individual units that made up each division or brigade were administered by County Associations, with the county's [[lord lieutenant]] as president. The other members of the association consisted of ''military members'' (chosen from the commanding officers of the units), ''representative members'' (nominated by the [[county council]]s and [[county borough]]s in the lieutenancy county) and ''co-opted members'' (often retired military officers). Associations took over any property vested in the volunteers or yeomanry under their administration. Each regiment or battalion had a [[Standing army|Regular Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] attached as full-time adjutant.\n\nThe use of the word ''territorial'' signified that the volunteers who served with the force were under no obligation to serve overseas\u2014in 1910, when asked to nominate for Imperial Service overseas in the event of mobilisation, less than 10% of the Force chose to do so. In August 1914, after the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], territorial units were given the option of serving in [[France]] and, by 25 August, in excess of seventy [[battalion]]s had volunteered. This question over the availability of territorial divisions for overseas service was one of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s motivations for raising the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] separately.\n\nTerritorial formations initially saw service in [[Egypt]] and [[British Raj|British India]] and other [[British Empire|Empire]] garrisons, such as [[Gibraltar]], thereby releasing regular units for service in France and enabling the formation of an additional five regular army divisions (for a total of eleven) by early 1915. Several reserve units were also deployed with regular formations and the first territorial unit to see action on the Western Front was the [[32 (Scottish) Signal Regiment|Glasgow Territorial Signallers Group, Royal Engineers]] at the [[First Battle of Ypres]] on 11 October 1914. The first fully Territorial division to join the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] was the [[46th (North Midland) Division]] in March 1915, with divisions later serving in [[Gallipoli]] and elsewhere. As the war progressed, and casualties mounted, the distinctive character of territorial units was diluted by the inclusion of conscript and New Army drafts. Following [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the Armistice]] all units of the Territorial Force were gradually disbanded.\n\n===Interwar re-establishment and the Second World War===\nThe Territorial Force (TF) was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the [[Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921]] and renamed in October as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA).<ref>Beckett 2008 p. 97</ref> The First-Line divisions (that were created in 1907 or 1908) were reconstituted in that year. The TA's intended role was to be the sole method of expanding the size of the [[British Armed Forces]], when compared to the varied methods used during the First World War including the creation of Kitchener's Army.

To avoid war, the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] met with German [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Adolf Hitler]] in September and brokered the [[Munich Agreement]]. The agreement averted a war and allowed Germany to [[Annexation|annex]] the Sudetenland.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=258\u2013275}} Although Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to further peaceful resolution of issues, relations between both countries soon deteriorated.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=277\u2013278}} On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|the remnants of the Czech state]].{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=281}}\n\nOn 29 March, Secretary of State for War [[Leslie Hore-Belisha]] announced plans to increase the TA from 130,000 to 340,000 men and double the number of TA divisions.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=518}} The plan was for existing TA units to recruit over their establishments (aided by an increase in pay for Territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion which had hindered recruiting, construction of better-quality barracks and an increase in supper rations) and then form second-line divisions from cadres that could be increased.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=518}}{{sfn|Messenger|1994|p=47}} In April, limited [[conscription]] was introduced.

The TA would join regular army divisions completed their training, with the final divisions of the entire force deployed one year after the war began.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=455, 507, 514\u2013515}} A mixture of First and Second Line formations were deployed for combat overseas.

The cadres became part of a \"sponsoring\" TAVR II unit, although continuing to wear the badges and perpetuating the traditions of their forebears.

Some brigades were re-formed which consisted mostly of TA units.\n\nThe TA was thus re-roled into its modern form. Instead of supplying complete combat divisions, its function was to round out regular formations by supplying units of up to battalion size (including infantry, light artillery and [[Formation reconnaissance regiment|formation reconnaissance]]), and to supply extra support functions, such as engineers, medical units and military police.\n\n===1998 onwards===\nAfter the [[Strategic Defence Review]] of 1998, the TA's size of around 56,200 was further reduced. The Infantry suffered most, with 87 companies in 33 battalions reducing to 67 companies in 15 battalions. As of 2006, the Territorial Army had an authorised strength of 42,000 though recruiting difficulties put the actual strength of the TA significantly below that figure (manning is currently at approx 82% across the board, which equates to 34,000, while the actual strength of certain units is almost a skeleton crew, making them unsustainable without direct intervention by full-time personnel).\n\nArmy Reservists have seen service in a number of conflicts that the UK has been involved with since 1945. However, they served in particularly large numbers in two conflicts: the [[Korean War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]; both occurred during the 1950s and, on each occasion, the entire TA was called up. Throughout the Cold War, however, the Territorial Army was never regarded as a particularly usable force overseas, either by the Government of the day or by the Regular Army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} This was due to the fact that the entire Territorial Army had to be mobilised by [[Royal Prerogative]] in a wartime scenario, as occurred in the World Wars, with no flexibility to use smaller formations or specialists if required and, as a result, relied purely on territorials willing to volunteer their services. Therefore, its role was, at least unofficially, seen as home defence and, as a result, the TA was not used in conflicts such as the 1982 [[Falklands War]] and 1991 [[Gulf War]]<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm TA History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514150113/http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm |date=May 14, 2007 }}</ref> (205 Scottish General Hospital was mobilised as a unit based in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], during the 1991 Gulf War and a number of TA staff officers and others volunteered and served during the conflict, either in supporting roles in Germany or within 1 (UK) Armoured Division in the Middle East.) Some 550 TA personnel volunteered for and deployed on Op RESOLUTE in December 1995; the UK's contribution to the NATO mission to enforce peace in the Former Yugoslavia. The Government subsequently passed the [[Reserve Forces Act 1996]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/14/contents|title=Reserve Forces Act 1996|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref> which enables individual Reservists to be compulsorily called up for deployment, with certain [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]s exempting those in full-time education and other compassionate reasons, as well as providing protection by employment law for members' civilian jobs should they be mobilised, which has led to the Army Reserve increasingly providing routine support for the Regular Army overseas including delivery of composite units to release regular units from standing liabilities; including Bosnia, Kosovo, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands.\n\nIn 2003, 9,500 reservists, the vast majority of them from the Reserve, were mobilised to take part in [[Operation TELIC]], the invasion of [[Iraq]]; in contrast, only some 420 Regular Reservists were called-up. Approximately 1,200 members of the Army Reserve deployed annually on [[Tour of duty|tours of duty]] in Iraq, [[Operation HERRICK]] in [[Afghanistan]] and elsewhere, normally on six month-long [[roulement]]s. They cannot be used in operations for more than twelve months in any three-year period \u2013 making most of those who have already served ineligible for call up for two years afterwards, although reservists may choose to volunteer for additional deployments.\n\nArmy Reservists have a minimum commitment to serve 27 training days per annum, or 19 days for some national units. This period normally includes a two-week period of continuous training either as an Army Reserve unit, on courses or attached to a Regular unit. Army Reserve soldiers are paid at a similar rate as their regular equivalents while engaged on military activities. Soldiers of the Army Reserve often serve alongside their regular counterparts, including operations in Afghanistan where 1,000 out of the total 10,100 deployed have been Reservists{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, around 10% of the total.

It should not be confused with the [[Regular Reserve (United Kingdom)|Regular Reserve]] whose members have formerly served full-time. The Army Reserve was previously known as the '''[[Territorial Force]]''' from 1908 to 1921, the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1921 to 1967, the '''Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve''' (TAVR) from 1967 to 1979, and again the '''Territorial Army''' (TA) from 1979 to 2014.\n\nThe Army Reserve was created as the Territorial Force in 1908 by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Haldane]], when the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] combined the previously civilian-administered [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]], with the mounted [[Yeomanry]] (at the same time the [[Militia#United Kingdom|Militia]] was renamed the [[Special Reserve]]). Most Volunteer infantry units had unique identities, but lost these in the reorganisation, becoming Territorial battalions of Regular Army infantry regiments. Only one infantry unit, the [[London Regiment (1993)|London Regiment]], has maintained a separate identity.\n\nIts original purpose was home defence, although the establishment of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967 involved a restructuring and revised doctrine leading to the provision of routine support for the regular army overseas. Reservists in the past also served as [[constable]]s or [[bailiff]]s, even holding positions of civic duty as overseer of their parish. The more modern Yeomen of the 18th century were cavalry-based units, which were often used to suppress riots (see the [[Peterloo Massacre]]). Several units that are now part of the Army Reserve bear the title \"militia\",<ref>e.g. [[Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers]] (Militia), The Jersey Field Squadron (Militia), The [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey]], 4th (Volunteer) Battalion, the [[Royal Irish Rangers|Royal Irish Rangers (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th)]] (North Irish Militia) (until 1993)</ref> reflecting their origins as part of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|that organisation]] prior to the formation of the Special Reserve in 1907.\n\nDuring periods of [[total war]], the Army Reserve is incorporated by the [[Royal Prerogative]] into Regular Service under one code of Military Law for the duration of hostilities or until de-activation is decided upon. After the [[Second World War]], for example, the Army Reserve \u2013 or Territorial Army as it was known then \u2013 was not demobilised until 1947. Army Reservists normally have a full-time civilian job or career, which in some cases provides skills and expertise that are directly transferable to a specialist military role, such as [[National Health Service|NHS]] employees serving in Reservist [[Army Medical Services]] units. All Army Reserve personnel have their civilian jobs protected to a limited extent by law should they be compulsorily mobilised. There is, however, no legal protection against discrimination in employment for membership of the Army Reserve in the normal course of events (i.e. when not mobilised).\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation to First World War===\n{{Main|Territorial Force}}\n\nThe Territorial Force was originally formed by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Burdon Haldane]], following the enactment of the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] which combined and re-organised the old [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] with the [[Yeomanry]]. As part of the same process, remaining units of [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] were converted to the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]]. The TF was formed on 1 April 1908 and contained fourteen [[infantry]] [[division (military)|division]]s, and fourteen mounted yeomanry [[brigade]]s. It had an overall strength of approximately 269,000.\n\nThe individual units that made up each division or brigade were administered by County Associations, with the county's [[lord lieutenant]] as president. The other members of the association consisted of ''military members'' (chosen from the commanding officers of the units), ''representative members'' (nominated by the [[county council]]s and [[county borough]]s in the lieutenancy county) and ''co-opted members'' (often retired military officers). Associations took over any property vested in the volunteers or yeomanry under their administration. Each regiment or battalion had a [[Standing army|Regular Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] attached as full-time adjutant.\n\nThe use of the word ''territorial'' signified that the volunteers who served with the force were under no obligation to serve overseas\u2014in 1910, when asked to nominate for Imperial Service overseas in the event of mobilisation, less than 10% of the Force chose to do so. In August 1914, after the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], territorial units were given the option of serving in [[France]] and, by 25 August, in excess of seventy [[battalion]]s had volunteered. This question over the availability of territorial divisions for overseas service was one of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s motivations for raising the [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] separately.\n\nTerritorial formations initially saw service in [[Egypt]] and [[British Raj|British India]] and other [[British Empire|Empire]] garrisons, such as [[Gibraltar]], thereby releasing regular units for service in France and enabling the formation of an additional five regular army divisions (for a total of eleven) by early 1915. Several reserve units were also deployed with regular formations and the first territorial unit to see action on the Western Front was the [[32 (Scottish) Signal Regiment|Glasgow Territorial Signallers Group, Royal Engineers]] at the [[First Battle of Ypres]] on 11 October 1914. The first fully Territorial division to join the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] was the [[46th (North Midland) Division]] in March 1915, with divisions later serving in [[Gallipoli]] and elsewhere. As the war progressed, and casualties mounted, the distinctive character of territorial units was diluted by the inclusion of conscript and New Army drafts. Following [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the Armistice]] all units of the Territorial Force were gradually disbanded.\n\n===Interwar re-establishment and the Second World War===\nThe Territorial Force (TF) was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the [[Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921]] and renamed in October as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA).<ref>Beckett 2008 p. 97</ref> The First-Line divisions (that were created in 1907 or 1908) were reconstituted in that year. The TA's intended role was to be the sole method of expanding the size of the [[British Armed Forces]], when compared to the varied methods used during the First World War including the creation of Kitchener's Army. All TA recruits were required to take the general service obligation: if the [[Government of United Kingdom|British Government]] decided, territorial soldiers could be deployed overseas for combat that avoided the complications of the TF, whose members were not required to leave Britain unless they volunteered for overseas service.{{sfn|Allport|2015|p=323}}{{sfn|French|2001|p=53}}{{sfn|Perry|1988|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfn|Simkins|2007|pp=43\u201346}}\n\nThe composition of the divisions was altered, with a reduction in the number of infantry battalions required. There was also a reduced need for cavalry, and of the 55 yeomanry regiments, only the 14 most senior retained their horses. The remaining yeomanry were converted to artillery or armoured car units or disbanded.<ref>New Territorial Army \u2013 The Government Scheme, ''The Times'', January 31, 1920</ref><ref>New Citizen Army \u2013 2nd Line Defence Scheme, ''The Times'', January 31, 1920</ref> The amalgamation of 40 pairs of infantry battalions was announced in October 1921.<ref>Territorial Army Reduction, ''The Times'', July 15, 1921</ref><ref>Territorial Army Amalgamations \u2013 40 Battalions Affected ''The Times'', October 5, 1921</ref> As part of the post-war \"[[Geddes Axe]]\" financial cuts, the TA was further reduced in size in 1922: artillery batteries lost two of their six guns, the established size of infantry battalions was cut and ancillary medical, veterinary, signals and [[Royal Army Service Corps]] units were either reduced in size or abolished.<ref>Territorial Army Reductions \u2013 \u00a31,650,000 to be saved, ''The Times'', March 4, 1922</ref> The bounty was also reduced to \u00a33 for trained men and \u00a32.10s 0d for recruits, which resulted in finding \u00a31,175,000 of the total savings required from the army as a whole.<ref>Ian F.

To avoid war, the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] met with German [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Adolf Hitler]] in September and brokered the [[Munich Agreement]]. The agreement averted a war and allowed Germany to [[Annexation|annex]] the Sudetenland.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=258\u2013275}} Although Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to further peaceful resolution of issues, relations between both countries soon deteriorated.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=277\u2013278}} On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|the remnants of the Czech state]].{{sfn|Bell|1997|p=281}}\n\nOn 29 March, Secretary of State for War [[Leslie Hore-Belisha]] announced plans to increase the TA from 130,000 to 340,000 men and double the number of TA divisions.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=518}} The plan was for existing TA units to recruit over their establishments (aided by an increase in pay for Territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion which had hindered recruiting, construction of better-quality barracks and an increase in supper rations) and then form second-line divisions from cadres that could be increased.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=518}}{{sfn|Messenger|1994|p=47}} In April, limited [[conscription]] was introduced. This resulted in 34,500 twenty-year-old militiamen being conscripted into the regular army, initially to be trained for six months before deployment to the forming second-line units.{{sfn|Messenger|1994|p=49}}{{sfn|French|2001|p=64}} It was envisioned that the duplicating process and recruiting the required numbers of men would take no more than six months.

The TA's war deployment plan envisioned the divisions being deployed, as equipment became available, in waves to reinforce the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) that had already been dispatched to Europe. The TA would join regular army divisions completed their training, with the final divisions of the entire force deployed one year after the war began.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=455, 507, 514\u2013515}} A mixture of First and Second Line formations were deployed for combat overseas.

Thus, on 1 May 1961, the TA divisional headquarters were merged with regular army districts, which were matched with Civil Defence Regions to aid mobilisation for war.<ref>Beckett 2008, 183, 185.</ref> The number of infantry brigades was<!--'number' is the subject: the number was reduced--> reduced from 31 to 23, and the two armoured brigades were disbanded.\n\n{{anchor|TAVR}}This was followed by a complete reorganisation announced in the [[1966 Defence White Paper]] from 1 April 1967, when the title '''Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve''' (TAVR) was adopted, that abolished the former regimental and divisional structure of the TA.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=f9jMDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA106&dq=Territorial+and+Army+Volunteer+Reserve+%221+April+1967%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwifrML7t8LeAhWBk4sKHdiPBjIQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=Territorial%20and%20Army%20Volunteer%20Reserve%20%221%20April%201967%22&f=false|title=The Statesman's Year-Book 1967\u201368: The One-Volume ENCYCLOPAEDIA of all nations|last=Steinberg|first=S.|date=2016-12-27|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9780230270961|location=|pages=106|language=en}}</ref> Units in the new TAVR were divided into four categories:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=gn27AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA282&lpg=PA282&dq=%22TAVR+I%22+%22TAVR+II%22+%22TAVR+III%22+army&source=bl&ots=4zm3yQffph&sig=ACfU3U0absPgvfaUvy2MtLegu7J6m_KJ6A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijxPzisMHgAhUVi3AKHceED8sQ6AEwCXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22TAVR%20I%22%20%22TAVR%20II%22%20%22TAVR%20III%22%20army&f=false|title=The Amateur Military Tradition, 1558\u20131945|last=Beckett|first=Ian Frederick William|date=1991|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=|isbn=9780719029127|location=|pages=282|language=en}}</ref><ref>Frederick, p. 326.</ref>\n\n*'''The Volunteers''' - units given designation of (V)\n**Special Army Volunteer Reserve - TAVR I - 'Ever Readies', 6 battalions ready for UN Duty, bringing the regular army to war establishment and replace casualties.\n***TAVR IA (Independent units)\n***TAVR IB (Sponsored)\n***Individuals from TAVR IA & IB\n**TAVR II - forces called 'The Volunteers'\n***TAVR IIA (Independent) - ie: 51st Highland Volunteers\n***TAVR IIB (Sponsored)\n*'''The Territorials''' - TAVR III\n**TAVR III (Independent), - units given (T) designation, mostly [[Cadre (military)|cadres]], maintaining law and order in the event of nuclear attack and were available for home defence, service, and help in case of emergencies\n*TAVR (Sponsored) - University OTC (UOTC), bands, and miscellaneous units.\n\nTAVR I and II units were known as \"Volunteers\", and those in TAVR III as \"Territorials\".

The cadres became part of a \"sponsoring\" TAVR II unit, although continuing to wear the badges and perpetuating the traditions of their forebears. An increase in the size of the TAVR in 1971 led to the formation of a number of battalions based on these cadres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/lists/ta1969.htm |title=Regiments of the British TERRITORIAL & ARMY VOLUNTEER RESERVE 1967 at regiments.org by T.F.Mills |accessdate=2015-02-13 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715140005/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/lists/ta1969.htm |archivedate=2007-07-15 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.win.tue.nl/~drenth/BritArmy/Lineage/ Lineage of British Army Regiments 1967 \u2013 2000 by Wienand Drieth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331142241/http://www.win.tue.nl/~drenth/BritArmy/Lineage/ |date=2012-03-31 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the Territorial Army title was restored and, in the following years, its size was somewhat increased, with the regimental system being progressively reinstated. Some brigades were re-formed which consisted mostly of TA units.\n\nThe TA was thus re-roled into its modern form. Instead of supplying complete combat divisions, its function was to round out regular formations by supplying units of up to battalion size (including infantry, light artillery and [[Formation reconnaissance regiment|formation reconnaissance]]), and to supply extra support functions, such as engineers, medical units and military police.\n\n===1998 onwards===\nAfter the [[Strategic Defence Review]] of 1998, the TA's size of around 56,200 was further reduced. The Infantry suffered most, with 87 companies in 33 battalions reducing to 67 companies in 15 battalions. As of 2006, the Territorial Army had an authorised strength of 42,000 though recruiting difficulties put the actual strength of the TA significantly below that figure (manning is currently at approx 82% across the board, which equates to 34,000, while the actual strength of certain units is almost a skeleton crew, making them unsustainable without direct intervention by full-time personnel).\n\nArmy Reservists have seen service in a number of conflicts that the UK has been involved with since 1945. However, they served in particularly large numbers in two conflicts: the [[Korean War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]; both occurred during the 1950s and, on each occasion, the entire TA was called up. Throughout the Cold War, however, the Territorial Army was never regarded as a particularly usable force overseas, either by the Government of the day or by the Regular Army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} This was due to the fact that the entire Territorial Army had to be mobilised by [[Royal Prerogative]] in a wartime scenario, as occurred in the World Wars, with no flexibility to use smaller formations or specialists if required and, as a result, relied purely on territorials willing to volunteer their services. Therefore, its role was, at least unofficially, seen as home defence and, as a result, the TA was not used in conflicts such as the 1982 [[Falklands War]] and 1991 [[Gulf War]]<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm TA History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514150113/http://www.army.mod.uk/unitsandorgs/ta/ta_history.htm |date=May 14, 2007 }}</ref> (205 Scottish General Hospital was mobilised as a unit based in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], during the 1991 Gulf War and a number of TA staff officers and others volunteered and served during the conflict, either in supporting roles in Germany or within 1 (UK) Armoured Division in the Middle East.) Some 550 TA personnel volunteered for and deployed on Op RESOLUTE in December 1995; the UK's contribution to the NATO mission to enforce peace in the Former Yugoslavia. The Government subsequently passed the [[Reserve Forces Act 1996]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/14/contents|title=Reserve Forces Act 1996|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref> which enables individual Reservists to be compulsorily called up for deployment, with certain [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]]s exempting those in full-time education and other compassionate reasons, as well as providing protection by employment law for members' civilian jobs should they be mobilised, which has led to the Army Reserve increasingly providing routine support for the Regular Army overseas including delivery of composite units to release regular units from standing liabilities; including Bosnia, Kosovo, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands.\n\nIn 2003, 9,500 reservists, the vast majority of them from the Reserve, were mobilised to take part in [[Operation TELIC]], the invasion of [[Iraq]]; in contrast, only some 420 Regular Reservists were called-up. Approximately 1,200 members of the Army Reserve deployed annually on [[Tour of duty|tours of duty]] in Iraq, [[Operation HERRICK]] in [[Afghanistan]] and elsewhere, normally on six month-long [[roulement]]s. They cannot be used in operations for more than twelve months in any three-year period \u2013 making most of those who have already served ineligible for call up for two years afterwards, although reservists may choose to volunteer for additional deployments.\n\nArmy Reservists have a minimum commitment to serve 27 training days per annum, or 19 days for some national units. This period normally includes a two-week period of continuous training either as an Army Reserve unit, on courses or attached to a Regular unit. Army Reserve soldiers are paid at a similar rate as their regular equivalents while engaged on military activities. Soldiers of the Army Reserve often serve alongside their regular counterparts, including operations in Afghanistan where 1,000 out of the total 10,100 deployed have been Reservists{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, around 10% of the total. The annual budget of the Army Reserve is approximately \u00a3350 million \u2013 around 1.3% of the total [[List of countries and federations by military expenditures|defence budget]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armedforces.co.uk/army/listings/l0070.html|title=British Army \u2013 Reserve Forces \u2013 Types of Reservist and Manpower Strength \u2013 Armed Forces \u2013 a11a3|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2011 onwards and renaming===\n[[File:Army Reservists Applying Camouflage MOD 45156159.jpg|thumb|Army Reservists applying camouflage during a training exercise]]\nUnder the \"Future Reserves 2020\" (FR20) plan outlined by then Secretary of State for Defence [[Liam Fox]] on 18 July 2011, the Ministry of Defence promised to provide more money to train more Army Reservists with the objective of more frequently deploying entire Army Reserve units{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} (much like [[United States Army Reserve]] and [[Army National Guard]] units). Under the reform plan, the total force will be restructured so that, by 2020, the British Army will have 120,000 soldiers, of which 84,000 will be Regulars and 35,000 Reservists (a ratio of 70/30).

This is normally conducted by the Arm or Service that the recruit is joining, for example for infantry units, Phase 2 consists of the two-week Combat Infantryman's Course (TA) (CIC (TA)) held at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]], [[Catterick Garrison|Catterick]].<ref name=\"Ministry of Defence\"/>\n\n===Officers===\n\nTo gain a commission, Potential Officers have to pass through four modules of training, which together form the Army Reserve Commissioning Course.\n\n'''Module A''' consists of basic field training and elementary military skills. This can be completed at either a UOTC over a number of weekends, or over 2 weeks at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] (RMAS)\n\n'''Module B''' covers training in Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine and Navigation, both in theory and in practice, with a focus on the section battle drills and the platoon combat estimate. This training can either be spread over 10 weekends at a UOTC, or 2 weeks at the RMAS.\n\n'''Module C''' builds on the Tactics, Leadership, Doctrine and Navigation taught in Module B, with a greater focus on the theory behind these constructs. CBRN training is also added at this point, and Officer Cadets undergo a number of field exercises to test their military and leadership skills. Module C can only be undertaken at the RMAS.\n\n'''Module D''' Once the Officer Cadet has completed their ArmyOfficer Selection Board, they can complete this final module, after which they will become commissioned officers in the British Army. Based at the RMAS, this module consists primarily of a prolonged field exercise, followed by drill training in preparation for the passing out parade.\n\nOn successful completion of Module D, the Officer Cadets receive their [[Commission (document)|Commission]] and become [[Second Lieutenant]]s. Further training that is required prior to them being considered for operational deployment and promotion to [[Lieutenant]] includes:\n\n'''Post Commissioning Training''' (formerly known as Module 5), again run at an OTC, over 3 weekends.\n\n'''Special To Arm training''' is specific to the type of unit the [[Subaltern]] is joining, and covers a 2-week period. This is increasingly integrated with the tactics phase of a Regular training course. For example, the [[Platoon leader|Platoon Commander's]] Battle Course held at the [[Infantry Battle School]] in [[Brecon]] which is integrated within a Regular training course, or the [[Light Cavalry]] Commander's Course held at the Reconnaissance & Armoured Tactics Division in [[Warminster]] which is run separately to Regular training courses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|War}}\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[List of Territorial Army units (2012)]]\n*[[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]\n*[[Auxiliary Units]] (1940\u20131944)\n*[[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] (1940\u20131944)\n*[[Exercise Cambrian Patrol]]\n*[[Home Service Force]] (1982\u20131993)\n*[[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]]\n*[[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]]\n*[[Royal Marines Reserve]]\n*[[Royal Naval Reserve]]\n{{col-break|gap=3em}}\n*[[Territorial Decoration]]\n*[[The Territorial Army (British Rail)]]\n*[[Volunteer Reserves Service Medal]]\n*[[Australian Army Reserve]]\n*[[Primary Reserve#Army Reserve|Canadian Army Reserve]]\n*[[Army Reserve (Ireland)|Irish Army Reserve]]\n*[[Indian Territorial Army]]\n*[[New Zealand Army#Army Reserve|Territorial Force]]\n*[[Rejimen Askar Wataniah]]\n{{col break|gap=4em}}\n'''People'''\n*[[Alfred Anderson (veteran)|Alfred Anderson]]\n*[[Micky Burn]]\n*[[Billy Connolly]]\n*[[Bill Deedes]]\n*[[Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster]]\n*[[Bear Grylls]]\n*[[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]]\n*[[Paddy Mayne]]\n*[[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |first=Alan |last=Allport |author1-link=Alan Allport |title=Browned Off and Bloody-minded: The British Soldier Goes to War 1939\u20131945 |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-300-17075-7 |lastauthoramp=y}}\n*Beckett, Ian F.
