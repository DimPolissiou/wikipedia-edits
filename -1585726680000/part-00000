According to some scholars the quantitative approach to defining microstates suffers from such problems as \"inconsistency, arbitrariness, vagueness and inability to meaningfully isolate qualitatively distinct political units\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Qualitative definitions==\nIn response to the problems associated with the quantitative definitions of microstates, some academics have suggested finding states with unique features linked to their geographic or demographic smallness.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">Amstrup, N., 1976.

These types of states, often labelled as \"microstates,\" are usually located on small (usually disputed) territorial enclaves, generate limited economic activity founded on [[tourism]] and [[philatelic]] and [[numismatic]] sales, and are tolerated or ignored by the nations from which they claim to have seceded.\n\nOne example is the [[Republic of Indian Stream]], now the town of [[Pittsburg, New Hampshire]]\u2014a geographic anomaly left unresolved by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the U.S. Revolutionary War, and claimed by both the U.S. and Canada. Between 1832 and 1835, the area's residents refused to acknowledge either claimant.\n\nAnother example is the [[Cospaia Republic]], which became independent through a treaty error and survived from 1440 to 1826. Its independence made it important in the introduction of tobacco cultivation to Italy.\n\nAnother is [[Couto Misto]], disputed by Spain and Portugal, that operated as a [[sovereign state]] in its own right until the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1864)|1864 Treaty of Lisbon]] that partitioned the territory, with the largest part becoming part of Spain.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Island country]]\n* [[City state]]\n* [[European microstates]]\n* [[List of countries and dependencies by population density]]\n* [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area]]\n* [[List of countries by population]]\n* [[Microstates and the United Nations]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book\n|title=Report from practically nowhere\n|url=https://archive.org/details/reportfrompracti00sack\n|url-access=registration\n|first1=John\n|last1=Sack\n|first2=Shel\n|last2=Silverstein\n|publisher=Harper\n|year=1959}}\n\n\n[[Category:Country classifications]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the specific configuration of particles of a material in [[statistical mechanics]]|microstate (statistical mechanics)}}[[File:Microstates.PNG|upright=1.4|thumb|The world's five smallest sovereign states by area, from largest to smallest: [[San Marino]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Nauru]], [[Monaco]], and [[Vatican City]] shown in the same scale for size comparison.]]\n[[Image:BlankMap-World-v5 small states.PNG|upright=1.4|thumb|Map of the smallest states in the world by land area.

However, some scholars dispute qualifying Vatican City as a state, arguing that it does not meet the \"traditional criteria of statehood\" and that the \"special status of the Vatican City is probably best regarded as a means of ensuring that the Pope can freely exercise his spiritual functions, and in this respect is loosely analogous to that of the headquarters of international organisations.\"<ref>Mendelson, M. (1972). \"Diminutive States in the United Nations\". ''The International and Comparative Law Quarterly'', 21(4), pp.609\u2013630.</ref>\n\nMicrostates are distinct from [[micronation]]s, which are not recognized as sovereign states.

According to some scholars the quantitative approach to defining microstates suffers from such problems as \"inconsistency, arbitrariness, vagueness and inability to meaningfully isolate qualitatively distinct political units\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Qualitative definitions==\nIn response to the problems associated with the quantitative definitions of microstates, some academics have suggested finding states with unique features linked to their geographic or demographic smallness.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">Amstrup, N., 1976. The Perennial Problem of Small States: A Survey of Research Efforts. Cooperation and\nConflict, 11(2), pp. 163\u2013182.</ref><ref name=\":4\">Neumann, I.B. & Gst\u00f6hl, S., 2004. Lilliputians in Gulliver\u2019s World ? Small States in International Relations.</ref> Newer approaches have proposed looking at the behaviour or capacity to operate in the international arena in order to determine which states should deserve the microstate label.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref>Oest, K.J.N. & Wivel, A., 2010. Security, profit or shadow of the past? Explaining the security strategies of microstates. Cambridge Review of International Affairs, 23(3), pp. 429\u2013453.</ref> Yet, it has been argued that such approaches could lead to either confusing microstates with weak states<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> (or [[failed states]]) or relying too much on subjective perceptions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Microstates as modern protected states ===\nIn order to address both the problems with quantitative approaches and with definitions based on qualitative features, it has been argued that a useful and meaningful way to isolate microstates from other types of states, would be to see them as \"modern protected states\".<ref name=\":1\" /> According to the definition proposed by Dumienski (2014): \"microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Adopting this approach permits limiting the number of microstates and separating them from both small states and autonomies or [[dependent territory|dependencies]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Examples of microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as [[Liechtenstein]], [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], [[Niue]], [[Andorra]], [[the Cook Islands]] or [[Palau]].\n\n== Historical anomalies and aspirant states ==\nA small number of tiny sovereign political units are founded on historical anomalies or eccentric interpretations of law. These types of states, often labelled as \"microstates,\" are usually located on small (usually disputed) territorial enclaves, generate limited economic activity founded on [[tourism]] and [[philatelic]] and [[numismatic]] sales, and are tolerated or ignored by the nations from which they claim to have seceded.\n\nOne example is the [[Republic of Indian Stream]], now the town of [[Pittsburg, New Hampshire]]\u2014a geographic anomaly left unresolved by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the U.S. Revolutionary War, and claimed by both the U.S. and Canada. Between 1832 and 1835, the area's residents refused to acknowledge either claimant.\n\nAnother example is the [[Cospaia Republic]], which became independent through a treaty error and survived from 1440 to 1826. Its independence made it important in the introduction of tobacco cultivation to Italy.\n\nAnother is [[Couto Misto]], disputed by Spain and Portugal, that operated as a [[sovereign state]] in its own right until the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1864)|1864 Treaty of Lisbon]] that partitioned the territory, with the largest part becoming part of Spain.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Island country]]\n* [[City state]]\n* [[European microstates]]\n* [[List of countries and dependencies by population density]]\n* [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area]]\n* [[List of countries by population]]\n* [[Microstates and the United Nations]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book\n|title=Report from practically nowhere\n|url=https://archive.org/details/reportfrompracti00sack\n|url-access=registration\n|first1=John\n|last1=Sack\n|first2=Shel\n|last2=Silverstein\n|publisher=Harper\n|year=1959}}\n\n\n[[Category:Country classifications]]\n", "name_user": "Aron73922", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBy population)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstate"}
