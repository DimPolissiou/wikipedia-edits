When discussing causation, people cannot deny the naturalness of disasters. Disasters including droughts, hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes are certainly natural events. However, whether natural events turn out to be a disaster or not, depends on the location, and extent of pollution.\nSame intensity of two hurricanes, which one of them is placed in unpopulated area and one of them in big metropolitan, will show significant difference of damage intensity as a result. Also, the causation of natural events are not detached from the social, since the carbon emission is a major factor of dramatic warming. Hurricane Katrina is a great example. Next one is Vulnerability. A main point, is that some people are much more vulnerable than others. Briefly, rich people tend to take higher chance to survive from disasters, while poor and working class is more vulnerable to them\n\n===Korean Industry distribution, and damage density of natural disaster===\n\nAccording to the map of industry distribution in Korea, it is noticeable that north-east part of the Korea does not have significant industry.

When discussing causation, people cannot deny the naturalness of disasters. Disasters including droughts, hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes are certainly natural events. However, whether natural events turn out to be a disaster or not, depends on the location, and extent of pollution.\nSame intensity of two hurricanes, which one of them is placed in unpopulated area and one of them in big metropolitan, will show significant difference of damage intensity as a result. Also, the causation of natural events are not detached from the social, since the carbon emission is a major factor of dramatic warming. Hurricane Katrina is a great example. Next one is Vulnerability. A main point, is that some people are much more vulnerable than others. Briefly, rich people tend to take higher chance to survive from disasters, while poor and working class is more vulnerable to them\n\n===Korean Industry distribution, and damage density of natural disaster===\n\nAccording to the map of industry distribution in Korea, it is noticeable that north-east part of the Korea does not have significant industry.
