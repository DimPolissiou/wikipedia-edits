The chromosomes are depicted (by rearranging a photomicrograph) in a standard format known as a ''karyogram'' or ''idiogram'': in pairs, ordered by size and position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size.\n\nThe basic number of chromosomes in the [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells of an individual or a species is called the ''somatic number'' and is designated ''2n''. In the [[germ-line]] (the sex cells) the chromosome number is ''n'' (humans: n = 23).<ref name=\"White2\"/><sup>p28</sup> Thus, in [[Human genome|humans]] 2n = 46.\n\nSo, in normal [[diploid]] organisms, [[autosomal]] chromosomes are present in two copies. There may, or may not, be [[sex chromosomes]]. [[polyploidy|Polyploid]] cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and [[ploidy|haploid]] cells have single copies.\n\nKaryotypes can be used for many purposes; such as to study [[chromosomal aberration]]s, [[cell biology|cellular]] function, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] relationships, [[medicine]] and to gather information about past [[evolutionary]] events.(''[[systematics|karyosystematics]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url= http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Karyosystematics|title=  Karyosystematics}}</ref>\n\n== History of karyotype studies ==\nChromosomes were first observed in plant cells by [[Carl Wilhelm von N\u00e4geli]] in 1842. Their behavior in animal ([[salamander]]) cells was described by [[Walther Flemming]], the discoverer of [[mitosis]], in 1882. The name was coined by another German anatomist, [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Heinrich von Waldeyer]] in 1888. It is [[New Latin]] from [[Ancient Greek]] \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd ''karyon'', \"kernel\", \"seed\", or \"nucleus\", and \u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''typos'', \"general form\")\n\nThe next stage took place after the development of genetics in the early 20th century, when it was appreciated that chromosomes (that can be observed by karyotype) were the carrier of genes. {{Interlanguage link multi|Lev Delaunay|ru|3=\u0414\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0435, \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the [[phenotypic]] appearance of the [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] chromosomes, in contrast to their [[gene|genic]] contents.<ref>Delaunay L.

The sex of an unborn [[fetus]] can be determined by observation of interphase cells (see [[Amniocentesis|amniotic centesis]] and [[Barr body]]).\n\n=== Observations ===\nSix different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared:<ref>{{cite book |last=Stebbins |first=G.L. |title=Chromosomal evolution in higher plants |url=https://archive.org/details/chromosomalevolu0000steb |url-access=registration |publisher=Arnold |location=London |year=1971 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/chromosomalevolu0000steb/page/85 85\u201386]| ref=harv}}</ref>\n# Differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes.  Chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family.  For example, the legumes ''[[Lotus tenuis]]'' and ''[[Vicia faba]]'' each have six pairs of chromosomes, yet ''V. faba'' chromosomes are many times larger.  These differences probably reflect different amounts of DNA duplication.\n# Differences in the position of [[centromeres]].  These differences probably came about through [[translocations]].\n# Differences in relative size of chromosomes.  These differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths.\n# Differences in basic number of chromosomes.  These differences could have resulted from successive unequal translocations which removed all the essential genetic material from a chromosome, permitting its loss without penalty to the organism (the dislocation hypothesis) or through fusion.  Humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes.  Human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes, and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes.\n# Differences in number and position of satellites.  Satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread.\n# Differences in degree and distribution of [[heterochromatin|heterochromatic]] regions.  Heterochromatin stains darker than [[euchromatin]].  Heterochromatin is packed tighter.  Heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive DNA sequences as well as containing a larger amount of [[Adenine]]-[[Thymine]] pairs.  Euchromatin is usually under active transcription and stains much lighter as it has less affinity for the [[giemsa]] stain.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Thompson & Thompson Genetics in Medicine 7th Ed</ref> Euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of [[Guanine]]-[[Cytosine]] pairs. The staining technique using [[giemsa]] staining is called [[G banding]] and therefore produces the typical \"G-Bands\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number, type, shape and banding of the chromosomes, as well as other cytogenetic information.\n\nVariation is often found:\n# between the sexes,\n# between the [[germ-line]] and [[somatic (biology)|soma]] (between [[gametes]] and the rest of the body),\n# between members of a population ([[polymorphism (biology)|chromosome polymorphism]]),\n# in [[allopatric speciation|geographic specialization]], and\n# in [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaics]] or otherwise abnormal individuals.<ref name=\"White1\"/>\n\n=== Human karyotype ===\n[[File:General human karyotype.jpg|thumb|human karyotype (male)]]\nThe normal human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of [[Autosome|autosomal]] chromosomes and one pair of [[sex chromosomes]] (allosomes). Normal karyotypes for [[females]] contain two [[X chromosome]]s and are denoted 46,XX; [[males]] have both an X and a [[Y chromosome]] denoted 46,XY. Any variation from the standard karyotype may lead to developmental abnormalities.\n\n== Diversity and evolution of karyotypes ==\nAlthough the [[DNA replication|replication]] and [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[DNA]] is highly standardized in [[eukaryotes]], the same cannot be said for their karyotypes, which are highly variable. There is variation between species in chromosome number, and in detailed organization, despite their construction from the same [[Chromatin|macromolecules]]. This variation provides the basis for a range of studies in evolutionary [[cell biology|cytology]].\n\nIn some cases there is even significant variation within species. In a review, Godfrey and Masters conclude: \n{{quote|In our view, it is unlikely that one process or the other can independently account for the wide range of karyotype structures that are observed ... But, used in conjunction with other phylogenetic data, karyotypic fissioning may help to explain dramatic differences in diploid numbers between closely related species, which were previously inexplicable.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Godfrey LR, Masters JC |title=Kinetochore reproduction theory may explain rapid chromosome evolution |journal=Proc.

Carson (biologist)|Hampton L. Carson]].\n\nIn about {{convert|6500|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, the [[Hawaiian Islands]] have the most diverse collection of drosophilid flies in the world, living from [[Hawaiian tropical rainforests|rainforests]] to [[Hawaiian tropical high shrublands|subalpine meadows]]. These roughly 800 Hawaiian drosophilid species are usually assigned to two genera, ''[[Drosophila]]'' and ''[[Drosophila|Scaptomyza]]'', in the family [[Drosophilidae]].\n\nThe polytene banding of the 'picture wing' group, the best-studied group of Hawaiian drosophilids, enabled Carson to work out the evolutionary tree long before genome analysis was practicable. In a sense, gene arrangements are visible in the banding patterns of each chromosome. Chromosome rearrangements, especially [[Chromosome inversions|inversions]], make it possible to see which species are closely related.\n\nThe results are clear. The inversions, when plotted in tree form (and independent of all other information), show a clear \"flow\" of species from older to newer islands. There are also cases of colonization back to older islands, and skipping of islands, but these are much less frequent. Using [[radiometric dating|K-Ar]] dating, the present islands date from 0.4 million years ago (mya) ([[Mauna Kea]]) to 10mya ([[Necker Island (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands)|Necker]]). The oldest member of the Hawaiian archipelago still above the sea is [[Kure Atoll]], which can be dated to 30 mya. The archipelago itself (produced by the [[Pacific plate]] moving over a [[Hot spot (geology)|hot spot]]) has existed for far longer, at least into the [[Cretaceous]]. Previous islands now beneath the sea ([[guyot]]s) form the [[Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain|Emperor Seamount Chain]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Clague, D.A. |author2=Dalrymple, G.B. |chapter=The Hawaiian-Emperor volcanic chain, Part I.

Bands are alternating light and dark stripes that appear along the lengths of chromosomes. Unique banding patterns are used to identify chromosomes and to diagnose chromosomal aberrations, including chromosome breakage, loss, duplication, translocation or inverted segments. A range of different chromosome treatments produce a range of banding patterns: G-bands, R-bands, C-bands, Q-bands, T-bands and NOR-bands.\n\n== Depiction of karyotypes ==\n=== Types of banding ===\n[[Cytogenetics]] employs several techniques to visualize different aspects of chromosomes:<ref name=\"Gustashaw K.M 1991\"/>\n* [[G-banding]] is obtained with [[Giemsa stain]] following digestion of chromosomes with [[trypsin]]. It yields a series of lightly and darkly stained bands \u2014 the dark regions tend to be heterochromatic, late-replicating and AT rich. The light regions tend to be euchromatic, early-replicating and GC rich. This method will normally produce 300\u2013400 bands in a normal, [[human genome]].\n* R-banding is the reverse of G-banding (the R stands for \"reverse\"). The dark regions are euchromatic (guanine-cytosine rich regions) and the bright regions are heterochromatic (thymine-adenine rich regions).\n* C-banding: Giemsa binds to [[constitutive heterochromatin]], so it stains [[centromere]]s.The name is derived from centromeric or constitutive heterochromatin. The preparations undergo alkaline denaturation prior to staining leading to an almost complete depurination of the DNA. After washing the probe the remaining DNA is renatured again and stained with Giemsa solution consisting of methylene azure, methylene violet, methylene blue, and eosin. Heterochromatin binds a lot of the dye, while the rest of the chromosomes absorb only little of it. The C-bonding proved to be especially well-suited for the characterization of plant chromosomes.\n* Q-banding is a [[fluorescent]] pattern obtained using [[quinacrine]] for staining. The pattern of bands is very similar to that seen in G-banding.They can be recognized by a yellow fluorescence of differing intensity. Most part of the stained DNA is heterochromatin. Quinacrin (atebrin) binds both regions rich in AT and in GC, but only the AT-quinacrin-complex fluoresces. Since regions rich in AT are more common in heterochromatin than in euchromatin, these regions are labelled preferentially. The different intensities of the single bands mirror the different contents of AT. Other fluorochromes like DAPI or Hoechst 33258 lead also to characteristic, reproducible patterns. Each of them produces its specific pattern. In other words: the properties of the bonds and the specificity of the fluorochromes are not exclusively based on their affinity to regions rich in AT. Rather, the distribution of AT and the association of AT with other molecules like histones, for example, influences the binding properties of the fluorochromes. \n* T-banding: visualize [[telomere]]s.\n* Silver staining: [[Silver nitrate]] stains the [[nucleolar organization region]]-associated protein.  This yields a dark region where the silver is deposited, denoting the activity of rRNA genes within the NOR.\n\n=== Classic karyotype cytogenetics ===\n[[File:PLoSBiol3.5.Fig7ChromosomesAluFish.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Karyogram from a human female [[lymphocyte]] probed for the [[Alu sequence]] using [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]].]]\nIn the \"classic\" (depicted) karyotype, a [[dye]], often [[Giemsa]] ''(G-banding)'', less frequently [[Mepacrine|mepacrine (quinacrine)]], is used to stain bands on the chromosomes. Giemsa is specific for the [[phosphate]] groups of [[DNA]]. Quinacrine binds to the [[adenine]]-[[thymine]]-rich regions. Each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern.\n\nKaryotypes are arranged with the short arm of the chromosome on top, and the long arm on the bottom.  Some karyotypes call the short and long arms ''p'' and ''q'', respectively.  In addition, the differently stained regions and sub-regions are given numerical designations from [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] to [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] on the chromosome arms.  For example, [[Cri du chat]] syndrome involves a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. It is written as 46,XX,5p-. The critical region for this syndrome is deletion of p15.2 (the [[locus (genetics)|locus]] on the chromosome), which is written as 46,XX,del(5)(p15.2).<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Lisa G.

[[Fluorescent]]ly labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different [[fluorophore]]s. Because there are a limited number of spectrally distinct fluorophores, a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors. Fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or, in the case of spectral karyotyping, by using an [[interferometer]] attached to a fluorescence microscope. In the case of an mFISH image, every combination of fluorochromes from the resulting original images is replaced by a [[false color|pseudo color]] in a dedicated image analysis software.

Numerical abnormalities, also known as [[aneuploidy]], often occur as a result of [[nondisjunction]] during [[meiosis]] in the formation of a [[gamete]]; [[trisomy|trisomies]], in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two, are common numerical abnormalities. Structural abnormalities often arise from errors in [[homologous recombination]].

In order for the [[Giemsa]] stain to adhere correctly, all chromosomal proteins must be digested and removed. For humans, [[white blood cells]] are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in [[tissue culture]].<ref name=\"Gustashaw K.M 1991\">Gustashaw K.M. 1991.

Chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family.  For example, the legumes ''[[Lotus tenuis]]'' and ''[[Vicia faba]]'' each have six pairs of chromosomes, yet ''V. faba'' chromosomes are many times larger.  These differences probably reflect different amounts of DNA duplication.\n# Differences in the position of [[centromeres]].  These differences probably came about through [[translocations]].\n# Differences in relative size of chromosomes.  These differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths.\n# Differences in basic number of chromosomes.  These differences could have resulted from successive unequal translocations which removed all the essential genetic material from a chromosome, permitting its loss without penalty to the organism (the dislocation hypothesis) or through fusion.  Humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes.  Human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes, and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes.\n# Differences in number and position of satellites.  Satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread.\n# Differences in degree and distribution of [[heterochromatin|heterochromatic]] regions.  Heterochromatin stains darker than [[euchromatin]].  Heterochromatin is packed tighter.  Heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive DNA sequences as well as containing a larger amount of [[Adenine]]-[[Thymine]] pairs.  Euchromatin is usually under active transcription and stains much lighter as it has less affinity for the [[giemsa]] stain.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Thompson & Thompson Genetics in Medicine 7th Ed</ref> Euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of [[Guanine]]-[[Cytosine]] pairs. The staining technique using [[giemsa]] staining is called [[G banding]] and therefore produces the typical \"G-Bands\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number, type, shape and banding of the chromosomes, as well as other cytogenetic information.\n\nVariation is often found:\n# between the sexes,\n# between the [[germ-line]] and [[somatic (biology)|soma]] (between [[gametes]] and the rest of the body),\n# between members of a population ([[polymorphism (biology)|chromosome polymorphism]]),\n# in [[allopatric speciation|geographic specialization]], and\n# in [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaics]] or otherwise abnormal individuals.<ref name=\"White1\"/>\n\n=== Human karyotype ===\n[[File:General human karyotype.jpg|thumb|human karyotype (male)]]\nThe normal human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of [[Autosome|autosomal]] chromosomes and one pair of [[sex chromosomes]] (allosomes). Normal karyotypes for [[females]] contain two [[X chromosome]]s and are denoted 46,XX; [[males]] have both an X and a [[Y chromosome]] denoted 46,XY. Any variation from the standard karyotype may lead to developmental abnormalities.\n\n== Diversity and evolution of karyotypes ==\nAlthough the [[DNA replication|replication]] and [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[DNA]] is highly standardized in [[eukaryotes]], the same cannot be said for their karyotypes, which are highly variable. There is variation between species in chromosome number, and in detailed organization, despite their construction from the same [[Chromatin|macromolecules]]. This variation provides the basis for a range of studies in evolutionary [[cell biology|cytology]].\n\nIn some cases there is even significant variation within species. In a review, Godfrey and Masters conclude: \n{{quote|In our view, it is unlikely that one process or the other can independently account for the wide range of karyotype structures that are observed ...

Carson (biologist)|Hampton L. Carson]].\n\nIn about {{convert|6500|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, the [[Hawaiian Islands]] have the most diverse collection of drosophilid flies in the world, living from [[Hawaiian tropical rainforests|rainforests]] to [[Hawaiian tropical high shrublands|subalpine meadows]]. These roughly 800 Hawaiian drosophilid species are usually assigned to two genera, ''[[Drosophila]]'' and ''[[Drosophila|Scaptomyza]]'', in the family [[Drosophilidae]].\n\nThe polytene banding of the 'picture wing' group, the best-studied group of Hawaiian drosophilids, enabled Carson to work out the evolutionary tree long before genome analysis was practicable. In a sense, gene arrangements are visible in the banding patterns of each chromosome. Chromosome rearrangements, especially [[Chromosome inversions|inversions]], make it possible to see which species are closely related.\n\nThe results are clear. The inversions, when plotted in tree form (and independent of all other information), show a clear \"flow\" of species from older to newer islands. There are also cases of colonization back to older islands, and skipping of islands, but these are much less frequent. Using [[radiometric dating|K-Ar]] dating, the present islands date from 0.4 million years ago (mya) ([[Mauna Kea]]) to 10mya ([[Necker Island (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands)|Necker]]). The oldest member of the Hawaiian archipelago still above the sea is [[Kure Atoll]], which can be dated to 30 mya. The archipelago itself (produced by the [[Pacific plate]] moving over a [[Hot spot (geology)|hot spot]]) has existed for far longer, at least into the [[Cretaceous]]. Previous islands now beneath the sea ([[guyot]]s) form the [[Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain|Emperor Seamount Chain]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Clague, D.A. |author2=Dalrymple, G.B. |chapter=The Hawaiian-Emperor volcanic chain, Part I.

Bands are alternating light and dark stripes that appear along the lengths of chromosomes. Unique banding patterns are used to identify chromosomes and to diagnose chromosomal aberrations, including chromosome breakage, loss, duplication, translocation or inverted segments. A range of different chromosome treatments produce a range of banding patterns: G-bands, R-bands, C-bands, Q-bands, T-bands and NOR-bands.\n\n== Depiction of karyotypes ==\n=== Types of banding ===\n[[Cytogenetics]] employs several techniques to visualize different aspects of chromosomes:<ref name=\"Gustashaw K.M 1991\"/>\n* [[G-banding]] is obtained with [[Giemsa stain]] following digestion of chromosomes with [[trypsin]]. It yields a series of lightly and darkly stained bands \u2014 the dark regions tend to be heterochromatic, late-replicating and AT rich. The light regions tend to be euchromatic, early-replicating and GC rich. This method will normally produce 300\u2013400 bands in a normal, [[human genome]].\n* R-banding is the reverse of G-banding (the R stands for \"reverse\"). The dark regions are euchromatic (guanine-cytosine rich regions) and the bright regions are heterochromatic (thymine-adenine rich regions).\n* C-banding: Giemsa binds to [[constitutive heterochromatin]], so it stains [[centromere]]s.The name is derived from centromeric or constitutive heterochromatin. The preparations undergo alkaline denaturation prior to staining leading to an almost complete depurination of the DNA. After washing the probe the remaining DNA is renatured again and stained with Giemsa solution consisting of methylene azure, methylene violet, methylene blue, and eosin. Heterochromatin binds a lot of the dye, while the rest of the chromosomes absorb only little of it. The C-bonding proved to be especially well-suited for the characterization of plant chromosomes.\n* Q-banding is a [[fluorescent]] pattern obtained using [[quinacrine]] for staining. The pattern of bands is very similar to that seen in G-banding.They can be recognized by a yellow fluorescence of differing intensity. Most part of the stained DNA is heterochromatin. Quinacrin (atebrin) binds both regions rich in AT and in GC, but only the AT-quinacrin-complex fluoresces. Since regions rich in AT are more common in heterochromatin than in euchromatin, these regions are labelled preferentially. The different intensities of the single bands mirror the different contents of AT. Other fluorochromes like DAPI or Hoechst 33258 lead also to characteristic, reproducible patterns. Each of them produces its specific pattern. In other words: the properties of the bonds and the specificity of the fluorochromes are not exclusively based on their affinity to regions rich in AT. Rather, the distribution of AT and the association of AT with other molecules like histones, for example, influences the binding properties of the fluorochromes. \n* T-banding: visualize [[telomere]]s.\n* Silver staining: [[Silver nitrate]] stains the [[nucleolar organization region]]-associated protein.  This yields a dark region where the silver is deposited, denoting the activity of rRNA genes within the NOR.\n\n=== Classic karyotype cytogenetics ===\n[[File:PLoSBiol3.5.Fig7ChromosomesAluFish.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Karyogram from a human female [[lymphocyte]] probed for the [[Alu sequence]] using [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]].]]\nIn the \"classic\" (depicted) karyotype, a [[dye]], often [[Giemsa]] ''(G-banding)'', less frequently [[Mepacrine|mepacrine (quinacrine)]], is used to stain bands on the chromosomes. Giemsa is specific for the [[phosphate]] groups of [[DNA]]. Quinacrine binds to the [[adenine]]-[[thymine]]-rich regions. Each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern.\n\nKaryotypes are arranged with the short arm of the chromosome on top, and the long arm on the bottom.  Some karyotypes call the short and long arms ''p'' and ''q'', respectively.  In addition, the differently stained regions and sub-regions are given numerical designations from [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] to [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] on the chromosome arms.  For example, [[Cri du chat]] syndrome involves a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. It is written as 46,XX,5p-. The critical region for this syndrome is deletion of p15.2 (the [[locus (genetics)|locus]] on the chromosome), which is written as 46,XX,del(5)(p15.2).<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Lisa G.

[[Fluorescent]]ly labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different [[fluorophore]]s. Because there are a limited number of spectrally distinct fluorophores, a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors. Fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or, in the case of spectral karyotyping, by using an [[interferometer]] attached to a fluorescence microscope. In the case of an mFISH image, every combination of fluorochromes from the resulting original images is replaced by a [[false color|pseudo color]] in a dedicated image analysis software. Thus, chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified, allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Liehr T, Starke H, Weise A, Lehrer H, Claussen U |title=Multicolour FISH probe sets and their applications |journal=Histol.

Numerical abnormalities, also known as [[aneuploidy]], often occur as a result of [[nondisjunction]] during [[meiosis]] in the formation of a [[gamete]]; [[trisomy|trisomies]], in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two, are common numerical abnormalities. Structural abnormalities often arise from errors in [[homologous recombination]]. Both types of abnormalities can occur in gametes and therefore will be present in all cells of an affected person's body, or they can occur during [[mitosis]] and give rise to a [[genetic mosaic]] individual who has some normal and some abnormal cells.\n=== Chromosome abnormalities in humans ===\n\nChromosomal abnormalities that lead to disease in humans include\n* [[Turner syndrome]] results from a single X chromosome (45,X or 45,X0).\n* [[Klinefelter syndrome]], the most common male chromosomal disease, otherwise known as 47,XXY, is caused by an extra '''X''' chromosome.\n* [[Edwards syndrome]] is caused by [[trisomy]] (three copies) of chromosome 18.\n* [[Down syndrome]], a common chromosomal disease, is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21.\n* [[Patau syndrome]] is caused by trisomy of chromosome 13.\n* [[Trisomy 9]], believed to be the 4th most common trisomy, has many long lived affected individuals but only in a form other than a full trisomy, such as trisomy 9p syndrome or mosaic trisomy 9. They often function quite well, but tend to have trouble with speech.\n* Also documented are trisomy 8 and trisomy 16, although they generally do not survive to birth.\n\nSome disorders arise from loss of just a piece of one chromosome, including\n\n* [[Cri du chat]] (cry of the cat), from a truncated short arm on chromosome 5. The name comes from the babies' distinctive cry, caused by abnormal formation of the larynx.\n* [[1p36 deletion syndrome|1p36 Deletion syndrome]], from the loss of part of the short arm of chromosome 1.\n* [[Angelman syndrome]] &ndash; 50% of cases have a segment of the long arm of chromosome 15 missing; a deletion of the maternal genes, example of [[genomic imprinting|imprinting]] disorder.\n* [[Prader-Willi syndrome]] &ndash; 50% of cases have a segment of the long arm of chromosome 15 missing; a deletion of the paternal genes, example of imprinting disorder.\n\n* Chromosomal abnormalities can also occur in [[cancer]]ous cells of an otherwise genetically normal individual; one well-documented example is the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], a translocation mutation commonly associated with [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] and less often with [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cytogenetic notation]]\n* [[Genome screen]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Karyotypes}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090118031402/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/traits/karyotype/ Making a karyotype], an online activity from the University of Utah's Genetic Science Learning Center.\n* [http://www.biology.arizona.edu/human_bio/activities/karyotyping/karyotyping.html Karyotyping activity with case histories] from the University of Arizona's Biology Project.\n* [http://www.biologycorner.com/worksheets/karyotype/chromosomestudy-teacher.html Printable karyotype project] from Biology Corner, a resource site for biology and science teachers.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050414010530/http://homepage.mac.com/wildlifeweb/cyto/text/Banding.html Chromosome Staining and Banding Techniques]\n* [http://www.bjornbiosystems.com Bjorn Biosystems for Karyotyping and FISH]\n\n{{chromo}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Cell biology]]\n[[Category:Chromosomes]]\n[[Category:Cytogenetics]]\n[[Category:Evolutionary biology]]\n", "name_user": "Manudouz", "label": "safe", "comment": "Shortening subsection title.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"}

She has an older brother and a younger brother, as well as an older sister. Her older sister, [[Donna de Varona]], is an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[gold medal]] swimmer, winning two gold medals in the 1964 Olympics. Their aunt is silent film actress [[Miriam Cooper]].\n\nGrowing up, Kerns was constantly in competition with Donna. Kerns stated in an interview, \"Donna was the golden girl. There was pressure inside me to duplicate Donna's success\". Joanna tried swimming, but realized it was not her sport, so she switched to gymnastics. She competed in the Olympic trials in 1968 and ranked 14th out of 28.<ref name=\"wallace\" >Wallace, David.  \"Kerns Turns\".  ''Philip Morris Magazine''.  Spring 1991.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early roles===\nKerns got her start in show business as a dancer before turning to acting. She attended UCLA and majored in dance.  There, she saw an advertisement for a Gene Kelly production called ''Clown Around'' and immediately jumped at the chance to audition. She joked in an interview that she sent the casting crew a high school senior picture of herself and all of her grades, hoping to get the part. To take the part, however, she would have to drop out of college and move to New York, so she did. After ''Clown Around'', Joanna also got parts in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' and ''Ulysses in Nighttown'', where she was directed by [[Burgess Meredith]].<ref name=\"wallace\" />\n\nMeredith and Kerns had a wonderful working relationship. Later in life, Kerns recalled that Meredith was a great influence on her, saying, \"Burgess was the one person who really influenced my acting career\". Meredith  also introduced Kerns to [[Peggy Feury]], under whom Kerns studied acting. In 1972, she moved back to California and landed a job as a backup dancer at Disneyland, and started auditioning for TV commercials and steady acting jobs.\n\nOn May 4, 1977, she made an appearance on ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' as Natalie, a worker at a massage parlor in the episode \"The Blue Angels\".\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, Kerns started making a name for herself in guest spots on many televisions shows that included: ''[[Emergency!]]'', ''[[CHiPs]]'', ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]'', ''[[Street Hawk]]'', ''[[Laverne and Shirley]]'', ''[[Three's Company]]'', ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Hunter (1984 American TV series)|Hunter]]'', ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', and ''[[V (1983 miniseries)|V]]'', as well as many commercials. During an interview, Kerns said, \"I kind of was always looking for the next thing; I auditioned for anything, hoping to get a big break\" ([[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]]'s ''[[Intimate Portrait (TV series)|Intimate Portrait]]''). Then, Kerns got her first steady acting job in 1983, starring as Pat Devon in a new CBS series called ''[[The Four Seasons (TV series)|The Four Seasons]]'', which lasted only one season. The sitcom was about three couples who all lived under the same roof in California. Although the show was not well received by television critics, her part proved to producers that she was capable of acting as a leading lady.\n\n===''Growing Pains''===\nSoon after the cancellation of ''The Four Seasons'', Kerns auditioned for a new series in late 1984, called ''[[Growing Pains]]''. She auditioned with [[Alan Thicke]], who was just coming off the failure of his TV talk show ''[[Thicke of the Night]]''. Kerns joked in many interviews that  Alan and she had immediate chemistry, especially when she kissed him on his nose by accident during their audition together. Kerns and Thicke's chemistry won them both the parts, and the two became great friends off the show. (They both had many things in common, including both being newly divorced and both being single parents.)\n\nDuring the success of ''Growing Pains'', Kerns began to star in television movies, where she played controversial parts very different from the beloved all-American mom, Maggie Seaver. One such performance that shocked audiences was her 1992 movie, ''[[The Nightman]]'', in which Kerns played a highly sexual business woman who was a motel owner. Her many TV movies include: ''[[Those She Left Behind]]'', ''[[Blind Faith (miniseries)|Blind Faith]]'', ''[[The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake]]'', ''[[Shameful Secrets]]'', and ''[[No One Could Protect Her]]''.\n\n===After ''Growing Pains'' roles and directing career===\nAfter ''Growing Pains'' ended, Kerns turned to directing. She directed one episode of ''Growing Pains'' while starring on the show and got hooked. In an interview, Kerns stated, \"Directing is where I've always wanted to go\". She loved directing and decided to change the focus of her career from acting to directing, while continuing to make rare appearances in front of the camera when the right parts come along. She has also directed episodes of television shows including ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[Titans (2000 TV series)|Titans]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'',  ''[[Psych]]'',\u201dFelicity\u201d  ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Privileged (TV series)|Privileged]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Ghost Whisperer]],'' ''[[Army Wives]]'', ''[[Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|Pretty Little Liars]]'', ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]'', ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', ''[[This Is Us]]'', and ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3986586/fullcredits/|title=Fuller House (TV Series 2016\u2013 )|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> Kerns even got a break when she was able to direct [[Annie Potts]] in an original made-for-television movie for Lifetime TV entitled: ''Defending Our Kids: The Julie Posey Story''. She has since made a number of shorts,<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,469484,00.html Growing Pains Stars: Where Are They Now?] Foxnews.com, December 18, 2008</ref> and directed the sixth episode of ''Pitch'', the new sports drama on Fox.\n\nKerns has also made notable appearances in [[feature film]]s, including ''[[A*P*E]]'', ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'', and the 2007 comedy ''[[Knocked Up]]''.\n\nShe has also co-founded the [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards]] given to women in acting.\n\nKerns was a member of the [[Motion Picture and Television Fund]] Board of Trustees from 2004 through 2008.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1974, Kerns met a commercial producer, Richard Kerns, on the set of a commercial, and they married  2 years later.  Their marriage lasted 9 years and produced a daughter, Ashley Cooper. Immediately after the dissolution of her marriage, Kerns won the role of Maggie Seaver on ''Growing Pains''. She was married to prominent Los Angeles architect Marc Appleton for nearly 25 years, but on August 9, 2019, it was announced that they had filed for divorce. <ref>https://www.tmz.com/2019/08/09/joanna-kerns-divorce-marc-appleton-growing-pains/</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nKerns, a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], supported [[John Kerry]] in the [[2004 United States Presidential Election]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2008 United States Presidential Election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/182/000109852/|title=Joanna Kerns|website=www.nndb.com}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The sitcom was about three couples who all lived under the same roof in California. Although the show was not well received by television critics, her part proved to producers that she was capable of acting as a leading lady.\n\n===''Growing Pains''===\nSoon after the cancellation of ''The Four Seasons'', Kerns auditioned for a new series in late 1984, called ''[[Growing Pains]]''. She auditioned with [[Alan Thicke]], who was just coming off the failure of his TV talk show ''[[Thicke of the Night]]''. Kerns joked in many interviews that  Alan and she had immediate chemistry, especially when she kissed him on his nose by accident during their audition together. Kerns and Thicke's chemistry won them both the parts, and the two became great friends off the show. (They both had many things in common, including both being newly divorced and both being single parents.)\n\nDuring the success of ''Growing Pains'', Kerns began to star in television movies, where she played controversial parts very different from the beloved all-American mom, Maggie Seaver. One such performance that shocked audiences was her 1992 movie, ''[[The Nightman]]'', in which Kerns played a highly sexual business woman who was a motel owner. Her many TV movies include: ''[[Those She Left Behind]]'', ''[[Blind Faith (miniseries)|Blind Faith]]'', ''[[The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake]]'', ''[[Shameful Secrets]]'', and ''[[No One Could Protect Her]]''.\n\n===After ''Growing Pains'' roles and directing career===\nAfter ''Growing Pains'' ended, Kerns turned to directing. She directed one episode of ''Growing Pains'' while starring on the show and got hooked. In an interview, Kerns stated, \"Directing is where I've always wanted to go\". She loved directing and decided to change the focus of her career from acting to directing, while continuing to make rare appearances in front of the camera when the right parts come along. She has also directed episodes of television shows including ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[Titans (2000 TV series)|Titans]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'',  ''[[Psych]]'',\u201dFelicity\u201d  ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Privileged (TV series)|Privileged]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Ghost Whisperer]],'' ''[[Army Wives]]'', ''[[Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|Pretty Little Liars]]'', ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]'', ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', ''[[This Is Us]]'', and ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3986586/fullcredits/|title=Fuller House (TV Series 2016\u2013 )|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> Kerns even got a break when she was able to direct [[Annie Potts]] in an original made-for-television movie for Lifetime TV entitled: ''Defending Our Kids: The Julie Posey Story''. She has since made a number of shorts,<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,469484,00.html Growing Pains Stars: Where Are They Now?] Foxnews.com, December 18, 2008</ref> and directed the sixth episode of ''Pitch'', the new sports drama on Fox.\n\nKerns has also made notable appearances in [[feature film]]s, including ''[[A*P*E]]'', ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'', and the 2007 comedy ''[[Knocked Up]]''.\n\nShe has also co-founded the [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards]] given to women in acting.\n\nKerns was a member of the [[Motion Picture and Television Fund]] Board of Trustees from 2004 through 2008.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1974, Kerns met a commercial producer, Richard Kerns, on the set of a commercial, and they married  2 years later.  Their marriage lasted 9 years and produced a daughter, Ashley Cooper. Immediately after the dissolution of her marriage, Kerns won the role of Maggie Seaver on ''Growing Pains''. She was married to prominent Los Angeles architect Marc Appleton for nearly 25 years, but on August 9, 2019, it was announced that they had filed for divorce. <ref>https://www.tmz.com/2019/08/09/joanna-kerns-divorce-marc-appleton-growing-pains/</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nKerns, a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], supported [[John Kerry]] in the [[2004 United States Presidential Election]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2008 United States Presidential Election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/182/000109852/|title=Joanna Kerns|website=www.nndb.com}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "List of historical unrecognized states and dependencies", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\nThese lists of '''historical unrecognized or partially recognized ''states''''' or '''''governments''''' give an overview of extinct [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] entities that wished to be recognized as [[sovereign state]]s, but did not enjoy worldwide [[diplomatic recognition]]. The entries listed here had ''de facto'' control over their claimed territory and were self-governing with a desire for full independence; or if they lacked such control over their territory, they were recognized by at least one other recognized nation.\n\n== Criteria for inclusion ==\nThe criteria for inclusion in this list are similar to those of the [[list of states with limited recognition]]. To be included here, a polity must have claimed [[Nation-state|statehood]], has not had recognition by at least one widely accepted state for a significant portion of its ''de facto'' existence, and either:\n\n* had a population and an organized government with a capacity to enter into relations with other states; or\n* had ''de facto'' control over a territory or a significant portion of the territory of an otherwise-recognized sovereign state\n\n== Historic unrecognized or partially recognized states with de facto control over their territory ==\n{{Further|List of states with limited recognition}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nThe total number of countries in the African continent is unknown due to the instability throughout the region. At present there are 54 sovereign countries and around 90 countries, territories and regions not recognized by the UN. One needs to take into account the fact that some countries are independent nations, and while they have geopolitical borders they are protectorates or territories (for example the Islands of [[St. Helena]]). Also, certain parts of Africa have a tendency towards political instability (more so than other continents); this means that from time to time countries split, merge and are renamed. Some examples include: The Republic of South Sudan, Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana and Burkina Faso. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.\n\nGreat instability was created by graft under these leaders.\"''Until independence, the opportunities for self-enrichment were limited; the principal beneficiaries of colonial rule were the European elite, officials and businessmen, enjoying a lifestyle which the Africa elite aspired to emulate but were largely prevented from reaching. Independence unlocked the floodgate [of corruption]. Politicians used their public office to extract \u2018commissions\u2019 at every available opportunity. The common cut on government contracts in West Africa was 10 per cent. In numerous cases, prominent politicians simply looted the state treasury, transferring money to their private accounts.''\"<ref>Corruption and State Instability in West Africa: An Examination of Policy Options\n\nBy Samuel Mondays ATUOBI</ref> \n\nMany leaders marginalised ethnic groups and fanned ethnic conflicts (some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule) for political gain. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.\n\nA variety of other causes have been blamed for Africa's political instability, including Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, over-reliance on foreign aid,<ref>[[Dambisa Moyo]] (2009). Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa. Farrar, Straus and Giroux</ref> decades of corruption and mismanagement by socialist leaders,<ref>\"Africa's crisis is of modern socialist making and stems from the misrule, mismanagement and corruption of the elite.\" \"[https://fee.org/resources/betrayal-why-socialism-failed-in-africa/ Betrayal: Why Socialism Failed in Africa],\" adapted from a speech economist [[George Ayittey]] delivered at \u201cEvenings at FEE\u201d in April 2005; accessed 01 January 2017</ref> as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/why-south-africa-shouldnt-turn-to-the-imf-for-help-82027|title=Why South Africa shouldn't turn to the IMF for help|last=Mutize|first=Misheck|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>  When a country became independent for the first time, it would often align itself with one of the two superpowers in order to get support. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while many in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by funding insurgency movements. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist/Soviet policies made the situation worse. The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath have killed an estimated 5.5 million people.[66] Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.\n\nIn the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined*. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://qz.com/1550626/chinas-investment-will-allow-africa-to-lead-the-22nd-century/ |title=The 21st century belongs to China\u2014but the 22nd will be Africa's |last=Avi Brooks |first=Lonny |date=February 21, 2019 |work=Quartz}}</ref>, which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies were among the world's fastest growing as of 2011 and that growth continues through 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icafrica.org/en/knowledge-hub/article/african-economic-outlook-2019-362/|title=African Economic Outlook 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. A significant part of this growth can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile phone.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>While there is less armed conflict in Africa political violence increases. \"''Open-source conflict data is increasingly used to supplement reporting and analysis of trends in instability in Africa. A number of recent global reports, including the OECD States of Fragility 2016: [http://www.oecd.org/dac/states-of-fragility-2016-9789264267213-en.htm Understanding Violence], use conflict data to show changes in conflict type, actors, tactics and intensity across and within countries over time''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://issafrica.org/iss-today/less-armed-conflict-but-more-political-violence-in-africa|title=Less armed conflict but more political violence in Africa|last=|first=|date=|website=The Institute for Security Studies (ISS)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\n<br />\n\n==== 18th and 19th centuries ====\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In June 1993, they declared their independence as the [[Republic of Airrec\u00fa]], which means \"friendship\" in a local Indian language.

They incited the [[Taiping Rebellion]] against the [[Qing Dynasty]] seizing some territories in [[South China]], established their capital in [[Nanjing|Nanking]], and proclaimed the founding of their kingdom. However, the [[Tianjing incident]] caused a major setback for the rebel kingdom, after infighting between their leaders the number of their supporters began to dwindle. This allowed the modernized Qing armies with the help of western aid to quash the rebellion. Though the Qing were victorious, the rebellion weakened the Qing power and some Taiping remnants continued the fight in other rebellions and struggles against western powers.\n|-\n| {{hs|Sedang}} {{flagicon image|Flag of Sedang.svg}} [[Kingdom of Sedang]]\n| 1888\u20131889\n| Now part of the [[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]\n| [[Marie-Charles David de Mayr\u00e9na]] was born in [[France]] in 1842.

At present there are 54 sovereign countries and around 90 countries, territories and regions not recognized by the UN. One needs to take into account the fact that some countries are independent nations, and while they have geopolitical borders they are protectorates or territories (for example the Islands of [[St. Helena]]). Also, certain parts of Africa have a tendency towards political instability (more so than other continents); this means that from time to time countries split, merge and are renamed. Some examples include: The Republic of South Sudan, Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana and Burkina Faso. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.\n\nGreat instability was created by graft under these leaders.\"''Until independence, the opportunities for self-enrichment were limited; the principal beneficiaries of colonial rule were the European elite, officials and businessmen, enjoying a lifestyle which the Africa elite aspired to emulate but were largely prevented from reaching. Independence unlocked the floodgate [of corruption]. Politicians used their public office to extract \u2018commissions\u2019 at every available opportunity. The common cut on government contracts in West Africa was 10 per cent. In numerous cases, prominent politicians simply looted the state treasury, transferring money to their private accounts.''\"<ref>Corruption and State Instability in West Africa: An Examination of Policy Options\n\nBy Samuel Mondays ATUOBI</ref> \n\nMany leaders marginalised ethnic groups and fanned ethnic conflicts (some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule) for political gain. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.\n\nA variety of other causes have been blamed for Africa's political instability, including Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, over-reliance on foreign aid,<ref>[[Dambisa Moyo]] (2009). Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa.

Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while many in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by funding insurgency movements. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist/Soviet policies made the situation worse. The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath have killed an estimated 5.5 million people.[66] Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.\n\nIn the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined*. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://qz.com/1550626/chinas-investment-will-allow-africa-to-lead-the-22nd-century/ |title=The 21st century belongs to China\u2014but the 22nd will be Africa's |last=Avi Brooks |first=Lonny |date=February 21, 2019 |work=Quartz}}</ref>, which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies were among the world's fastest growing as of 2011 and that growth continues through 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icafrica.org/en/knowledge-hub/article/african-economic-outlook-2019-362/|title=African Economic Outlook 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. A significant part of this growth can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile phone.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>While there is less armed conflict in Africa political violence increases. \"''Open-source conflict data is increasingly used to supplement reporting and analysis of trends in instability in Africa.

Immediately his spokesmen announced the integration of a revolutionary provisional government based in Santiago de los Caballeros. The Cibaenians launched a manifesto and expressed that they did it to \"shake off the yoke of Mr. B\u00e1ez's government that they do not know from now and declare themselves governed (until a congress elected by direct vote, constitute new powers) by a provisional revolutionary government, with its seat in the city of Santiago de los Caballeros. \"\n\nAs president of the anti-B\u00e1ez and Santana provisional government was chosen to General Jos\u00e9 Desiderio Valverde, and the lawyer Benigno Filomeno Rojas, as vice president.

As Venezuela printed more money for their social programs, the bol\u00edvar continued to devalue for Venezuelan citizens and merchants since the government held the majority of the more reliable currencies.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanke|first=Steve|title=The World's Troubled Currencies|url=http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article41552.html|publisher=The Market Oracle|accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs of January 2018, the strongest official exchange rate was 1 US$ to 10 [[Venezuelan bol\u00edvar|VEF]] while the free market exchange rate was over 200,000 VEF to 1 US$.<ref name=BBCEconomy/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dolartoday.com/indicadores|title=Indicadores Econom\u00eda Venezolana|date=|website=dolartoday.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Since merchants can only receive so much necessary foreign currency from the government, they must resort to the black market which in turn raises the merchant's prices on [[consumers]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Gupta|first=Girish|title=The 'Cheapest' Country in the World|url=http://world.time.com/2014/01/23/venezuelas-currency-controls-propels-those-with-connections/|accessdate=26 January 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=24 January 2014}}</ref> The high rates in the black market make it difficult for businesses to purchase necessary goods since the government often forces these businesses to make price cuts.

Kikuyu is spoken in the area between [[Nyeri]] and [[Nairobi]]. The Kikuyu people usually identify their lands by the surrounding mountain ranges in Central Kenya which they call ''K\u0129r\u0129nyaga''.\n\n==Dialects==\nKikuyu has four main mutually intelligible dialects. The [[Central Province (Kenya)|Central Province]] districts are divided along the traditional boundaries of these dialects, which are [[Kirinyaga District|K\u00eer\u00eenyaga]], [[Murang'a|M\u00fbrang'a]], [[Nyeri]] and [[Kiambu]]. The Kikuyu from K\u00eer\u00eenyaga are composed of two main sub-dialects \u2013 the Ndia and Gichugu who speak the dialects ''K\u0129ndia'' and ''G\u0129g\u0129c\u0169g\u0169''. The Gicugus and the Ndias do not have the \"ch\" or \"sh\" sound, and will use the \"s\" sound instead, hence the pronunciation of \"G\u0129c\u0169g\u0169\" as opposed to \"G\u0129ch\u0169g\u0169\". To hear Ndia being spoken, one needs to be in [[Kerugoya]], the largest town in K\u00eer\u00eenyaga. Other home towns for the Ndia, where purer forms of the dialect are spoken, are located in the tea-growing areas of [[Kagumo]], and the cool [[Kangaita]] hills. Lower down the slopes is [[Kutus]], which is a bustling dusty town with so many influences from the other dialects that it is difficult to distinguish between them. The dialect is also prevalent in the rice growing area of Mwea.\n\nThe unmistakable tonal patterns of the Gichugu dialect (which sounds like [[Meru language|Meru]] or [[Embu language|Embu]], a sister language to Kikuyu) can be heard in the coffee-growing areas of [[Kianyaga]], [[Githunguri|G\u0129th\u0169re]], [[Kathungure|Kath\u0169ng\u0169ri]], Marigiti. The [[Gichugu]] switch easily to other Kikuyu dialects in conversation with the rest of the Kikuyu.\n\n==Phonology==\nSymbols shown in parentheses are those used in the [[orthography]].\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

The [[Central Province (Kenya)|Central Province]] districts are divided along the traditional boundaries of these dialects, which are [[Kirinyaga District|K\u00eer\u00eenyaga]], [[Murang'a|M\u00fbrang'a]], [[Nyeri]] and [[Kiambu]]. The Kikuyu from K\u00eer\u00eenyaga are composed of two main sub-dialects \u2013 the Ndia and Gichugu who speak the dialects ''K\u0129ndia'' and ''G\u0129g\u0129c\u0169g\u0169''. The Gicugus and the Ndias do not have the \"ch\" or \"sh\" sound, and will use the \"s\" sound instead, hence the pronunciation of \"G\u0129c\u0169g\u0169\" as opposed to \"G\u0129ch\u0169g\u0169\". To hear Ndia being spoken, one needs to be in [[Kerugoya]], the largest town in K\u00eer\u00eenyaga. Other home towns for the Ndia, where purer forms of the dialect are spoken, are located in the tea-growing areas of [[Kagumo]], and the cool [[Kangaita]] hills. Lower down the slopes is [[Kutus]], which is a bustling dusty town with so many influences from the other dialects that it is difficult to distinguish between them.The dialect is also prevalent in the rice growing area of Mwea.\n\nThe unmistakable tonal patterns of the Gichugu dialect (which sounds like [[Meru language|Meru]] or [[Embu language|Embu]], a sister language to Kikuyu) can be heard in the coffee-growing areas of [[Kianyaga]], [[Githunguri|G\u0129th\u0169re]], [[Kathungure|Kath\u0169ng\u0169ri]], Marigiti. The [[Gichugu]] switch easily to other Kikuyu dialects in conversation with the rest of the Kikuyu.\n\n==Phonology==\nSymbols shown in parentheses are those used in the [[orthography]].\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

Ford, 1975. \"The tones of nouns in Kikuyu,\" ''Studies in African Linguistics'' 6, 49\u201364; G.N. Clements & Kevin C. Ford, 1979, \"Kikuyu Tone Shift and its Synchronic Consequences\", ''Linguistic Inquiry'' 10.2, 179\u2013210.</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\nThe canonical word order of G\u0129k\u0169y\u0169 is SVO ([[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]]). It uses [[prepositions]] rather than postpostions, and [[adjective]]s follow [[noun]]s.<ref>[http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_kik Wals.info]</ref>\n\n==Alphabet==\nKikuyu is written in a Latin alphabet. It does not use the letters ''f  l  p  q  s  v  x  z'', and adds the letters ''\u0129'' and ''\u0169''. The Kikuyu alphabet is:\n:'''a  b  c  d  e  g  h  i  \u0129  j  k  m  n  o  r  t  u  \u0169  w  y'''<ref>[http://sumale.vjf.cnrs.fr/phono/AfficheTableauOrtho2N.php?choixLangue=kikuyu]</ref>\n\nSome sounds are represented by digraphs such as '''ng''' for the velar nasal {{IPA|/\u014b/}}.<!--this section could use more precision-->\n\n==Sample phrases==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

For instance, [[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]]'s ''M\u0169rogi wa Kagogo'' (''[[Wizard of the Crow]]'') is the longest known book written in Kikuyu. Other authors writing in Kikuyu are  [[Gatua wa Mb\u0169gwa]] and [[Waith\u0129ra wa Mbuthia]]. Mbuthia has published various works in different genres\u2014essays, poetry, children stories and translations\u2014in Kikuyu. The late [[Wahome Mutahi]] also sometimes wrote in Kikuyu.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the 1983 [[Film|movie]] ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'', the character [[Nien Nunb]] speaks in the Kikuyu language.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0728/072823.html|title=In Kenya, audiences roar at language in 'Jedi' film|last=Feldmann|first=Compiled From Wire Service Dispatches With Analysis From Monitor Correspondents Around The World,Edited By Linda|date=1983-07-28|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-06-24|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*[[Lilias Armstrong|Armstrong, Lilias E.]] 1967.
