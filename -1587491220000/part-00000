He heads to the tiny country of Cagliostro, the rumoured source of the bills, and attempts to save the runaway Clarisse from the Count Cagliostro's men. Lupin enlists his associates, Jigen and Goemon, and sends his calling card to the Count to get Inspector Zenigata, his longtime nemesis, to the castle. After becoming trapped in the dungeon under the castle, Lupin and Zenigata form a pact to escape and foil the Count's counterfeit operation and save Clarisse from her forced marriage to the Count.\n\nThe original theatrical release in Japan occurred on 15 December 1979. The American theatrical debut was on 3 April 1991, with the home release following in October 1992. This first dub was produced by [[Streamline Pictures]] and released on home video the following year. A new dubbed version was produced by [[Manga Entertainment]] in 2000 and has had several releases. Despite initially underperforming at the box office, ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' has garnered high praise, with critics and historians noting the film's influence on Miyazaki's later works, and has since become the most popular and well-regarded entry in the entire ''Lupin III'' franchise. However, some have disapproved of its depiction of Lupin as a gallant hero instead of his original persona as a ruthless criminal. The film has served as a major influence on animators and directors worldwide, most notably [[Pixar]] director [[John Lasseter]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn September 1968, master thief [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] and his colleague, [[Daisuke Jigen]], flee the [[Monte Carlo Casino]] with huge quantities of stolen money. They escape in Lupin's [[Fiat 500]], but Lupin recognizes the bills as distinctively high-quality counterfeits.{{efn|In the Japanese dialogue, the counterfeit bills are called \"G\u014dto-satsu\" (\u30b4\u30fc\u30c8\u672d), which is written as \"Ghoto bills\" in the heavily-simplified TMS subtitled version. The Streamline dub, which used TMS' subtitles as its primary translation source, explains that \"Ghoto\" was the name of the person responsible for the creation of Cagliostro's counterfeiting ring. The Animaze/Manga dub interprets \"G\u014dto\" as a [[transliteration]] of [[goat]] - the Japanese word for which is \"yagi\" (\u30e4\u30ae) - in part due to the abundant goat and ram-related imagery present in the film, and thus refers to the counterfeits as \"Goat bills\". However, in the Japanese version, Lupin describes the writing on Clarisse's ring as being \"G\u014dto-moji\" (\u30b4\u30fc\u30c8\u6587\u5b57), or Gothic characters, which implies that the houses of Cagliostro are descended from the ancient [[Goths]]. The Animaze/Manga dub describes the writing as \"[[Capra (genus)|Capra]]n\", furthering the film's symbolic use of goats. When preparing the English subtitles for [[Discotek Media]]'s DVD and Blu-ray, translators Shoko Oono and Reed Nelson chose to name the counterfeits \"Gothic bills\" instead of \"Goat bills\".<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\" /><ref name=\"DVD Translation Notes\">{{cite video\n  | title = The Castle of Cagliostro (Translation Notes)\n  | medium = DVD\n  | publisher = [[Discotek Media]]\n  | location = \tAltamonte Springs, Florida\n  | date = 1979\n}}</ref>}} Deciding to seek out the source, they head to the [[Grand Duchy]] of Cagliostro, the alleged wellspring of the counterfeits.\n\nShortly after arriving, they rescue a young woman being pursued by a gang of thugs, with her and Lupin falling off a cliff while escaping. Lupin is knocked unconscious, and the woman captured, but she leaves him a signet ring. Lupin recognizes the woman as Clarisse, the princess of Cagliostro, who will soon be married to Count Cagliostro, the country's regent. The Count's [[arranged marriage]] will cement his power and recover the fabled ancient treasure of Cagliostro, for which he needs both his and Clarisse's ancestral rings.\n\nA squad of assassins attack Lupin and Jigen at their inn but fail to kill them or  recover the ring. Lupin leaves his calling card on the back of Jodot, the Count's butler and chief assassin, announcing he is going to steal Clarisse. Lupin summons [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]] to aid their quest to rescue the princess and tips off his longtime pursuer, Inspector [[Koichi Zenigata]], to his whereabouts to provide a distraction. Zenigata's presence and a party give Lupin enough time to sneak into the castle. There he finds his on-off lover, [[Fujiko Mine]], posing as Clarisse's lady-in-waiting, who tells him where the princess is being held. Lupin makes his way to Clarisse and returns her ring, vowing to help her to escape. Before he can act, the Count drops Lupin down a trapdoor into the castle's catacombs, as Lupin had planned. Lupin mocks the Count through the ring he gave to Clarisse \u2013 a fake containing a transmitter \u2013 and the Count sends three assassins to retrieve the real ring.\n\nLupin encounters Zenigata, who was accidentally dropped down earlier, and they form a pact to help each other escape. After overpowering the assassins, they escape into a room full of printing presses \u2014 the source of the counterfeits. Zenigata wants to collect evidence, but Lupin points out they must escape the castle first. They start a fire as a distraction and steal the Count's [[autogyro]]. However, as they attempt to rescue Clarisse, Lupin is shot. Clarisse offers the ring to the Count in exchange for Lupin's life.  After securing the ring, the Count's attempt at betrayal is foiled when Fujiko's actions allow her, Lupin, and Zenigata to flee. As Lupin recovers from his injuries, Zenigata attempts to convince his superiors at [[Interpol]] to prosecute the Count for counterfeiting, but fearing political repercussions, they halt the investigation and remove him from the case. Meanwhile, Lupin intends to stop the wedding and rescue the princess. He also reveals his reasons for rescuing Clarisse to Jigen, Goemon and her family's former gardener \u2014 as a young girl, she had saved his life during his unsuccessful first attempt to find the treasure of Cagliostro Castle ten years earlier. Fujiko tips off Lupin on a way to sneak into the castle, and forms a plan with Zenigata to publicly reveal the counterfeiting operation under the cover of pursuing Lupin.\n\nThe wedding with a drugged Clarisse appears to go as planned, until Lupin disrupts the ceremony and, despite the Count's precautions, makes off with both Clarisse and the Count's rings. Meanwhile, Zenigata and his squadron arrive in the chaos, and the inspector leads Fujiko, posing as a television reporter, to the Count's counterfeiting facility to expose the operation to the world. The Count pursues Lupin and Clarisse to the face of the castle's clock tower. Lupin is forced to surrender the rings to save Clarisse, and they are both knocked into the lake surrounding the tower. After using the rings to reveal the secret of Cagliostro, the Count is killed by the mechanism unveiling the treasure. Lupin and Clarisse watch as the lake around the castle drains to reveal exquisite ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ruins \u2014 the true treasure of Cagliostro. Lupin and his friends bid farewell to Clarisse, now the rightful ruler of Cagliostro. With Zenigata pursuing them again (for the crime of \"stealing Clarisse's heart\") and Fujiko fleeing with the [[printing plate|plates]] from counterfeit printing presses, Lupin and the gang drive out of Cagliostro, with the police close behind them.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The title character, [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]], was inspired by (and is claimed in the series to be the grandson of) [[Maurice Leblanc]]'s fictional character [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], a gallant and famous outlaw able to outsmart even [[Sherlock Holmes]].<ref name=dc /> Lupin III is a [[gentleman thief]] and announces his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of the desired items. The manga's popularity led to two [[anime]] series, titled ''[[Lupin The Third Part I|Lupin III]]'' and ''[[Lupin III Part II]]''.<ref name=dc /> The first film, ''[[The Mystery of Mamo]]'', was released on 16 December 1978. ''Cagliostro'' followed the year later following the financial success of that film. This is marked as the first feature-length film to be directed by Miyazaki, who had previously co-directed episodes of the first Lupin anime series with [[Isao Takahata]] and the two directors along with  [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] would give birth to [[Studio Ghibli]] in 1985. He was also a writer and director of two episodes in the second series under the pseudonym \"Telecom\", both produced a year after ''Cagliostro''.<ref name=dc /> In works other than ''Castle of Cagliostro'' and the series episodes directed by Miyazaki and Takahata, Lupin III is portrayed as a scheming and lecherous thief, sometimes supported by his former enemies Jigen and Goemon. Miyazaki's film conflicts with the typical behavior and personality of the characters, a change that has been described as Lupin \"growing up\".<ref name=dc /><ref name=om />\n\n''Castle of Cagliostro'' marked Miyazaki's debut as a theatrical movie director, but he also was a writer, a designer, and a storyboardist on the movie.<ref name=\"om\">{{cite web | url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx | title=The Castle of Cagliostro Hayao Miyazaki's First (And Most Enjoyable) Movie | publisher=Otaku USA Magazine | date=9 March 2012 | accessdate=27 August 2013 | author=Surat, Daryl | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018154933/http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx | archive-date=18 October 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nThe production for the film began in May 1979 with the writing of the story and storyboarding for the film.<ref name=\"hm\" /> Miyazaki began by drawing a bird's eye view of the setting before creating the story to completion.

He heads to the tiny country of Cagliostro, the rumoured source of the bills, and attempts to save the runaway Clarisse from the Count Cagliostro's men. Lupin enlists his associates, Jigen and Goemon, and sends his calling card to the Count to get Inspector Zenigata, his longtime nemesis, to the castle. After becoming trapped in the dungeon under the castle, Lupin and Zenigata form a pact to escape and foil the Count's counterfeit operation and save Clarisse from her forced marriage to the Count.\n\nThe original theatrical release in Japan occurred on 15 December 1979. The American theatrical debut was on 3 April 1991, with the home release following in October 1992. This first dub was produced by [[Streamline Pictures]] and released on home video the following year. A new dubbed version was produced by [[Manga Entertainment]] in 2000 and has had several releases. Despite initially underperforming at the box office, ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' has garnered high praise, with critics and historians noting the film's influence on Miyazaki's later works, and has since become the most popular and well-regarded entry in the entire ''Lupin III'' franchise. However, some have disapproved of its depiction of Lupin as a gallant hero instead of his original persona as a ruthless criminal. The film has served as a major influence on animators and directors worldwide, most notably [[Pixar]] director [[John Lasseter]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn September 1968, master thief [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] and his colleague, [[Daisuke Jigen]], flee the [[Monte Carlo Casino]] with huge quantities of stolen money. They escape in Lupin's [[Fiat 500]], but Lupin recognizes the bills as distinctively high-quality counterfeits.{{efn|In the Japanese dialogue, the counterfeit bills are called \"G\u014dto-satsu\" (\u30b4\u30fc\u30c8\u672d), which is written as \"Ghoto bills\" in the heavily-simplified TMS subtitled version. The Streamline dub, which used TMS' subtitles as its primary translation source, explains that \"Ghoto\" was the name of the person responsible for the creation of Cagliostro's counterfeiting ring. The Animaze/Manga dub interprets \"G\u014dto\" as a [[transliteration]] of [[goat]] - the Japanese word for which is \"yagi\" (\u30e4\u30ae) - in part due to the abundant goat and ram-related imagery present in the film, and thus refers to the counterfeits as \"Goat bills\". However, in the Japanese version, Lupin describes the writing on Clarisse's ring as being \"G\u014dto-moji\" (\u30b4\u30fc\u30c8\u6587\u5b57), or Gothic characters, which implies that the houses of Cagliostro are descended from the ancient [[Goths]]. The Animaze/Manga dub describes the writing as \"[[Capra (genus)|Capra]]n\", furthering the film's symbolic use of goats. When preparing the English subtitles for [[Discotek Media]]'s DVD and Blu-ray, translators Shoko Oono and Reed Nelson chose to name the counterfeits \"Gothic bills\" instead of \"Goat bills\".<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\" /><ref name=\"DVD Translation Notes\">{{cite video\n  | title = The Castle of Cagliostro (Translation Notes)\n  | medium = DVD\n  | publisher = [[Discotek Media]]\n  | location = \tAltamonte Springs, Florida\n  | date = 1979\n}}</ref>}} Deciding to seek out the source, they head to the [[Grand Duchy]] of Cagliostro, the alleged wellspring of the counterfeits.\n\nShortly after arriving, they rescue a young woman being pursued by a gang of thugs, with her and Lupin falling off a cliff while escaping. Lupin is knocked unconscious, and the woman captured, but she leaves him a signet ring. Lupin recognizes the woman as Clarisse, the princess of Cagliostro, who will soon be married to Count Cagliostro, the country's regent. The Count's [[arranged marriage]] will cement his power and recover the fabled ancient treasure of Cagliostro, for which he needs both his and Clarisse's ancestral rings.\n\nA squad of assassins attack Lupin and Jigen at their inn but fail to kill them or  recover the ring. Lupin leaves his calling card on the back of Jodot, the Count's butler and chief assassin, announcing he is going to steal Clarisse. Lupin summons [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]] to aid their quest to rescue the princess and tips off his longtime pursuer, Inspector [[Koichi Zenigata]], to his whereabouts to provide a distraction. Zenigata's presence and a party give Lupin enough time to sneak into the castle. There he finds his on-off lover, [[Fujiko Mine]], posing as Clarisse's lady-in-waiting, who tells him where the princess is being held. Lupin makes his way to Clarisse and returns her ring, vowing to help her to escape. Before he can act, the Count drops Lupin down a trapdoor into the castle's catacombs, as Lupin had planned. Lupin mocks the Count through the ring he gave to Clarisse \u2013 a fake containing a transmitter \u2013 and the Count sends three assassins to retrieve the real ring.\n\nLupin encounters Zenigata, who was accidentally dropped down earlier, and they form a pact to help each other escape. After overpowering the assassins, they escape into a room full of printing presses \u2014 the source of the counterfeits. Zenigata wants to collect evidence, but Lupin points out they must escape the castle first. They start a fire as a distraction and steal the Count's [[autogyro]]. However, as they attempt to rescue Clarisse, Lupin is shot. Clarisse offers the ring to the Count in exchange for Lupin's life.  After securing the ring, the Count's attempt at betrayal is foiled when Fujiko's actions allow her, Lupin, and Zenigata to flee. As Lupin recovers from his injuries, Zenigata attempts to convince his superiors at [[Interpol]] to prosecute the Count for counterfeiting, but fearing political repercussions, they halt the investigation and remove him from the case. Meanwhile, Lupin intends to stop the wedding and rescue the princess. He also reveals his reasons for rescuing Clarisse to Jigen, Goemon and her family's former gardener \u2014 as a young girl, she had saved his life during his unsuccessful first attempt to find the treasure of Cagliostro Castle ten years earlier. Fujiko tips off Lupin on a way to sneak into the castle, and forms a plan with Zenigata to publicly reveal the counterfeiting operation under the cover of pursuing Lupin.\n\nThe wedding with a drugged Clarisse appears to go as planned, until Lupin disrupts the ceremony and, despite the Count's precautions, makes off with both Clarisse and the Count's rings. Meanwhile, Zenigata and his squadron arrive in the chaos, and the inspector leads Fujiko, posing as a television reporter, to the Count's counterfeiting facility to expose the operation to the world. The Count pursues Lupin and Clarisse to the face of the castle's clock tower. Lupin is forced to surrender the rings to save Clarisse, and they are both knocked into the lake surrounding the tower. After using the rings to reveal the secret of Cagliostro, the Count is killed by the mechanism unveiling the treasure. Lupin and Clarisse watch as the lake around the castle drains to reveal exquisite ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ruins \u2014 the true treasure of Cagliostro. Lupin and his friends bid farewell to Clarisse, now the rightful ruler of Cagliostro. With Zenigata pursuing them again (for the crime of \"stealing Clarisse's heart\") and Fujiko fleeing with the [[printing plate|plates]] from counterfeit printing presses, Lupin and the gang drive out of Cagliostro, with the police close behind them.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The title character, [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]], was inspired by (and is claimed in the series to be the grandson of) [[Maurice Leblanc]]'s fictional character [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], a gallant and famous outlaw able to outsmart even [[Sherlock Holmes]].<ref name=dc /> Lupin III is a [[gentleman thief]] and announces his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of the desired items. The manga's popularity led to two [[anime]] series, titled ''[[Lupin The Third Part I|Lupin III]]'' and ''[[Lupin III Part II]]''.<ref name=dc /> The first film, ''[[The Mystery of Mamo]]'', was released on 16 December 1978. ''Cagliostro'' followed the year later following the financial success of that film. This is marked as the first feature-length film to be directed by Miyazaki, who had previously co-directed episodes of the first Lupin anime series with [[Isao Takahata]] and the two directors along with  [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] would give birth to [[Studio Ghibli]] in 1985. He was also a writer and director of two episodes in the second series under the pseudonym \"Telecom\", both produced a year after ''Cagliostro''.<ref name=dc /> In works other than ''Castle of Cagliostro'' and the series episodes directed by Miyazaki and Takahata, Lupin III is portrayed as a scheming and lecherous thief, sometimes supported by his former enemies Jigen and Goemon. Miyazaki's film conflicts with the typical behavior and personality of the characters, a change that has been described as Lupin \"growing up\".<ref name=dc /><ref name=om />\n\n''Castle of Cagliostro'' marked Miyazaki's debut as a theatrical movie director, but he also was a writer, a designer, and a storyboardist on the movie.<ref name=\"om\">{{cite web | url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx | title=The Castle of Cagliostro Hayao Miyazaki's First (And Most Enjoyable) Movie | publisher=Otaku USA Magazine | date=9 March 2012 | accessdate=27 August 2013 | author=Surat, Daryl | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018154933/http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx | archive-date=18 October 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nThe production for the film began in May 1979 with the writing of the story and storyboarding for the film.<ref name=\"hm\" /> Miyazaki began by drawing a bird's eye view of the setting before creating the story to completion.

She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012) which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]'' (2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", all of which crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer, though she personally favoured the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well-appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl.\" She appeared in the ''[[Forbes|India Forbes]]'' Celebrity 100 in 2017 and 2019.\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar was a homemaker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012) which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]'' (2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", all of which crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer, though she personally favoured the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well-appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl.\" She appeared in the ''[[Forbes|India Forbes]]'' Celebrity 100 in 2017 and 2019.\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar was a homemaker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

His grievances against the governor stemmed from Berkeley's dismissive policy to the political challenges of its western frontier, particularly leaving Bacon out of his inner circle and refusing to allow Bacon to take part in fur trading with [[Native American tribes in Virginia|Native Americans]], and Berkeley refusing Bacon a military commission that would allow him to fight and attack Native Americans at his own discretion. Attacks by the [[Doeg people]] are credited with inciting the popular uprising against Berkeley for failing to address the demands of the colonists regarding the safety of the frontier. The Doeg people had both traded and made war on the Virginia frontier.\n\nStarting in the 1650s, as English colonists began to settle the Northern Neck frontier, then known as Chicacoan (Secocowon), some Doeg, Patawomeck and Rappahannock began moving into the region as well and joined local tribes in disputing the settlers' claims to land and resources. In July 1666, the colonists declared war on them. By 1669, colonists had patented the land on the west of the Potomac as far north as My Lord's Island. By 1670, they had driven most of the Doeg out of the Virginia colony and into Maryland\u2014apart from those living beside the Nanzatico/Portobago in Caroline County, Virginia.\n\nThe English continued to harass the Doeg on the Northern Neck and in July 1675, a Doeg raiding party crossed the Potomac and stole hogs from Thomas Mathew, in retaliation for him not paying them for traded goods. Mathew and other colonists pursued them to Maryland and killed a group of Doeg, as well as innocent Susquehannock. A Doeg war party retaliated by killing Mathew's son and two servants on his plantation. {{Citation needed|reason=Whole paragraph unsubstantiated|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn retaliation, a Virginian militia led by Nathaniel Bacon entered Maryland, attacked the Doeg and besieged the Susquehannock. This precipitated the general reaction against natives by the Virginia Colony that resulted in \"Bacon's Rebellion\". In 1676 Bacon took his armed force to the Green Dragon Swamp on the upper Pamunkey River where he killed nearly fifty Pamunkey Indians, which lead to the chief Cockacoeske issuing orders to the rest of the tribe to escape. She ordered her tribe to not harm anyone and stay true to their treaty of peace.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ethan A.

The alliance between [[Indentured servitude in the Americas|European indentured servants]] and [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]] (many [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] until death or freed), united by their bond-servitude, disturbed the ruling class. The ruling class responded by hardening the racial caste of slavery in an attempt to divide the two races from subsequent united uprisings with the passage of the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]].<ref name=Foner>Eric Foner, ''Give Me Liberty!: An American History'' (New York: W.W.

In addition, many colonists wished to attack and claim  Native American frontier land westward, but they were denied permission by Gov. Berkeley.<ref name=\"Foner\" />  Many of these colonists were former indentured servants whose contracts had terminated and who were now free, looking for land.\n\nModern historians have suggested the rebellion may have been a power play by Bacon against Berkeley and his favoritism towards certain members of the court. While Bacon was on the court, he was not within Berkeley's inner circle of council members and disagreed with him on many issues.  Bacon's financial backers included men of wealth from outside Berkeley's circle of influence.<ref name=Foner />\n\nHistorian Peter Thompson argues that Bacon's motivation was a personal vendetta between  Berkeley and him. However, Bacon's followers used the rebellion as an effort to gain government recognition of the shared interests among all social classes of the colony in protecting the \"commonality\" and advancing its welfare.<ref>Peter Thompson, \"The Thief, the Householder, and the Commons: Languages of Class in Seventeenth-Century Virginia,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2006) 63#2 pp 253-280 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877353 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n== Rebellion ==\nWhen Sir William Berkeley refused to retaliate against the Native Americans, farmers gathered around at the report of a new raiding party. Nathaniel Bacon arrived with a quantity of brandy; after it was distributed, he was elected leader. Against Berkeley's orders, the group struck south until they came to the [[Occaneechi]] people. After convincing the Occaneechi to attack the [[Susquehannock]], Bacon and his men followed by killing most of the men, women, and children at the village. Upon their return, they discovered that Berkeley had called for new elections to the Burgesses to better address the Native American raids.<ref>John Berry, Francis Moryson, and Herbert Jefferys, \"A True Narrative of the Rise, Progress and Cessation of the Late Rebellion in Virginia, Most Humbly an Impartially Recorded by His Majesties Commissioners, Appointed to inquire into the Affairs of the Said Colony\", Ed. by Charles Andrews, in ''Narrative of the Insurrections 1675 to 1690'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1915, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref>\n\n[[File:A Fair Mark - Shoot.jpg|thumb|Governor Berkeley baring his breast for Bacon to shoot after refusing him a commission (1895 engraving)]]\nThe recomposed [[House of Burgesses]] enacted a number of sweeping reforms (known as [[Bacon's Laws]]). (Bacon was not serving his duty in the House; rather, he was at his plantation miles away.) It limited the powers of the governor and restored suffrage rights to landless freemen.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Susan P.

The governor, however, refused to yield to the pressure. When Bacon had his men take aim at Berkeley, he responded by \"baring his breast\" to Bacon and told Bacon to shoot him.

His grievances against the governor stemmed from Berkeley's dismissive policy to the political challenges of its western frontier, particularly leaving Bacon out of his inner circle and refusing to allow Bacon to take part in fur trading with [[Native American tribes in Virginia|Native Americans]], and Berkeley refusing Bacon a military commission that would allow him to fight and attack Native Americans at his own discretion. Attacks by the [[Doeg people]] are credited with inciting the popular uprising against Berkeley for failing to address the demands of the colonists regarding the safety of the frontier. The Doeg people had both traded and made war on the Virginia frontier.\n\nStarting in the 1650s, as English colonists began to settle the Northern Neck frontier, then known as Chicacoan (Secocowon), some Doeg, Patawomeck and Rappahannock began moving into the region as well and joined local tribes in disputing the settlers' claims to land and resources. In July 1666, the colonists declared war on them. By 1669, colonists had patented the land on the west of the Potomac as far north as My Lord's Island. By 1670, they had driven most of the Doeg out of the Virginia colony and into Maryland\u2014apart from those living beside the Nanzatico/Portobago in Caroline County, Virginia.\n\nThe English continued to harass the Doeg on the Northern Neck and in July 1675, a Doeg raiding party crossed the Potomac and stole hogs from Thomas Mathew, in retaliation for him not paying them for traded goods. Mathew and other colonists pursued them to Maryland and killed a group of Doeg, as well as innocent Susquehannock. A Doeg war party retaliated by killing Mathew's son and two servants on his plantation. {{Citation needed|reason=Whole paragraph unsubstantiated|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn retaliation, a Virginian militia led by Nathaniel Bacon entered Maryland, attacked the Doeg and besieged the Susquehannock. This precipitated the general reaction against natives by the Virginia Colony that resulted in \"Bacon's Rebellion\". In 1676 Bacon took his armed force to the Green Dragon Swamp on the upper Pamunkey River where he killed nearly fifty Pamunkey Indians, which lead to the chief Cockacoeske issuing orders to the rest of the tribe to escape. She ordered her tribe to not harm anyone and stay true to their treaty of peace.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ethan A.

In addition, many colonists wished to attack and claim  Native American frontier land westward, but they were denied permission by Gov. Berkeley.<ref name=\"Foner\" />  Many of these colonists were former indentured servants whose contracts had terminated and who were now free, looking for land.\n\nModern historians have suggested the rebellion may have been a power play by Bacon against Berkeley and his favoritism towards certain members of the court. While Bacon was on the court, he was not within Berkeley's inner circle of council members and disagreed with him on many issues.  Bacon's financial backers included men of wealth from outside Berkeley's circle of influence.<ref name=Foner />\n\nHistorian Peter Thompson argues that Bacon's motivation was a personal vendetta between  Berkeley and him. However, Bacon's followers used the rebellion as an effort to gain government recognition of the shared interests among all social classes of the colony in protecting the \"commonality\" and advancing its welfare.<ref>Peter Thompson, \"The Thief, the Householder, and the Commons: Languages of Class in Seventeenth-Century Virginia,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2006) 63#2 pp 253-280 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877353 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n== Rebellion ==\nWhen Sir William Berkeley refused to retaliate against the Native Americans, farmers gathered around at the report of a new raiding party. Nathaniel Bacon arrived with a quantity of brandy; after it was distributed, he was elected leader. Against Berkeley's orders, the group struck south until they came to the [[Occaneechi]] people. After convincing the Occaneechi to attack the [[Susquehannock]], Bacon and his men followed by killing most of the men, women, and children at the village. Upon their return, they discovered that Berkeley had called for new elections to the Burgesses to better address the Native American raids.<ref>John Berry, Francis Moryson, and Herbert Jefferys, \"A True Narrative of the Rise, Progress and Cessation of the Late Rebellion in Virginia, Most Humbly an Impartially Recorded by His Majesties Commissioners, Appointed to inquire into the Affairs of the Said Colony\", Ed. by Charles Andrews, in ''Narrative of the Insurrections 1675 to 1690'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1915, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref>\n\n[[File:A Fair Mark - Shoot.jpg|thumb|Governor Berkeley baring his breast for Bacon to shoot after refusing him a commission (1895 engraving)]]\nThe recomposed [[House of Burgesses]] enacted a number of sweeping reforms (known as [[Bacon's Laws]]).

The governor, however, refused to yield to the pressure. When Bacon had his men take aim at Berkeley, he responded by \"baring his breast\" to Bacon and told Bacon to shoot him. Seeing that the governor would not be moved, Bacon then had his men take aim at the assembled burgesses, who quickly granted Bacon his commission. Bacon had earlier been promised a commission before he retired to his estate if he maintained \"good\" behavior for two weeks.

The most idolizing portrait of Bacon is found in ''Torchbearer of the Revolution'' (1940) by [[Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker]], which one scholar in 2011 called \"one of the worst books on Virginia that a reputable scholarly historian ever published.\"<ref>Tarter, Brent. \"Bacon's Rebellion, the Grievances of the People, and the Political Culture of Seventeenth-Century Virginia.\" The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 119, no. 1 (2011): 6; Rice, James D. Tales from a Revolution:  Bacon's Rebellion and the Transformation of Early America. Oxford University Press (Oxford:  2012.) Print. Pg. 204.</ref>  The central area of debate is Bacon's controversial character and complex disposition, as illustrated by [[Wilcomb Washburn]]'s ''The Governor and the Rebel'' (1957). Rather than singing Bacon's praises and chastising Berkeley's tyranny, Washburn found the roots of the rebellion in the colonists' intolerable demand to \"authorize the slaughter and dispossession of the innocent as well as the guilty.\"<ref>Washburn, ''The Governor and the Rebel'', p. 163</ref>\n\nMore nuanced approaches on Berkeley's supposed tyranny or mismanagement entertained specialist historians throughout the middle of the century, leading to a diversification of factors responsible for Virginia's contemporary instability. [[Wesley Frank Craven]] in the 1968 publication ''The Colonies in Transition'' argues that Berkeley's greatest failings took place during the revolt, near the end of his life.<ref>Craven, Wesley Frank.

Morgan]]'s classic 1975 ''[[American Slavery, American Freedom]]:  The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia'' connected the calamity of Bacon's Rebellion, namely the potential for lower-class revolt, with the colony's transition over to slavery: \"..But for those with eyes to see, there was an obvious lesson in the rebellion.

That would be politically difficult since it would require the United States to allow a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan to expire.{{sfnb|Trei|2001}} After an initial but less successful trip to Beijing in 1977 with Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]], Oksenberg traveled with National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] to Beijing in early 1978, where they met with [[Leonard Woodcock]], the head of the U.S. liaison office there, to lay the groundwork for establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries.<ref>See https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/24/world/michael-oksenberg-62-china-expert-in-washington.html?scp=2&sq=michel%20oksenberg&st=cse</ref> On December 15, 1978, the United States announced that on January 1, 1979, it would recognize Beijing as the legitimate government in China, ending formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, although the United States would still maintain informal ties with the island.\n\nOksenberg helped work out an intelligence-sharing arrangement with Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] on his visit to the United States in 1979. He also negotiated with China on assisting the Afghan resistance movement after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979.<ref>See https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/24/world/michael-oksenberg-62-china-expert-in-washington.html?scp=2&sq=michel%20oksenberg&st=cse</ref>\n\nOksenberg advised every subsequent U.S. president on China policy until his death in 2001. He was also largely involved in the shaping of the [[National Committee on U.S.-China Relations]], the [[Committee on Scholarly Communication with the People\u2019s Republic of China]], and the [[U.S.-China Business Council]].\n\n==Selected publications==\n* ''China\u2019s Developmental Experience (1973)\n* ''Dragon and Eagle\u2014United States-China Relations\u2014Past and Future, co-author (1978)\n* ''China\u2019s Participation in the IMF, the World Bank, and GATT, co-author (1990)\n* ''The Cultural Revolution, co-author (1981)\n* ''Policy Making in China, co-author (1988)\n* ''Beijing Spring, 1989: Confrontation and Conflict: The Basic Documents, co-author (1990)\n* ''An Emerging China in a World of Interdependence: A Report to the Trilateral Commission, co-author (1994)\n* ''Shaping U.S.-China Relations: A Long-Term Strategy, co-author (1997)\n* ''China Joins the World: Progress and Prospects, co-editor (1998)\n* ''A Century\u2019s Journey: How the Great Powers Shape the World, co-author (1999)\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References and further reading==\n*{{cite|title=The United States and China: A President\u2019s Perspective: An address by Jimmy Carter at the Inaugural Oksenberg Lecture at Stanford on 6 May 2002|first = Jimmy |last= Carter|year= 2002 |url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20030/Carter.pdf |accessdate=2009-04-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611002315/http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20030/Carter.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-11 |ref= harv}}.\n* {{cite journal |last =Goldstein, Steven M., Kenneth Lieberthal, [[Jean C.
