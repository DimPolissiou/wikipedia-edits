Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

(6963466635).jpg|thumb|right|275px|Depiction of the [[Bonsecours Market]] and [[Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel]] in [[Montreal]], 1853.]]\nThe '''history of Montreal''', located in the province of [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], spans about 800 years. At the time of European contact, the area was inhabited by the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]], a discrete and distinct group of [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[indigenous people]]. They spoke [[Laurentian language|Laurentian]]. [[Jacques Cartier]] became the first European to reach the area now known as [[Montreal]] in 1535 when he entered the village of ''[[Hochelaga (village)|Hochelaga]]'' on the [[Island of Montreal]] while in search of a passage to Asia during the [[Age of Exploration]].  Seventy years later, [[Samuel de Champlain]] unsuccessfully tried to create a fur [[trading post]] but the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] of the [[Iroquois]] defended what they had been using as their hunting grounds.\n\nA fortress named [[Fort Ville-Marie|Ville Marie]] was built in 1642 as part of a project to create a [[French colonial empire]].  Ville Marie became a centre for the [[fur trade]] and French expansion into [[New France]] until 1760, when it was surrendered to the British army, following the [[Montreal Campaign]].  British immigration expanded the city.  The city's golden era of fur trading began with the advent of the locally owned [[North West Company]].\n\nMontreal officially became a city in 1832.  The city's growth was spurred by the opening of the [[Lachine Canal]] and Montreal was the capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] from 1844 to 1849. Growth continued and by 1860 Montreal was the largest city in British North America and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of [[Canada]].  Annexation of neighbouring towns between 1883 and 1918 changed Montreal back to a mostly Francophone city.  The [[Great Depression in Canada]] brought unemployment to the city, but this waned in the mid-1930s, and skyscrapers began to be built.\n\nWorld War II brought protests against conscription and caused the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]].  Montreal's population surpassed one million in the early 1950s. A new [[Montreal Metro|metro]] system was added, Montreal's [[harbour]] was expanded, and the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] was opened during this time. More skyscrapers were built along with museums. Montreal's international status was cemented by [[Expo 67]] and the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. A major league baseball team, the [[Montreal Expos|Expos]], played in Montreal from 1969 to 2004 when the team relocated to [[Washington Nationals|Washington, DC]]. Historically, business and finance in Montreal were under the control of Anglophones. With the rise of Quebec nationalism in the 1970s, many institutions relocated their headquarters to Toronto.<ref>{{cite book|author=Erin Hurley|title=National Performance: Representing Quebec from Expo 67 to C\u00e9line Dion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bMVPsUeE3oC&pg=PA58|year=2011|publisher=U of Toronto Press|page=58}}</ref>\n\n==Pre-contact==\n[[File:Map of Hochelaga.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Hochelaga (village)|Hochelaga]] in 1535.

Some settled along the fertile St. Lawrence River, where fishing and hunting in nearby forests supported a full diet.  By the 14th century, the people had built [[fortified]] villages similar to those described by Cartier on his later visit.<ref name=\"Tremblay\">{{cite book|first=Roland|last=Tremblay|year=2006|title=The Saint Lawrence Iroquoians. Corn People.|location=Montr\u00e9al, Qc|publisher=Les \u00c9ditions de l'Homme}}</ref>\n\nHistorians and [[anthropologists]] have had many theories about the people encountered by Cartier, as well as the reasons for their disappearance from the valley about 1580.  Since the 1950s, archaeological and [[linguistics|linguistic]] comparative studies have established many facts about the people.  They are now called the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]] and recognized by scholars as distinct from other Iroquoian-language people, such as the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] or [[Iroquois]] of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'', although sharing some cultural characteristics.  Their language has been called [[Laurentian language|Laurentian]], a distinct branch of the family.<ref name=\"Tremblay\"/>\n\n==Montreal during the French colonial period==\nThe first European to reach the area was [[Jacques Cartier]] on  October 2, 1535. Cartier visited the villages of ''Hochelaga'' (on [[Montreal Island]]) and ''Stadacona'' (near modern [[Quebec City]]), and noted others in the valley which he did not name. He recorded about 200 words of the people's language.\n[[File:Jacques Cartier a Hochelaga.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques Cartier]] at Hochelaga. Cartier was the first European to arrive in the area, arriving in 1535.]]\nSeventy years after Cartier, explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] traveled to Hochelaga, but the village no longer existed, nor was there sign of any human habitation in the valley. At times historians theorized that the people migrated west to the Great Lakes (or were pushed out by conflict with other tribes, including the Huron), or suffered infectious disease. Since the 1950s, other theories have been proposed. The Mohawk had most to gain by moving up from New York into the ''Tadoussac'' area, at the confluence of the [[Saguenay River|Saguenay]] and St. Lawrence rivers, which was controlled by local ''[[Innu|Montagnais]]''.\n\nChamplain decided to establish a [[fur]] [[trading post]] at Place Royal on the Island of Montreal, but the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], based mostly in present-day New York, successfully defended what had by then become their hunting grounds and paths for their war parties.  It was not until 1639 that the French created a permanent settlement on the Island of Montreal, started by tax collector [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me le Royer de la Dauversi\u00e8re]].

By 1716, the French population had grown to 4,409 people while the native population was 1,177.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 7</ref> The French Population of Montreal began slowly through immigration. In 1642 a party of 50 Frenchmen representing the Societe de Notre Dame de Montreal pour la conversion des Sauvages de la Nouvelle France set foot on the island that the Compagnie des Cent Associes donated.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 16</ref> The initial settlement had 150 individuals in the first ten years; few remained for long because the site of Montreal was vulnerable to Iroquois attacks. Immigration to Montreal increased thereafter; between 1653 and 1659, 200 persons arrived.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Eventually approximately 1200 to 1500 immigrants settled on the island of Montreal between 1642 and 1714; 75% remained and half of them came before 1670.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Immigrants came from different regions of France: 65 percent of the immigrants were rural; 25 percent of the immigrants were from the largest cities of France; 10 percent from smaller urban communities.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 46</ref> \n[[File:Plan of Montreal, 1687-1723.jpg|thumb|Development plan for the settlement, 1687\u20131723.

This was because Quebec City was the primary place for merchants to immigrate to; all the merchants who came to Montreal were related to a resident or another merchant.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 44</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th century there were drastic changes in the demographics of Montreal. In 1666, 56 percent of the population were newcomers to Montreal; by 1681, 66% of Montreal was native-born.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 47</ref> There was a male to female sex ratio of 163:100 in 1666, by 1681 it was 133:100.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Although, the population of Montreal was still dominated by males, the female population grew. The rural proportion represented two-thirds in the first 40 years. However, by 1715-1730 the urban proportion was about 45 percent.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 62</ref> Data from 1681 to 1739 show that the point of equilibrium was reached around 1695, with males accounting for 51.6 percent of the population. This percent of the population was maintained until 1710, through immigration that was predominantly male.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The infant mortality rates in Montreal grew from 9.8% in 1676 to 18.0% to 1706\u20131715.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 60</ref> Illegitimacy rate for Montreal was 1.87 percent higher than the rest of colony due to the status of the Montreal as a garrison town; some unwed mothers from the countryside would abandon their children in the town.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 57</ref> Despite some differences in the pattern of population in comparison to the rest of the colony, Montreal's population developed at approximately the same rhythm as that of the whole colony. In the 18th century, the population grew at an even rate of 2.5 percent per annum until 1725 when the growth rate decreased to 0.7 percent per annum.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 61</ref>\n\n===Economy of Montreal===\n{{One source|section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Western New France, 1688.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Great Lakes]] area west of Montreal. Because of rapids west of Montreal, portages were required to travel further inland, making Montreal a key distribution point for trade.]]\nIn the 17th century, Montreal acted as a point of trans-shipment and a stopover on the passage to the interior.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 66</ref> Due to the rapids upriver from Montreal, free sailing through the Saint-Laurence ended in Montreal. Portages inland were then taken. This effectively made Montreal a major distribution centre rather than a mere trading post.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Pelts and merchandise were stocked for distribution inland and out. Montreal lacked moorings in the 17th century, forcing trans-Atlantic vessels with larger capacity to unload at Quebec. Goods from Quebec had to be transported by river between the two towns until the construction of a road in 1735.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Montreal remained subservient to Quebec due to its isolation. Trade between Montreal and France remained indirect.\n\nNot long after its establishment, Montreal provided for its own subsistence.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 78</ref> However, the colony was still dependent on France for a range of finished products, iron, and salt.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Montreal's principal import, before the end of the 17th century, was finished fabric. The seigneurs of Montreal who owned large flock organized the manufacture and sale of their wool to compensate for the imports. To the contrary, in the early 18th century, for peasants who kept their own sheep and grew flax, production was limited to their own needs. This led to few weavers and a left no more than 5% of textiles sold in Montreal to be manufactured locally. Louise Dechene states: \"There was no market-oriented production of fabrics and, understandably no import of raw materials.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/>\n\nGuns, shot, bullets, and powder represented 15% of imported cargo.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 80</ref> The presence of guns meant that colonies retained the services of blacksmiths, or arquebusiers, to repair guns, manufacture bullets, and perform other duties to relieve dependence on imports.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 81</ref> 4-5% of imports were kettles.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> The kettle at this time took the form of an \"easily transportable large copper cauldron\".<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Knives, scissors, and awls had to be imported. Local production of these items did not begin until approximately 1660. By 1720, all iron tools could be purchased exclusively from colonial blacksmiths.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Small stocks of glassware, porcelain, and china were imported as well.\n\nSoon after the founding of the Montreal, when the population numbered 8, the Company of One Hundred Associates gave the city's trading rights up to the colonial merchants.

The fur trade with the natives and the [[coureur des bois]] was a vital part of the settlement's early economy.]]\nThese natives would come to Montreal on occasion to participate in economic activity. One of these occasions happened every August, as Montreal welcomed hundreds of member of various nations to an annual fur fair which dwindled after 1680; as many as 500 to 1000 natives would attend to get better prices than the voyageurs would offer, and the governor would meet them for a ceremony. They would stay outside of town until late September.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 10</ref> There were also some natives who lived on the island and in the settlement of Montreal as permanent residents. There were a couple missions founded in Montreal for natives, such as the 1671 La Montagne Mission by the Sulpicians and the Jesuit at Sault-Saint-Louis (Kahnawake).<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 6</ref> The mission population rose in the 18th century through natural increase and some newcomers; between 1735 and 1752, Kahnawake contained about 1000 people, as did Lac-des-duex-Montagnes.  Montreal had some natives residing within the settlement, even if it was temporary, the Jesuits recorded 76 baptisms in 1643 of native children, and this continued to be recorded until 1653.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants,  5</ref> Despite the presence of natives in the settlement of Montreal there seems to be very little intermixing with only seven registered mixed marriages in Montreal, though the number of actually mixed marriages was probably slightly higher.<ref name=\"ReferenceH\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants,  9</ref> Native slaves were also a reality in Montreal, there were about 50 or so slaves recorded on the island of Montreal in 1716.<ref name=\"ReferenceH\"/>  Therefore, the presence of Natives was definitely necessary for trade, but the Natives were never really integrated into the city of Montreal itself.\n\nVery little information exists on how the colony of Montreal obtained foodstuffs before 1663.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants,  188</ref> The town of Montreal was too small to act as an important internal market. Though habitants came to Montreal to sell their goods (such as eggs, chickens, vegetables, and other goods), it was never a regional distribution centre for grain.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants,  192</ref> Furthermore, despite a surplus of unsold wheat at the colony, flour and lard were still regularly imported to feed French troops during the seventeenth century.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\"/> The ineffective use of the wheat surplus remained a contentious issue for the habitants in Montreal and the royalty in France.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 192-193</ref>  An intendant explained that:\n\"The habitants do not grow hemp because they get nothing for it. Wool is plentiful, but there is no market. They have enough to ensure their subsistence, but since they are all in the same position, the cannot make any money, and this prevents them from meeting other needs and keeps them so poor in winter that we have been told that there are men and women who wander about practically naked.\"<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants,  193</ref>\n \nIn the eighteenth century, Montreal was central to the illegal trade of furs.<ref>Jean Lunn, The Illegal Fur Trade Out of New France 1713-60 (McGill University: Montreal, 1939) 61</ref> The illegal fur trade can be defined as the \"export of furs to any destination other than France\".<ref>Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 66</ref> French merchants carried furs were carried down the Richelieu River to English, Dutch, and the converted Jesuit Iroquois at Albany. The contraband was buried outside the walls of Montreal at the request of merchants in order to avoid more loyal French eyes.<ref>Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 61</ref> Furs were traded illegally between Quebec and Albany, however these instances were less extensive than the illegal trade between Quebec and France or Boston.<ref>Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 64</ref> Some estimates place the furs being illegally traded from Montreal to roughly half or two-thirds of total fur-production at the beginning of the 1700s.<ref name=\"Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 65\">Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 65</ref> Later in the century, records appear to be silent. The presence of English supplies amongst the Iroquois during the period, among other reasons, is given as proof of a continued existence of the illegal fur trade between colonies.<ref name=\"Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 65\"/>\n\n===The design of Montreal===\nThe organization and building of towns in New France attempted to continue the history of France and had similar designs to the homes and buildings of France. Originally with the lack of stone and the plentiful number of lumber cites like Montreal were almost completely made with wooden buildings designed in the French style.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\">Morisset, Lucie K., and Luc Noppen. \"Architectural History: The French Colonial R\u00e9gime.\" The Canadian Encyclopedia. Historica-Dominion Institute, 2012.  Feb. 2013.</ref> These buildings completely relied on the use of classic French building techniques and many of the craftsmen refused to use anything other than sawn and squared lumber. This caused the natives such as the Iroquoians to view the building methods of the colonists as odd as almost all of their building was done with unfinished materials such as branches, bark and tree trunks.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\"/> The buildings in the city of Montreal remained wooden until the year 1664 when Louis XIV declared the colony an officially recognized province.\n[[File:130, rue Notre-Dame Ouest.jpg|thumb|[[Saint-Sulpice Seminary (Montreal)|Saint-Sulpice Seminary]] in 1839. Completed in 1687, the seminary is the oldest standing building in Montreal.]]\nThis declaration led to the introduction of \u2018king\u2019s engineers\u2019 to New France and to Montreal. This led to actual city layout planning and a shift to stone buildings as well.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\"/> The government of Montreal helped plan the layout of the city; several aspects of the design of the city in the French colonial period are still present. The Sulpicians, who became the seigneurs of Montreal in 1663, perhaps played the largest role in the early formation of the city.<ref>\"The Old Seminary and Notre-Dame Basilica,\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape17/eng/17fena.htm.</ref>  The Sulpicians helped design Montreal's chequerboard city plan decided upon in 1671 and with the help of the king's engineers the establishment of stone buildings also began.<ref name=\"Robert, Jean-Claude 1994\">Robert, Jean-Claude. Atlas Historique De Montr\u00e9al. Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec: Art Global, 1994.</ref> For example, Father Superior of the Sulpicians Dollier de Casson and surveyor B\u00e9nigne Basset originally planned Rue Notre Dame to be the main street of Montreal in 1672.<ref>\"Central Rue Notre-Dame West,\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape18/eng/18fena.htm.</ref> The designers themselves were all similar to the Father Superior not architects by profession and so the engineers worked closely with the religious order to design and build Montreal. Casson for example also designed the Old Sulpician Seminary, the oldest standing building in Montreal and home to the oldest gardens in North America, in 1684.<ref>\"The Old Seminary and Notre-Dame Basilica.\"</ref> \n \nThe lack of architects led to the lack of classical metropolitan form common in France and so many buildings had more basic designs.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\"/>  The workers did improve however and as stonemasons became more skilled and stone more available stone buildings became more common.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\"/> Stonemasons became the men in charge when in came to building as their resource was of the highest demand and what ever could be done without stone was, this had some unfortunate side effects though as fires in Montreal became common. When more stone was used, the issue arose of cracking as the cold and heat expansion stressed the stone this led to the discovery of a basic plan, which worked for the environment and uniformity in buildings. The roofs in Montreal were designed to be of a sharp pitch and they were topped not with slate, which common in France, but were uncommon in Montreal, and they used cedar shingles and the cheaper method of Canadian-style sheet metal roofing.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\"/> The Ch\u00e2teau Ramezay, which was built in 1705 as the residence for then-Governor Claude de Ramezay was built with these building styles.<ref>\"Rue Notre-Dame East,\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape2/eng/2text5a.htm.</ref>\n\nCanadian-specific architecture in Montreal began to evolve and form after the fire ordinances in 1721, as wood was removed as much as possible from dwellings and left buildings almost completely stone.<ref name=\"Robert, Jean-Claude 1994\"/> This also eliminated the common wooden fashionable extras and designs common in France. This caused only churches truly to have any form of decoration on them and caused many of the colonial buildings to be plain. This lack of artistic expression to demonstrate wealth caused many of the wealthy simply to build larger buildings to demonstrate their greatness. This caused a large boom in the demand for stone and an increase in the size of Montreal.<ref>Morisset, Lucie K., and Luc Noppen. \"Architectural History: The French Colonial R\u00e9gime.\" The Canadian Encyclopedia.

Fort Ville-Marie was the first European fortified settlement established the area.]]\nIn 1645, a fort was established on the island of Montreal and this was the beginning of Montreal's military history. The fort was key and effective in repelling the raids of the Iroquois and would become a station for soldiers for years to come.<ref>Atherton, William H. Montreal, 1535-1914. (Montreal: S.J.

Many of the expeditions who went out to explore Ontario and the Ohio River Valley would start in Montreal, but much of the time in the beginning they would not make it far or they would be forced to return by hostile native forces.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 124</ref>\n  \nDuring the early 1700s, many military expeditions left from Montreal to finally deal with the Hostile natives and to strengthen alliances with the Native allies. This led to one of the most significant events to occur in Montreal during this period was the Great Peace of 1701. The conference took place in August and was between the French and representatives of thirty-nine different Aboriginal nations. For the conference an estimated 2000-3000 people (including roughly 1300 native delegates) entered a theatre south of Pointe-\u00e0-Calli\u00e8re to listen to speeches given by French leaders and native chiefs.<ref>Gilles Havard, Montreal, 1701: Planting the Tree of Peace (Montreal: Recherches Am\u00e9rindiennes au Qu\u00e9bec, 2001), 42-43.</ref> The French engaged in many Aboriginal gestures of peace, including the burying of hatchets, the exchange of wampum belts, and the use of peace pipes.<ref>Havard,  44.</ref> While the French signed their names using their alphabet, the Aboriginal leaders notably used totem symbols to sign the treaty.<ref>Havard,  47</ref> \n[[File:Fortifications Montreal.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the fortified walls of Montreal in 1752.

The military thus established many forts along the \u2018borders\u2019 down the Ohio Valley into New Orleans.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 315</ref> Many of these such as Detroit relied on Montreal to reinforce them with supplies and military men furthering Montreal's military involvement and development.\n[[File:Capitulation Montreal.jpg|thumb|French authorities surrender the city of Montreal to the British in 1760.]]\nDue to the importance of Montreal to New France, a double wall 6.4 metres tall and over three kilometres long was erected in 1737 (after twenty years of construction) to protect the city. Only some of the base of the wall remains today.<ref>\"Champ-de-Mars,\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape1/eng/1text2a.htm.</ref> This helped make Montreal the most militarily capable town in New France, and so when the seven years war started Montreal was declared the military headquarters for operations in the North American Theater.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 391</ref> As the military headquarters, the number of military men in Montreal began to increase and the town itself was further expanded and stressed Montreal for supplies.\n\nIn 1757 the number of soldiers and natives stationed in Montreal had gotten so great that Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil the Governor of New France realized they needed to take action on a campaign or the army and the town would begin to suffer from starvation. This led to the great campaign of 1757 and with his large force of native allies and the bronzed soldiery of France General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm moved the large force out of Montreal and left a garrison in its place, relieving the pressure on the city to supply the military slightly.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 404</ref> Montcalm was very successful in his military efforts keeping spirits in Montreal high and the people hopeful. After his victory at Carillon, Montcalm returned to Montreal; having just defeated 16,000 British forces Montcalm seemed to be in a good position.<ref>Atherton, Montreal,419</ref> This would prove false, because of Montcalm's lack of troops in comparison to the British. Learning of an invasion coming over the Saint Laurence, Montcalm took his forces to reinforce Quebec City.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 428</ref> Montcalm would die there and Quebec City would be lost, which caused a major shock in Montreal as it now seemed they were doomed and though the city was also briefly established as the capital, but with three British armies headed for it, the town would not last long. In September 1760, the French forces finally capitulated to the British and the French colonial rule ended in Montreal.\n\n==British rule and the American Revolution==\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Conquest of Canada}}\n[[File:EthanAllenBeforePrescott1775.jpeg|thumb|[[Ethan Allen]] marched through the streets of Montreal after [[Battle of Longue-Pointe|his attempt]] to take the city in 1775. A few months later, the city would be briefly occupied by [[United States|American rebels]] without a fight.]]\nVille-Marie remained a French settlement until 1760, when [[Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial]] surrendered it to the British army under [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] after a [[Montreal Campaign|two month campaign]]. With Great Britain's victory in the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763 marked its end, with the French being forced to cede [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] and all its dependencies to the other nation.<ref>\"His Most Christian Majesty cedes and guaranties to his said Britannick Majesty, in full right, Canada, with all its dependencies, as well as the island of Cape Breton, and all the other islands and coasts in the gulph and river of St. Lawrence, and in general, every thing that depends on the said countries, lands, islands, and coasts, with the sovereignty, property, possession, and all rights acquired by treaty, or otherwise, which the Most Christian King and the Crown of France have had till now over the said countries, lands, islands, places, coasts, and their inhabitants\" \u2013 [[s:Treaty of Paris (1763)|''Treaty of Paris'']], 1763</ref>\n\nAs a British colony, and with immigration no longer limited to members of the Roman Catholic religion, the city began to grow from British immigration.  [[American Revolution]]ists under General [[Richard Montgomery]] briefly captured the city during the [[invasion of Canada (1775)|1775 invasion of Canada]] but left when it became obvious they could not hold Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrevolution.com/his_first_phase_invasion.html|title=The Invasion of Canada and the Fall of Boston|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=americanrevolution.com}}</ref>  Often having suffered loss of property and personal attacks during hostilities, thousands of English-speaking [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] migrated to Canada from the American colonies during and after the American Revolution.

The golden era of fur trading began in the city with the advent of the locally owned [[North West Company]], the main rival to the primarily British [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. The first machine shop in Montreal, owned by one George Platt, was in operation before 1809.<ref>{{harvnb|Denison|1955|p=64}}</ref> The census of 1821 numbered 18,767 residents.<ref>{{harvnb|Denison|1955|p=136}}</ref>\n\nThe town's population was majority Francophones until around the 1830s. From the 1830s, to about 1865, it was inhabited by a majority of Anglophones, most of recent immigration from the British Isles or other parts of British North America. Fire destroyed one quarter of the town on May 18, 1765.\n\n===Scottish contributions===\n{{further|Scots-Quebecer}}\nScottish immigrants constructed Montreal's first bridge across the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and founded many of the city's great industries, including [[Henry Morgan (merchant)|Morgan's]], the first [[department store]] in Canada, incorporated within the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1970s; the [[Bank of Montreal]]; [[Redpath Sugar]]; and both of Canada's national railroads. The city boomed as railways were built to [[New England]], [[Toronto]], and the west, and [[factory|factories]] were established along the Lachine Canal. Many buildings from this time period are concentrated in the area known today as [[Old Montreal]]. Noted for their [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] work, Scots established and funded numerous Montreal institutions, such as [[McGill University]], the [[Literary and Historical Society of Quebec]], the [[High School of Montreal]], and the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]].\n\n==The City of Montreal==\n[[File:Incendie Parlement Montreal.jpg|thumb|Political protests in 1849 led to the [[burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal]].]]\nMontreal was incorporated as a city in 1832. The city's growth was spurred by the opening of the [[Lachine Canal]], which permitted ships to pass by the unnavigable Lachine Rapids south of the island. As the capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] from 1844 to 1849, Montreal attracted more English-speaking immigrants: [[United Empire Loyalist|Late Loyalist]]s, [[Ireland|Irish]], [[Scotland|Scottish]], and English. The population of Montreal grew from 40,000 in 1841 to 57,000 a decade later.<ref>{{harvnb|Denison|1955|p=183}}</ref>\n\nRiots led by Tories led to the [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|burning of the Provincial Parliament]].

Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a 3-month-long military course in Montreal in 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in Montreal. Established by Militia General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, drill and discipline, to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company's Officer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~theislands/photos6/ansonkeillmilcert.jpg |title=Anson Keill's Second class certificate from the School of Military Instruction, Kingston |access-date=2016-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407162844/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~theislands/photos6/ansonkeillmilcert.jpg |archive-date=2016-04-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867.

While Confederate troops secured arms and supplies from the friendly British, Union soldiers and agents spied on their activity while similarly arranging for weapons shipments from France. [[John Wilkes Booth]] spent some time in Montr\u00e9al prior to assassinating President Lincoln, and in one case was said to have drunkenly gallivanted throughout the city telling anyone who would listen of his plan to kill Lincoln. Almost all took him to be a fool. After the War, President of the Confederacy [[Jefferson Davis]] stayed at a manor house located at the current site of The Bay on Sainte-Catherine's Street West; a plaque commemorating the site was installed on the West wall of the building, on Union Avenue, in 1957 by the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]]. The plaque was removed in 2017.\n\n===Industrialization===\n[[File:Le canal Lachine.jpg|thumb|View of [[Lachine Canal]] in 1852. Bypassing the rapids west of the city, the canal linked Montreal with other continental markets, spurring its industrialization.]]\nThe Lachine Canal and major new businesses linked the established port of Montreal with continental markets and led to rapid [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]] during the mid-19th century. The economic boom attracted [[French Canadian]] labourers from the surrounding countryside to factories in satellite cities such as [[Saint-Henri, Montreal|Saint-Henri]] and [[Hochelaga-Maisonneuve|Maisonneuve]]. [[Irish Canadians|Irish]] immigrants settled in tough working-class neighbourhoods such as [[Pointe-Saint-Charles]] and [[Griffintown]], making English and French linguistic groups roughly equal in size. The growing city also attracted immigrants from Italy, and Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Powell|title=Encyclopedia of North American Immigration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VNCX6UsdZYkC&pg=PA194|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=194\u201395}}</ref>\n\nIn 1852, Montreal had 58,000 inhabitants and by 1860, Montreal was the largest city in British North America, and it was the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada. From 1861 to the [[Great Depression]] of 1930, Montreal developed in what some historians call its Golden Age. [[Saint Jacques Street]] became the most important economic centre of the Dominion of Canada. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] made its headquarters there in 1880, and the [[Canadian National Railway]] in 1919. At the time of its construction in 1928, the new head office of the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] at 360 St. James Street was the tallest building in the [[British Empire]]. With the annexation of neighbouring towns between 1883 and 1918, Montreal became a mostly Francophone city again. The tradition of alternating between a francophone and an anglophone mayor began, lasting until 1914.\n\nMontreal shared control of the Canadian securities market with Toronto from the 1850s to the 1970s causing a persistent rivalry between the two. The financiers were Anglophones. However both cities were overshadowed by London and later New York, for they had easy access to these much larger financial centres.<ref>Ranald C.

After the war, the [[Prohibition]] movement in the United States turned Montreal into a destination for Americans looking for alcohol.  Americans went to Montreal for its drinking, gambling, and prostitution, unrivalled in North America at this time, which earned the city the nickname \"Sin City\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/north-america/canada/montreal?v=print|title=Lonely Planet Montreal Guide - Modern History|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]}}</ref>\n\nMontreal had a population of 618,000 in 1921, growing to 903,000 in 1941.\n\nThe twenties saw many changes in the city and the introduction of new technologies continued to have a prominent impact. The introduction of the car in large numbers began to transform the nature of the city. The world's first commercial radio station, XWA began broadcasting in 1920. A huge mooring mast for dirigibles was constructed in St. Hubert in anticipation of trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service, but only one craft, the R-100, visited in 1930 and the service never developed. However, Montreal became the eastern hub of the Trans-Canada Airway in 1939.\n\nFilm production became a part of the city activity. Associated Screen News of Canada in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, \"Kinograms\" in the twenties and \"Canadian Cameo\" from 1932 to 1953. The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the [[National Film Board of Canada]], in Montreal, in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit including the very popular, \"The World in Action\" and \"Canada Carries On\", series of monthly propaganda films. Other developments in the cultural field included the founding of [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] in 1919 and the [[Montreal Symphony Orchestra]] in 1934. The [[Montreal Forum]], built in 1924 became the home ice rink of the fabled Montreal Canadiens hockey team.\n\nDr. [[Wilder Penfield]], with a grant from the US [[Rockefeller Foundation]] founded the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] at the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]] (Montreal), in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases. Research into the design of nuclear weapons was conducted at the Montreal Laboratory of the [[National Research Council of Canada]] during World War II.\n\n===Great Depression===\n[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A Montreal [[soup kitchen]] in 1931. Like the rest of Canada, unemployment in Montreal was high during the [[Great Depression]].]]\nUnemployment was high during the [[Great Depression in Canada]] in the 1930s.  Canada began to recover from the Great Depression in the mid-1930s, and real estate developers began to build skyscrapers, changing Montreal's skyline. The [[Sun Life Building]], built in 1931, was for a time the tallest building in the British Commonwealth.  During World War II its vaults were used as the hiding place for the [[gold bullion]] of the [[Bank of England]] and the [[British Crown Jewels]].\n\nWith so many men unemployed women had to scrimp on spending to meet the reduced family budget. About a fourth of the workforce were women, but most women were housewives. Denyse Baillargeon uses oral histories to discover how Montreal housewives handled shortages of money and resources during the depression years. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat\u2014sometimes even horse meat and recycled the [[Sunday roast]] into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and kept the house colder. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies, Baillargeon finds, show that women's domestic labor\u2014cooking, cleaning, budgeting, shopping, childcare\u2014was essential to the economic maintenance of the family and offered room for economies. Most of her informants also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer.  Extended families used mutual aid\u2014extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans\u2014to help cousins and in-laws.<ref>Denyse Baillargeon, ''Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression'' (Wilfrid Laurier U. Press, 1999) pp 70, 108, 136\u201338, 159.</ref> Half of the Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births\u2014the number of births nationwide fell from 250,000 in 1930 to about 228,000 and did not recover until 1940.<ref>{{cite book|author=M.

Mayor [[Camillien Houde]] protested against conscription. He urged Montrealers to ignore the [[Government of Canada|federal government]]'s registry of all men and women because he believed it would lead to conscription.  The federal government at [[Ottawa]], considering Houde's actions treasonable, incarcerated him in a prison camp in Petawawa, Ontario, for over four years, from 1940 until 1944. That year the government instituted conscription in order to expand the armed forces to confront the Axis Powers. (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]]).\n\n==The Quiet Revolution and the modernization of Montreal==\n[[File:Stephane Prefontaine, Sandra Henderson 1976.jpg|thumb|Lighting of the [[Olympic Torch]] inside Montreal's [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]]. The city hosted the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].]]\n{{further|Quiet Revolution}}\nBy the beginning of the 1960s, a new political movement was rising in Quebec. The newly elected Liberal government of Jean Lesage made reforms that helped francophone Quebecers gain more influence in politics and in the economy, thus changing the city.  More francophones began to own businesses as Montreal became the centre of French culture in North America.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1964, four of Montreal's ten tallest buildings were completed: [[Tour de la Bourse]], [[Place Ville-Marie]], the [[CIBC Building]] and [[CIL House]]. Montreal gained an increased international status due to the World's Fair of 1967, known as [[Expo 67]], for which innovative construction such as Habitat was completed. During the 1960s, mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] carried upgraded infrastructure throughout the city, such as the construction of the [[Montreal Metro]], while the provincial government built much of what is today's highway system.  Like many other North American cities during these years, Montreal had developed so rapidly that its infrastructure was lagging behind its needs.\n\nIn 1969, a police strike resulted in 16 hours of unrest, known as the [[Murray-Hill riot|Murray Hill riot]].<ref name=\"CBC Digital\">http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/civil-unrest/general-27/montreals-night-of-terror.html</ref> Police were motivated to strike because of difficult working conditions caused by disarming [[FLQ|separatist-planted bombs]] and patrolling frequent protests and wanting higher pay.<ref name=\"CBC Digital\"/> The [[National Assembly of Quebec]] passed an emergency law forcing the police back to work. By the time order was restored, 108 people had been arrested.<ref name=\"CBC Digital\"/>\n\nThe [[1976 Summer Olympics]], officially known as the \"Games of the XXI Olympiad\", held in Montreal, was the first Olympics in Canada.  The Games helped introduce Quebec and Canada to the rest of the world.  The entire province of Quebec prepared for the games and associated activities, generating a resurgence of interest in amateur athletics across the province. The spirit of Qu\u00e9bec nationalism helped motivate the organizers; however, the city went $1 billion into debt.<ref>Patrick Allen, \"Les Jeux Olympiques: Icebergs ou Rampes de Lancements?,\" [The Olympic Games: Icebergs or launching pads?] ''Action Nationale'' (1976) 65#5 pp 271-323</ref><ref>Paul Charles Howell, ''The Montreal Olympics: An Insider's View of Organizing a Self-financing Games'' (Montr\u00e9al: McGill-Queens University Press, 2009)</ref>\n\n==Quebec Independence Movement ==\n{{further|Quebec sovereignty movement|History of the Quebec sovereignty movement}}\nAt the end of the 1960s, the independence movement in Quebec was in full swing due to a constitutional debate between the Ottawa and Quebec governments.  Radical groups formed, most notably the [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec]] (FLQ). In October 1970, members of the FLQ's \"[[Liberation Cell]]\" kidnapped and murdered [[Pierre Laporte]], a minister in the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]], and also kidnapped [[James Cross]], a British diplomat, who was later released. The [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Pierre Trudeau]], ordered the military occupation of Montreal and invoked the [[War Measures Act]], giving unprecedented peacetime powers to police. The social unrest and related events became known as the [[October Crisis]] of 1970.\n\nSovereignty was addressed through the ballot box.  The [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] held two referendums on the question, in 1980 and in 1995. During those decades, about 300,000 English-speaking Quebecers left Quebec.  The uncertain political climate caused substantial social and economic impacts, as a significant number of Montrealers, mostly Anglophone, took their businesses and migrated to other provinces.  The extent of the transition was greater than the norm for major urban centres. With the passage of [[Charter of the French Language|Bill 101]] in 1977, the government gave primacy to French as the only official language for all levels of government in Quebec, the main language of business and culture, and the exclusive language for public signage and business communication. In the rest of Canada, the government adopted a bilingual policy, producing all government materials in both French and English.  The success of the separatist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois caused uncertainty over Quebec's economic future, leading to an exodus of corporate headquarters to Toronto and Calgary.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mark J.

By the late 1990s, however, Montreal's economic climate had improved, as new firms and institutions began to fill the traditional business and financial niches.<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Brooke |title=Montreal Journal; No Longer Fading, City Booms Back Into Its Own |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E3D91438F935A35756C0A9669C8B63 |work=New York Times |date=2000-05-06 |accessdate=2008-04-12 }}</ref>\n\nAs the city celebrated its 350th anniversary in 1992, construction began on two new skyscrapers: [[1000 de La Gaucheti\u00e8re]] and [[1250 Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque]]. Montreal's improving economic conditions allowed further enhancements of the city [[infrastructure]], with the expansion of the metro system, construction of new skyscrapers, and the development of new highways, including the start of a [[Beltway|ring road]] around the island. The city attracted several international organisations that moved their secretariats into Montreal's Quartier International: [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA), [[International Council of Societies of Industrial Design]] (Icsid), [[International Council of Graphic Design Associations]] (Icograda), [http://www.ibcr.org International Bureau for Children's Rights] (IBCR), [http://www.crime-prevention-intl.org International Centre for the Prevention of Crime] (ICPC) and the [[UNESCO]] Institute for Statistics (UIS). With developments such as Centre de Commerce Mondial (World Trade Centre), Quartier International, Square Cartier, and proposed revitalization of the harbourfront, Montreal is regaining its international position as a world-class city.\n\n==Merger and demerger==\n{{Main|Montreal Merger|Municipal reorganization in Quebec}}\n[[File:Montreal2001.png|thumb|The municipalities of the [[Island of Montreal]] prior to the [[2002\u201306 municipal reorganization of Montreal|2002 merger]] of all municipalities on the island.]]\nThe concept of having one municipal government for the island of Montreal was first proposed by [[Jean Drapeau]] in the 1960s. The idea was strongly opposed in many suburbs, although [[Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies]], [[Ahuntsic-Cartierville#Ville de Saraguay|Saraguay]] ([[Saraguay]]) and [[Saint-Michel-de-Laval|Ville Saint Michel]], now the [[Saint-Michel, Montreal|Saint-Michel]] neighbourhood) were annexed to Montreal between 1963 and 1968. [[Pointe-aux-Trembles]] was annexed in 1982.\n\nIn 2001, the provincial government announced a plan to merge major cities with their suburbs. As of January 1, 2002, the entire [[Island of Montreal]], home to 1.8 million people, as well as the several outlying islands that were also part of the Montreal Urban Community, [[Municipal reorganization in Quebec|were merged]] into a new \"megacity\". Some 27 suburbs as well as the former city were folded into several [[Arrondissement#Montreal|boroughs]], named after their former cities or (in the case of parts of the former Montreal) districts.\n\nDuring the [[2003 Quebec general election|2003 provincial elections]], the winning [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] had promised to submit the mergers to referendums. On June 20, 2004, a number of the former cities voted to demerge from Montreal and regain their municipal status, although not with all the powers they once had. The following voted to demerge: [[Baie-d'Urf\u00e9, Quebec|Baie-d'Urf\u00e9]], [[Beaconsfield, Quebec|Beaconsfield]], [[C\u00f4te Saint-Luc]], [[Dollard-des-Ormeaux]], [[Dorval]], the uninhabited [[L'\u00cele-Dorval, Quebec|L'\u00cele-Dorval]], [[Hampstead, Quebec|Hampstead]], [[Kirkland, Quebec|Kirkland]], [[Montr\u00e9al-Est, Quebec|Montr\u00e9al-Est]], [[Montreal West, Quebec|Montreal West]], [[Mount Royal, Quebec|Mount Royal]], [[Pointe-Claire]], [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue]], [[Senneville, Quebec|Senneville]], and [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]]. The demergers were effective on January 1, 2006.\n\n[[Anjou, Quebec|Anjou]], [[LaSalle, Quebec|LaSalle]], [[\u00cele Bizard|L'\u00cele-Bizard]], [[Pierrefonds, Quebec|Pierrefonds]], [[Roxboro, Quebec|Roxboro]], [[Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, Quebec|Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]], and [[Saint-Laurent, Quebec|Saint-Laurent]] had majority votes in favour of demerger, but their turnout of voters was insufficient to meet the requirements for the decision, so those former municipalities remained part of Montreal. No referendum was held in [[Lachine, Quebec|Lachine]], [[Montr\u00e9al-Nord]], [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont]], [[St. Leonard, Quebec|Saint Leonard]], or [[Verdun, Quebec|Verdun]] - nor in any of the boroughs that were part of the former city of Montreal.\n[[File:Montreal2006.png|thumb|left|The Island of Montreal and its municipalities after several communities were reestablished as independent communities in 2006.]]\nThe Island of Montreal now has 16 municipalities (the city of Montreal proper plus 15 independent municipalities). The post-demerger city of Montreal (divided into 19 boroughs) has a territory of {{convert|366.02|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and a population of 1,583,590 inhabitants (based on 2001 census figures). Compared with the pre-merger city of Montreal, this is a net increase of 96.8% in land area, and 52.3% in population.\n\nThe city of Montreal has nearly as many inhabitants as the former unified city of Montreal (the recreated suburban municipalities are less densely populated than the core city), but population growth is expected to be slower for some time. Analysts note that the overwhelming majority of industrial sites are located in the territory of the post-demerger city of Montreal. The current city of Montreal is about half the size of the post-1998 merger city of Toronto (both in terms of land area and population).\n\nThe 15 recreated suburban municipalities have fewer government powers than they did before the merger. A joint board covering the entire Island of Montreal, in which the city of Montreal has the upper hand, retains many powers.\n\nDespite the demerger referendums held in 2004, controversy continues as some politicians note the cost of demerging.  Several studies show that the recreated municipalities will incur substantial financial costs, which will require them to increase taxes (an unanticipated result for the generally wealthier English-speaking municipalities that had voted for demerger). Proponents of the demergers contest the results of such studies.  They note that reports from other merged municipalities across the country that show that, contrary to their primary raison d'\u00eatre, the fiscal and societal costs of mega-municipalities far exceed any projected benefit.\n\n==Origin of the name==\n{{Main|Name of Montreal}}\nDuring the early 18th century, the name of the island came to be used as the name of the town. Two 1744 maps by Nicolas Bellin identified the island as Isle de Montr\u00e9al and the town as Ville-Marie; but a 1726 map refers to the town as \"la ville de Montr\u00e9al\". The name Ville-Marie soon fell into disuse.  Today it is used to refer to the Montreal borough that includes downtown.\n\nIn the modern [[Mohawk language]], Montreal is called ''Tiohti\u00e0:ke''. In Algonquin, it is called ''Moniang''.<ref>[http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/montreal_e.php Geonames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531042123/http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/montreal_e.php |date=2008-05-31 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Quebec]]\n* [[List of historic places in Montreal]]\n* [[List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Montreal]]\n* [[Timeline of Montreal history]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===In English ===\n* Atherton, William H.

(6963466635).jpg|thumb|right|275px|Depiction of the [[Bonsecours Market]] and [[Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel]] in [[Montreal]], 1853.]]\nThe '''history of Montreal''', located in the province of [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], spans about 800 years. At the time of European contact, the area was inhabited by the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]], a discrete and distinct group of [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[indigenous people]]. They spoke [[Laurentian language|Laurentian]]. [[Jacques Cartier]] became the first European to reach the area now known as [[Montreal]] in 1535 when he entered the village of ''[[Hochelaga (village)|Hochelaga]]'' on the [[Island of Montreal]] while in search of a passage to Asia during the [[Age of Exploration]].  Seventy years later, [[Samuel de Champlain]] unsuccessfully tried to create a fur [[trading post]] but the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] of the [[Iroquois]] defended what they had been using as their hunting grounds.\n\nA fortress named [[Fort Ville-Marie|Ville Marie]] was built in 1642 as part of a project to create a [[French colonial empire]].  Ville Marie became a centre for the [[fur trade]] and French expansion into [[New France]] until 1760, when it was surrendered to the British army, following the [[Montreal Campaign]].  British immigration expanded the city.  The city's golden era of fur trading began with the advent of the locally owned [[North West Company]].\n\nMontreal officially became a city in 1832.  The city's growth was spurred by the opening of the [[Lachine Canal]] and Montreal was the capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] from 1844 to 1849. Growth continued and by 1860 Montreal was the largest city in British North America and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of [[Canada]].  Annexation of neighbouring towns between 1883 and 1918 changed Montreal back to a mostly Francophone city.  The [[Great Depression in Canada]] brought unemployment to the city, but this waned in the mid-1930s, and skyscrapers began to be built.\n\nWorld War II brought protests against conscription and caused the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]].  Montreal's population surpassed one million in the early 1950s. A new [[Montreal Metro|metro]] system was added, Montreal's [[harbour]] was expanded, and the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] was opened during this time. More skyscrapers were built along with museums. Montreal's international status was cemented by [[Expo 67]] and the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. A major league baseball team, the [[Montreal Expos|Expos]], played in Montreal from 1969 to 2004 when the team relocated to [[Washington Nationals|Washington, DC]]. Historically, business and finance in Montreal were under the control of Anglophones. With the rise of Quebec nationalism in the 1970s, many institutions relocated their headquarters to Toronto.<ref>{{cite book|author=Erin Hurley|title=National Performance: Representing Quebec from Expo 67 to C\u00e9line Dion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bMVPsUeE3oC&pg=PA58|year=2011|publisher=U of Toronto Press|page=58}}</ref>\n\n==Pre-contact==\n[[File:Map of Hochelaga.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Hochelaga (village)|Hochelaga]] in 1535. Hochelaga was the first indigenous settlement in Montreal to make contact with Europeans.]]\nThe area known today as Montreal had been inhabited by [[indigenous peoples]] for some 8,000 years, while the oldest known artifact found in Montreal proper is about 4,000 years old.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9veloppement de Montr\u00e9al|title=Place Royale and the Amerindian presence|date=September 2001|url=http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape9/eng/9text3a.htm|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>  By about 1000 CE, [[nomadic]] [[Iroquoian]] and other peoples around the [[Great Lakes]] began to adopt the cultivation of maize and more settled lifestyles. Some settled along the fertile St. Lawrence River, where fishing and hunting in nearby forests supported a full diet.  By the 14th century, the people had built [[fortified]] villages similar to those described by Cartier on his later visit.<ref name=\"Tremblay\">{{cite book|first=Roland|last=Tremblay|year=2006|title=The Saint Lawrence Iroquoians. Corn People.|location=Montr\u00e9al, Qc|publisher=Les \u00c9ditions de l'Homme}}</ref>\n\nHistorians and [[anthropologists]] have had many theories about the people encountered by Cartier, as well as the reasons for their disappearance from the valley about 1580.  Since the 1950s, archaeological and [[linguistics|linguistic]] comparative studies have established many facts about the people.  They are now called the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]] and recognized by scholars as distinct from other Iroquoian-language people, such as the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] or [[Iroquois]] of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'', although sharing some cultural characteristics.  Their language has been called [[Laurentian language|Laurentian]], a distinct branch of the family.<ref name=\"Tremblay\"/>\n\n==Montreal during the French colonial period==\nThe first European to reach the area was [[Jacques Cartier]] on  October 2, 1535. Cartier visited the villages of ''Hochelaga'' (on [[Montreal Island]]) and ''Stadacona'' (near modern [[Quebec City]]), and noted others in the valley which he did not name. He recorded about 200 words of the people's language.\n[[File:Jacques Cartier a Hochelaga.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques Cartier]] at Hochelaga. Cartier was the first European to arrive in the area, arriving in 1535.]]\nSeventy years after Cartier, explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] traveled to Hochelaga, but the village no longer existed, nor was there sign of any human habitation in the valley. At times historians theorized that the people migrated west to the Great Lakes (or were pushed out by conflict with other tribes, including the Huron), or suffered infectious disease. Since the 1950s, other theories have been proposed. The Mohawk had most to gain by moving up from New York into the ''Tadoussac'' area, at the confluence of the [[Saguenay River|Saguenay]] and St. Lawrence rivers, which was controlled by local ''[[Innu|Montagnais]]''.\n\nChamplain decided to establish a [[fur]] [[trading post]] at Place Royal on the Island of Montreal, but the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], based mostly in present-day New York, successfully defended what had by then become their hunting grounds and paths for their war parties.  It was not until 1639 that the French created a permanent settlement on the Island of Montreal, started by tax collector [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me le Royer de la Dauversi\u00e8re]].  Under the authority of the Roman Catholic ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al]]'', [[missionary|missionaries]] [[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]], [[Jeanne Mance]] and a few French colonists set up a mission named Ville Marie on May 17, 1642 as part of a project to create a [[French colonial empire|colony]] dedicated to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. In 1644, [[Jeanne Mance]] founded the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Montr\u00e9al|H\u00f4tel-Dieu]], the first hospital in North America north of Mexico.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ6dtAMcgeAC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=%22first+hospital+in+north+america%22+-wikipedia&source=web&ots=nhiWaiA24f&sig=KmA5Aut061dfmMsdZRCpzdFPRgE Google books] accessed December 23, 2007</ref>\n[[File:Premiere eglise Ville-Marie.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the first church in [[Fort Ville-Marie]] in the 1640s. The settlement was established in 1642 under the authority of ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al]]''.]]\n[[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]] was governor of the colony and on January 4, 1648, he granted Pierre Gadois (who was in his fifties) the first concession of land - some {{convert|40|acre|m2}}. In 1650, Grou family, the lineage of historian [[Lionel Groulx]], arrived from [[Rouen]], France, and established a land holding known as [[Coul\u00e9e Grou]] which is today encompassed by the borough [[Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies\u2013Pointe-aux-Trembles]]. In November 1653, another 140 Frenchmen arrived to enlarge the settlement.\n\nBy 1651, Ville-Marie had been reduced to less than 50 inhabitants by repeated attacks by the Mohawk. Maisonneuve returned to France that year to recruit 100 men to bolster the failing colony.  He had already decided that should he fail to recruit these settlers, he would abandon Ville-Marie and move everyone back downriver to [[Quebec City]]. (Even 10 years after its founding, the people of Quebec City still thought of Montreal as \"une folle entreprise\" - a crazy undertaking.)<ref name=\"auger\">{{cite book|last=Auger|first=Roland J.|title=La Grande Recrue de 1653|url=https://archive.org/details/lagranderecruede0000auge|url-access=registration|work=Publications de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9logique Canadienne-Fran\u00e7aise - No 1|location=Montreal|year=1955}}</ref> These recruits arrived on 16 November 1653 and essentially guaranteed the evolution of Ville Marie and of all New France.<ref name=\"auger\"/>  In 1653 [[Marguerite Bourgeoys]] arrived to serve as a teacher.

In 1663, the [[Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice|Sulpician]] seminary became the new Seigneur of the island.\n[[File:Le Fort R\u00e9my en 1671.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Remy in 1671.

Along with Quebec and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Montreal was considered a district of the colony.<ref>Yves F. Zoltvany, The Government of New France: Royal, Clerical, or Class Rule?

Syndics were elected representatives who attended meetings of the council of Quebec and the Sovereign Council. However, the syndics had little authority and could only raise the concerns of their district's residents. This office existed from 1647 until it was eliminated in the 1670s due to government fears over the potential formation of political factions; in lieu of syndics, citizens brought their issues to the commissaire de la marine.<ref name=\"Zoltvany 5\">Zoltvany 5.</ref> Because of their importance to Montreal and New France, merchants were allowed to establish chambers of commerce called bourses and meet regularly to discuss their concerns.<ref name=\"Zoltvany 5\"/> A bourse would have collectively chosen a representative to address these issues with the governor and commissaire de la marine.<ref>Weir, 86.</ref>\n\n===Population of Montreal===\n{{One source|section|date=May 2017}}\nThe Population of the Island of the Montreal during French rule consisted of both native peoples and the French.

By 1716, the French population had grown to 4,409 people while the native population was 1,177.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 7</ref> The French Population of Montreal began slowly through immigration.

In 1666, 56 percent of the population were newcomers to Montreal; by 1681, 66% of Montreal was native-born.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 47</ref> There was a male to female sex ratio of 163:100 in 1666, by 1681 it was 133:100.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Although, the population of Montreal was still dominated by males, the female population grew. The rural proportion represented two-thirds in the first 40 years. However, by 1715-1730 the urban proportion was about 45 percent.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 62</ref> Data from 1681 to 1739 show that the point of equilibrium was reached around 1695, with males accounting for 51.6 percent of the population. This percent of the population was maintained until 1710, through immigration that was predominantly male.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The infant mortality rates in Montreal grew from 9.8% in 1676 to 18.0% to 1706-1715.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 60</ref> Illegitimacy rate for Montreal was 1.87 percent higher than the rest of colony due to the status of the Montreal as a garrison town; some unwed mothers from the countryside would abandon their children in the town.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 57</ref> Despite some differences in the pattern of population in comparison to the rest of the colony, Montreal's population developed at approximately the same rhythm as that of the whole colony.

Because of rapids west of Montreal, portages were required to travel further inland, making Montreal a key distribution point for trade.]]\nIn the 17th century, Montreal acted as a point of trans-shipment and a stopover on the passage to the interior.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 66</ref> Due to the rapids upriver from Montreal, free sailing through the Saint-Laurence ended in Montreal. Portages inland were then taken. This effectively made Montreal a major distribution centre rather than a mere trading post.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Pelts and merchandise were stocked for distribution inland and out. Montreal lacked moorings in the 17th century, forcing trans-Atlantic vessels with larger capacity to unload at Quebec. Goods from Quebec had to be transported by river between the two towns until the construction of a road in 1735.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Montreal remained subservient to Quebec due to its isolation. Trade between Montreal and France remained indirect.\n\nNot long after its establishment, Montreal provided for its own subsistence.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 78</ref> However, the colony was still dependent on France for a range of finished products, iron, and salt.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Montreal's principal import, before the end of the 17th century, was finished fabric. The seigneurs of Montreal who owned large flock organized the manufacture and sale of their wool to compensate for the imports. To the contrary, in the early 18th century, for peasants who kept their own sheep and grew flax, production was limited to their own needs. This led to few weavers and a left no more than 5% of textiles sold in Montreal to be manufactured locally. Louise Dechene states: \"There was no market-oriented production of fabrics and, understandably no import of raw materials.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/>\n\nGuns, shot, bullets, and powder represented 15% of imported cargo.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 80</ref> The presence of guns meant that colonies retained the services of blacksmiths, or arquebusiers, to repair guns, manufacture bullets, and perform other duties to relieve dependence on imports.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 81</ref> 4-5% of imports were kettles.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> The kettle at this time took the form of an \"easily transportable large copper cauldron\".<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Knives, scissors, and awls had to be imported. Local production of these items did not begin until approximately 1660. By 1720, all iron tools could be purchased exclusively from colonial blacksmiths.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Small stocks of glassware, porcelain, and china were imported as well.\n\nSoon after the founding of the Montreal, when the population numbered 8, the Company of One Hundred Associates gave the city's trading rights up to the colonial merchants.

The fur trade with the natives and the [[coureur des bois]] was a vital part of the settlement's early economy.]]\nThese natives would come to Montreal on occasion to participate in economic activity. One of these occasions happened every August, as Montreal welcomed hundreds of member of various nations to an annual fur fair which dwindled after 1680; as many as 500 to 1000 natives would attend to get better prices than the voyageurs would offer, and the governor would meet them for a ceremony. They would stay outside of town until late September.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 10</ref> There were also some natives who lived on the island and in the settlement of Montreal as permanent residents. There were a couple missions founded in Montreal for natives, such as the 1671 La Montagne Mission by the Sulpicians and the Jesuit at Sault-Saint-Louis (Kahnawake).<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 6</ref> The mission population rose in the 18th century through natural increase and some newcomers; between 1735 and 1752, Kahnawake contained about 1000 people, as did Lac-des-duex-Montagnes.  Montreal had some natives residing within the settlement, even if it was temporary, the Jesuits recorded 76 baptisms in 1643 of native children, and this continued to be recorded until 1653.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants,  5</ref> Despite the presence of natives in the settlement of Montreal there seems to be very little intermixing with only seven registered mixed marriages in Montreal, though the number of actually mixed marriages was probably slightly higher.<ref name=\"ReferenceH\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants,  9</ref> Native slaves were also a reality in Montreal, there were about 50 or so slaves recorded on the island of Montreal in 1716.<ref name=\"ReferenceH\"/>  Therefore, the presence of Natives was definitely necessary for trade, but the Natives were never really integrated into the city of Montreal itself.\n\nVery little information exists on how the colony of Montreal obtained foodstuffs before 1663.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants,  188</ref> The town of Montreal was too small to act as an important internal market. Though habitants came to Montreal to sell their goods (such as eggs, chickens, vegetables, and other goods), it was never a regional distribution centre for grain.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\">Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants,  192</ref> Furthermore, despite a surplus of unsold wheat at the colony, flour and lard were still regularly imported to feed French troops during the seventeenth century.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\"/> The ineffective use of the wheat surplus remained a contentious issue for the habitants in Montreal and the royalty in France.<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants, 192-193</ref>  An intendant explained that:\n\"The habitants do not grow hemp because they get nothing for it. Wool is plentiful, but there is no market. They have enough to ensure their subsistence, but since they are all in the same position, the cannot make any money, and this prevents them from meeting other needs and keeps them so poor in winter that we have been told that there are men and women who wander about practically naked.\"<ref>Dech\u00eane, Habitants and Merchants,  193</ref>\n \nIn the eighteenth century, Montreal was central to the illegal trade of furs.<ref>Jean Lunn, The Illegal Fur Trade Out of New France 1713-60 (McGill University: Montreal, 1939) 61</ref> The illegal fur trade can be defined as the \"export of furs to any destination other than France\".<ref>Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 66</ref> French merchants carried furs were carried down the Richelieu River to English, Dutch, and the converted Jesuit Iroquois at Albany. The contraband was buried outside the walls of Montreal at the request of merchants in order to avoid more loyal French eyes.<ref>Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 61</ref> Furs were traded illegally between Quebec and Albany, however these instances were less extensive than the illegal trade between Quebec and France or Boston.<ref>Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 64</ref> Some estimates place the furs being illegally traded from Montreal to roughly half or two-thirds of total fur-production at the beginning of the 1700s.<ref name=\"Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 65\">Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 65</ref> Later in the century, records appear to be silent. The presence of English supplies amongst the Iroquois during the period, among other reasons, is given as proof of a continued existence of the illegal fur trade between colonies.<ref name=\"Lunn, Illegal Fur Trade, 65\"/>\n\n===The design of Montreal===\nThe organization and building of towns in New France attempted to continue the history of France and had similar designs to the homes and buildings of France. Originally with the lack of stone and the plentiful number of lumber cites like Montreal were almost completely made with wooden buildings designed in the French style.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\">Morisset, Lucie K., and Luc Noppen. \"Architectural History: The French Colonial R\u00e9gime.\" The Canadian Encyclopedia. Historica-Dominion Institute, 2012.  Feb. 2013.</ref> These buildings completely relied on the use of classic French building techniques and many of the craftsmen refused to use anything other than sawn and squared lumber. This caused the natives such as the Iroquoians to view the building methods of the colonists as odd as almost all of their building was done with unfinished materials such as branches, bark and tree trunks.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\"/> The buildings in the city of Montreal remained wooden until the year 1664 when Louis XIV declared the colony an officially recognized province.\n[[File:130, rue Notre-Dame Ouest.jpg|thumb|[[Saint-Sulpice Seminary (Montreal)|Saint-Sulpice Seminary]] in 1839. Completed in 1687, the seminary is the oldest standing building in Montreal.]]\nThis declaration led to the introduction of \u2018king\u2019s engineers\u2019 to New France and to Montreal. This led to actual city layout planning and a shift to stone buildings as well.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\"/> The government of Montreal helped plan the layout of the city; several aspects of the design of the city in the French colonial period are still present. The Sulpicians, who became the seigneurs of Montreal in 1663, perhaps played the largest role in the early formation of the city.<ref>\"The Old Seminary and Notre-Dame Basilica,\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape17/eng/17fena.htm.</ref>  The Sulpicians helped design Montreal's chequerboard city plan decided upon in 1671 and with the help of the king's engineers the establishment of stone buildings also began.<ref name=\"Robert, Jean-Claude 1994\">Robert, Jean-Claude. Atlas Historique De Montr\u00e9al. Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec: Art Global, 1994.</ref> For example, Father Superior of the Sulpicians Dollier de Casson and surveyor B\u00e9nigne Basset originally planned Rue Notre Dame to be the main street of Montreal in 1672.<ref>\"Central Rue Notre-Dame West,\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape18/eng/18fena.htm.</ref> The designers themselves were all similar to the Father Superior not architects by profession and so the engineers worked closely with the religious order to design and build Montreal. Casson for example also designed the Old Sulpician Seminary, the oldest standing building in Montreal and home to the oldest gardens in North America, in 1684.<ref>\"The Old Seminary and Notre-Dame Basilica.\"</ref> \n \nThe lack of architects led to the lack of classical metropolitan form common in France and so many buildings had more basic designs.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\"/>  The workers did improve however and as stonemasons became more skilled and stone more available stone buildings became more common.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\"/> Stonemasons became the men in charge when in came to building as their resource was of the highest demand and what ever could be done without stone was, this had some unfortunate side effects though as fires in Montreal became common. When more stone was used, the issue arose of cracking as the cold and heat expansion stressed the stone this led to the discovery of a basic plan, which worked for the environment and uniformity in buildings. The roofs in Montreal were designed to be of a sharp pitch and they were topped not with slate, which common in France, but were uncommon in Montreal, and they used cedar shingles and the cheaper method of Canadian-style sheet metal roofing.<ref name=\"Morisset, Lucie K. 2012\"/> The Ch\u00e2teau Ramezay, which was built in 1705 as the residence for then-Governor Claude de Ramezay was built with these building styles.<ref>\"Rue Notre-Dame East,\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape2/eng/2text5a.htm.</ref>\n\nCanadian-specific architecture in Montreal began to evolve and form after the fire ordinances in 1721, as wood was removed as much as possible from dwellings and left buildings almost completely stone.<ref name=\"Robert, Jean-Claude 1994\"/> This also eliminated the common wooden fashionable extras and designs common in France. This caused only churches truly to have any form of decoration on them and caused many of the colonial buildings to be plain. This lack of artistic expression to demonstrate wealth caused many of the wealthy simply to build larger buildings to demonstrate their greatness. This caused a large boom in the demand for stone and an increase in the size of Montreal.<ref>Morisset, Lucie K., and Luc Noppen. \"Architectural History: The French Colonial R\u00e9gime.\" The Canadian Encyclopedia.

Fort Ville-Marie was the first European fortified settlement established the area.]]\nIn 1645, a fort was established on the island of Montreal and this was the beginning of Montreal's military history. The fort was key and effective in repelling the raids of the Iroquois and would become a station for soldiers for years to come.<ref>Atherton, William H. Montreal, 1535-1914. (Montreal: S.J. Clarke,, 1914), 92</ref> After the arrival of Maisonneuve in the Second Foundation in 1653, Montreal became a front for activity throughout New France and a key launching point for expeditions into the frontier.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 111</ref> Montreal did not become reinforced however until after the establishment of New France as a province and the welcoming of the \u2018king\u2019s engineers\u2019 who came with the military reinforcements. Many of the expeditions who went out to explore Ontario and the Ohio River Valley would start in Montreal, but much of the time in the beginning they would not make it far or they would be forced to return by hostile native forces.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 124</ref>\n  \nDuring the early 1700s, many military expeditions left from Montreal to finally deal with the Hostile natives and to strengthen alliances with the Native allies. This led to one of the most significant events to occur in Montreal during this period was the Great Peace of 1701. The conference took place in August and was between the French and representatives of thirty-nine different Aboriginal nations. For the conference an estimated 2000-3000 people (including roughly 1300 native delegates) entered a theatre south of Pointe-\u00e0-Calli\u00e8re to listen to speeches given by French leaders and native chiefs.<ref>Gilles Havard, Montreal, 1701: Planting the Tree of Peace (Montreal: Recherches Am\u00e9rindiennes au Qu\u00e9bec, 2001), 42-43.</ref> The French engaged in many Aboriginal gestures of peace, including the burying of hatchets, the exchange of wampum belts, and the use of peace pipes.<ref>Havard,  44.</ref> While the French signed their names using their alphabet, the Aboriginal leaders notably used totem symbols to sign the treaty.<ref>Havard,  47</ref> \n[[File:Fortifications Montreal.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the fortified walls of Montreal in 1752. Walls surrounding the city were erected in 1737 in order to protect it.]]\nThe Great Peace resulted in an end to the Iroquois Wars and, according to historian Gilles Havard, \"ostensibly (brought) peace to the vast territory extending from Acadia in the East to the Mississippi in the west, and from James Bay in the north to Missouri in the south\".<ref>Havard,  11</ref>  The French had hoped to form a military frontier with their Native allies along the borders on New France against the advancing British colonies. The military thus established many forts along the \u2018borders\u2019 down the Ohio Valley into New Orleans.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 315</ref> Many of these such as Detroit relied on Montreal to reinforce them with supplies and military men furthering Montreal's military involvement and development.\n[[File:Capitulation Montreal.jpg|thumb|French authorities surrender the city of Montreal to the British in 1760.]]\nDue to the importance of Montreal to New France, a double wall 6.4 metres tall and over three kilometres long was erected in 1737 (after twenty years of construction) to protect the city. Only some of the base of the wall remains today.<ref>\"Champ-de-Mars,\" Old Montreal, last modified September 2001, http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/tour/etape1/eng/1text2a.htm.</ref> This helped make Montreal the most militarily capable town in New France, and so when the seven years war started Montreal was declared the military headquarters for operations in the North American Theater.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 391</ref> As the military headquarters, the number of military men in Montreal began to increase and the town itself was further expanded and stressed Montreal for supplies.\n\nIn 1757 the number of soldiers and natives stationed in Montreal had gotten so great that Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil the Governor of New France realized they needed to take action on a campaign or the army and the town would begin to suffer from starvation. This led to the great campaign of 1757 and with his large force of native allies and the bronzed soldiery of France General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm moved the large force out of Montreal and left a garrison in its place, relieving the pressure on the city to supply the military slightly.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 404</ref> Montcalm was very successful in his military efforts keeping spirits in Montreal high and the people hopeful. After his victory at Carillon, Montcalm returned to Montreal; having just defeated 16,000 British forces Montcalm seemed to be in a good position.<ref>Atherton, Montreal,419</ref> This would prove false, because of Montcalm's lack of troops in comparison to the British. Learning of an invasion coming over the Saint Laurence, Montcalm took his forces to reinforce Quebec City.<ref>Atherton, Montreal, 428</ref> Montcalm would die there and Quebec City would be lost, which caused a major shock in Montreal as it now seemed they were doomed and though the city was also briefly established as the capital, but with three British armies headed for it, the town would not last long. In September 1760, the French forces finally capitulated to the British and the French colonial rule ended in Montreal.\n\n==British rule and the American Revolution==\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Conquest of Canada}}\n[[File:EthanAllenBeforePrescott1775.jpeg|thumb|[[Ethan Allen]] marched through the streets of Montreal after [[Battle of Longue-Pointe|his attempt]] to take the city in 1775.

After the War, President of the Confederacy [[Jefferson Davis]] stayed at a manor house located at the current site of The Bay on Sainte-Catherine's Street West; a plaque commemorating the site was installed on the West wall of the building, on Union Avenue, in 1957 by the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]]. The plaque was removed in 2017.\n\n===Industrialization===\n[[File:Le canal Lachine.jpg|thumb|View of [[Lachine Canal]] in 1852. Bypassing the rapids west of the city, the canal linked Montreal with other continental markets, spurring its industrialization.]]\nThe Lachine Canal and major new businesses linked the established port of Montreal with continental markets and led to rapid [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]] during the mid-19th century. The economic boom attracted [[French Canadian]] labourers from the surrounding countryside to factories in satellite cities such as [[Saint-Henri, Montreal|Saint-Henri]] and [[Hochelaga-Maisonneuve|Maisonneuve]]. [[Irish Canadians|Irish]] immigrants settled in tough working-class neighbourhoods such as [[Pointe-Saint-Charles]] and [[Griffintown]], making English and French linguistic groups roughly equal in size. The growing city also attracted immigrants from Italy, and Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Powell|title=Encyclopedia of North American Immigration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VNCX6UsdZYkC&pg=PA194|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=194\u201395}}</ref>\n\nIn 1852, Montreal had 58,000 inhabitants and by 1860, Montreal was the largest city in British North America, and it was the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada. From 1861 to the [[Great Depression]] of 1930, Montreal developed in what some historians call its Golden Age. [[Saint Jacques Street]] became the most important economic centre of the Dominion of Canada. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] made its headquarters there in 1880, and the [[Canadian National Railway]] in 1919. At the time of its construction in 1928, the new head office of the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] at 360 St. James Street was the tallest building in the [[British Empire]]. With the annexation of neighbouring towns between 1883 and 1918, Montreal became a mostly Francophone city again. The tradition of alternating between a francophone and an anglophone mayor began, lasting until 1914.\n\nMontreal shared control of the Canadian securities market with Toronto from the 1850s to the 1970s causing a persistent rivalry between the two. The financiers were Anglophones. However both cities were overshadowed by London and later New York, for they had easy access to these much larger financial centres.<ref>Ranald C.

[[French-Canadian]] opposition towards [[conscription]] in the latter years of [[World War I]] led to the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]].]]\nMontrealers volunteered to serve in the [[Canadian Forces|army]] in the early days of World War I, but most French Montrealers opposed mandatory [[conscription]] and enlistment fell off. After the war, the [[Prohibition]] movement in the United States turned Montreal into a destination for Americans looking for alcohol.  Americans went to Montreal for its drinking, gambling, and prostitution, unrivalled in North America at this time, which earned the city the nickname \"Sin City\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/north-america/canada/montreal?v=print|title=Lonely Planet Montreal Guide - Modern History|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]}}</ref>\n\nMontreal had a population of 618,000 in 1921, growing to 903,000 in 1941.\n\nThe twenties saw many changes in the city and the introduction of new technologies continued to have a prominent impact. The introduction of the car in large numbers began to transform the nature of the city. The world's first commercial radio station, XWA began broadcasting in 1920. A huge mooring mast for dirigibles was constructed in St. Hubert in anticipation of trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service, but only one craft, the R-100, visited in 1930 and the service never developed. However, Montreal became the eastern hub of the Trans-Canada Airway in 1939.\n\nFilm production became a part of the city activity. Associated Screen News of Canada in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, \"Kinograms\" in the twenties and \"Canadian Cameo\" from 1932 to 1953. The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the [[National Film Board of Canada]], in Montreal, in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit including the very popular, \"The World in Action\" and \"Canada Carries On\", series of monthly propaganda films. Other developments in the cultural field included the founding of [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] in 1919 and the [[Montreal Symphony Orchestra]] in 1934. The [[Montreal Forum]], built in 1924 became the home ice rink of the fabled Montreal Canadiens hockey team.\n\nDr. [[Wilder Penfield]], with a grant from the US [[Rockefeller Foundation]] founded the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] at the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]] (Montreal), in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases. Research into the design of nuclear weapons was conducted at the Montreal Laboratory of the [[National Research Council of Canada]] during World War II.\n\n===Great Depression===\n[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A Montreal [[soup kitchen]] in 1931. Like the rest of Canada, unemployment in Montreal was high during the [[Great Depression]].]]\nUnemployment was high during the [[Great Depression in Canada]] in the 1930s.  Canada began to recover from the Great Depression in the mid-1930s, and real estate developers began to build skyscrapers, changing Montreal's skyline. The [[Sun Life Building]], built in 1931, was for a time the tallest building in the British Commonwealth.  During World War II its vaults were used as the hiding place for the [[gold bullion]] of the [[Bank of England]] and the [[British Crown Jewels]].\n\nWith so many men unemployed women had to scrimp on spending to meet the reduced family budget. About a fourth of the workforce were women, but most women were housewives. Denyse Baillargeon uses oral histories to discover how Montreal housewives handled shortages of money and resources during the depression years. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat\u2014sometimes even horse meat and recycled the [[Sunday roast]] into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and kept the house colder. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies, Baillargeon finds, show that women's domestic labor\u2014cooking, cleaning, budgeting, shopping, childcare\u2014was essential to the economic maintenance of the family and offered room for economies. Most of her informants also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer.  Extended families used mutual aid\u2014extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans\u2014to help cousins and in-laws.<ref>Denyse Baillargeon, ''Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression'' (Wilfrid Laurier U. Press, 1999) pp 70, 108, 136\u201338, 159.</ref> Half of the Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births\u2014the number of births nationwide fell from 250,000 in 1930 to about 228,000 and did not recover until 1940.<ref>{{cite book|author=M.

Mayor [[Camillien Houde]] protested against conscription. He urged Montrealers to ignore the [[Government of Canada|federal government]]'s registry of all men and women because he believed it would lead to conscription.  The federal government at [[Ottawa]], considering Houde's actions treasonable, incarcerated him in a prison camp in Petawawa, Ontario, for over four years, from 1940 until 1944. That year the government instituted conscription in order to expand the armed forces to confront the Axis Powers. (see [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]]).\n\n==The Quiet Revolution and the modernization of Montreal==\n[[File:Stephane Prefontaine, Sandra Henderson 1976.jpg|thumb|Lighting of the [[Olympic Torch]] inside Montreal's [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]]. The city hosted the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].]]\n{{further|Quiet Revolution}}\nBy the beginning of the 1960s, a new political movement was rising in Quebec. The newly elected Liberal government of Jean Lesage made reforms that helped francophone Quebecers gain more influence in politics and in the economy, thus changing the city.  More francophones began to own businesses as Montreal became the centre of French culture in North America.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1964, four of Montreal's ten tallest buildings were completed: [[Tour de la Bourse]], [[Place Ville-Marie]], the [[CIBC Building]] and [[CIL House]]. Montreal gained an increased international status due to the World's Fair of 1967, known as [[Expo 67]], for which innovative construction such as Habitat was completed. During the 1960s, mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] carried upgraded infrastructure throughout the city, such as the construction of the [[Montreal Metro]], while the provincial government built much of what is today's highway system.  Like many other North American cities during these years, Montreal had developed so rapidly that its infrastructure was lagging behind its needs.\n\nIn 1969, a police strike resulted in 16 hours of unrest, known as the [[Murray-Hill riot|Murray Hill riot]].<ref name=\"CBC Digital\">http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/civil-unrest/general-27/montreals-night-of-terror.html</ref> Police were motivated to strike because of difficult working conditions caused by disarming [[FLQ|separatist-planted bombs]] and patrolling frequent protests and wanting higher pay.<ref name=\"CBC Digital\"/> The [[National Assembly of Quebec]] passed an emergency law forcing the police back to work. By the time order was restored, 108 people had been arrested.<ref name=\"CBC Digital\"/>\n\nThe [[1976 Summer Olympics]], officially known as the \"Games of the XXI Olympiad\", held in Montreal, was the first Olympics in Canada.  The Games helped introduce Quebec and Canada to the rest of the world.  The entire province of Quebec prepared for the games and associated activities, generating a resurgence of interest in amateur athletics across the province. The spirit of Qu\u00e9bec nationalism helped motivate the organizers; however, the city went $1 billion into debt.<ref>Patrick Allen, \"Les Jeux Olympiques: Icebergs ou Rampes de Lancements?,\" [The Olympic Games: Icebergs or launching pads?] ''Action Nationale'' (1976) 65#5 pp 271-323</ref><ref>Paul Charles Howell, ''The Montreal Olympics: An Insider's View of Organizing a Self-financing Games'' (Montr\u00e9al: McGill-Queens University Press, 2009)</ref>\n\n==Quebec Independence Movement ==\n{{further|Quebec sovereignty movement|History of the Quebec sovereignty movement}}\nAt the end of the 1960s, the independence movement in Quebec was in full swing due to a constitutional debate between the Ottawa and Quebec governments.  Radical groups formed, most notably the [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec]] (FLQ). In October 1970, members of the FLQ's \"[[Liberation Cell]]\" kidnapped and murdered [[Pierre Laporte]], a minister in the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]], and also kidnapped [[James Cross]], a British diplomat, who was later released. The [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Pierre Trudeau]], ordered the military occupation of Montreal and invoked the [[War Measures Act]], giving unprecedented peacetime powers to police. The social unrest and related events became known as the [[October Crisis]] of 1970.\n\nSovereignty was addressed through the ballot box.  The [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] held two referendums on the question, in 1980 and in 1995. During those decades, about 300,000 English-speaking Quebecers left Quebec.  The uncertain political climate caused substantial social and economic impacts, as a significant number of Montrealers, mostly Anglophone, took their businesses and migrated to other provinces.  The extent of the transition was greater than the norm for major urban centres. With the passage of [[Charter of the French Language|Bill 101]] in 1977, the government gave primacy to French as the only official language for all levels of government in Quebec, the main language of business and culture, and the exclusive language for public signage and business communication. In the rest of Canada, the government adopted a bilingual policy, producing all government materials in both French and English.  The success of the separatist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois caused uncertainty over Quebec's economic future, leading to an exodus of corporate headquarters to Toronto and Calgary.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mark J.

By the late 1990s, however, Montreal's economic climate had improved, as new firms and institutions began to fill the traditional business and financial niches.<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Brooke |title=Montreal Journal; No Longer Fading, City Booms Back Into Its Own |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E3D91438F935A35756C0A9669C8B63 |work=New York Times |date=2000-05-06 |accessdate=2008-04-12 }}</ref>\n\nAs the city celebrated its 350th anniversary in 1992, construction began on two new skyscrapers: [[1000 de La Gaucheti\u00e8re]] and [[1250 Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque]]. Montreal's improving economic conditions allowed further enhancements of the city [[infrastructure]], with the expansion of the metro system, construction of new skyscrapers, and the development of new highways, including the start of a [[Beltway|ring road]] around the island. The city attracted several international organisations that moved their secretariats into Montreal's Quartier International: [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA), [[International Council of Societies of Industrial Design]] (Icsid), [[International Council of Graphic Design Associations]] (Icograda), [http://www.ibcr.org International Bureau for Children's Rights] (IBCR), [http://www.crime-prevention-intl.org International Centre for the Prevention of Crime] (ICPC) and the [[UNESCO]] Institute for Statistics (UIS). With developments such as Centre de Commerce Mondial (World Trade Centre), Quartier International, Square Cartier, and proposed revitalization of the harbourfront, Montreal is regaining its international position as a world-class city.\n\n==Merger and demerger==\n{{Main|Montreal Merger|Municipal reorganization in Quebec}}\n[[File:Montreal2001.png|thumb|The municipalities of the [[Island of Montreal]] prior to the [[2002\u201306 municipal reorganization of Montreal|2002 merger]] of all municipalities on the island.]]\nThe concept of having one municipal government for the island of Montreal was first proposed by [[Jean Drapeau]] in the 1960s. The idea was strongly opposed in many suburbs, although [[Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies]], [[Ahuntsic-Cartierville#Ville de Saraguay|Saraguay]] ([[Saraguay]]) and [[Saint-Michel-de-Laval|Ville Saint Michel]], now the [[Saint-Michel, Montreal|Saint-Michel]] neighbourhood) were annexed to Montreal between 1963 and 1968. [[Pointe-aux-Trembles]] was annexed in 1982.\n\nIn 2001, the provincial government announced a plan to merge major cities with their suburbs. As of January 1, 2002, the entire [[Island of Montreal]], home to 1.8 million people, as well as the several outlying islands that were also part of the Montreal Urban Community, [[Municipal reorganization in Quebec|were merged]] into a new \"megacity\". Some 27 suburbs as well as the former city were folded into several [[Arrondissement#Montreal|boroughs]], named after their former cities or (in the case of parts of the former Montreal) districts.\n\nDuring the [[2003 Quebec general election|2003 provincial elections]], the winning [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] had promised to submit the mergers to referendums. On June 20, 2004, a number of the former cities voted to demerge from Montreal and regain their municipal status, although not with all the powers they once had. The following voted to demerge: [[Baie-d'Urf\u00e9, Quebec|Baie-d'Urf\u00e9]], [[Beaconsfield, Quebec|Beaconsfield]], [[C\u00f4te Saint-Luc]], [[Dollard-des-Ormeaux]], [[Dorval]], the uninhabited [[L'\u00cele-Dorval, Quebec|L'\u00cele-Dorval]], [[Hampstead, Quebec|Hampstead]], [[Kirkland, Quebec|Kirkland]], [[Montr\u00e9al-Est, Quebec|Montr\u00e9al-Est]], [[Montreal West, Quebec|Montreal West]], [[Mount Royal, Quebec|Mount Royal]], [[Pointe-Claire]], [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue]], [[Senneville, Quebec|Senneville]], and [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]]. The demergers were effective on January 1, 2006.\n\n[[Anjou, Quebec|Anjou]], [[LaSalle, Quebec|LaSalle]], [[\u00cele Bizard|L'\u00cele-Bizard]], [[Pierrefonds, Quebec|Pierrefonds]], [[Roxboro, Quebec|Roxboro]], [[Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, Quebec|Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]], and [[Saint-Laurent, Quebec|Saint-Laurent]] had majority votes in favour of demerger, but their turnout of voters was insufficient to meet the requirements for the decision, so those former municipalities remained part of Montreal. No referendum was held in [[Lachine, Quebec|Lachine]], [[Montr\u00e9al-Nord]], [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont]], [[St. Leonard, Quebec|Saint Leonard]], or [[Verdun, Quebec|Verdun]] - nor in any of the boroughs that were part of the former city of Montreal.\n[[File:Montreal2006.png|thumb|left|The Island of Montreal and its municipalities after several communities were reestablished as independent communities in 2006.]]\nThe Island of Montreal now has 16 municipalities (the city of Montreal proper plus 15 independent municipalities). The post-demerger city of Montreal (divided into 19 boroughs) has a territory of {{convert|366.02|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and a population of 1,583,590 inhabitants (based on 2001 census figures). Compared with the pre-merger city of Montreal, this is a net increase of 96.8% in land area, and 52.3% in population.\n\nThe city of Montreal has nearly as many inhabitants as the former unified city of Montreal (the recreated suburban municipalities are less densely populated than the core city), but population growth is expected to be slower for some time. Analysts note that the overwhelming majority of industrial sites are located in the territory of the post-demerger city of Montreal. The current city of Montreal is about half the size of the post-1998 merger city of Toronto (both in terms of land area and population).\n\nThe 15 recreated suburban municipalities have fewer government powers than they did before the merger. A joint board covering the entire Island of Montreal, in which the city of Montreal has the upper hand, retains many powers.\n\nDespite the demerger referendums held in 2004, controversy continues as some politicians note the cost of demerging.  Several studies show that the recreated municipalities will incur substantial financial costs, which will require them to increase taxes (an unanticipated result for the generally wealthier English-speaking municipalities that had voted for demerger). Proponents of the demergers contest the results of such studies.  They note that reports from other merged municipalities across the country that show that, contrary to their primary raison d'\u00eatre, the fiscal and societal costs of mega-municipalities far exceed any projected benefit.\n\n==Origin of the name==\n{{Main|Name of Montreal}}\nDuring the early 18th century, the name of the island came to be used as the name of the town. Two 1744 maps by Nicolas Bellin identified the island as Isle de Montr\u00e9al and the town as Ville-Marie; but a 1726 map refers to the town as \"la ville de Montr\u00e9al\". The name Ville-Marie soon fell into disuse.  Today it is used to refer to the Montreal borough that includes downtown.\n\nIn the modern [[Mohawk language]], Montreal is called ''Tiohti\u00e0:ke''. In Algonquin, it is called ''Moniang''.<ref>[http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/montreal_e.php Geonames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531042123/http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/montreal_e.php |date=2008-05-31 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Quebec]]\n* [[List of historic places in Montreal]]\n* [[List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Montreal]]\n* [[Timeline of Montreal history]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===In English ===\n* Atherton, William H.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s  surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>. The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>. However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>. \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref>. Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election. That September, the party joined with the other members of the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] in the successful Yes-Yes campaign in the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]] which lead to the establishment of a [[Scottish Parliament]] with tax-varying powers.\n\nBy 1999, the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first elections]] to the parliament were being held, although the party suffered a disappointing result, gaining just 35 MSPs in the face of Salmond's unpopular '[[Kosovo]] Broadcast' which opposed [[NATO intervention in Kosovo|NATO intervention]] in the country<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/politics-anti-bombing-salmond-hits-an-all-time-low-with-voters-1086961.html|title=Politics: Anti-bombing Salmond hits an all-time low with voters|date=1999-04-13|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\n=== Opposing Labour-Liberal Democrat Coalitions (1999-2007) ===\nThis meant that the party began as the official opposition in the parliament to a [[Dewar government|Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition government]].

The EFA co-operates with the larger [[European Green Party]] to form [[The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA) group in the [[European Parliament]].\n\nPrior to its affiliation with The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance, the SNP had previously been allied with the [[European Progressive Democrats]] (1979\u20131984), [[Rainbow Group (1989\u20131994)|Rainbow Group]] (1989\u20131994) and [[European Radical Alliance]] (1994\u20131999).\n\nAs the UK is no longer a member of the EU, the SNP has no MEPs.\n\n==Party ideology==\n\n===Historical ideology===\nThe Scottish National Party did not have a clear ideological position until the 1970s, when it sought to explicitly present itself as a social democratic party in terms of party policy and publicity.<ref name=\"Lynch\">{{cite book|author=Peter Lynch|title=SNP: The History of the Scottish National Party|year=2002|publisher= Welsh Academic Press|page= }}</ref><ref name=\"Brand1978\">{{cite book|title=The National Movement in Scotland|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|year=1978|pages=216\u201317|author=Jack Brand}}</ref> During the period from its foundation until the 1960s, the SNP was essentially a moderate [[centrism|centrist]] party.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> Debate within the party focused more on the SNP being distinct as an all-Scotland national movement, with it being neither of the [[Left-wing politics|left]] nor the [[Right-wing politics|right]], but constituting a new politics that sought to put Scotland first.<ref name=\"Brand1978\"/><ref name=\"Brand199028\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=28|author=Jack Brand}}</ref>\n\nThe SNP was formed through the merger of the centre-left [[National Party of Scotland|National Party of Scotland (NPS)]] and the centre-right [[Scottish Party]].<ref name=\"Brand1978\"/> The SNP's founders were united over [[self-determination]] in principle, though not its exact nature, or the best strategic means to achieve self-government. From the mid-1940s onwards, SNP policy was [[Political radicalism|radical]] and [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistributionist]] in relation to land and in favour of \u2018the diffusion of economic power\u2019, including the [[decentralisation]] of industries such as coal to include the involvement of local authorities and regional planning bodies to control industrial structure and development.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> Party policies supported the economic and social policy status quo of the post-war [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]].<ref name=\"Lynch\"/><ref name=\"Hassan2009120\">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=120}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s, the SNP was starting to become defined ideologically, with a social democratic tradition emerging as the party grew in urban, industrial Scotland, and its membership experienced an influx of social democrats from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[trade union]]s and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].<ref name=\"Brand199032\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=32|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name=\"Mitchell1996208\">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=208}}</ref> The emergence of [[William Wolfe|Billy Wolfe]] as a leading figure in the SNP also contributed to the leftwards shift. By this period, the Labour Party were also the dominant party in Scotland, in terms of electoral support and representation. Targeting Labour through emphasising left-of-centre policies and values was therefore electorally logical for the SNP, as well as tying in with the ideological preferences of many new party members.<ref name=\"Mitchell1996208\"/> In 1961, the SNP conference expressed the party's opposition to the siting of the [[United States|US]] [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine base at the [[Holy Loch]].

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n===Current ideology===\nThe SNP's policy base is mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition.

It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability of [[Scotland]] to govern herself, thus bringing increased support for independence.\n\nGradualism stands in opposition to the so-called fundamentalist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely in order to achieve it. The argument goes that if the SNP is unprepared to argue for its central policy then it is unlikely ever to persuade the public of its worthiness.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/06/uk.politicalnews1|title=SNP's radical wing threatens to split party|last=Seenan|first=By Gerard|date=1999-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-02|last2=MacAskill|first2=Ewen|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Notable fundamentalists ===\n* [[Kenny MacAskill]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Margo MacDonald]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Notable gradualists ===\n* [[Alex Salmond]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[John Swinney]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/snp/865888.stm|title=Tussle for the top |website= BBC News |date=21 September 2000 |access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics|United Kingdom|Scotland}}\n* [[Culture of Scotland]]\n* [[Politics of Scotland]]\n* [[History of Scottish devolution]]\n* [[It's Scotland's oil]]\n* [[Radio Free Scotland]]\n* [[Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\n* [[The National (Scotland)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brand, Jack, ''The National Movement in Scotland'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978\n* Brand, Jack, \u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), ''Contemporary Minority Nationalism'', Routledge, 1990\n* [[Winnie Ewing]], [[Michael Russell (politician)|Michael Russell]], ''Stop the World; The Autobiography of Winnie Ewing'' [[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]], 2004\n* [[Richard J.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s  surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>. The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>. However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>. \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref>. Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election. That September, the party joined with the other members of the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] in the successful Yes-Yes campaign in the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]] which lead to the establishment of a [[Scottish Parliament]] with tax-varying powers.\n\nBy 1999, the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first elections]] to the parliament were being held, although the party suffered a disappointing result, gaining just 35 MSPs in the face of Salmond's unpopular '[[Kosovo]] Broadcast' which opposed [[NATO intervention in Kosovo|NATO intervention]] in the country<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/politics-anti-bombing-salmond-hits-an-all-time-low-with-voters-1086961.html|title=Politics: Anti-bombing Salmond hits an all-time low with voters|date=1999-04-13|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\n=== Opposing Labour-Liberal Democrat Coalitions (1999-2007) ===\nThis meant that the party began as the official opposition in the parliament to a [[Dewar government|Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition government]].

[[Stephen Gethins]], MP for [[North East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Fife]], came out of this election with a majority of just 2 to the Liberal Democrat candidate. High-profile losses included SNP Commons leader [[Angus Robertson]] in [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray]] and former party leader and First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] in [[Gordon (UK Parliament constituency)|Gordon]].\n\nThe SNP went on to achieve its best ever [[European Parliament]] result [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|in the final election]] before [[Brexit]], the party taking its [[Member of European Parliament|MEP]] total to 3 or half of [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|Scottish seats]]. Later that year the SNP experienced a surge in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2019|2019 general election]], winning 45.0% of the vote and 47 seats, its second best result ever. Although the party suffered a loss to the Liberal Democrats, it gained the seat of its then UK leader [[Jo Swinson]], along with 7 from the Conservatives and 6 from Labour. This victory was generally attributed to Sturgeon's cautious approach regarding holding a second independence referendum and strong emphasis on EU membership during the election<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50766014|title=SNP wins election landslide in Scotland|date=2019-12-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref>. \n\n==Constitution and structure==\nThe local Branches are the primary level of organisation in the SNP. All of the Branches within each Scottish Parliament constituency form a Constituency Association, which coordinates the work of the Branches within the constituency, coordinates the activities of the party in the constituency, and acts as a point of liaison between an MSP or MP and the party. Constituency Associations are composed of delegates from all of the Branches within the constituency.\n\nThe annual National Conference is the supreme governing body of the SNP, and is responsible for determining party policy and electing the National Executive Committee. The National Conference is composed of:\n* delegates from every Branch and Constituency Association\n* the members of the National Executive Committee\n* 15 members elected by the National Conference\n* every SNP MSP, MP and MEP\n* a number of SNP local councillors, and\n* delegates from one of the SNP's Affiliated Organisations ([[Young Scots for Independence]], [[SNP Students]], [[SNP Trade Union Group]] and the Association of Nationalist Councillors)\n\nThe National Council serves as the SNP's governing body between National Conferences, and its decisions are binding, unless rescinded or modified by the National Conference. There are also regular meetings of the National Assembly, which provides a forum for detailed discussion of party policy by party members.\n\nThe party has an active youth wing, the [[Young Scots for Independence]], as well as a student wing, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference). The SNP parliamentarians (Holyrood and Westminster) and councillors have representation on the NEC, as do the Trade Union Group, the youth wing and the student wing.\n\n===National Executive Committee===\nThe National Executive Committee is composed of:\n* President: [[Ian Hudghton]]\n* Leader: [[Nicola Sturgeon]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] <small>([[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]])</small>\n* Depute Leader: [[Keith Brown (Scottish politician)|Keith Brown]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] <small>([[Clackmannanshire and Dunblane (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Clackmannanshire and Dunblane]])</small>\n* National Treasurer: [[Colin Beattie]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] <small>([[Midlothian North and Musselburgh (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Midlothian North and Musselburgh]])</small>\n* National Secretary: Dr Angus MacLeod\n* Business Convener: [[Kirsten Oswald]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] <small>([[East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Renfrewshire]])</small>\n* Organisation Convener: Stacy Bradley\n* Member Support Convener: John Clark \n* Policy Development Convener: [[Alyn Smith]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] <small>([[Stirling (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirling]])</small>\n* Local Government Convener: Councillor Ellen Forson <small>([[Clackmannanshire South]])</small>\n* Women's Convener: Councillor Rhiannon Spear <small>([[Greater Pollok (ward)|Greater Pollok]])</small>\n* Equalities Convener: Fiona Robertson\n* Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Convener: Councillor Graham Campbell <small>([[Springburn/Robroyston (ward)|Springburn/Robroyston]])</small>\n* Disabled Members' Convener: Morag Fulton\n* [[Tommy Sheppard]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] <small>([[Edinburgh East (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East]])</small>\n* [[Alison Thewliss]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] <small>([[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]])</small>\n* Sixteen regional representatives\n* Representatives from the Association of Nationalist Councillors and affiliated organisations\n\n===Membership===\nSince 18 September 2014 (the day of the Scottish independence referendum), party membership has more than quadrupled (from 25,642), surpassing the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and, briefly, [[Conservatives (UK)|Conservatives]] to become the second-largest political party in the United Kingdom in terms of membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160//|title=New figures show our party is now powered by 125,482 members - making @theSNP the second biggest party in the UK.|access-date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524143611/https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160|archive-date=24 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As of August 2018, the Party has 125,482 members.\n\n===European affiliation===\nThe SNP retains close links with [[Plaid Cymru]], its counterpart in [[Wales]].

Both the SNP and Plaid Cymru are members of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA), a European political party comprising [[regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] political parties. The EFA co-operates with the larger [[European Green Party]] to form [[The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA) group in the [[European Parliament]].\n\nPrior to its affiliation with The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance, the SNP had previously been allied with the [[European Progressive Democrats]] (1979\u20131984), [[Rainbow Group (1989\u20131994)|Rainbow Group]] (1989\u20131994) and [[European Radical Alliance]] (1994\u20131999).\n\nAs the UK is no longer a member of the EU, the SNP has no MEPs.\n\n==Party ideology==\n\n===Historical ideology===\nThe Scottish National Party did not have a clear ideological position until the 1970s, when it sought to explicitly present itself as a social democratic party in terms of party policy and publicity.<ref name=\"Lynch\">{{cite book|author=Peter Lynch|title=SNP: The History of the Scottish National Party|year=2002|publisher= Welsh Academic Press|page= }}</ref><ref name=\"Brand1978\">{{cite book|title=The National Movement in Scotland|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|year=1978|pages=216\u201317|author=Jack Brand}}</ref> During the period from its foundation until the 1960s, the SNP was essentially a moderate [[centrism|centrist]] party.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> Debate within the party focused more on the SNP being distinct as an all-Scotland national movement, with it being neither of the [[Left-wing politics|left]] nor the [[Right-wing politics|right]], but constituting a new politics that sought to put Scotland first.<ref name=\"Brand1978\"/><ref name=\"Brand199028\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=28|author=Jack Brand}}</ref>\n\nThe SNP was formed through the merger of the centre-left [[National Party of Scotland|National Party of Scotland (NPS)]] and the centre-right [[Scottish Party]].<ref name=\"Brand1978\"/> The SNP's founders were united over [[self-determination]] in principle, though not its exact nature, or the best strategic means to achieve self-government. From the mid-1940s onwards, SNP policy was [[Political radicalism|radical]] and [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistributionist]] in relation to land and in favour of \u2018the diffusion of economic power\u2019, including the [[decentralisation]] of industries such as coal to include the involvement of local authorities and regional planning bodies to control industrial structure and development.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> Party policies supported the economic and social policy status quo of the post-war [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]].<ref name=\"Lynch\"/><ref name=\"Hassan2009120\">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=120}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s, the SNP was starting to become defined ideologically, with a social democratic tradition emerging as the party grew in urban, industrial Scotland, and its membership experienced an influx of social democrats from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[trade union]]s and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].<ref name=\"Brand199032\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=32|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name=\"Mitchell1996208\">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=208}}</ref> The emergence of [[William Wolfe|Billy Wolfe]] as a leading figure in the SNP also contributed to the leftwards shift. By this period, the Labour Party were also the dominant party in Scotland, in terms of electoral support and representation. Targeting Labour through emphasising left-of-centre policies and values was therefore electorally logical for the SNP, as well as tying in with the ideological preferences of many new party members.<ref name=\"Mitchell1996208\"/> In 1961, the SNP conference expressed the party's opposition to the siting of the [[United States|US]] [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine base at the [[Holy Loch]].

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n===Current ideology===\nThe SNP's policy base is mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition.

It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability of [[Scotland]] to govern herself, thus bringing increased support for independence.\n\nGradualism stands in opposition to the so-called fundamentalist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely in order to achieve it. The argument goes that if the SNP is unprepared to argue for its central policy then it is unlikely ever to persuade the public of its worthiness.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/06/uk.politicalnews1|title=SNP's radical wing threatens to split party|last=Seenan|first=By Gerard|date=1999-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-02|last2=MacAskill|first2=Ewen|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Notable fundamentalists ===\n* [[Kenny MacAskill]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Margo MacDonald]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Notable gradualists ===\n* [[Alex Salmond]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[John Swinney]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/snp/865888.stm|title=Tussle for the top |website= BBC News |date=21 September 2000 |access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics|United Kingdom|Scotland}}\n* [[Culture of Scotland]]\n* [[Politics of Scotland]]\n* [[History of Scottish devolution]]\n* [[It's Scotland's oil]]\n* [[Radio Free Scotland]]\n* [[Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\n* [[The National (Scotland)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brand, Jack, ''The National Movement in Scotland'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978\n* Brand, Jack, \u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), ''Contemporary Minority Nationalism'', Routledge, 1990\n* [[Winnie Ewing]], [[Michael Russell (politician)|Michael Russell]], ''Stop the World; The Autobiography of Winnie Ewing'' [[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]], 2004\n* [[Richard J.

As with all other Queen performances since 1997, longstanding bassist [[John Deacon]] has declined to participate in the project due to his retirement. This is the first long-term collaboration of Queen since the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] project ended in 2009. Like the previous project, it was made clear that Lambert would not be replacing Queen frontman [[Freddie Mercury]], but rather that he would be featured with the band's active members. The collaboration originated when May and Taylor appeared on ''[[American Idol (season 8)|American Idol]]'' in 2009 when Lambert was a contestant. They began performing occasionally in 2011, conducted a short [[Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2012|European tour]] in 2012, and in 2014 announced a world tour, the [[Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2014\u20132015]] with dates in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and South America. In the summer of 2016, the group performed several dates as part of a festival tour in Europe and several dates in Asia.
