former professional [[basketball]] player who is currently Special Advisor to [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], the owner of the [[Chicago Bulls]]. After a highly successful period in European basketball, he was one of the first established European stars to play in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He won the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award]] in 1996.\n\nKuko\u010d was renowned for his versatility and passing ability; although his natural position was [[small forward]], he played all five [[Basketball position|positions]] on the court with prowess and demonstrated court vision and an outside shooting touch that were seldom found in players of his height. Together with [[Vassilis Spanoulis]], they are the only players in history to achieve the [[EuroLeague Final Four MVP#Multiple honors|EuroLeague Final Four MVP]] honor on three occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/113736/180/spanoulis-named-bwin-mvp-of-2013-final-four|title=Spanoulis named bwin MVP of 2013 Final Four|publisher=}}</ref> He was elected to the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] in 2017.<ref>[http://www.fiba.basketball/news/dream-team-shaq-and-kukoc-headline-2017-class-of-fiba-hall-of-fame-inductees Dream Team, Shaq and Kukoc headline 2017 Class of FIBA Hall of Fame Inductees.]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nKuko\u010d grew up as a youth in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], Croatia. His father was devoted to athletics, having played [[association football|football]] as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] in a lower ranked local [[sports club|club]]. Possessing excellent [[motor skill]]s, young Toni grew up participating in different sports, including [[table tennis]] and football. He especially excelled in table tennis as an adolescent, winning different youth category titles.<ref name=\"euroleague\">{{cite web|url=http://nodo4.euroleague.net/features/voices/2012-2013/vladimir-stankovic/i/109942/7781/toni-kukoc-the-pink-panther-of-basketball|title=Toni Kuko\u010d, the Pink Panther of basketball|date=March 4, 2013|publisher=Euroleague|accessdate=2013-08-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628030600/http://nodo4.euroleague.net/features/voices/2012-2013/vladimir-stankovic/i/109942/7781/toni-kukoc-the-pink-panther-of-basketball|archivedate=June 28, 2013}}</ref>  He soon switched to [[basketball]] as his sport of choice.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Europe===\nKuko\u010d began playing for his home town club, [[KK Split|KK Jugoplastika]], at the age of 17. He achieved significant success during his time with the club, winning the prestigious [[EuroLeague]] as the team recorded three winning year seasons consecutively (1989&ndash;1991). His team won the [[Triple Crown (basketball)|Triple Crown]] in 1990 and 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/9105/180/all-the-final-fours-1988-2011|title=All The Final Fours 1988-2011|date=March 1, 2002 |publisher=Euroleague|accessdate=2015-08-19}}</ref> Kuko\u010d was awarded as the [[EuroLeague Final Four MVP]] both times.\n\nAfterwards, he played for [[Pallacanestro Treviso|Benetton Treviso]] and won the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]] championship in 1992 and the [[Italian Basketball Cup|Italian Cup]] in 1993. He also played in the [[1993 EuroLeague Final Four|EuroLeague final in 1993]], winning the [[EuroLeague Final Four MVP]] once again. He was nicknamed \"the White [[Magic Johnson|Magic]]\", \"the Spider from Split\", \"the Pink Panther\", \"the Waiter\", and \"the Croatian Sensation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t1oPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b4YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2049,2623878&dq=croatian-sensation+kukoc&hl=en|title=The Bulletin - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref> Throughout the 1990s, he won several European Basketball Player of the Year Awards.\n\n===Chicago Bulls===\nAfter being drafted by the NBA's [[Chicago Bulls]] in 1990, Kuko\u010d continued to play in Europe, until finally reporting to the Bulls in [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993]], when the team had just finished its first three-peat and had lost [[Michael Jordan]] to retirement. While disappointed at the time that he could not play with Jordan, Kuko\u010d made his NBA debut on November 5, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kukocto01.html|title=Toni Kukoc Stats - Basketball-Reference.com|website=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nThe 6'11\" (2.11 m) Kuko\u010d came off the bench in [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]] behind [[small forward]] [[Scottie Pippen]] and [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Horace Grant]], though Kuko\u010d could play shooting guard and center as well. On January 21, 1994, in a game against the [[Indiana Pacers]], [[Reggie Miller]] shot a mid-range jumper with 0.8 seconds remaining to give the Pacers the lead 95-93. [[Scottie Pippen]] inbounded the ball to Kukoc, who shot a 3-point jumper at the buzzer to give the Bulls the 1-point win, 96-95. Kuko\u010d put up a solid rookie season, averaging double-digit scoring and earning a berth on the [[NBA All-Rookie Second Team]].\n\nOn May 13, 1994, at the end of Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls and the [[New York Knicks]] were tied at 102 with 1.8 seconds left. Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]] designed the last play for Kuko\u010d, with [[Scottie Pippen]] charged with inbounding the basketball. Pippen was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Kuko\u010d did hit the game-winner, a 23-foot fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, though the Bulls eventually lost the series in seven games.\n\nAfter Grant left in the offseason, Kuko\u010d moved into the starting lineup and finished the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]] second on the Bulls in scoring, rebounds and assists, behind Pippen. Furthermore, Michael Jordan would return to the Bulls in March, fulfilling Kuko\u010d's wish to play alongside him.\n\nFor the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]], the Bulls were bolstered by both Jordan's return to full form and the offseason acquisition of exceptional rebounder [[Dennis Rodman]]. With Pippen still at small forward, coach [[Phil Jackson]] saw it best to have Kuko\u010d continue to be a bench player. Kuko\u010d was third on the team in scoring (behind Jordan and Pippen) and was rewarded for his efforts with the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award]]. He also assisted the Bulls to a 25-game turnaround and the best record in league history at the time at 72\u201310 (later surpassed by the [[2015\u201316 Golden State Warriors season|2015\u201316 Golden State Warriors]]), as well as the fourth championship in team history. Kuko\u010d was the 4th and is currently the last player to win the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award]] and the NBA title in the same year having joined [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], [[Bill Walton]], and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]] in accomplishing that feat.\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, Kuko\u010d again came off the bench as sixth man as the Bulls won their fifth and sixth NBA titles. Once again, he was the team's third-leading scorer.\n\n===Career ending and retirement===\nIn early 1999, Pippen was traded to the [[Houston Rockets]], effectively breaking up the Bulls dynasty. Kuko\u010d was one of the only players from their championship years that the Bulls retained. In the lockout-shortened [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], he led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists. During the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]] as Chicago continued their rebuilding scheme, Kuko\u010d was traded to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in a three-team deal involving the [[Golden State Warriors]] that sent [[Bruce Bowen]], [[John Starks (basketball)|John Starks]] and a 2000 first-round pick to the Bulls. The following season, he was dealt to the [[Atlanta Hawks]], along with [[Nazr Mohammed]], [[Juan Ignacio S\u00e1nchez|Pepe S\u00e1nchez]], and [[Theo Ratliff]], in a blockbuster deal that sent [[Dikembe Mutombo]] and [[Roshown McLeod]] to the 76ers. After a short stint with the Hawks, he was traded to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], along with [[Leon Smith (basketball)|Leon Smith]], in a deal for [[Glenn Robinson]]. On September 12, 2006, Kuko\u010d announced that he would retire from professional basketball if he could not be signed by either the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] or the [[Chicago Bulls]] for the [[2006\u201307 NBA season]]. Although various NBA teams had shown interest in his services, Kuko\u010d expressed a desire to be close to his residence in the city of [[Highland Park, Illinois]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2584291 | title = All she wrote?

former professional [[basketball]] player who is currently Special Advisor to [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], the owner of the [[Chicago Bulls]]. After a highly successful period in European basketball, he was one of the first established European stars to play in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He won the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award]] in 1996.\n\nKuko\u010d was renowned for his versatility and passing ability; although his natural position was [[small forward]], he played all five [[Basketball position|positions]] on the court with prowess and demonstrated court vision and an outside shooting touch that were seldom found in players of his height.

He achieved significant success during his time with the club, winning the prestigious [[EuroLeague]] as the team recorded three winning year seasons consecutively (1989&ndash;1991).

He also played in the [[1993 EuroLeague Final Four|EuroLeague final in 1993]], winning the [[EuroLeague Final Four MVP]] once again. He was nicknamed \"the White [[Magic Johnson|Magic]]\", \"the Spider from Split\", \"the Pink Panther\", \"the Waiter\", and \"the Croatian Sensation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t1oPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b4YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2049,2623878&dq=croatian-sensation+kukoc&hl=en|title=The Bulletin - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref> Throughout the 1990s, he won several European Basketball Player of the Year Awards.\n\n===Chicago Bulls===\nAfter being drafted by the NBA's [[Chicago Bulls]] in 1990, Kuko\u010d continued to play in Europe, until finally reporting to the Bulls in [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993]], when the team had just finished its first three-peat and had lost [[Michael Jordan]] to retirement. While disappointed at the time that he could not play with Jordan, Kuko\u010d made his NBA debut on November 5, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kukocto01.html|title=Toni Kukoc Stats - Basketball-Reference.com|website=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nThe 6'11\" (2.11 m) Kuko\u010d came off the bench in [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]] behind [[small forward]] [[Scottie Pippen]] and [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Horace Grant]], though Kuko\u010d could play shooting guard and center as well. On January 21, 1994, in a game against the [[Indiana Pacers]], [[Reggie Miller]] shot a mid-range jumper with 0.8 seconds remaining to give the Pacers the lead 95-93. [[Scottie Pippen]] inbounded the ball to Kukoc, who shot a 3-point jumper at the buzzer to give the Bulls the 1-point win, 96-95. Kuko\u010d put up a solid rookie season, averaging double-digit scoring and earning a berth on the [[NBA All-Rookie Second Team]].\n\nOn May 13, 1994, at the end of Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls and the [[New York Knicks]] were tied at 102 with 1.8 seconds left. Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]] designed the last play for Kuko\u010d, with [[Scottie Pippen]] charged with inbounding the basketball. Pippen was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Kuko\u010d did hit the game-winner, a 23-foot fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, though the Bulls eventually lost the series in seven games.\n\nAfter Grant left in the offseason, Kuko\u010d moved into the starting lineup and finished the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]] second on the Bulls in scoring, rebounds and assists, behind Pippen. Furthermore, Michael Jordan would return to the Bulls in March, fulfilling Kuko\u010d's wish to play alongside him.\n\nFor the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]], the Bulls were bolstered by both Jordan's return to full form and the offseason acquisition of exceptional rebounder [[Dennis Rodman]]. With Pippen still at small forward, coach [[Phil Jackson]] saw it best to have Kuko\u010d continue to be a bench player. Kuko\u010d was third on the team in scoring (behind Jordan and Pippen) and was rewarded for his efforts with the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award]]. He also assisted the Bulls to a 25-game turnaround and the best record in league history at the time at 72\u201310 (later surpassed by the [[2015\u201316 Golden State Warriors season|2015\u201316 Golden State Warriors]]), as well as the fourth championship in team history. Kuko\u010d was the 4th and is currently the last player to win the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award]] and the NBA title in the same year having joined [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], [[Bill Walton]], and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]] in accomplishing that feat.\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, Kuko\u010d again came off the bench as sixth man as the Bulls won their fifth and sixth NBA titles. Once again, he was the team's third-leading scorer.\n\n===Career ending and retirement===\nIn early 1999, Pippen was traded to the [[Houston Rockets]], effectively breaking up the Bulls dynasty. Kuko\u010d was one of the only players from their championship years that the Bulls retained. In the lockout-shortened [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], he led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists. During the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]] as Chicago continued their rebuilding scheme, Kuko\u010d was traded to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in a three-team deal involving the [[Golden State Warriors]] that sent [[Bruce Bowen]], [[John Starks (basketball)|John Starks]] and a 2000 first-round pick to the Bulls. The following season, he was dealt to the [[Atlanta Hawks]], along with [[Nazr Mohammed]], [[Juan Ignacio S\u00e1nchez|Pepe S\u00e1nchez]], and [[Theo Ratliff]], in a blockbuster deal that sent [[Dikembe Mutombo]] and [[Roshown McLeod]] to the 76ers. After a short stint with the Hawks, he was traded to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], along with [[Leon Smith (basketball)|Leon Smith]], in a deal for [[Glenn Robinson]]. On September 12, 2006, Kuko\u010d announced that he would retire from professional basketball if he could not be signed by either the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] or the [[Chicago Bulls]] for the [[2006\u201307 NBA season]]. Although various NBA teams had shown interest in his services, Kuko\u010d expressed a desire to be close to his residence in the city of [[Highland Park, Illinois]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2584291 | title = All she wrote?

The fall of the Hatry group in September 1929 is cited as a contributing factor to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].<ref name=\"moneyweek\">John Stepak, [https://moneyweek.com/476720/hatry-crisis-great-depression/ \"Did one man trigger the Great Depression?\"], ''Money Week'', 17 November 2017. Retrieved 21 May 2019.</ref>\n\nEconomist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] described Hatry as \"one of those curiously un-English figures with whom the English periodically find themselves unable to cope.\"<ref>Galbraith, J.K. (2009) ''The Great Crash of 1929'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=jjf2Xv0t_BQC&lpg=PA91&dq=clarence%20hatry&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q=clarence%20hatry&f=false p.91.] Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. {{ISBN|0-547-57577-7}}. Retrieved August 2011</ref>\n\n==Rise in business==\nHatry began his professional career as an [[insurance]] [[clerk]] in London's [[West End of London|West End]]. Shrewd fellow-promoters remember that \"Clarence\" made his first killing in silk. He then recouped the ensuing bankruptcy in insurance, through City Equitable, a modest [[reinsurance]] business. It was bought from German and Austrian owners in 1914 for \u00a360,000; Hatry reorganised it in six months and sold a controlling interest for \u00a3250,000 to [[Gerard Lee Bevan]] and an associate called Peter Haig Thomas.\n\nHatry found the First World War a chance to profiteer, and by 1921, he was the respected director of 15 corporations.\n\nHe had already come to the attention of the American public for a different reason: transporting Eastern European immigrants to the United States and Canada.\n\nIn 1924, his Commercial Corporation of London failed for $3.75 million. In some manner, three successive bankruptcies had left him successively richer. He built a new business empire, with investments in photographic supplies, cameras, vending machines and loan offices.\n\nIn early 1929 investors flocked to the Hatry group: General Securities Ltd. (of which [[Henry Paulet, 16th Marquess of Winchester]], was chairman); Austin Friars Trust, Ltd., Dundee Trust, Oak Investment Corp., Associated Automatic Machines Corp., Drapery Trust, Retail Trade Corp., Photomaton Parent Corp. and Far Eastern Photomaton Corp.\n\nPhotomaton Parent Corporation Limited was set up by Clarence Hatry in 1928 to operate photograph machines in hundreds of public places such as railway stations and amusement parks.\n\nBy 1929, he had returned to the top table of corporate finance, and had worked out his greatest project, a merger of steel and iron concerns into the $40 million [[United Steel Companies]]. Just as this deal was to be consummated, the Stock Exchange Committee caught him borrowing $1 million on worthless paper. On 20 September 1929, the fraud became known, and the Hatry empire collapsed.\n\n==Personal life==\nHatry was not shy in displaying his wealth: his office suite had ornate bathrooms, he had [[swimming pool]]s in his Mayfair homes, a [[yacht]] and a racing stable.\n\nHatry owned the ''Westward'', once the largest yacht in British waters, between 1919 and 1924. He was known to dive from her bowsprit. He was a keen swimmer and remarked that \"swimming is the only sport that I, personally, enjoy.\"\n\nBetween 1922 and 1926 Hatry lived at 56 Upper Brook Street, previously occupied by [[David Ricardo]], economist, between 1812 and 1823. Number 56 was built on what was originally an independent plot some forty-one feet in frontage and thirty-three in depth, with a narrow passage at the back from Blackburne's Mews. It was well known as the only house with a rooftop swimming pool in London, where he held bathing-suit parties.\n\nBetween 1924 and 1929 Hatry lived at 5 Great Stanhope Street in [[Mayfair]], near the mansion of the daughter of [[King George V]]; [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Mary, the Princess Royal]]. During his four years there, Hatry spent \u00a370,000 on the house. His improvements were of questionable but indisputably exuberant, taste, as a contemporary newspaper report recorded: \"He installed \u2013 among other luxurious things \u2013 a swimming bath on the principal bedroom floor, and a stone-floored Tudor-style cocktail bar in the sub-basement.\" He called the bar \"Ye Old Stanhope Arms-Free House\". Until his imprisonment, Hatry swam in the pool every morning, throughout the year. Despite this, he was described as a \"sallow, baldish, unhealthy-looking little man.\"\n\n==Crash==\nHatry asserted that in late August 1929 he had made a secret visit to the Bank of England to appeal to [[Montagu Norman]] for financing to allow him to complete a merger with [[United Steel Companies]], a UK firm. Norman had adamantly refused Hatry's bid for a bridge loan. By 17 September, when Hatry stock began to fall on the London exchange, Hatry had liabilities of \u00a319&nbsp;million and assets of \u00a34&nbsp;million. On 19 September, after Hatry had approached [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] in a last desperate bid for financing, he asked Sir Gilbert Garnsey, a chartered accountant, to intervene on his behalf.\n\nHowever, Hatry did not tell Garnsey that he had been issuing stocks to try to cover the deal, and some of the stocks were fraudulent: the same certificates had been printed twice and given as security to different leading banks. Hatry had obtained a $1 million loan on forged bearer scrip certificates of [[City of Wakefield]] 4\u00bd% stock, and an alert clerk had spotted the discrepancy.\n\nGarnsey made a second approach to Norman for emergency financing, and was again rebuffed. By this point Norman had informed the chairman of the [[London Stock Exchange]] that the Hatry group was bankrupt. In the conversation, it was agreed that trading in Hatry shares would be suspended on 20 September.\n\nOn 20 September 1929 the [[London Stock Exchange]] committee immediately suspended all shares of the Hatry group, which had been worth about \u00a324 million. On that day, Hatry and his leading associates confessed to fraud and forgery in the office of Sir [[Archibald Bodkin]], the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] and, after lunching at the [[Charing Cross Hotel]], were jailed.\n\nThe Wall Street Crash began late the following month.\n\n==Trial and conviction==\nIn late December 1929, Hatry, along with Albert Edward Tabor, Edmund Daniels and Charles Graham Dixon, were tried at the [[Old Bailey]], charged with forgery and fraud. Hatry's friends subscribed $95,000 to pay for his defence.\n\nHatry, his voice shaking with emotion, said in his defence:\n\n{{quote|When I saw that matters were getting serious, I pledged every penny I possessed, my reputation, and maybe my liberty to avert what I knew would otherwise be a terrible crash. I took a grave risk at a time when I could easily have let things go and walked off a free man&nbsp;... By taking this risk now my name has become a byword and I am irretrievably and irreparably ruined.<ref name=time1929>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,929154,00.html | journal=Time Magazine | date=30 December 1929 | title=Nonpareil Hatry }}</ref>}}\n\nHatry was sentenced to 14 years in prison (two of them at hard labour) and sent to [[Brixton Prison]]. The first two weeks of his sentence he had to sleep on bare boards, and for 28 days, he had to crush rocks on the stonepile. Then, he was given the slightly less difficult task of making mail bags. He also served a stint as prison librarian.\n\nHatry was released after serving nine years of his sentence thanks to the support of his lawyer Norman Birkett, K. C. Birkett's role in the Hatry trial is related in H. Montgomery Hyde's book, ''Norman Birkett'' (London, 1964).\n\n==Comeback==\nAfter Hatry's release from prison in 1939, he bought [[Hatchards|Hatchards bookshop]] for \u00a36,000 and \"proceeded to turn around the ailing business\".<ref name=\"moneyweek\" /> In 1946 he acquired the [[Thomas Werner Laurie|T.

Retrieved August 2011</ref>\n\n==Rise in business==\nHatry began his professional career as an [[insurance]] [[clerk]] in London's [[West End of London|West End]]. Shrewd fellow-promoters remember that \"Clarence\" made his first killing in silk. He then recouped the ensuing bankruptcy in insurance, through City Equitable, a modest [[reinsurance]] business. It was bought from German and Austrian owners in 1914 for \u00a360,000; Hatry reorganised it in six months and sold a controlling interest for \u00a3250,000 to [[Gerard Lee Bevan]] and an associate called Peter Haig Thomas.\n\nHatry found the First World War a chance to profiteer, and by 1921, he was the respected director of 15 corporations.\n\nHe had already come to the attention of the American public for a different reason: transporting Eastern European immigrants to the United States and Canada.\n\nIn 1924, his Commercial Corporation of London failed for $3.75 million. In some manner, three successive bankruptcies had left him successively richer. He built a new business empire, with investments in photographic supplies, cameras, vending machines and loan offices.\n\nIn early 1929 investors flocked to the Hatry group: General Securities Ltd. (of which [[Henry Paulet, 16th Marquess of Winchester]], was chairman); Austin Friars Trust, Ltd., Dundee Trust, Oak Investment Corp., Associated Automatic Machines Corp., Drapery Trust, Retail Trade Corp., Photomaton Parent Corp. and Far Eastern Photomaton Corp.\n\nPhotomaton Parent Corporation Limited was set up by Clarence Hatry in 1928 to operate photograph machines in hundreds of public places such as railway stations and amusement parks.\n\nBy 1929, he had returned to the top table of corporate finance, and had worked out his greatest project, a merger of steel and iron concerns into the $40 million [[United Steel Companies]]. Just as this deal was to be consummated, the Stock Exchange Committee caught him borrowing $1 million on worthless paper. On 20 September 1929, the fraud became known, and the Hatry empire collapsed.\n\n==Personal life==\nHatry was not shy in displaying his wealth: his office suite had ornate bathrooms, he had [[swimming pool]]s in his Mayfair homes, a [[yacht]] and a racing stable.\n\nHatry owned the ''Westward'', once the largest yacht in British waters, between 1919 and 1924. He was known to dive from her bowsprit. He was a keen swimmer and remarked that \"swimming is the only sport that I, personally, enjoy.\"\n\nBetween 1922 and 1926 Hatry lived at 56 Upper Brook Street, previously occupied by [[David Ricardo]], economist, between 1812 and 1823. Number 56 was built on what was originally an independent plot some forty-one feet in frontage and thirty-three in depth, with a narrow passage at the back from Blackburne's Mews. It was well known as the only house with a rooftop swimming pool in London, where he held bathing-suit parties.\n\nBetween 1924 and 1929 Hatry lived at 5 Great Stanhope Street in [[Mayfair]], near the mansion of the daughter of [[King George V]]. During his four years there, Hatry spent \u00a370,000 on the house. His improvements were of questionable but indisputably exuberant, taste, as a contemporary newspaper report recorded: \"He installed \u2013 among other luxurious things \u2013 a swimming bath on the principal bedroom floor, and a stone-floored Tudor-style cocktail bar in the sub-basement.\" He called the bar \"Ye Old Stanhope Arms-Free House\". Until his imprisonment, Hatry swam in the pool every morning, throughout the year. Despite this, he was described as a \"sallow, baldish, unhealthy-looking little man.\"\n\n==Crash==\nHatry asserted that in late August 1929 he had made a secret visit to the Bank of England to appeal to [[Montagu Norman]] for financing to allow him to complete a merger with [[United Steel Companies]], a UK firm. Norman had adamantly refused Hatry's bid for a bridge loan. By 17 September, when Hatry stock began to fall on the London exchange, Hatry had liabilities of \u00a319&nbsp;million and assets of \u00a34&nbsp;million. On 19 September, after Hatry had approached [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] in a last desperate bid for financing, he asked Sir Gilbert Garnsey, a chartered accountant, to intervene on his behalf.\n\nHowever, Hatry did not tell Garnsey that he had been issuing stocks to try to cover the deal, and some of the stocks were fraudulent: the same certificates had been printed twice and given as security to different leading banks. Hatry had obtained a $1 million loan on forged bearer scrip certificates of [[City of Wakefield]] 4\u00bd% stock, and an alert clerk had spotted the discrepancy.\n\nGarnsey made a second approach to Norman for emergency financing, and was again rebuffed. By this point Norman had informed the chairman of the [[London Stock Exchange]] that the Hatry group was bankrupt. In the conversation, it was agreed that trading in Hatry shares would be suspended on 20 September.\n\nOn 20 September 1929 the [[London Stock Exchange]] committee immediately suspended all shares of the Hatry group, which had been worth about \u00a324 million. On that day, Hatry and his leading associates confessed to fraud and forgery in the office of Sir [[Archibald Bodkin]], the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] and, after lunching at the [[Charing Cross Hotel]], were jailed.\n\nThe Wall Street Crash began late the following month.\n\n==Trial and conviction==\nIn late December 1929, Hatry, along with Albert Edward Tabor, Edmund Daniels and Charles Graham Dixon, were tried at the [[Old Bailey]], charged with forgery and fraud. Hatry's friends subscribed $95,000 to pay for his defence.\n\nHatry, his voice shaking with emotion, said in his defence:\n\n{{quote|When I saw that matters were getting serious, I pledged every penny I possessed, my reputation, and maybe my liberty to avert what I knew would otherwise be a terrible crash. I took a grave risk at a time when I could easily have let things go and walked off a free man&nbsp;... By taking this risk now my name has become a byword and I am irretrievably and irreparably ruined.<ref name=time1929>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,929154,00.html | journal=Time Magazine | date=30 December 1929 | title=Nonpareil Hatry }}</ref>}}\n\nHatry was sentenced to 14 years in prison (two of them at hard labour) and sent to [[Brixton Prison]]. The first two weeks of his sentence he had to sleep on bare boards, and for 28 days, he had to crush rocks on the stonepile. Then, he was given the slightly less difficult task of making mail bags. He also served a stint as prison librarian.\n\nHatry was released after serving nine years of his sentence thanks to the support of his lawyer Norman Birkett, K. C. Birkett's role in the Hatry trial is related in H. Montgomery Hyde's book, ''Norman Birkett'' (London, 1964).\n\n==Comeback==\nAfter Hatry's release from prison in 1939, he bought [[Hatchards|Hatchards bookshop]] for \u00a36,000 and \"proceeded to turn around the ailing business\".<ref name=\"moneyweek\" /> In 1946 he acquired the [[Thomas Werner Laurie|T.

{"title_page": "Mosiah priority", "text_new": "'''Mosiah priority''' is a theory about the creation of the [[Book of Mormon]] arguing that the original manuscript began not with [[1 Nephi]] (found at the beginning of the Book of Mormon), but midway through, starting with [[Book of Mosiah|Mosiah]]. According to Mosiah priority, after the text of Mosiah through the end of the Book of Mormon was transcribed, Joseph Smith returned to the beginning and transcribed 1 Nephi through [[Words of Mormon]]. Mosiah priority is the most widely held solution to questions regarding the sequence of the English text.\n\n==Priority in the Book of Mormon==\nThe original transcription of the Book of Mormon by scribe Martin Harris was interrupted by the loss of the original manuscript.  The question about the subsequent workflow is known as the '''problem of priority in the Book of Mormon'''.\n\n===Lost 116 pages===\n{{see also|Lost 116 pages}}\nThe \"Lost 116 pages\" were the first manuscript pages of the Book of Mormon, and these were entrusted to scribe Martin Harris<ref>circa April\u2013June 1828</ref> and subsequently lost.  Smith subsequently announced a revelation:\n\n<blockquote>Behold I say unto you, that you shall not translate again those words which have gone forth out of your hands; for behold, they shall not lie any more against those words; for behold, if you should bring forth the same words, they would say that you have lied; that you have pretended to translate, but that you have contradicted your words; and behold they would publish this, and satan would harden the hearts of the people, to stir them up to anger against you, that they might not believe my words<ref>{{cite web|url=http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/book-of-commandments-1833?dm=image-and-text&zm=zoom-inner&tm=expanded&p=28&s=undefined&sm=none |title=Book of Commandments, 1833 |publisher=Josephsmithpapers.org |date=1904-02-20 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a preface to the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, Smith writes of the Lost 116 pages: \n\n<blockquote> I translated, by the gift and power of God, and caused to be written, one hundred and sixteen pages, the which I took from the Book of Lehi, which was an account abridged from the plates of Lehi, by the hand of Mormon; which said account, some person or persons have stolen and kept from me, notwithstanding my utmost exertions to recover it again -- and being commanded of the Lord that I should not translate the same over again, for Satan had put it into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering the words that they did read contrary from that which I translated and caused to be written; and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of this generation, that they might not receive this work: but behold the Lord said unto me, I will not suffer that Satan shall accomplish his evil design in this thing: therefore thou shalt translate from the plates of Nephi, until ye come to that which ye have translated, which ye have retained; and behold ye shall publish it as a record of Nephi; and thus I will confound those who have altered my words. I will not suffer that they shall destroy my work;</blockquote>\n\n===''1 Nephi'' priority===\nFaced with the loss of the 116 page manuscript, transcription of a second manuscript began.\n\nThe theory of '''''1 Nephi'' Priority''' argues that after the loss of the original 116-page manuscript, the transcription process returned to the beginning of the Golden Plates narrative, starting over at the beginning with ''1 Nephi''.<ref>In order: 1 Nephi, 2 Nephi, Jacob, Enos, Jarom, Omni, Words of Mormon, Mosiah, Alma, Helaman, 3 Nephi, 4 Nephi, Mormon, Ether, Moroni, and finally the Title Page.</ref> Proponents of 1 Nephi Priority included multiple 20th century authors.<ref>Ivan J.

This includes the restarting of translation work (referred to in D&C 10 in April\u2013May 1829), teachings on baptism in ''3 Nephi'' (referred to in D&C 13 on May 15, 1829), and a prophecy of the [[Three Witnesses]] in ''2 Nephi'' 27 (referred to in D&C 17 in June 1829).  The times when these passages were produced corresponds with a sequence and a consistent pace of translation beginning at ''Mosiah'' in April 1829<ref>After losing the first manuscript, the restarted translation work was actually initially begun in Summer 1828.  However, other demands in Joseph Smith's life hampered progress and little was produced until a revelation in April\u2013May 1829 (found in LDS D&C 10) recommitted Smith and his scribes to complete the work in haste.</ref> and then arriving at ''1 Nephi'' later that summer.<ref name=WelchRathbone/><ref name=RSR/><ref>{{cite web | title=Historical Introduction | department=Revelation, Spring 1829 <nowiki>[D&C 10]</nowiki> | work=The Joseph Smith Papers | publisher=[[Church Historian's Press]] | date=September 1, 2016 | url=http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-spring-1829-dc-10/1#historical-intro | accessdate=2017-09-11}}</ref>\n\nThe pages of the original manuscript containing ''1 Nephi'' are written in [[Oliver Cowdery]]'s handwriting.<ref name=Metcalfe1993/>  However, the first scribes were Joseph's wife [[Emma Smith|Emma]] and his younger brother [[Samuel H.

In a recent study, Eccel<ref>Arthur Chris Eccel, ''Mormon Genesis'' (Hilo: GP Touchstone, 1918), 351\u2013356</ref> standardized the data on 5,000 words. The resulting graph showed no gradual shift in style. To the contrary, the radical shift from the Nephi group to the Mosiah-Helaman group, supports the study of John Hilton<ref>John L.

Mosiah priority is the most widely held solution to questions regarding the sequence of the English text.\n\n==Priority in the Book of Mormon==\nThe original transcription of the Book of Mormon by scribe Martin Harris was interrupted by the loss of the original manuscript.

This includes the restarting of translation work (referred to in D&C 10 in April\u2013May 1829), teachings on baptism in ''3 Nephi'' (referred to in D&C 13 on May 15, 1829), and a prophecy of the [[Three Witnesses]] in ''2 Nephi'' 27 (referred to in D&C 17 in June 1829).  The times when these passages were produced corresponds with a sequence and a consistent pace of translation beginning at ''Mosiah'' in April 1829<ref>After losing the first manuscript, the restarted translation work was actually initially begun in Summer 1828.  However, other demands in Joseph Smith's life hampered progress and little was produced until a revelation in April\u2013May 1829 (found in LDS D&C 10) recommitted Smith and his scribes to complete the work in haste.</ref> and then arriving at ''1 Nephi'' later that summer.<ref name=WelchRathbone/><ref name=RSR/><ref>{{cite web | title=Historical Introduction | department=Revelation, Spring 1829 <nowiki>[D&C 10]</nowiki> | work=The Joseph Smith Papers | publisher=[[Church Historian's Press]] | date=September 1, 2016 | url=http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-spring-1829-dc-10/1#historical-intro | accessdate=2017-09-11}}</ref>\n\nThe pages of the original manuscript containing ''1 Nephi'' are written in [[Oliver Cowdery]]'s handwriting.<ref name=Metcalfe1993/>  However, the first scribes were Joseph's wife [[Emma Smith|Emma]] and his younger brother [[Samuel H.

In a recent study, Eccel<ref>Arthur Chris Eccel, ''Mormon Genesis'' (Hilo: GP Touchstone, 1918), 351\u2013356</ref> standardized the data on 5,000 words. The resulting graph showed no gradual shift in style. To the contrary, the radical shift from the Nephi group to the Mosiah-Helaman group, supports the study of John Hilton<ref>John L. Hilton, \"On Verifying Wordprint Studies: ''Book of Mormon'' Authorship,\" ''BYU Studies'' vol. 30, no. 3 (1990), 99 & footnote 21.</ref>, which concluded that Nephi and Alma could not have been authored by the same person.\n{{Book of Mormon therefore v wherefore}}\n\n===Computational studies===\nA 2008 computational study claimed to note patterns which support Mosiah priority, although its methodology is not without criticism.<ref>{{citation |last1= Jockers |first1= Matthew L. |last2= Witten |first2= Daniela M. |last3= Criddle |first3= Craig S. |year= 2008 |title= Reassessing authorship of the Book of Mormon using delta and nearest shrunken centroid classification |journal= Literary and Linguistic Computing |volume= 23 |issue= 4 |pages= 465\u2013491 |doi= 10.1093/llc/fqn040}}.
