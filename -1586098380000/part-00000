A bus with a partial low floor may also be referred to as a '''low-entry bus''' in some locations.\n\n[[Low floor]] refers to a bus deck that is accessible from the sidewalk with only a single step with a small height difference, caused solely by the difference between the bus deck and sidewalk. This is distinct from [[high-floor]], a bus deck design that requires climbing one or more steps (now known as step entrance) to access the interior floor that is placed at a higher height.  Being low-floor improves the [[accessibility]] of the bus for the public, particularly the elderly and [[disability|people with disabilities]], including those using [[wheelchair]]s and [[Walker (mobility)|walkers]]. Almost all are [[rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] with no [[drive shaft]].\n\n==History==\n{{stub section|date=January 2020}}\nThe first low floor bus was LAZ 360, created in Soviet Union in 1963 by [[Lviv Bus Factory]] (LAZ), designed by Nami USSR. Dennis Lance SLF was the first low-floor bus in London 1993.<ref>{{cite web |title=Start of Low floor buses - a Freedom of Information request to Transport for London |url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/start_of_low_floor_buses |website=WhatDoTheyKnow |language=en |date=2 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Configuration==\n[[File:Kneeling bus raising the floor before departure.webm|thumb|Kneeling bus raising the floor before departure]]\n[[File:Lowfloorramp.jpg|thumb|Many low-floor buses feature extendable ramps.|alt=|left|288x288px]]\n\n===Low-floor and low-entry buses===\nLow-floor buses are generally divided into two major types: fully low-floor buses with a low floor throughout the length of the bus (more popular in Europe), and low-entry buses with step-free access to only a part of the bus, most commonly between the front door and the middle door (more popular in North America). In North America, both types are commonly called low-floor, as the majority of the vehicle has a low floor, without steps at the doors.\n\nThe main reason for choosing a low-entry configuration is to allow better placement for the [[powertrain]] and other technical equipment in the raised floor section, in addition to allowing a more comfortable ride on rough roads. Some manufacturers use the initials '''LF''' or '''L''' in their model designations for fully low-floor models (or in the case of German manufacturers, '''NF''' or '''N''', based on the German word ''Niederflur'', which means low floor), and in North America buses that are partially low-floor are often also designated LF.  In some countries, '''LE''', short for '''Low Entry''', is used by some manufacturers in their model designations for low-entry buses.\n\n===Suspension and powertrain===\nMost [[bus manufacturer]]s achieve a low floor height by making [[rear-engine design|rear-engined]] [[rear-wheel drive]] buses with [[independent front suspension]], so that no [[axle]] is needed to pass under the floor of the front part of passenger compartment, or a lowered front axle. Some full low-floor buses also have a lowered rear axle, while the rear axle is not an issue on a low-entry bus.\n\nMany low-floor buses, including the [[Irisbus Citelis]] (also in Skoda 24Tr trolleybus version), has the engine in a vertical cabinet at the rear of the bus. [[Van Hool]] have a series of \"side-engine mid-drive\" buses that puts the engine off to one side of the cabin longitudinally between the first and the second axle, to maximize usable cabin space. The same concept was also utilized by Volvo on their [[Volvo B9S|B9S]] articulated chassis.\n\nFor smaller buses, such as [[midibus]]es, the low-floor capability is achieved by placing the front wheels ahead of the entrance. One of the last types of buses to gain low-floor accessibility as standard was the [[minibus]], where a similar front-wheel arrangement allows around 12 seats and a wheelchair space to be accommodated in very small [[minibus#Low floor minibuses|low-floor minibuses]], such as the [[Optare Alero]] and [[Hino Poncho]]. Accessibility was previously achieved in [[paratransit]] type applications, which use small vehicles with the fitment of special lifts. The inception of small low-floor buses has allowed the development of several accessible [[demand-responsive transport]] schemes using standard 'off-the-shelf' buses.\n\nA disadvantage of the low floor is accommodating the bus's own wheels. With the low floor, the wheels protrude into the passenger cabin, and need to be contained in wheel pockets of waist height, and this occupies space which would otherwise be used for seating. To allow space for technical equipment, many low-floor buses have the seats mounted on podiums, making a small step up from the floor, while others are able to mount the seats directly to the floor, avoiding the step. Seating layout for a low-floor bus therefore requires careful design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schallerconsult.com/pub/lowfloor.htm|title=MTA New York City Transit Research Shows What Customers Want in Low Floor Buses|last=Schaller|first=Bruce|author2=Dana Lowell |author3=Kenneth R. Stuart |date=May\u2013June 1998|publisher=Schaller Consulting|accessdate=29 April 2009}}</ref> Low floor configuration is also known to have poor side to side dead load distribution within the chassis due to the asymmetrical off-centre placement of driveline components - mainly engine and transmission. As a result, many of such buses require electronically controlled air suspension to compensate the lopsided configuration.\n\n===Other features===\n[[File:Blacksburg Transit New Flyer low floor bus interior.jpg|thumb|250px|Interior of a New Flyer low-floor bus. The floor of the front two-thirds of the bus is at curb height.]]\n[[File:Lagevloerbus Mindervalide.jpg|thumb|A low-floor bus provides accessibility for wheelchair users.|alt=|left]]\nLow-floor buses usually include an area without seating (or seating that folds up) next to at least one of the doors, where [[wheelchair]]s, [[Walker (mobility)|walker]]s, strollers/prams, and where allowed even bicycles, can be parked. This is sometimes not the only purpose of this area, though, as many operators employ larger standee areas for high occupancy at peak times. Despite the space existing, operators may also insist that only one or two wheelchairs or pushchairs can be accommodated unfolded, due to space/safety concerns.\n\nLow floors can be complemented by a [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] or [[pneumatic]] 'kneeling device', which can be used when the bus is not in motion, tilting it or lowering it at the front axle even further, often down to normal [[curb (road)|curb]] height. Depending on how close to the curb the bus is parked and wheelchair design, this can allow wheelchair users to board unaided. Though such technology has been available and in use on high-floor buses since the 1970s, it is of significant utility on low-floor vehicles only where it enables less-mobile passengers to board and leave the vehicle without help from others. Many vehicles are also equipped with wheel-chair lifts, or ramps which, when combined with a low floor, can provide a nearly level entry.\n\nAn interesting implementation of the low floor design exists in Australia, where Custom Coaches makes a \"Hybrid\" variant of its CB60 bodywork. These buses combine a smaller low floor area with a small underfloor bin for some luggage. Whilst these buses do not provide a full amount of luggage space, they can be used to house more luggage than what can be held inside the bus itself. Another drawback is the arrangement means the section of the bus that is at curb height is very short-consisting of enough space to house the wheelchair area and then rising up, to accommodate the luggage bin. These buses also lack the ability to have a center door.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Alternatives==\nMany [[bus rapid transit]] systems employ a level boarding by using high-floor buses stopping at \"station\" style bus stops. Specially raised sections of curb may also be used to achieve accessibility with lesser low floor models, although this is more expensive for the operator, and only attractive for regular busy scheduled routes. For infrequent routes or routes with [[hail and ride]] sections, or [[demand responsive transport]], raised curbs would only be feasible in [[bus terminus|terminus]]es.\n\nSome transit agencies refused to order low-floor buses altogether, such as [[New Jersey Transit]] and [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|MUNI]] owing to terrain conditions in the service area. [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART]] still has a preference for high floor buses. Although [[New York City Transit Authority|New York City Transit]] runs some 40-foot low-floors, it originally refused to order low-floor buses, namely D60LFs from [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]], after the D60HF, a high floor model, was discontinued mid-delivery. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, they have demonstrated both the D60LF and NovaBus LFSA, the latter of which they have decided to order.\n\n==Asia==\n\n===India===\n\n====Bengaluru====\nBangalore is one of the first cities in India that introduced Low Floor buses. The [[Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation|Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation, BMTC]] operates many services using the premium Volvo<ref>{{cite web|title=Volvo Buses India|url=http://www.volvobuses.com/bus/india/en-in/buses/Volvo8400/Pages/Introduction.aspx}}</ref> 8400LE Low-floor buses. These buses are air-conditioned, and offer features such as automatic transmission, kneeling and wheel-chair ramp, typical of modern city buses. They are also fitted with LED display boards as well as ITS to announce the halts. The corporation also had tried Mercedes-Benz Low-Floor buses as well as [[Ashok Leyland]] ULE coaches, but chose to stick to the Volvo offering.\n\nIn order to keep the bus ticket prices low, the BMTC operates the majority of their services using Non-Airconditioned Semi-Low Floor (SLF) buses that have a floor height of 650mm as against the 400mm floor height of the true Low-Floor buses. These buses are from Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors, with future procurements planned to be from Eicher (VECV). These cheaper alternative to low-floor buses do not have kneeling or wheel-chair accessible ramps, but they have air suspension and use the same or better seats as those found in the Volvo buses. They also feature manual transmission as against automatic transmission\n\n====New Delhi====\n[[Image:DTC AC Bus.jpg|thumb|Low floor AC Buses in Delhi]]\nWith the introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and the development of dedicated corridors for the service, bus service is set to improve.<ref name=\"indiaexpress\">{{cite news | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/next-brt-corridor-in-east-delhi-dikshita/569663/ | title=Next BRT corridor in East Delhi: Dikshita | accessdate=26 February 2011 | author=Agency | date=20 January 2010 | newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]}}</ref> The [[Delhi Transport Corporation]] (DTC) has started introducing air-conditioned buses and brand new low-floor buses (with floor height of {{convert|400|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} and even higher on one third area as against {{convert|230|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} available internationally) on city streets to replace the conventional buses.<ref name=\"the hindu \">{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/25/stories/2007092555040400.htm | title=First new low-floor bus for DTC arrives | accessdate=26 February 2011 | author=Bhatnagar, Gaurav Vivek | date=25 September 2007 | newspaper=[[The Hindu]]}}</ref> A revamp plan is underway to improve bus-shelters in the city and to integrate GPS systems in DTC buses and bus stops so as to provide reliable information about bus arrivals. The Delhi Government decided to expedite this process and procured 6,600 low floor buses for the DTC before [[2010 Commonwealth Games|commonwealth games]] in 2010.\n\n====Kolkata====\n{{Further|Transport in Kolkata }}\nKolkata has an extensive network of government run buses. Recently air-conditioned buses have been introduced by the WBSTC. These buses connects places like the [[Kolkata Airport]], [[Barasat]] (Capital Town of North Suburb), [[Rajarhat|New Town]], [[Bidhannagar, Kolkata|Salt Lake]], [[Howrah]], [[Santragachi]] (a station on the Howrah-Kharagpur railway line), [[Kudgaht]] and [[Tollygunge]]. The road network in Kolkata is vast. Under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, air conditioned buses have been included as a part of travel comfort to commuters. Air-conditioned buses are operated by West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC) directly & through outsourcing. These buses are served by Tata Marcopolo Buses and Volvo Low Floor Buses. The V Series and VS series bus routes are served by the AC volvo bus and MW series are served by the Tata Marcopolo buses operated by WBSTC. AC Marcopolo buses serve the MH series route operated by WBHIDCO and the MB series route operated by BHBL. Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) also run AC Volvo Bus & Ashok Leylan JanBus.\n\n====Jaipur (Jaipur)====\n\n* Non-AC : Several Non-AC buses are available across the city.

Low floor buses were rapidly introduced on high-profile routes, notably becoming a requirement for [[London Buses]] contracts. The [[Optare Solo]] introduced in 1997 marked another step change with inroads into smaller usages traditionally served by [[minibus]]es. The final phase came with low floor [[double-decker bus|double-deckers]] the [[Dennis Trident 2]] and [[Volvo B7TL]] entering the mass market, even though they were introduced after the [[Optare Spectra]].\n\nDue to the [[bus deregulation|deregulated nature]] of the public transport system in the UK, adoption of the higher cost low floor buses was usually in conjunction with some sort of grant or quality partnership with a [[local authority]], as the profitability of many routes was not high enough to justify conversion based purely on increased revenue. It has been reported however that adoption of so-called ''Easy Access'' buses does have a positive effect of ridership and revenue levels.\n\nUnder the [[Transport Act 1985]] the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131106010255/http://dptac.independent.gov.uk/ Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee] (DPTAC) (or commonly DiPTAC) was established to provide independent consultation on accessibility issues.<ref>[http://www.dptac.gov.uk/dptacint.htm UK government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807124315/http://www.dptac.gov.uk/dptacint.htm |date=7 August 2008 }}</ref> In the same year, the first low floor bus specification was drafted by DPTAC. The [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] provided for the completion of the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000,<ref>[http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/buses/pubs/psvar/accessibilityregulations20005993?page=1#a1000 Transport for you]</ref> which specified that all new public service vehicles over 22 seats should be low floor from 31 December 2000, with smaller vehicles mandated from 1 January 2005. The 2000 regulations do not require retro-fitting of pre-existing vehicles or the enforced sale of non-compliant existing vehicles, allowing operators to retain a high floor vehicle until \"the end of their economic life\". In reality, as the prevalence of low floor buses spreads, combined with grants/incentives, it is likely that the prevalence of high floor vehicles in the national fleet will markedly reduce before all buses were de-registered by 27 October 2014. In the past, in times of reduced economic investment, it was not uncommon for service buses to be used for 15 to 20 years.\n\nWhile some [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]] have been produced with a small front low floor section at the driver's level, most coaches in the UK are being made accessible through the use of [[wheelchair lift]]s, with the 2005 [[Caetano Levante]] being one of the largest introductions.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4422482.stm BBC]</ref>\n\nWhile another widely stated benefit of low floor buses is quicker boarding for able-bodied passengers due to the lack of steps, studies have found the opposite effect in the UK. This is apparently due to the prevailing system of operation where passengers enter and exit through one single front door. It has been suggested that the previous 1980s/90s high floor step entrance buses which featured a centre rail, encouraged a bi-directional flow of entering and exiting passengers simultaneously. The removal of the pole to allow wheelchair/buggy access created the situation where the quintessentially polite British bus passenger would wait for all passengers to alight before boarding, leading to an increase in [[on-time performance|dwell times]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==North America==\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Community Transit 9165 (1999 NFI D40LF) at Aurora Village TC.jpg|thumb|1999 [[New Flyer D40LF]] in the [[Aurora Village]] Transit Center in [[Shoreline]] in June 2010.]]\nIn the United States, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] is credited with motivating the development of low-floor buses.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tsyn02.pdf |title=Low-Floor Transit Buses: A Synthesis of Transit Practice |author=King, Rolland D. |date=1994 |isbn=0-309-05321-8 |publisher=Transportation Research Board |accessdate=12 December 2018}}</ref> The first low-floor (low-entry) buses to be delivered were the [[New Flyer Low Floor]] D40LF, to the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] in 1991.

A bus with a partial low floor may also be referred to as a '''low-entry bus''' in some locations.\n\n[[Low floor]] refers to a bus deck that is accessible from the sidewalk with only a single step with a small height difference, caused solely by the difference between the bus deck and sidewalk. This is distinct from [[high-floor]], a bus deck design that requires climbing one or more steps (now known as step entrance) to access the interior floor that is placed at a higher height.  Being low-floor improves the [[accessibility]] of the bus for the public, particularly the elderly and [[disability|people with disabilities]], including those using [[wheelchair]]s and [[Walker (mobility)|walkers]]. Almost all are [[rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] with no [[drive shaft]].\n\n==History==\n{{stub section|date=January 2020}}\nThe first low floor bus was LAZ 360, created in Soviet Union in 1963 by [[LAZ]], designed by Nami USSR. Dennis Lance SLF was the first low-floor bus in London 1993.<ref>{{cite web |title=Start of Low floor buses - a Freedom of Information request to Transport for London |url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/start_of_low_floor_buses |website=WhatDoTheyKnow |language=en |date=2 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Configuration==\n[[File:Kneeling bus raising the floor before departure.webm|thumb|Kneeling bus raising the floor before departure]]\n[[File:Lowfloorramp.jpg|thumb|Many low-floor buses feature extendable ramps.|alt=|left|288x288px]]\n\n===Low-floor and low-entry buses===\nLow-floor buses are generally divided into two major types: fully low-floor buses with a low floor throughout the length of the bus (more popular in Europe), and low-entry buses with step-free access to only a part of the bus, most commonly between the front door and the middle door (more popular in North America). In North America, both types are commonly called low-floor, as the majority of the vehicle has a low floor, without steps at the doors.\n\nThe main reason for choosing a low-entry configuration is to allow better placement for the [[powertrain]] and other technical equipment in the raised floor section, in addition to allowing a more comfortable ride on rough roads. Some manufacturers use the initials '''LF''' or '''L''' in their model designations for fully low-floor models (or in the case of German manufacturers, '''NF''' or '''N''', based on the German word ''Niederflur'', which means low floor), and in North America buses that are partially low-floor are often also designated LF.  In some countries, '''LE''', short for '''Low Entry''', is used by some manufacturers in their model designations for low-entry buses.\n\n===Suspension and powertrain===\nMost [[bus manufacturer]]s achieve a low floor height by making [[rear-engine design|rear-engined]] [[rear-wheel drive]] buses with [[independent front suspension]], so that no [[axle]] is needed to pass under the floor of the front part of passenger compartment, or a lowered front axle. Some full low-floor buses also have a lowered rear axle, while the rear axle is not an issue on a low-entry bus.\n\nMany low-floor buses, including the [[Irisbus Citelis]] (also in Skoda 24Tr trolleybus version), has the engine in a vertical cabinet at the rear of the bus. [[Van Hool]] have a series of \"side-engine mid-drive\" buses that puts the engine off to one side of the cabin longitudinally between the first and the second axle, to maximize usable cabin space. The same concept was also utilized by Volvo on their [[Volvo B9S|B9S]] articulated chassis.\n\nFor smaller buses, such as [[midibus]]es, the low-floor capability is achieved by placing the front wheels ahead of the entrance. One of the last types of buses to gain low-floor accessibility as standard was the [[minibus]], where a similar front-wheel arrangement allows around 12 seats and a wheelchair space to be accommodated in very small [[minibus#Low floor minibuses|low-floor minibuses]], such as the [[Optare Alero]] and [[Hino Poncho]]. Accessibility was previously achieved in [[paratransit]] type applications, which use small vehicles with the fitment of special lifts. The inception of small low-floor buses has allowed the development of several accessible [[demand-responsive transport]] schemes using standard 'off-the-shelf' buses.\n\nA disadvantage of the low floor is accommodating the bus's own wheels. With the low floor, the wheels protrude into the passenger cabin, and need to be contained in wheel pockets of waist height, and this occupies space which would otherwise be used for seating. To allow space for technical equipment, many low-floor buses have the seats mounted on podiums, making a small step up from the floor, while others are able to mount the seats directly to the floor, avoiding the step. Seating layout for a low-floor bus therefore requires careful design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schallerconsult.com/pub/lowfloor.htm|title=MTA New York City Transit Research Shows What Customers Want in Low Floor Buses|last=Schaller|first=Bruce|author2=Dana Lowell |author3=Kenneth R. Stuart |date=May\u2013June 1998|publisher=Schaller Consulting|accessdate=29 April 2009}}</ref> Low floor configuration is also known to have poor side to side dead load distribution within the chassis due to the asymmetrical off-centre placement of driveline components - mainly engine and transmission. As a result, many of such buses require electronically controlled air suspension to compensate the lopsided configuration.\n\n===Other features===\n[[File:Blacksburg Transit New Flyer low floor bus interior.jpg|thumb|250px|Interior of a New Flyer low-floor bus. The floor of the front two-thirds of the bus is at curb height.]]\n[[File:Lagevloerbus Mindervalide.jpg|thumb|A low-floor bus provides accessibility for wheelchair users.|alt=|left]]\nLow-floor buses usually include an area without seating (or seating that folds up) next to at least one of the doors, where [[wheelchair]]s, [[Walker (mobility)|walker]]s, strollers/prams, and where allowed even bicycles, can be parked. This is sometimes not the only purpose of this area, though, as many operators employ larger standee areas for high occupancy at peak times. Despite the space existing, operators may also insist that only one or two wheelchairs or pushchairs can be accommodated unfolded, due to space/safety concerns.\n\nLow floors can be complemented by a [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] or [[pneumatic]] 'kneeling device', which can be used when the bus is not in motion, tilting it or lowering it at the front axle even further, often down to normal [[curb (road)|curb]] height. Depending on how close to the curb the bus is parked and wheelchair design, this can allow wheelchair users to board unaided. Though such technology has been available and in use on high-floor buses since the 1970s, it is of significant utility on low-floor vehicles only where it enables less-mobile passengers to board and leave the vehicle without help from others. Many vehicles are also equipped with wheel-chair lifts, or ramps which, when combined with a low floor, can provide a nearly level entry.\n\nAn interesting implementation of the low floor design exists in Australia, where Custom Coaches makes a \"Hybrid\" variant of its CB60 bodywork. These buses combine a smaller low floor area with a small underfloor bin for some luggage. Whilst these buses do not provide a full amount of luggage space, they can be used to house more luggage than what can be held inside the bus itself. Another drawback is the arrangement means the section of the bus that is at curb height is very short-consisting of enough space to house the wheelchair area and then rising up, to accommodate the luggage bin. These buses also lack the ability to have a center door.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Alternatives==\nMany [[bus rapid transit]] systems employ a level boarding by using high-floor buses stopping at \"station\" style bus stops. Specially raised sections of curb may also be used to achieve accessibility with lesser low floor models, although this is more expensive for the operator, and only attractive for regular busy scheduled routes. For infrequent routes or routes with [[hail and ride]] sections, or [[demand responsive transport]], raised curbs would only be feasible in [[bus terminus|terminus]]es.\n\nSome transit agencies refused to order low-floor buses altogether, such as [[New Jersey Transit]] and [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|MUNI]] owing to terrain conditions in the service area. [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART]] still has a preference for high floor buses. Although [[New York City Transit Authority|New York City Transit]] runs some 40-foot low-floors, it originally refused to order low-floor buses, namely D60LFs from [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]], after the D60HF, a high floor model, was discontinued mid-delivery. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, they have demonstrated both the D60LF and NovaBus LFSA, the latter of which they have decided to order.\n\n==Asia==\n\n===India===\n\n====Bengaluru====\nBangalore is one of the first cities in India that introduced Low Floor buses. The [[Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation|Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation, BMTC]] operates many services using the premium Volvo<ref>{{cite web|title=Volvo Buses India|url=http://www.volvobuses.com/bus/india/en-in/buses/Volvo8400/Pages/Introduction.aspx}}</ref> 8400LE Low-floor buses. These buses are air-conditioned, and offer features such as automatic transmission, kneeling and wheel-chair ramp, typical of modern city buses. They are also fitted with LED display boards as well as ITS to announce the halts. The corporation also had tried Mercedes-Benz Low-Floor buses as well as [[Ashok Leyland]] ULE coaches, but chose to stick to the Volvo offering.\n\nIn order to keep the bus ticket prices low, the BMTC operates the majority of their services using Non-Airconditioned Semi-Low Floor (SLF) buses that have a floor height of 650mm as against the 400mm floor height of the true Low-Floor buses. These buses are from Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors, with future procurements planned to be from Eicher (VECV). These cheaper alternative to low-floor buses do not have kneeling or wheel-chair accessible ramps, but they have air suspension and use the same or better seats as those found in the Volvo buses. They also feature manual transmission as against automatic transmission\n\n====New Delhi====\n[[Image:DTC AC Bus.jpg|thumb|Low floor AC Buses in Delhi]]\nWith the introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and the development of dedicated corridors for the service, bus service is set to improve.<ref name=\"indiaexpress\">{{cite news | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/next-brt-corridor-in-east-delhi-dikshita/569663/ | title=Next BRT corridor in East Delhi: Dikshita | accessdate=26 February 2011 | author=Agency | date=20 January 2010 | newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]}}</ref> The [[Delhi Transport Corporation]] (DTC) has started introducing air-conditioned buses and brand new low-floor buses (with floor height of {{convert|400|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} and even higher on one third area as against {{convert|230|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} available internationally) on city streets to replace the conventional buses.<ref name=\"the hindu \">{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/25/stories/2007092555040400.htm | title=First new low-floor bus for DTC arrives | accessdate=26 February 2011 | author=Bhatnagar, Gaurav Vivek | date=25 September 2007 | newspaper=[[The Hindu]]}}</ref> A revamp plan is underway to improve bus-shelters in the city and to integrate GPS systems in DTC buses and bus stops so as to provide reliable information about bus arrivals.

Recently air-conditioned buses have been introduced by the WBSTC. These buses connects places like the [[Kolkata Airport]], [[Barasat]] (Capital Town of North Suburb), [[Rajarhat|New Town]], [[Bidhannagar, Kolkata|Salt Lake]], [[Howrah]], [[Santragachi]] (a station on the Howrah-Kharagpur railway line), [[Kudgaht]] and [[Tollygunge]]. The road network in Kolkata is vast. Under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, air conditioned buses have been included as a part of travel comfort to commuters. Air-conditioned buses are operated by West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC) directly & through outsourcing. These buses are served by Tata Marcopolo Buses and Volvo Low Floor Buses. The V Series and VS series bus routes are served by the AC volvo bus and MW series are served by the Tata Marcopolo buses operated by WBSTC.

Low floor buses were rapidly introduced on high-profile routes, notably becoming a requirement for [[London Buses]] contracts. The [[Optare Solo]] introduced in 1997 marked another step change with inroads into smaller usages traditionally served by [[minibus]]es. The final phase came with low floor [[double-decker bus|double-deckers]] the [[Dennis Trident 2]] and [[Volvo B7TL]] entering the mass market, even though they were introduced after the [[Optare Spectra]].\n\nDue to the [[bus deregulation|deregulated nature]] of the public transport system in the UK, adoption of the higher cost low floor buses was usually in conjunction with some sort of grant or quality partnership with a [[local authority]], as the profitability of many routes was not high enough to justify conversion based purely on increased revenue. It has been reported however that adoption of so-called ''Easy Access'' buses does have a positive effect of ridership and revenue levels.\n\nUnder the [[Transport Act 1985]] the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131106010255/http://dptac.independent.gov.uk/ Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee] (DPTAC) (or commonly DiPTAC) was established to provide independent consultation on accessibility issues.<ref>[http://www.dptac.gov.uk/dptacint.htm UK government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807124315/http://www.dptac.gov.uk/dptacint.htm |date=7 August 2008 }}</ref> In the same year, the first low floor bus specification was drafted by DPTAC. The [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] provided for the completion of the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000,<ref>[http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/buses/pubs/psvar/accessibilityregulations20005993?page=1#a1000 Transport for you]</ref> which specified that all new public service vehicles over 22 seats should be low floor from 31 December 2000, with smaller vehicles mandated from 1 January 2005. The 2000 regulations do not require retro-fitting of pre-existing vehicles or the enforced sale of non-compliant existing vehicles, allowing operators to retain a high floor vehicle until \"the end of their economic life\". In reality, as the prevalence of low floor buses spreads, combined with grants/incentives, it is likely that the prevalence of high floor vehicles in the national fleet will markedly reduce before all buses were de-registered by 27 October 2014. In the past, in times of reduced economic investment, it was not uncommon for service buses to be used for 15 to 20 years.\n\nWhile some [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]] have been produced with a small front low floor section at the driver's level, most coaches in the UK are being made accessible through the use of [[wheelchair lift]]s, with the 2005 [[Caetano Levante]] being one of the largest introductions.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4422482.stm BBC]</ref>\n\nWhile another widely stated benefit of low floor buses is quicker boarding for able-bodied passengers due to the lack of steps, studies have found the opposite effect in the UK. This is apparently due to the prevailing system of operation where passengers enter and exit through one single front door. It has been suggested that the previous 1980s/90s high floor step entrance buses which featured a centre rail, encouraged a bi-directional flow of entering and exiting passengers simultaneously. The removal of the pole to allow wheelchair/buggy access created the situation where the quintessentially polite British bus passenger would wait for all passengers to alight before boarding, leading to an increase in [[on-time performance|dwell times]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==North America==\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Community Transit 9165 (1999 NFI D40LF) at Aurora Village TC.jpg|thumb|1999 [[New Flyer D40LF]] in the [[Aurora Village]] Transit Center in [[Shoreline]] in June 2010.]]\nIn the United States, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] is credited with motivating the development of low-floor buses.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tsyn02.pdf |title=Low-Floor Transit Buses: A Synthesis of Transit Practice |author=King, Rolland D. |date=1994 |isbn=0-309-05321-8 |publisher=Transportation Research Board |accessdate=12 December 2018}}</ref> The first low-floor (low-entry) buses to be delivered were the [[New Flyer Low Floor]] D40LF, to the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] in 1991.

Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet.

He is the son of a goldsmith and went to school in Germany. In 1892, he decided to go to University of Berlin where he enrolled in theology but he studied\u00a0other subjects.

In his book, ''The'' ''Psychology of the Other'', he argues that psychology should focus on behaviour instead of the mind.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Esper|first=Erwin A.|date=1966|title=Max Meyer: The making of a scientific isolate|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|volume=2|issue=4|pages=341\u2013356|doi=10.1002/1520-6696(196610)2:4<341::aid-jhbs2300020408>3.0.co;2-d|issn=0022-5061}}</ref> Meyer did not deny the existence of consciousness like the other behaviourists at that time, he was simply against the utilization of introspection as a scientific tool.<ref name=\":1\" /> His reasoning behind this was that it was not necessary to study the mind to understand human behaviour.<ref name=\":1\" /> We just needed to study the nervous law which oversees human behaviour to understand behaviour.<ref name=\":1\" />\u00a0Later in life Meyer taught courses about esthetics as they had captured his attention during his undergrad .  He went on to publish two journal articles about the topic.<ref name=\":1\" /> Meyer's lab contributed to the behaviouralist zeitgeist. His work studies in the nervous system and behaviour arrived at John B. Watson insight, the father of behaviourism. Meyer published important monographs, textbooks and journal articles in both music and psychology.\n\n===Language===\n\nMeyer also contributed to the field of language. He contends that kids learn speech sounds through impersonation.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=A history of psycholinguistics : the pre-Chomskyan era|last=Levelt, W. J. M. (Willem J. M.), 1938- auteur.|isbn=9780198712213|oclc=905886412}}</ref> At first, audial speech sounds are a reflex in the young. They hear a sound and react by shaping a comparable sound.<ref name=\":2\" /> After some time, this impersonation stops.<ref name=\":2\" /> Acquiring speech sounds is dependent on whether or not making a similar sound is valuable to an individual or not.<ref name=\":2\" /> This loss of reflex is the reason why people cannot learn new dialects easily.<ref name=\":2\" /> In his book, fitting into the silent words, he talks about this stenograph system which he has created based on phonetics.<ref name=\":2\" /> He argues that it\u2019s effective in deaf people for oral education. To backed up his argument, he presented longitudinal studies he fif using his system in deaf people.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Music theory===\n\nMeyer started developing his work during the year 1894 at the university of Berlin when he became a pupil to Carl Stumpf. During his time as a pupil, he was described as having a technical ingenuity that assisted Meyer in developing instruments to research music theory.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Esper|first=Erwin|title=Max Meyer and the Psychology of Music|journal=Journal of Music Theory|volume=10|issue=2|pages=182\u2013199|jstor=843241|year=1966|doi=10.2307/843241}}</ref> During his years studying under Stumpf, he developed his theory of cochlear function. His main source of data was \"introspective observations of difference tones, of the relative intensities of tones in a compound tone, and of the differences in relative intensity of tones sounded simultaneously and separately\u201d.<ref name=\":02\" /> From this theory, he developed a hypothesis about \"the anatomical and physiological properties of the ear\" where the assumption was that \"the inner ear is a hydraulic system, that the effective cochlear oscillations occur in the basilar membrane, that this membrane is inelastic, and that its motions passively follow the motions of the stapes\".<ref name=\":02\" /> This received little attention until the year 1966.\n\nAfter having a falling out with Stumpf, he migrated to London and spent time in the psychological lab of James Sully at the University of London for 6 months. Here he worked on developing an apparatus where a deaf person could even compose, as well as worked on a theory of harmony.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Max F.|date=|title=\u00dcber Beurtheilung zusammengesetzter Kl\u00e4nge|url=|journal=Zeitschrift fuir Psychologie und Physiologie der Sinnesorgane|volume=20|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nMeyer then travelled to America and spend time at Clark University and later the University of Missouri.

Since some quartertones were also present in Oriental music, he used these findings to support the theory that the psychological laws of music are the same all over the world, even though a good amount of this study relied on his own interpretation of certain results.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\nSome of his final works included trying to develop tests that measured a variety of factors as well as trying to find a scientific music staff that would not require musical signs (ex. flats), but these results were never published.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also developed the musical arithmetic in 1929, which discusses the neurological implications of music perception, but this lacked reference to previous literature.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nFrom 1932 till 1940, Meyer lived in Miami where he continued his research and had a divorce in 1936. He later moved to Virginia and lived with his daughter until his death in 1967.

He was then finally appointed as a faculty member in 1900 at the University of Missouri.<ref name=\":01\">{{cite web |last1=Geen |first1=Russell G |title=Max Meyer and the Psychology Department at the University of Missouri. 1900-1930 |url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/55687/MeyerPsych1900-30.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |publisher=University of Missouri Columbia}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nMeyer was the first-ever Psychology Professor hired by the University of Missouri.<ref name=\":01\" /> He opened the laboratory in experimental psychology and taught an extensive range of psychology courses during his professorship which included: Introduction to Psychology, Perception and Behaviour, Differential Psychology, General Aesthetics, Theory of Music, Advanced Psychology, Comparative Psychology, Social Psychology, Industrial Psychology and Abnormal Psychology.<ref name=\":01\" /> As of 2019, Meyer has 209 publications in three languages circulating in 2,439 library holdings around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n88127773/|title=Meyer, Max F. (Max Friedrich) 1873-1967.|last=|first=|date=2019|website=OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Behaviourism===\nMeyer was an early advocate of behaviourism in America. In his book, ''The'' ''Psychology of the Other'', he argues that psychology should focus on behaviour instead of the mind.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Esper|first=Erwin A.|date=1966|title=Max Meyer: The making of a scientific isolate|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|volume=2|issue=4|pages=341\u2013356|doi=10.1002/1520-6696(196610)2:4<341::aid-jhbs2300020408>3.0.co;2-d|issn=0022-5061}}</ref> Meyer did not deny the existence of consciousness like the other behaviourists at that time, he was simply against the utilization of introspection as a scientific tool.<ref name=\":1\" /> His reasoning behind this was that it was not necessary to study the mind to understand human behaviour.<ref name=\":1\" /> We just needed to study the nervous law which oversees human behaviour to understand behaviour.<ref name=\":1\" />\u00a0Later in life Meyer taught courses about esthetics as they had captured his attention during his undergrad .  He went on to publish two journal articles about the topic.<ref name=\":1\" /> Meyer's lab contributed to the behaviouralist zeitgeist. His work studies in the nervous system and behaviour arrived at John B. Watson insight, the father of behaviourism. Meyer published important monographs, textbooks and journal articles in both music and psychology.\n\n===Language===\n\nMeyer also contributed to the field of language. He contends that kids learn speech sounds through impersonation.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=A history of psycholinguistics : the pre-Chomskyan era|last=Levelt, W. J. M. (Willem J. M.), 1938- auteur.|isbn=9780198712213|oclc=905886412}}</ref> At first, audial speech sounds are a reflex in the young. They hear a sound and react by shaping a comparable sound.<ref name=\":2\" /> After some time, this impersonation stops.<ref name=\":2\" /> Acquiring speech sounds is dependent on whether or not making a similar sound is valuable to an individual or not.<ref name=\":2\" /> This loss of reflex is the reason why people cannot learn new dialects easily.<ref name=\":2\" /> In his book, fitting into the silent words, he talks about this stenograph system which he has created based on phonetics.<ref name=\":2\" /> He argues that it\u2019s effective in deaf people for oral education. To backed up his argument, he presented longitudinal studies he fif using his system in deaf people.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Music theory===\n\nMeyer started developing his work during the year 1894 at the university of Berlin when he became a pupil to Carl Stumpf. During his time as a pupil, he was described as having a technical ingenuity that assisted Meyer in developing instruments to research music theory.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Esper|first=Erwin|title=Max Meyer and the Psychology of Music|journal=Journal of Music Theory|volume=10|issue=2|pages=182\u2013199|jstor=843241|year=1966|doi=10.2307/843241}}</ref> During his years studying under Stumpf, he developed his theory of cochlear function. His main source of data was \"introspective observations of difference tones, of the relative intensities of tones in a compound tone, and of the differences in relative intensity of tones sounded simultaneously and separately\u201d.<ref name=\":02\" /> From this theory, he developed a hypothesis about \"the anatomical and physiological properties of the ear\" where the assumption was that \"the inner ear is a hydraulic system, that the effective cochlear oscillations occur in the basilar membrane, that this membrane is inelastic, and that its motions passively follow the motions of the stapes\".<ref name=\":02\" /> This received little attention until the year 1966.\n\nAfter having a falling out with Stumpf, he migrated to London and spent time in the psychological lab of James Sully at the University of London for 6 months. Here he worked on developing an apparatus where a deaf person could even compose, as well as worked on a theory of harmony.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Max F.|date=|title=\u00dcber Beurtheilung zusammengesetzter Kl\u00e4nge|url=|journal=Zeitschrift fuir Psychologie und Physiologie der Sinnesorgane|volume=20|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nMeyer then travelled to America and spend time at Clark University and later the University of Missouri. Here he published a series of articles, one of them about an experiment he conducted back in Berlin which favoured the view that memory of absolute pitch can be improved with practice.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Max F.|date=|title=Is the Memory of Absolute Pitch Capable of Development by Training?|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=6|pages=|via=}}</ref> This time was also very important as he published his first edition of his theory of music. In this first edition, he critiqued his predecessor Stumpf, as well as Hermann von Hemholtz, saying how the focus of the diatonic scale prevented them from developing a scientific, empirical theory of music.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Max F.|date=|title=Elements of Psychological Theory of Melody|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=7|pages=|via=}}</ref> He also constructed a scale \"represented by the infinite series of all composites of the powers of 2, 3, 5, and 7\", which he believed was sufficient to study music theory.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> He extended his theory of music during his first year at Missouri, adding that the hearing of simultaneous tones contain two important effects: \"the melodic relationship also heard in successive tones, and consonance\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Max F.|date=|title=Contributions to a Psychological Theory of Music|url=|journal=University of Missouri Studies|volume=1|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Meyer conducted a study related to \"the aesthetic effects of final tones, the intonation of musical intervals, and quartertone music\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Max F.|date=|title=Experimental Studies in the Psychology of Music|url=|journal=American Journal of Psychology|volume=14|pages=|via=}}</ref> The findings of the study found that quatertone music in European music became more pleasant with increased familiarity (as long as it followed the \u201cgeneral laws of European music\u201d). Since some quartertones were also present in Oriental music, he used these findings to support the theory that the psychological laws of music are the same all over the world, even though a good amount of this study relied on his own interpretation of certain results.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\nSome of his final works included trying to develop tests that measured a variety of factors as well as trying to find a scientific music staff that would not require musical signs (ex. flats), but these results were never published.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also developed the musical arithmetic in 1929, which discusses the neurological implications of music perception, but this lacked reference to previous literature.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nFrom 1932 till 1940, Meyer lived in Miami where he continued his research and had a divorce in 1936. He later moved to Virginia and lived with his daughter until his death in 1967. The laboratory started by Meyer during 1930 would later become the Department of Psychology at the University of Missouri. His house is still preserved.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |last1=Geen |first1=Russell G |title=Max Meyer and the Psychology Department at the University of Missouri. 1900-1930 |url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/55687/MeyerPsych1900-30.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |publisher=University of Missouri Columbia}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal | author = A.J.
