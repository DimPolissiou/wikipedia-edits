The fair, visited by nearly 50 million, displayed many technological innovations, including the [[Grande Roue de Paris]] [[Ferris wheel]], the moving sidewalk, [[diesel engine]]s, [[Sound film|talking films]], [[escalator]]s, and the [[telegraphone]] (the first magnetic audio recorder). It also brought international attention to the [[Art Nouveau]] style. Additionally, it showcased France as a major [[Colonialism|colonial]] power through numerous pavilions built on the hill of the Trocadero Palace. Major structures remaining from the Exposition include the [[Grand Palais]], the [[Petit Palais]], the [[Pont Alexandre III]], the [[Gare d'Orsay]] railroad station (now the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]) and two of original entrances of [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] stations by [[Hector Guimard]].\n\n==Organization==\nThe first international exposition was held in London in 1851. The French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] attended and was deeply impressed. He commissioned the first [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1855]]. Its purpose was to promote French commerce, technology and culture. It was followed by another in 1867, and, after the Emperor's downfall in 1870, another in 1878, celebrating national unity after the defeat of the [[Paris Commune]], and then in 1889, celebrating the centennial of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>Ageorges, Sylvain, ''Sur les traces des Exposition universelles'' (2006) pp. 12-15</ref><ref name = \"Allwood\">Allwood, John (1977), ''The Great Exhibitions'', Great Britain: Cassell & Collier Macmillan Publishers, pp. 7\u2013107.{{Page range too broad|date=April 2020}}</ref> Planning for the 1900 Exposition began in 1892, under President [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Carnot]]. Three French Presidents and ten Ministers of Commerce held office before it was completed. President Carnot died shortly before it was completed. Though many of the buildings were not finished, the Exposition Was opened on April 14, 1900 by President [[\u00c9mile Loubet]].<ref>Mabire, Jean Christophe (2000) pg. 31</ref><ref name = \"Allwood\" />\n\n==The Site and participants==\nThe site of the Exposition covered 112 hectares along the Left and Right Banks of the Seine from the [[Eiffel Tower]] (built for the 1889 Exposition) and [[Champ de Mars]] to the Esplanade of [[Les Invalides]]. It also included the [[Grand Palais]] and [[Petit Palais]] on the right bank. An additional section of 104 hectares for agricultural exhibits and other structures was built in the [[Bois de Vincennes]]. The total area of the Exposition (216 hectares) was ten times larger than the 1855 Exposition.<ref name=\"Ageorges 2006 pages 104-105\">Ageorges (2006) pages 104-105</ref>\n\nCountries from around the world were invited by France to showcase their achievements and cultures. Of the fifty-six countries invited to participate, forty accepted, plus an additional number of colonies and protectorates of France, the Netherlands, Britain, and Portugal. The United States, Germany, China, Siam, Japan, Mexico, Russia, and the [[South African Republic]] all had pavilions.<ref name=\"Ageorges 2006 pages 104-105\"/>\n\nThe Exposition buildings were meant to be temporary; they were built on iron frames covered with plaster and [[staff (building material)|staff]], a kind of inexpensive artificial stone. Many of the buildings were unfinished when the Exposition opened, and most were demolished immediately after it closed.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Vue panoramique de l'exposition universelle de 1900.jpg|Aerial view of the Exposition Universelle\nFile:Paris Exposition, map in 1900.jpg|Map of the main exposition sites Exposition\n</gallery>\n\n==Major attractions==\n\n===The Porte Monumental===\nThe Porte Monumental de Paris, located on the [[Place de la Concorde]], was the main entrance of the Exposition. The architect was [[Ren\u00e9 Binet (architect)|Ren\u00e9 Binet]]. It was composed of towering polychrome ceramic decoration in Byzantine motifs,  crowned by a statue 6.5 meters high called ''La Parisienne''. Unlike classical statues, she was dressed in modern Paris fashion. Below the statue was a sculptural prow of a boat, the symbol of Paris, and friezes depicting the workers who built the Exposition. The central arch was flanked by two slender, candle-like towers, resembling minarets. The gateway was brightly illuminated at night by 3,200 light bulbs and an additional forty arc lamps.  Forty thousand visitors an hour could pass beneath the arch to approach the twenty-six ticket booths.<ref>Ageorges, Sylvan. ''Sur les traces des Expositions Universelles'' (2004), pg. 238</ref><ref name = \"Jullian\">Jullian, Philipe (1974), ''The Triumph of Art Nouveau: Paris Exhibition 1900'', New York, New York: Larousse & Co, pp. 38\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe Gateway, like the Exposition buildings, was intended to be temporary, and was demolished as soon as the Exposition was finished. The ceramic frieze depicting the workers of the Exposition was preserved by the head of the ceramics firm that made it, \u00c9mile M\u00fcller, and moved to what is now Parc M\u00fcller in the town of [[Breuillet, Essonne]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Grand entrance, Exposition Universal, 1900, Paris, France.jpg|Porte Monumentale on the [[Place de la Concorde]]\nFile:S03 06 01 015 image 9905.jpg|Detail of the Porte Monumental entrance\n</gallery>\n\n===The Pont Alexander III===\nThe [[Pont Alexandre III]] was an essential link of the Exposition, connecting the pavilions and palaces on the Left and Right Banks of the Seine. It was named for Czar [[Alexander III of Russia]], who had died in 1894, and celebrated the recent alliance between France and Russia. The foundation stone was laid by his son, Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1896, and the bridge was finished in 1900. It was the work of engineers Jean Resal and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e D'Alby and architect Gaston Cousin. The widest and longest of the Paris bridges at the time, it was constructed on a single arch of steel 108 meters long. Though it was named after the Russian Czar, the themes of the decoration almost entirely French. At the ends of the bridge, it was supported by four massive stone pylons 13 meters high, decorated with statues of the ''Renom\u00e9es'' (The Renowned), female figures with trumpets, and gilded statues of the horse [[Pegasus]].  At the base of the pedastals are allegorical statues representing the France of Charlemagne, the France of the Renaissance, the France of Louis XIV and France in 1900.<ref>Ageorges (2006) pg. 118</ref>  The Russian element was in the center, with statuary of the Nymphs of the [[Neva River]] holding a gilded seal of the Russian Empire. At the same time that the Pont Alexander III was built, a similar bridge, the [[Trinity Bridge, Saint Petersburg|Trinity Bridge]] was built in Saint-Petersburg, and was dedicated to French-Russian Friendship by French President [[F\u00e9lix Faure]]. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Perspective du Pont Alexandre III et de l'esplanade des Invalides.jpg|View of the Pont Alexandre III toward Les Invalides (1900)\nFile:Pont Alexandre III.jpg|The [[Pont Alexandre III]] with the Grand Palais in the background\nFile:Exposition universelle, 1900 - the chefs-d'uvre (1900) (14597665097).jpg|View of the Exposition from the Pont Alexandre III\n</gallery>\n\n===The Palace of Electricity and the Water Castle===\nThe Palace of Electricity and the adjoining Water Castle (''Chateau d'Eau'') designed by architects Eug\u00e8ne H\u00e9nard and [[Edmond Paulin]],<ref name = \"Jullian\" /> were among the most popular sights.  The Palace of Electricity was built partly incorporating architectural elements of the old Palace of the Champ de Mars from the 1889 Exposition.The Palace was enormous, 420 meters long and 60 meters wide, and its form suggested a giant peacock spreading its tail.  The central tower was crowned by an enormous illuminated star and a chariot carrying a statue of the Spirit of Electricity 6.5 meters high, holding aloft a torch powered by 50,000 volts of electricity, provided by the steam engines and generators inside the Palace.  Producing the light for the Exposition consumed 200,000 kilograms of oil an hour.<ref name=\"Mabire 2000, pg. 116\">Mabire (2000), pg. 116</ref> The facade of the Palace and the Water Castle, across from it, were lit by an additional 7,200 incandescent lamps and seventeen arc lamps.<ref>Ageorges (2006) pg. 110</ref><ref name = \"Jullian\" />  Visitors could go inside to see the steam-powered generators which provided electricity for the buildings of the Exposition.<ref name = \"Jullian\" /><ref name = \"Allwood\" />\nThe Water castle, facing the Palace of Electricity, had an equally imposing appearance.  It had two large domes, between which was a gigantic fountain, circulating one hundred thousand liters of water a minute.  Thanks to the power from Palace of Electricity, the fountain was illuminated at night by continually changing colored lights.<ref name=\"Mabire 2000, pg. 116\"/>  The architects of the ensemble were Eug\u00e8ne H\u00e9nard and [[Edmond Paulin]].\n\nThe [[Galerie des machines|Gallery of Machines]], on the Left Bank, was another major exhibition building, dedicated to displaying the advances in industrial technology at the end of the century.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Paris Exposition Palace of Electricity, Paris, France, 1900 n2.jpg|The Palace of Electricity (behind) and the Water Castle (in front)\n</gallery>\n\n===The Palace of Optics, the Aquarium, and Motion Pictures===\nTwenty-one of the thirty-three official pavilions were devoted to technology and the sciences.  Among the most popular was the Palace of Optics,  whose main attractions included the [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900|Great Paris Exposition Telescope]],  which enlarged the image of the moon ten thousand times.  The image was projected on a screen 144 square meters in size, in a hall which seated two thousand visitors. This telescope was the largest [[refracting telescope]] at that time. The optical tube assembly was 60 meters long and 1.5 meters in diameter, and was fixed in place due to its mass. Light from the sky was sent into the tube by a movable 2-meter mirror.\n\nAnother very popular feature of the Palace of Optics was the giant [[kaleidoscope]], which attracted three million visitors.  Other features of the optics pavilion included demonstrations of X-rays and dancers performing in [[phosphorescent]] costumes.\n\nThe Palais des Illusions (Palace of Illusions), attached to the Palace of Optics, was an extremely popular exhibition.  It was a large hall which used mirrors and electric lighting to create a show of colorful and bizarre optical illusions.  It was preserved after the Exposition in the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]]<ref>Mabire (2000) pg. 89</ref>\n\nAnother scientific attraction was the aquarium, the largest in the world at the time, viewed from an underground gallery 722 meters long. The water tanks were each 38 meters long, eighteen meters wide and 6.5 meters deep, and contained a wide selection of exotic marine life.\n\nThe [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]], who had made the first public projections of a motion picture in 1895, presented their films on a colossal screen, twenty-one meters by sixteen meters, in the Gallery of Machines. Another innovation in motion pictures was presented at the Exposition at the Phono-Cin\u00e9 Theater;  a primitive talking motion picture, where the image on the screen was synchronized to the sound from phonographs.<ref name=\"Ageorges 2006 pg. 110-111\">Ageorges (2006) pg. 110-111</ref>\n\nAn even more ambitious experiment in motion pictures was the ''[[Cin\u00e9orama]]'' of Raoul Grimoin Sanson,  which simulated a voyage in a balloon. The film, projected on a circular screen 93 meters in circumference by ten synchronized projectors, depicted a landscape passing below. The spectators sat in the center above the projectors, in what resembled the basket suspended beneath a large balloon.<ref name=\"Ageorges 2006 pg. 110-111\"/>\n\nAnother popular attraction was the ''[[Mareorama]]'', which simulated a voyage by ship from Villefranche to Constantinople.  The viewers stood on the railing of a ship simulator, watching painted images pass by of the cities and seascapes en route. The illusion was aided by machinery that rocked the ship,  and fans which blew gusts of wind.<ref>Ageorges (2006) pg. 112</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Paris Exposition Palace of Optics, Paris, France, 1900.jpg|Entrance of the Palace of Optics\nFile:Great Ex Telescope Design.jpg|Diagram of the [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900]]\nFile:Cineorama.jpg|The Cin\u00e9orama, a simulated voyage in a balloon with motion pictures projected on a circular screen.\nFile:Mareorama (Scientific American).jpg|The Mareorama simulated a sea voyage, complete with rocking ship and unrolling painted scenery.\nFile:Le palais des illusions, Exposition Universelle 1900 B.jpg|The Palais des Illusions created a show of optical illusions with mirrors and lighting effects.\n</gallery>\n\n===The Grande Roue de Chicago and the moving sidewalk===\nThe ''Grande Roue de Chicago'' was a very popular attraction.  It was a gigantic [[ferris wheel]] 110 meters high, which took its name from a similar wheel created by [[George Washington Gale Ferris Jr.]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago. It and could carry 1600 passengers in its forty cars in a single voyage. The cost of a ride was one franc for a second class car, and two francs for a more spacious first-class car.  Despite the high price, passengers often had to wait an hour for a place.<ref>Mabire (2000) pg. 86</ref>\n\nThe moving sidewalk was a very popular and useful attraction, given the large size of the Exposition. It ran along the edge of the Exposition, from the Esplanade of [[Les Invalides]] to the [[Champ de Mars]], passing through stations along the way, where passengers could board. The fare was an average of fifty centimes. The sidewalk was accessed from a platform six meters above the ground level.  The passengers stepped from the platform onto the moving sidewalk traveling at a little more than four kilometers an hour, then onto a more rapid sidewalk moving at 8.5 kilometers an hour. The sidewalks had posts with handles which passengers could hold onto, or they could walk.<ref>Mabire (2000) pp. 87-89</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:La grande roue, Paris, France, ca. 1890-1900.jpg|The Grande Roue de Chicago at the Paris Exposition could carry 1600 passengers at once\nFile:Paris Exposition moving sidewalk, Paris, France, 1900 - S03 06 01 015 image 2011.jpg|The moving sidewalk of the Exposition\nFile:Plateforme mobile, station du pont des Invalides.jpg|Station of the Moving sidewalk at Les Invalides.\n</gallery>\n\n===The Globe C\u00e9leste===\nThe [[Globe C\u00e9leste]] was an immense globe-shaped [[planetarium]] which offered a presentation on the night sky.  The globe was forty-five meters in diameter, and the blue and gold exterior was painted with the constellations and the signs of the [[zodiac]]. It was placed atop a masonry support eighteen meters high, supported by four columns. A flower garden on the support surrounded the globe. Spectators seated in armchairs inside watched a presentation on the stars and planets projected overhead.  The sphere was the scene of a fatal accident on April 29, 1900 when one of access ramps, hastily made of a newly-introduced material, [[reinforced concrete]],  collapsed onto the street below, killing nine persons. Following the accident the French government established the first regulations for the use of reinforced concrete. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tour Eiffel et le Globe C\u00e9leste.jpg|The [[Globe C\u00e9leste]] with the Eiffel Tower\nFile:Suchard - Globe c\u00e9leste.jpg|The Globe C\u00e9leste was featured in an advertisement for Suchard Chocolate\n</gallery>\n\n===The Grand Palais and Petit Palais===\nThe [[Grand Palais]], on the right bank, officially the ''Grand Palais des beaux-arts et des arts decoratifs'', was built upon the site of the Palace of Industry of the 1855 Exposition.  It was the work of two architects, [[Henri Deglane]] for the main body of the building, and Albert Thomas for the portion which now is the [[Palais de la D\u00e9couverte]], or science museum. [[Charles Girault]] designed the [[Petit Palais]] facing the Grand Palais.  The iron frame of the Grand Palais was quite modern for its time; It appeared light, but in fact it used used nine thousand tons of metal, compared with seven thousand for the construction of the [[Eiffel Tower]].<ref>Ageorges (2006) pp. 113-114</ref>   The interior served as a setting for exhibits of painting and particularly sculpture.<ref name = \"Jullian\" />  The facade was in the ornate [[Beaux-Arts style]] or [[Neo-baroque|Neo-Baroque]] style,  The more modern interior iron ramework, huge skylights and stairways offered decorative elements in the new [[Art Nouveau]] style,<ref name = \"Jullian\" /> particularly in the railings of the staircase, which were intricately woven in fluid, organic forms.<ref name = \"Allwood\" />\n\nThe [[Petit Palais]] , was constructed by the architect Giraud.<ref name = \"Jullian\"/> for the exhibition of French art.<ref name = \"Jullian\" /> Much like the Grand Palais, the facade is Beaux-Arts and Neo-Baroque, reminiscent of the Grand Trianon and the stable at Chantilly.<ref name = \"Jullian\" /> while the interior offers examples of Art Nouveau, particularly in the railings of the curving stairways, the tiles of the floors, the stained glass, and the murals on the ceiling of the arcade around the garden.<ref name = \"Jullian\"/>  The entrance murals were painted by Albert Besnard and Paul Albert Laurens.<ref name = \"Jullian\"/> \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nExposition universelle, 1900 - the chefs-d'uvre (1900) (14784195265).jpg|Interior of the [[Grand Palais]], with its Art Nouveau iron stairway\nFile:Stairs @ Petit Palais @ Paris (34892352515).jpg|Art Nouveau stairway of the [[Petit Palais]]\nFile:Exposition universelle, 1900 - the chefs-d'uvre (1900) (14597670517).jpg|Courtyard of the [[Petit Palais]] (1900)\n</gallery>\n\n==National Pavilions==\n\nFifty-six countries were invited to have pavilions at the Exposition, and forty accepted. The Rue des Nations was created along the banks of the Seine between the esplanade of [[Les Invalides]] and the [[Champ de Mars]] for the pavilions of the larger countries. Each country paid for its own pavilion. The pavilions were all temporary, made of plaster and ''staff'' on a metal frame.  Nearly all were designed in the national architecture of each country, often imitating famous national monuments, The Russian pavilion was inspired by the towers of the Kremlin. \n<ref name = \"Allwood\"  /> \nThe Pavilion of Turkey was one of the largest, covering 4000 square meters on the rue des Nations. It was designed by a French architect, Dubuisson, and was a mixture of copies of Islamic architecture from mosques in Istanbul and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Ageorges (2006) pg. 123</ref>\nThe British Royalty pavilion, one of the largest, consisted of a mock-Jacobean mansion decorated with pictures and furniture, constructed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. It was largely used for receptions for important visitors to the Exposition.<ref name = \"Allwood\"  />\n\nThe German Pavilion was the tallest, at 76 meters, built of wood and stained glass.  However,most of the German presence at the Exposition was in the commercial pavilions, where they had important displays of German technology and machinery, as well as models of German steamships and a scale model of a German lighthouse.<ref name = \"Allwood\" />\n\nThe United States pavilion was also modest, a variation on the United States Capitol Building:  the main U.S. presence was in the commercial and industrial palaces.  One unusual aspect of the U.S. presence was [[The Exhibit of American Negroes]], a joint project of [[Daniel Alexander Payne Murray|Daniel Murray]], the Assistant Librarian of Congress, [[Thomas J. Calloway]], a lawyer and the primary organizer of the exhibit, and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. The goal of the exhibition was to demonstrate progress and commemorate the lives of [[African American]]s at the turn of the century.<ref name=Lewis24-49>[[David Levering Lewis]], \"A Small Nation of People: W.E.B.

This Pavilion suffered some disruption in August 1900, when anti-western rebels in Beijing seized the European delegations in Beijing in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]  and held them for several weeks until a British-led expeditionary force arrived and recaptured the city.

A separate thoroughfare of the Exposition, the Rue de Paris, was lined with amusements, including music vnues, a comedy theater, marionettes, American jazz, a [[Grand Guignol]] theater, and the celebrated \"Backwards House\", which had its furniture on the ceiling, its chandeliers on the floor, and windows which gave reverse images. Other diversions elsewhere in and around the Exposition included a Venetian canal with gondolas, a Japanese tea house, a street of Cairo, an orchestra from Madagascar, a Comedy Theater, and the Columbia Theater at Port Maillot, with acts ranging from panoramss of life in the Orient to a water ballet.

At the time, the average hourly wage for Paris workers was between 40 and 50 centimes.  In addition, most popular attractions charged an admission fee, usually between fifty centimes and Franc.  The average cost of a simple meal at the Exposition was 2.50 Francs, the half-day wages of a worker.<ref>Ageorges (2006), pg. 105</ref>\nThe amount budgeted for the Paris Exposition was one hundred million French Francs; twenty million from the French State, twenty million from the City of Paris, and the remaining sixty million expected to come from admissions, and backed by French banks and financial institutions.<ref name=\"Mabire 2000, pp. 51\">Mabire (2000), pp. 51</ref>\n\nThe official final cost was 119 million Francs, while the total amount actually collected from admission fees was 126 million Francs. However, there were unplanned expenses of 22 million Francs for the French State,  and 6 million Francs for the City of Paris, bringing the total cost to 147 million Francs, or a deficit of 21 million Francs.<ref name=\"Mabire 2000, pp. 51\"/>   The deficit was to a degree offset by the long-term additions to the city infrastructure;   new buildings and bridges, including the Grand and Petit Palais, the Pont Alexander III and the [[Passerelle Debilly]];  and additions to the transport system; The [[Paris M\u00e9tro]], the [[funicular railway]] on [[Montmartre]], and two new train stations, the Gare d'Orleans  (now the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]] and the [[Gare des Invalides]], and the new facade and enlargement and redecoration of the [[Gare de Lyon]] and other stations.\n[[File:FirrstPrize1900.jpg|thumb|upright 1.25|<center>Michigan Stove Company</center>]]\n\n==Medals and Awards==\nThe organizers of the Exposition were not miserly in recognizing the 83,047 exhibitors of products,  about half of whom came from France, and 7,161 from the United States.  The awards ceremony was held on August 18, 1900, and was attended by 11,500 persons. 3,156 grand prizes were handed out, 8,889 gold medals, 13,300 silver medals, 12,108 bronze medals, and 8,422 honorable mentions. Many of the participants, such as [[Campbell's Soup]], added the Paris award to the advertisements and labels of their products. Another was the [[Michigan Stove Company]].<ref>Mabire (1900) pg. 44</ref>\n\n==Art Nouveau at the Exposition==\n\nThe [[Art Nouveau]] (\"New Art\") style began to appear in Belgium and France in the 1880s and became fashionable in Europe and the United States during the 1890s.<ref name = \"Gontar\">Gontar, Cybele.

The architecture of the Exposition was largely of the [[Paris architecture of the Belle \u00c9poque|Belle Epoque style]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]], or of eclectic national styles, But Art Nouveau decoration did appear in the interiors and decoration of a many of buildings, notably the interior ironwork and decoration of the Monumental gateway of the Exposition, the [[Grand Palais]] and the [[Petit Palais]], and in the portal of the Palace of National Industries.\n\nThe Art Nouveau style was very popular in the pavilions of decorative arts. The jewelry firm of [[Fouquet]] and the glass and crystal manufactory of [[Lalique]]  all presented collections of Art Nouveau objects.<ref name=\"ArtfixDaily.com ArtGuild Members\">{{Cite web|title = ArtfixDaily.com ArtGuild Members|url = http://www.artfixdaily.com/blogs/post/1677-on-the-world-stage-s%25C3%25A8vres-world%25E2%2580%2599s-fair-vases|website = www.artfixdaily.com|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}</ref> The [[Manufacture nationale de S\u00e8vres|S\u00e8vres Porcelain Manufactory]] created a series of monumental swan vases for the Exposition, as well as the monumental entrance to the Palace of National Manufacturers.<ref name=\"ArtfixDaily.com ArtGuild Members\"/>\n\nMany Exposition posters also made use of the Art Nouveau style.  The work of the most famous Art Nouveau poster artist, [[Alfons Mucha]], had many forms at the Exposition. He designed the posters for the official Austrian participation in the Exposition, painted murals depicting scenes from the history of Bosnia as well as the menu for the restaurant at the Bosnian pavilion, and designed the menu for the official opening banquet. He produced displays for the jeweler [[Georges Fouquet]] and the perfume maker [[Houbigant Parfum|Houbigant]], with statuettes and panels of women depicting the scents of rose, orange blossom, violet and buttercup. His more serious art works, including his drawings for ''Le Pater'', were shown in the Austrian Pavilion and in the Austrian section of the [[Grand Palais]].  Some of his murals can be seen now in the [[Petit Palais]].{{Sfn|Sato|2015|page=64}}\n\nThe most famous appearance was the in the edicules, or entrance coverings, of the stations of the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] designed by [[Hector Guimard]].

They were built largely of wood, and covered with [[staff (building material)|staff]], which was formed into columns, statuary, walls, stairs. After the fair was over, the buildings were demolished and all items and materials that could be salvaged were sold or recylcled. A few of the major structures built from the Exposition were preserved, including the [[Grand Palais]] and the [[Petit Palais]], and the two major bridges, the [[Pont Alexandre III]] and the [[Passerelle Debilly]], though the latter was later dismantled and moved to a new location a few dozen meters from its original placement.<ref>Ageorges (2006) p. 130</ref>\n\n* Most of the Art Nouveau Metro Station edicules designed by [[Hector Guimard]] were removed soon after the Exposition closed, but two of the originals still exist, including one at its original location, at the [[Porte Dauphine (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Porte Dauphine station of the Paris M\u00e9tro]].\n*The monumental portal of the Palace of National Manufacturers, made by the [[S\u00e8vres Manufactory]], was preserved and moved to Square Felix-Desruelles, next to the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s]].\n* A 2.87 meter copy of the [[Statue of Liberty]] by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi]], exhibited in Paris in 1900, was placed in the [[Luxembourg Gardens]] in 1905 at the request of his widow. \n* The Japanese tower from the Exposition, along with the Chinese pavilion,  was purchased by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] and moved the [[Museums of the Far Est]] in [[Laeken]], near [[Brussels]], Belgium.\n\nOne of the most curious vestiges is [[La Ruche]], at 2 Passage de Dantzig (15h arrond.). This is a three-story building constructed entirely out of bits and pieces of Exposition buildings, purchased at auctions by sculptor [[Alfred Boucher]].  It includes substantial pieces of Exposition buildings. The iron roof, made by [[Gustave Eiffel]],  originally belonged covered the kiosk of the Wines of [[M\u00e9doc]], in the palace of agriculture and foods. The statues of women in theatrical costumes by the front door came from the Indochina Pavilion, while the ornamental iron gate at the entrance was part of the Palace of Women. In the years after the Exposition, La Ruche served as the temporary studio and home of dozens of young artists and writers spent some time living there, including [[Marc Chagall]]. [[Henri Matisse]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]] and the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. It was threatened with demolition in the 1960s, but was saved by culture minister [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]].

The exhibition lost a grand total of 82,000 francs after six months in operation. Many Parisians had invested money in shares sold to raise money for the event and therefore lost their investment. With a much larger expected turnout the exhibit sites had gone up in value. Continuing to pay rent for the sites became increasingly hard for concessionaires as they were receiving fewer customers than anticipated. The concessionaires went on strike, which ultimately resulted in the closure of a large part of the exposition. To resolve the matter, the concessionaires were given a fractional refund of the rent they had paid.<ref name = \"Allwood\" />\n\n==Criticism==\nThe Exposition had numerous critics from different points of view.

The fair, visited by nearly 50 million, displayed many technological innovations, including the [[Grande Roue de Paris]] [[Ferris wheel]], the moving sidewalk, [[diesel engine]]s, [[Sound film|talking films]], [[escalator]]s, and the [[telegraphone]] (the first magnetic audio recorder). It also brought international attention to the [[Art Nouveau]] style. Additionally, it showcased France as a major [[Colonialism|colonial]] power through numerous pavilions built on the hill of the Trocadero Palace. Major structures remaining from the Exposition include the [[Grand Palais]], the [[Petit Palais]], the [[Pont Alexandre III]], the [[Gare d'Orsay]] railroad station (now the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]) and two of original entrances of [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] stations by [[Hector Guimard]].\n\n==Organization==\nThe first international exposition was held in London in 1851. The French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] attended and was deeply impressed. He commissioned the first [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1855]]. Its purpose was to promote French commerce, technology and culture. It was followed by another in 1867, and, after the Emperor's downfall in 1870, another in 1878, celebrating national unity after the defeat of the [[Paris Commune]], and then in 1889, celebrating the centennial of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>Ageorges, Sylvain, ''Sur les traces des Exposition universelles'' (2006) pp. 12-15</ref><ref name = \"Allwood\">Allwood, John (1977), ''The Great Exhibitions'', Great Britain: Cassell & Collier Macmillan Publishers, pp. 7\u2013107.{{Page range too broad|date=April 2020}}</ref> Planning for the 1900 Exposition began in 1892, under President [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Carnot]]. Three French Presidents and ten Ministers of Commerce held office before it was completed. President Carnot died shortly before it was completed. Though many of the buildings were not finished, the Exposition Was opened on April 14, 1900 by President [[\u00c9mile Loubet]].<ref>Mabire, Jean Christophe (2000) pg. 31</ref><ref name = \"Allwood\" />\n\n==The Site and participants==\nThe site of the Exposition covered 112 hectares along the Left and Right Banks of the Seine from the [[Eiffel Tower]] (built for the 1889 Exposition) and [[Champ de Mars]] to the Esplanade of [[Les Invalides]]. It also included the [[Grand Palais]] and [[Petit Palais]] on the right bank. An additional section of 104 hectares for agricultural exhibits and other structures was built in the [[Bois de Vincennes]]. The total area of the Exposition (216 hectares) was ten times larger than the 1855 Exposition.<ref name=\"Ageorges 2006 pages 104-105\">Ageorges (2006) pages 104-105</ref>\n\nCountries from around the world were invited by France to showcase their achievements and cultures. Of the fifty-six countries invited to participate, forty accepted, plus an additional number of colonies and protectorates of France, the Netherlands, Britain, and Portugal. The United States, Germany, China, Siam, Japan, Mexico, Russia, and the [[South African Republic]] all had pavilions.<ref name=\"Ageorges 2006 pages 104-105\"/>\n\nThe Exposition buildings were meant to be temporary; they were built on iron frames covered with plaster and [[staff (building material)|staff]], a kind of inexpensive artificial stone. Many of the buildings were unfinished when the Exposition opened, and most were demolished immediately after it closed.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Vue panoramique de l'exposition universelle de 1900.jpg|Aerial view of the Exposition Universelle\nFile:Paris Exposition, map in 1900.jpg|Map of the main exposition sites Exposition\n</gallery>\n\n==Major attractions==\n\n===The Porte Monumental===\nThe Porte Monumental de Paris, located on the [[Place de la Concorde]], was the main entrance of the Exposition. The architect was [[Ren\u00e9 Binet (architect)|Ren\u00e9 Binet]]. It was composed of towering polychrome ceramic decoration in Byzantine motifs,  crowned by a statue 6.5 meters high called ''La Parisienne''. Unlike classical statues, she was dressed in modern Paris fashion. Below the statue was a sculptural prow of a boat, the symbol of Paris, and friezes depicting the workers who built the Exposition. The central arch was flanked by two slender, candle-like towers, resembling minarets. The gateway was brightly illuminated at night by 3,200 light bulbs and an additional forty arc lamps.  Forty thousand visitors an hour could pass beneath the arch to approach the twenty-six ticket booths.<ref>Ageorges, Sylvan. ''Sur les traces des Expositions Universelles'' (2004), pg. 238</ref><ref name = \"Jullian\">Jullian, Philipe (1974), ''The Triumph of Art Nouveau: Paris Exhibition 1900'', New York, New York: Larousse & Co, pp. 38\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe Gateway, like the Exposition buildings, was intended to be temporary, and was demolished as soon as the Exposition was finished. The ceramic frieze depicting the workers of the Exposition was preserved by the head of the ceramics firm that made it, \u00c9mile M\u00fcller, and moved to what is now Parc M\u00fcller in the town of [[Breuillet, Essonne]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Grand entrance, Exposition Universal, 1900, Paris, France.jpg|Porte Monumentale on the [[Place de la Concorde]]\nFile:S03 06 01 015 image 9905.jpg|Detail of the Porte Monumental entrance\n</gallery>\n\n===The Pont Alexander III===\nThe [[Pont Alexandre III]] was an essential link of the Exposition, connecting the pavilions and palaces on the Left and Right Banks of the Seine. It was named for Czar [[Alexander III of Russia]], who had died in 1894, and celebrated the recent alliance between France and Russia. The foundation stone was laid by his son, Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1896, and the bridge was finished in 1900. It was the work of engineers Jean Resal and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e D'Alby and architect Gaston Cousin. The widest and longest of the Paris bridges at the time, it was constructed on a single arch of steel 108 meters long. Though it was named after the Russian Czar, the themes of the decoration almost entirely French. At the ends of the bridge, it was supported by four massive stone pylons 13 meters high, decorated with statues of the ''Renom\u00e9es'' (The Renowned), female figures with trumpets, and gilded statues of the horse [[Pegasus]].  At the base of the pedastals are allegorical statues representing the France of Charlemagne, the France of the Renaissance, the France of Louis XIV and France in 1900.<ref>Ageorges (2006) pg. 118</ref>  The Russian element was in the center, with statuary of the Nymphs of the [[Neva River]] holding a gilded seal of the Russian Empire. At the same time that the Pont Alexander III was built, a similar bridge, the [[Trinity Bridge, Saint Petersburg|Trinity Bridge]] was built in Saint-Petersburg, and was dedicated to French-Russian Friendship by French President [[F\u00e9lix Faure]]. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Perspective du Pont Alexandre III et de l'esplanade des Invalides.jpg|View of the Pont Alexandre III toward Les Invalides (1900)\nFile:Pont Alexandre III.jpg|The [[Pont Alexandre III]] with the Grand Palais in the background\nFile:Exposition universelle, 1900 - the chefs-d'uvre (1900) (14597665097).jpg|View of the Exposition from the Pont Alexandre III\n</gallery>\n\n===The Palace of Electricity and the Water Castle===\nThe Palace of Electricity and the adjoining Water Castle (''Chateau d'Eau'') designed by architects Eug\u00e8ne H\u00e9nard and [[Edmond Paulin]],<ref name = \"Jullian\" /> were among the most popular sights.  The Palace of Electricity was built partly incorporating architectural elements of the old Palace of the Champ de Mars from the 1889 Exposition.The Palace was enormous, 420 meters long and 60 meters wide, and its form suggested a giant peacock spreading its tail.  The central tower was crowned by an enormous illuminated star and a chariot carrying a statue of the Spirit of Electricity 6.5 meters high, holding aloft a torch powered by 50,000 volts of electricity, provided by the steam engines and generators inside the Palace.  Producing the light for the Exposition consumed 200,000 kilograms of oil an hour.<ref name=\"Mabire 2000, pg. 116\">Mabire (2000), pg. 116</ref> The facade of the Palace and the Water Castle, across from it, were lit by an additional 7,200 incandescent lamps and seventeen arc lamps.<ref>Ageorges (2006) pg. 110</ref><ref name = \"Jullian\" />  Visitors could go inside to see the steam-powered generators which provided electricity for the buildings of the Exposition.<ref name = \"Jullian\" /><ref name = \"Allwood\" />\nThe Water castle, facing the Palace of Electricity, had an equally imposing appearance.  It had two large domes, between which was a gigantic fountain, circulating one hundred thousand liters of water a minute.  Thanks to the power from Palace of Electricity, the fountain was illuminated at night by continually changing colored lights.<ref name=\"Mabire 2000, pg. 116\"/>  The architects of the ensemble were Eug\u00e8ne H\u00e9nard and [[Edmond Paulin]].\n\nThe [[Galerie des machines|Gallery of Machines]], on the Left Bank, was another major exhibition building, dedicated to displaying the advances in industrial technology at the end of the century.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Paris Exposition Palace of Electricity, Paris, France, 1900 n2.jpg|The Palace of Electricity (behind) and the Water Castle (in front)\n</gallery>\n\n===The Palace of Optics, the Aquarium, and Motion Pictures===\nTwenty-one of the thirty-three official pavilions were devoted to technology and the sciences.  Among the most popular was the Palace of Optics,  whose main attractions included the [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900|Great Paris Exposition Telescope]],  which enlarged the image of the moon ten thousand times.  The image was projected on a screen 144 square meters in size, in a hall which seated two thousand visitors. This telescope was the largest [[refracting telescope]] at that time. The optical tube assembly was 60 meters long and 1.5 meters in diameter, and was fixed in place due to its mass. Light from the sky was sent into the tube by a movable 2-meter mirror.\n\nAnother very popular feature of the Palace of Optics was the giant [[kaleidoscope]], which attracted three million visitors.  Other features of the optics pavilion included demonstrations of X-rays and dancers performing in [[phosphorescent]] costumes.\n\nThe Palais des Illusions (Palace of Illusions), attached to the Palace of Optics, was an extremely popular exhibition.  It was a large hall which used mirrors and electric lighting to create a show of colorful and bizarre optical illusions.  It was preserved after the Exposition in the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]]<ref>Mabire (2000) pg. 89</ref>\n\nAnother scientific attraction was the aquarium, the largest in the world at the time, viewed from an underground gallery 722 meters long. The water tanks were each 38 meters long, eighteen meters wide and 6.5 meters deep, and contained a wide selection of exotic marine life.\n\nThe [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]], who had made the first public projections of a motion picture in 1895, presented their films on a colossal screen, twenty-one meters by sixteen meters, in the Gallery of Machines. Another innovation in motion pictures was presented at the Exposition at the Phono-Cin\u00e9 Theater;  a primitive talking motion picture, where the image on the screen was synchronized to the sound from phonographs.<ref name=\"Ageorges 2006 pg. 110-111\">Ageorges (2006) pg. 110-111</ref>\n\nAn even more ambitious experiment in motion pictures was the ''[[Cin\u00e9orama]]'' of Raoul Grimoin Sanson,  which simulated a voyage in a balloon. The film, projected on a circular screen 93 meters in circumference by ten synchronized projectors, depicted a landscape passing below. The spectators sat in the center above the projectors, in what resembled the basket suspended beneath a large balloon.<ref name=\"Ageorges 2006 pg. 110-111\"/>\n\nAnother popular attraction was the ''[[Mareorama]]'', which simulated a voyage by ship from Villefranche to Constantinople.  The viewers stood on the railing of a ship simulator, watching painted images pass by of the cities and seascapes en route. The illusion was aided by machinery that rocked the ship,  and fans which blew gusts of wind.<ref>Ageorges (2006) pg. 112</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Paris Exposition Palace of Optics, Paris, France, 1900.jpg|Entrance of the Palace of Optics\nFile:Great Ex Telescope Design.jpg|Diagram of the [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900]]\nFile:Cineorama.jpg|The Cin\u00e9orama, a simulated voyage in a balloon with motion pictures projected on a circular screen.\nFile:Mareorama (Scientific American).jpg|The Mareorama simulated a sea voyage, complete with rocking ship and unrolling painted scenery.\nFile:Le palais des illusions, Exposition Universelle 1900 B.jpg|The Palais des Illusions created a show of optical illusions with mirrors and lighting effects.\n</gallery>\n\n===The Grande Roue de Chicago and the moving sidewalk===\nThe ''Grande Roue de Chicago'' was a very popular attraction.  It was a gigantic [[ferris wheel]] 110 meters high, which took its name from a similar wheel created by [[George Washington Gale Ferris Jr.]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago. It and could carry 1600 passengers in its forty cars in a single voyage. The cost of a ride was one franc for a second class car, and two francs for a more spacious first-class car.  Despite the high price, passengers often had to wait an hour for a place.<ref>Mabire (2000) pg. 86</ref>\n\nThe moving sidewalk was a very popular and useful attraction, given the large size of the Exposition. It ran along the edge of the Exposition, from the Esplanade of [[Les Invalides]] to the [[Champ de Mars]], passing through stations along the way, where passengers could board. The fare was an average of fifty centimes. The sidewalk was accessed from a platform six meters above the ground level.  The passengers stepped from the platform onto the moving sidewalk traveling at a little more than four kilometers an hour, then onto a more rapid sidewalk moving at 8.5 kilometers an hour. The sidewalks had posts with handles which passengers could hold onto, or they could walk.<ref>Mabire (2000) pp. 87-89</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:La grande roue, Paris, France, ca. 1890-1900.jpg|The Grande Roue de Chicago at the Paris Exposition could carry 1600 passengers at once\nFile:Paris Exposition moving sidewalk, Paris, France, 1900 - S03 06 01 015 image 2011.jpg|The moving sidewalk of the Exposition\nFile:Plateforme mobile, station du pont des Invalides.jpg|Station of the Moving sidewalk at Les Invalides.\n</gallery>\n\n===The Globe C\u00e9leste===\nThe [[Globe C\u00e9leste]] was an immense globe-shaped [[planetarium]] which offered a presentation on the night sky.  The globe was forty-five meters in diameter, and the blue and gold exterior was painted with the constellations and the signs of the [[zodiac]]. It was placed atop a masonry support eighteen meters high, supported by four columns. A flower garden on the support surrounded the globe. Spectators seated in armchairs inside watched a presentation on the stars and planets projected overhead.  The sphere was the scene of a fatal accident on April 29, 1900 when one of access ramps, hastily made of a newly-introduced material, [[reinforced concrete]],  collapsed onto the street below, killing nine persons. Following the accident the French government established the first regulations for the use of reinforced concrete. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tour Eiffel et le Globe C\u00e9leste.jpg|The [[Globe C\u00e9leste]] with the Eiffel Tower\nFile:Suchard - Globe c\u00e9leste.jpg|The Globe C\u00e9leste was featured in an advertisement for Suchard Chocolate\n</gallery>\n\n===The Grand Palais and Petit Palais===\nThe [[Grand Palais]], on the right bank, officially the ''Grand Palais des beaux-arts et des arts decoratifs'', was built upon the site of the Palace of Industry of the 1855 Exposition.  It was the work of two architects, [[Henri Deglane]] for the main body of the building, and Albert Thomas for the portion which now is the [[Palais de la D\u00e9couverte]], or science museum. [[Charles Girault]] designed the [[Petit Palais]] facing the Grand Palais.  The iron frame of the Grand Palais was quite modern for its time; It appeared light, but in fact it used used nine thousand tons of metal, compared with seven thousand for the construction of the [[Eiffel Tower]].<ref>Ageorges (2006) pp. 113-114</ref>   The interior served as a setting for exhibits of painting and particularly sculpture.<ref name = \"Jullian\" />  The facade was in the ornate [[Beaux-Arts style]] or [[Neo-baroque|Neo-Baroque]] style,  The more modern interior iron ramework, huge skylights and stairways offered decorative elements in the new [[Art Nouveau]] style,<ref name = \"Jullian\" /> particularly in the railings of the staircase, which were intricately woven in fluid, organic forms.<ref name = \"Allwood\" />\n\nThe [[Petit Palais]] , was constructed by the architect Giraud.<ref name = \"Jullian\"/> for the exhibition of French art.<ref name = \"Jullian\" /> Much like the Grand Palais, the facade is Beaux-Arts and Neo-Baroque, reminiscent of the Grand Trianon and the stable at Chantilly.<ref name = \"Jullian\" /> while the interior offers examples of Art Nouveau, particularly in the railings of the curving stairways, the tiles of the floors, the stained glass, and the murals on the ceiling of the arcade around the garden.<ref name = \"Jullian\"/>  The entrance murals were painted by Albert Besnard and Paul Albert Laurens.<ref name = \"Jullian\"/> \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nExposition universelle, 1900 - the chefs-d'uvre (1900) (14784195265).jpg|Interior of the [[Grand Palais]], with its Art Nouveau iron stairway\nFile:Stairs @ Petit Palais @ Paris (34892352515).jpg|Art Nouveau stairway of the [[Petit Palais]]\nFile:Exposition universelle, 1900 - the chefs-d'uvre (1900) (14597670517).jpg|Courtyard of the [[Petit Palais]] (1900)\n</gallery>\n\n==National Pavilions==\n\nFifty-six countries were invited to have pavilions at the Exposition, and forty accepted. The Rue des Nations was created along the banks of the Seine between the esplanade of [[Les Invalides]] and the [[Champ de Mars]] for the pavilions of the larger countries. Each country paid for its own pavilion. The pavilions were all temporary, made of plaster and ''staff'' on a metal frame.  Nearly all were designed in the national architecture of each country, often imitating famous national monuments, The Russian pavilion was inspired by the towers of the Kremlin. \n<ref name = \"Allwood\"  /> \nThe Pavilion of Turkey was one of the largest, covering 4000 square meters on the rue des Nations. It was designed by a French architect, Dubuisson, and was a mixture of copies of Islamic architecture from mosques in Istanbul and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Ageorges (2006) pg. 123</ref>\nThe British Royalty pavilion, one of the largest, consisted of a mock-Jacobean mansion decorated with pictures and furniture, constructed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. It was largely used for receptions for important visitors to the Exposition.<ref name = \"Allwood\"  />\n\nThe German Pavilion was the tallest, at 76 meters, built of wood and stained glass.  However,most of the German presence at the Exposition was in the commercial pavilions, where they had important displays of German technology and machinery, as well as models of German steamships and a scale model of a German lighthouse.<ref name = \"Allwood\" />\n\nThe United States pavilion was also modest, a variation on the United States Capitol Building:  the main U.S. presence was in the commercial and industrial palaces.  One unusual aspect of the U.S. presence was [[The Exhibit of American Negroes]], a joint project of [[Daniel Alexander Payne Murray|Daniel Murray]], the Assistant Librarian of Congress, [[Thomas J. Calloway]], a lawyer and the primary organizer of the exhibit, and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. The goal of the exhibition was to demonstrate progress and commemorate the lives of [[African American]]s at the turn of the century.<ref name=Lewis24-49>[[David Levering Lewis]], \"A Small Nation of People: W.E.B.

At the time, the average hourly wage for Paris workers was between 40 and 50 centimes.  In addition, most popular attractions charged an admission fee, usually between fifty centimes and Franc.  The average cost of a simple meal at the Exposition was 2.50 Francs, the half-day wages of a worker.<ref>Ageorges (2006), pg. 105</ref>\nThe amount budgeted for the Paris Exposition was one hundred million French Francs; twenty million from the French State, twenty million from the City of Paris, and the remaining sixty million expected to come from admissions, and backed by French banks and financial institutions.<ref name=\"Mabire 2000, pp. 51\">Mabire (2000), pp. 51</ref>\n\nThe official final cost was 119 million Francs, while the total amount actually collected from admission fees was 126 million Francs. However, there were unplanned expenses of 22 million Francs for the French State,  and 6 million Francs for the City of Paris, bringing the total cost to 147 million Francs, or a deficit of 21 million Francs.<ref name=\"Mabire 2000, pp. 51\"/>   The deficit was to a degree offset by the long-term additions to the city infrastructure;   new buildings and bridges, including the Grand and Petit Palais, the Pont Alexander III and the [[Passerelle Debilly]];  and additions to the transport system; The [[Paris M\u00e9tro]], the [[funicular railway]] on [[Montmartre]], and two new train stations, the Gare d'Orleans  (now the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]] and the [[Gare des Invalides]], and the new facade and enlargement and redecoration of the [[Gare de Lyon]] and other stations.\n[[File:FirrstPrize1900.jpg|thumb|upright 1.25|<center>Michigan Stove Company</center>]]\n\n==Medals and Awards==\nThe organizers of the Exposition were not miserly in recognizing the 83,047 exhibitors of products,  about half of whom came from France, and 7,161 from the United States.  The awards ceremony was held on August 18, 1900, and was attended by 11,500 persons. 3,156 grand prizes were handed out, 8,889 gold medals, 13,300 silver medals, 12,108 bronze medals, and 8,422 honorable mentions. Many of the participants, such as [[Campbell's Soup]], added the Paris award to the advertisements and labels of their products. Another was the [[Michigan Stove Company]].<ref>Mabire (1900) pg. 44</ref>\n\n==Art Nouveau at the Exposition==\n\nThe [[Art Nouveau]] (\"New Art\") style began to appear in Belgium and France in the 1880s and became fashionable in Europe and the United States during the 1890s.<ref name = \"Gontar\">Gontar, Cybele.

The architecture of the Exposition was largely of the [[Paris architecture of the Belle \u00c9poque|Belle Epoque style]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]], or of eclectic national styles, But Art Nouveau decoration did appear in the interiors and decoration of a many of buildings, notably the interior ironwork and decoration of the Monumental gateway of the Exposition, the [[Grand Palais]] and the [[Petit Palais]], and in the portal of the Palace of National Industries.\n\nThe Art Nouveau style was very popular in the pavilions of decorative arts.

The work of the most famous Art Nouveau poster artist, [[Alfons Mucha]], had many forms at the Exposition. He designed the posters for the official Austrian participation in the Exposition, painted murals depicting scenes from the history of Bosnia as well as the menu for the restaurant at the Bosnian pavilion, and designed the menu for the official opening banquet. He produced displays for the jeweler [[Georges Fouquet]] and the perfume maker [[Houbigant Parfum|Houbigant]], with statuettes and panels of women depicting the scents of rose, orange blossom, violet and buttercup. His more serious art works, including his drawings for ''Le Pater'', were shown in the Austrian Pavilion and in the Austrian section of the [[Grand Palais]].  Some of his murals can be seen now in the [[Petit Palais]].{{Sfn|Sato|2015|page=64}}\n\nThe most famous appearance was the in the edicules, or entrance coverings, of the stations of the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] designed by [[Hector Guimard]].

They were built largely of wood, and covered with [[staff (building material)|staff]], which was formed into columns, statuary, walls, stairs. After the fair was over, the buildings were demolished and all items and materials that could be salvaged were sold or recylcled. A few of the major structures built from the Exposition were preserved, including the [[Grand Palais]] and the [[Petit Palais]], and the two major bridges, the [[Pont Alexandre III]] and the [[Passerelle Debilly]], though the latter was later dismantled and moved to a new location a few dozen meters from its original placement.<ref>Ageorges (2006) p. 130</ref>\n\n* Most of the Art Nouveau Metro Station edicules designed by [[Hector Guimard]] were removed soon after the Exposition closed, but two of the originals still exist, including one at its original location, at the [[Porte Dauphine (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Porte Dauphine station of the Paris M\u00e9tro]].\n*The monumental portal of the Palace of National Manufacturers, made by the [[S\u00e8vres Manufactory]], was preserved and moved to Square Felix-Desruelles, next to the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s]].\n* A 2.87 meter copy of the [[Statue of Liberty]] by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi]], exhibited in Paris in 1900, was placed in the [[Luxembourg Gardens]] in 1905 at the request of his widow. \n* The Japanese tower from the Exposition, along with the Chinese pavilion,  was purchased by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] and moved the [[Museums of the Far Est]] in [[Laeken]], near [[Brussels]], Belgium.\n\nOne of the most curious vestiges is [[La Ruche]], at 2 Passage de Dantzig (15h arrond.). This is a three-story building constructed entirely out of bits and pieces of Exposition buildings, purchased at auctions by sculptor [[Alfred Boucher]].  It includes substantial pieces of Exposition buildings. The iron roof, made by [[Gustave Eiffel]],  originally belonged covered the kiosk of the Wines of [[M\u00e9doc]], in the palace of agriculture and foods. The statues of women in theatrical costumes by the front door came from the Indochina Pavilion, while the ornamental iron gate at the entrance was part of the Palace of Women. In the years after the Exposition, La Ruche served as the temporary studio and home of dozens of young artists and writers spent some time living there, including [[Marc Chagall]]. [[Henri Matisse]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]] and the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. It was threatened with demolition in the 1960s, but was saved by culture minister [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]].

The exhibition lost a grand total of 82,000 francs after six months in operation. Many Parisians had invested money in shares sold to raise money for the event and therefore lost their investment. With a much larger expected turnout the exhibit sites had gone up in value. Continuing to pay rent for the sites became increasingly hard for concessionaires as they were receiving fewer customers than anticipated.

Prasath shows special care for a prostitute named Buvana ([[Riythvika]]) and treats her well than the others.\n\nOne night, a customer named Santhosh (Mal Maruga) calls Prasath and asks him a girl. Prasath asks Chetta, who suggests Nirmala alias Nimmi (Meera Nair) to be sent, who lives as a prostitute without the knowledge of her family, which consists of her mother and siblings, who are scared of her. She is taken to Santhosh by the help of Subramani ([[Mayilsamy]]), a cab driver. She is dropped at Santhosh's place by Subramani.\n\nThe next day, Prasath and Chetta discover that Nimmi has not gone to other customers and that Santhosh was her last customer. They get puzzled, as Santosh states that she left and her phone is not attended. They then go to different places with the help of Subramani and investigate them. They soon reach Santhosh's house, where they find him dead with no clue of Nimmi. Later, Chetta leaves Prasath and Subramani, and they both go to KFC for further investigation and are left clueless for what had happened. They once again reach to Santhosh's house, where they find Nimmi killed, as well. Prasath is left alone seeing Chetta getting caught and later sees a man crying on his roof. He follows the man, who reveals what had happened actually.\n\nThe man reveals himself to be Mathivanan ([[Kathir (actor)|Kathir]]), who is an NRI and comes to India each year to meet his close friend Santhosh. One night, Santhosh invites Nimmi to get laid. Nimmi seduces Mathi and says that it is alright for her to manage people while eating food from KFC. Nimmi waits in the room for them, while Santhosh is drunk and allows Mathi to go first. Mathi tells Nimmi to leave, and she remains stubborn and mocks him. Soon then, he accidentally kills her and cries out in guilt, later revealing that he is a transgender person who wanted Santhosh to share his feelings. He hides her body in the fridge and tells to the now-recovered Santosh that she had left earlier. Later, Santosh discovers her body and gets to know Mathi's true colors. He too mocks Mathi, ignoring his feelings towards him and is accidentally killed by him. He hides due to the arrival of Prasath at that moment and cries out in the pain that he faced through as a transgender person. He completes narrating what happened that night, shares his pain, and leaves the place back at the present.\n\nA few months later, we can see Chetta being a much strict pimp by providing strict guidelines to prostitutes, Prasath stopping being a pimp after listening to Subramani's words and marrying Buvana, and Mathi living life as a transgender person by growing a lot of hair.\n\nThe film ends by showing a few transgender people and dedicating them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kathir (actor)|Kathir]] as Mathivanan \n* Meera Nair as Nirmala (Nimmi)\n* [[Raj Bharath (actor)|Raj Bharath]] as Prasath\n* [[Riythvika]] as Buvana\n* [[Mayilsamy]] as Subramani\n* [[Rajesh Sharma (Malayalam actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as Chetta\n* Mal Maruga as Santhosh\n* Brila Boss as Prem \n* Vishalini as Prem's spouse\n* Muthukumar as Manager\n* Kani Venkatesh as suspect\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nKathir revealed he had to endure hardships while applying prosthetic make up to look like a woman.<ref>http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/2017/aug/15/a-different-transformation-1643218.html</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was screened at All Lights India International Film Festival.<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Tamil-films-shine-at-intnl-film-festivals/articleshow/54509678.cms</ref> It was released on [[ZEE5]] on 9 January 2019 due to failing to have a theatrical release.<ref>https://www.in.com/entertainment/regional/pariyerum-perumal-heros-next-to-have-a-direct-online-release-260861.htm</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official|https://www.zee5.com/movies/details/sigai/0-0-18554}}\n\n[[Category:2019 films]]\n[[Category:2010s Tamil-language films]]\n[[Category:Indian thriller films]]\n[[Category:Cross-dressing in Indian films]]\n[[Category:Transgender-related films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:ZEE5 original films]]\n[[Category:2019 directorial debut films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2019 film}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2019}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Sigai\n| image =Sigai poster.jpg\n| caption = Poster\n| director = Jagadeesan subu\n| producer = NPKS.Logu\n| writer = Jagadeesan subbu<br />M.K.Mani<br />Aravindhan\n| starring = [[Kathir (actor)|Kathir]]<br />Meera Nair<br />[[Raj Bharath (actor)|Raj Bharath]]<br />[[Riythvika]]<br />[[Mayilsamy]]\n| music = [[Ron Ethan Yohann]]\n| cinematography = Navin Kumar\n| editing = [[Anucharan Murugaiyan|Anucharan]]\n| studio = Divine Studios\n| distributor = [[ZEE5]]\n| released = 9 January 2019<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7143554/</ref>\n| runtime = 102 minutes\n| country = India\n| language = Tamil\n| budget = \n}}\n\n'''''Sigai''''' ({{translation|Hair}}) is a 2019 [[Tamil language]] [[drama film]] directed by Jagadeesan Subu.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7143554/</ref> The movie has [[Kathir (actor)|Kathir]] in the lead role while Meera Nair, [[Raj Bharath (actor)|Raj Bharath]], [[Riythvika]], and [[Mayilsamy]] play supporting roles.
