Like most ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the [[even-toed ungulate]]s. Although the name '''sheep''' applies to many species in the genus ''[[Ovis]]'', in everyday usage it almost always refers to ''Ovis aries''. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female is referred to as a ''ewe'' ({{IPAc-en|j|u\u02d0}}), an intact male as a ''ram'', occasionally a ''tup'', a [[castrated]] male as a ''wether'', and a young sheep as a  ''lamb''.\n\nSheep are most likely descended from the wild [[mouflon]] of Europe and Asia and one of the earliest animals to be domesticated for [[agricultural]] purposes, sheep are raised for [[fleeces]], meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and [[sheep milk|milk]]. A sheep's [[wool]] is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by [[sheep shearing|shearing]]. [[Wikt:ovine|Ovine]] meat is called [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] when from younger animals and [[mutton]] when from older ones in Commonwealth countries, and lamb in the United States (including from adults).  Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for [[Sheepskin (material)|pelts]], as [[dairy]] animals, or as [[model organism]]s for science.\n\n[[Sheep husbandry]] is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the southern and central [[South America]]n nations, and the [[British Isles]] are most closely associated with sheep production.\n\nThere are a large [[glossary of sheep husbandry|lexicon of unique terms]] which vary considerably by region and [[dialect]]. Use of the word ''sheep'' began in [[Middle English]] as a derivation of the [[Old English]] word ''{{lang|ang|sc\u0113ap}}''; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.\n\nBeing a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and [[symbology]]. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with [[pastoral]], [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] imagery. Sheep figure in many [[mythologies]]\u2014such as the [[Golden Fleece]]\u2014and major religions, especially the [[Abrahamic]] traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as [[sacrificial animals]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the domestic sheep}}\nThe exact line of descent between domestic sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear.<ref name=Hiendleder>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hiendleder S, Kaupe B, Wassmuth R, Janke A |title=Molecular analysis of wild and domestic sheep questions current nomenclature and provides evidence for domestication from two different subspecies |journal=Proc.

Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely [[Neoteny|neotenic]] as a result of selective breeding by humans.<ref>Budiansky, pp. 97\u201398.</ref><ref>Budianksy, pp. 100\u201301.</ref> A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. [[Polled livestock|polled]]), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.<ref name=\"sheep and goat\"/>\n\nAnother trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or [[piebald]].<ref name=\"rmcsba\"/><ref name=\"bcsba\"/> Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a [[dominant trait]] it spread quickly.

Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American [[Columbia (sheep)|Columbia]] breed was developed by crossing [[Lincoln (sheep)|Lincoln]] rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled [[Rambouillet (sheep)|Rambouillet]] ewes.\n\nCoarse or [[carpet]] wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds).

Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of [[grass]]es, [[legume]]s and [[forb]]s.<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 82.</ref> Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of the world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, [[Taxus|yew]], rhubarb, potato, and [[rhododendron]].<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 160.</ref>\n\n[[File:SnakeValley.JPG|thumb|right|Sheep grazing on public land ([[Utah]], 2009)]]\n\n====Effects on pasture====\nSheep are largely [[grazing]] herbivores, unlike [[Browsing (predation)|browsing]] animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants very close to the ground and can [[overgraze]] a pasture much faster than cattle.<ref name=\"begin\"/> For this reason, many shepherds use [[managed intensive rotational grazing]], where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover.<ref name=\"begin\"/><ref name=\"modern\"/> Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of [[invasive species|invasive plant species]]. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as [[cheatgrass]], [[Euphorbia virgata|leafy spurge]], [[kudzu]] and [[spotted knapweed]] over native species such as [[sagebrush]], making grazing sheep effective for [[conservation grazing]].<ref>Simmons & Ekarius, p. 143.</ref> Research conducted in [[Imperial County, California]] compared lamb grazing with [[herbicides]] for [[weed]] control in seedling [[alfalfa]] fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. [[Entomologist]]s also compared grazing lambs to [[insecticides]] for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ucanr.org/delivers/impactview.cfm?impactnum=176 |title=Sheep grazing reduces pesticide use in alfalfa |work=ucanr.org |publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources }}</ref>\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Border Collie sheepdog trial.jpg|thumb|Sheep showing flocking behavior during a [[sheepdog trial]]]]\n[[File:Flock of sheep in South Africa (2015).jpg|thumb|Flock of sheep in [[South Africa]] (2015)]]\n\n===Flock behavior===\nSheep are [[Herd animal|flock]] animals and strongly gregarious; much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies. The [[dominance hierarchy]] of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species.<ref name=\"wild\">Budiansky</ref> Furthermore, in contrast to the [[red deer]] and [[gazelle]] (two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times), sheep do not defend [[Territory (animal)|territories]] although they do form [[home ranges]].<ref name=\"CluttonBrock, (1987)\">Clutton-Brock, J., (1987).  A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge  pp.55</ref>  All sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock, although this behavior varies with breed,<ref name=smith5/> and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members.<ref name=\"storey\"/> During flocking, sheep have a strong tendency to follow, and a leader may simply be the first individual to move.  Relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep: in mixed-breed flocks, subgroups of the same breed tend to form, and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks.<ref name=\"hobby\"/>  Sheep can become [[hefted]] to one particular local pasture (heft) so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes. Lambs learn the heft from ewes and if whole flocks are culled it must be retaught to the replacement animals.<ref name=\"storey\"/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1634526.stm| work=BBC News| date=2001-11-03| title=Sheep taught to stay put| accessdate=2006-04-29}}</ref>\n\nFlock behaviour in sheep is generally only exhibited in groups of four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep.<ref name=\"hobby\"/> Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their [[flight zone]] is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.<ref name=\"hobby\"/>\n\nIn regions where sheep have no natural predators, none of the native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior.<ref name=\"begin\"/>\n\n====Herding====\n[[File:Round 'em up.jpg|thumb|right|Escaped sheep being led back to pasture with the enticement of food. This method of moving sheep works best with smaller flocks.]]\nFarmers exploit flocking behavior to keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as [[hill farming]], and to move them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use [[herding dog]]s in this effort, with a highly bred [[herding]] ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food.<ref>Budiasnky p. 100 et al.</ref> Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.<ref>Budiansky p. 10.</ref><ref>Wooster, pp. 73, 75.</ref>\n\n===Dominance hierarchy===\nSheep establish a [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] hierarchy through fighting, threats and competitiveness.

Both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks.<ref name=\"storey\"/> [[Worm]]s are the most common internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as [[Deworming|drenches]], are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites.<ref name=\"modern\"/>  External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep [[Hippoboscidae|keds]], [[nose bot]]s, [[Psorergates ovis|sheep itch mites]], and [[maggot]]s. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the [[bot fly]] and the [[blow-fly]], commonly ''[[Common green bottle fly|Lucilia sericata]]'' or its relative ''L. cuprina''. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of [[flystrike]]. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, [[crutching]] (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. Some countries allow [[mulesing]], a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb.<ref name = \"DPI SOP\">{{cite web\n|url = http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/livestock/animal-welfare/general/other/livestock/sop/sheep/mulesing\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906155137/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/livestock/animal-welfare/general/other/livestock/sop/sheep/mulesing\n|archivedate = 2007-09-06\n|title = Standard Operating Procedures \u2013 sheep Mulesing\n|website = New South Wales Department of Primary Industries\n|accessdate = 2008-03-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Model Code\">\n{{cite book\n|url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/22/pid/5389.htm\n|format = PDF\n|title = The Sheep\n|edition = 2nd\n|series = Primary Industries Report Series\n|pages = 17\u201323\n|work = Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals\n|publisher = [[CSIRO]] Publishing\n|author = Primary Industries Ministerial Council\n|year=2006 |accessdate=2008-03-01\n|isbn = 978-0-643-09357-7}}</ref>  Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]], causing breathing difficulties and discomfort.

[[Orf (animal disease)|Orf]] (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous [[anthrax]] is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores can be transmitted in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic [[abortion]] in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the [[prion]] disease [[scrapie]] and the [[virus]] that causes [[foot-and-mouth disease]] (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.<ref name=\"storey\"/>\n\nOf the 600,300 sheep lost to the US economy in 2004, 37.3% were lost to predators, while 26.5% were lost to some form of disease.

Christ is also portrayed as the [[Sacrificial lamb]] of God (''[[Agnus Dei]]'') and Easter celebrations in [[Greece]] and [[Romania]] traditionally feature a meal of Paschal lamb. A church leader is often called the [[pastor]], which is derived from the Latin word for shepherd.

Like most ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the [[even-toed ungulate]]s. Although the name '''sheep''' applies to many species in the genus ''[[Ovis]]'', in everyday usage it almost always refers to ''Ovis aries''. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female is referred to as a ''ewe'' ({{IPAc-en|j|u\u02d0}}), an intact male as a ''ram'', occasionally a ''tup'', a [[castrated]] male as a ''wether'', and a young sheep is a  ''lamb''.\n\nSheep are most likely descended from the wild [[mouflon]] of Europe and Asia and one of the earliest animals to be domesticated for [[agricultural]] purposes, sheep are raised for [[fleeces]], meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and [[sheep milk|milk]]. A sheep's [[wool]] is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by [[sheep shearing|shearing]]. [[Wikt:ovine|Ovine]] meat is called [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] when from younger animals and [[mutton]] when from older ones in Commonwealth countries, and lamb in the United States (including from adults).  Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for [[Sheepskin (material)|pelts]], as [[dairy]] animals, or as [[model organism]]s for science.\n\n[[Sheep husbandry]] is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the southern and central [[South America]]n nations, and the [[British Isles]] are most closely associated with sheep production.\n\nThere are a large [[glossary of sheep husbandry|lexicon of unique terms]] which vary considerably by region and [[dialect]]. Use of the word ''sheep'' began in [[Middle English]] as a derivation of the [[Old English]] word ''{{lang|ang|sc\u0113ap}}''; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.\n\nBeing a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and [[symbology]]. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with [[pastoral]], [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] imagery. Sheep figure in many [[mythologies]]\u2014such as the [[Golden Fleece]]\u2014and major religions, especially the [[Abrahamic]] traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as [[sacrificial animals]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the domestic sheep}}\nThe exact line of descent between domestic sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear.<ref name=Hiendleder>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hiendleder S, Kaupe B, Wassmuth R, Janke A |title=Molecular analysis of wild and domestic sheep questions current nomenclature and provides evidence for domestication from two different subspecies |journal=Proc.

Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely [[Neoteny|neotenic]] as a result of selective breeding by humans.<ref>Budiansky, pp. 97\u201398.</ref><ref>Budianksy, pp. 100\u201301.</ref> A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. [[Polled livestock|polled]]), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.<ref name=\"sheep and goat\"/>\n\nAnother trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or [[piebald]].<ref name=\"rmcsba\"/><ref name=\"bcsba\"/> Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a [[dominant trait]] it spread quickly.

State of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture</ref> (These numbers exclude extinct breeds, which are also tallied by the FAO.) For the purpose of such tallies, the FAO definition of a breed is \"either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity.\"<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/> Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed. Other features used when classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), tail length, presence or lack of horns, and the [[topography]] for which the breed has been developed.

Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from [[Merino (sheep)|Merino]] sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces.<ref name=\"D\u2019Arcy\">D\u2019Arcy, J.B., Sheep Management & Wool Technology, NSW University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-86840-106-4}}</ref> Some major medium wool breeds, such as the [[Corriedale sheep|Corriedale]], are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American [[Columbia (sheep)|Columbia]] breed was developed by crossing [[Lincoln (sheep)|Lincoln]] rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled [[Rambouillet (sheep)|Rambouillet]] ewes.\n\nCoarse or [[carpet]] wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.<ref name=\"living\">Wooster</ref>\n\nA minor class of sheep are the [[dairy]] breeds.

When sheep [[Grazing|graze]], vegetation is chewed into a mass called a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]], which is then passed into the [[rumen]], via the [[Reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]].

Both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks.<ref name=\"storey\"/> [[Worm]]s are the most common internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as [[Deworming|drenches]], are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites.<ref name=\"modern\"/>  External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep [[Hippoboscidae|keds]], [[nose bot]]s, [[Psorergates ovis|sheep itch mites]], and [[maggot]]s. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the [[bot fly]] and the [[blow-fly]], commonly ''[[Common green bottle fly|Lucilia sericata]]'' or its relative ''L. cuprina''. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of [[flystrike]]. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, [[crutching]] (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. Some countries allow [[mulesing]], a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb.<ref name = \"DPI SOP\">{{cite web\n|url = http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/livestock/animal-welfare/general/other/livestock/sop/sheep/mulesing\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906155137/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/livestock/animal-welfare/general/other/livestock/sop/sheep/mulesing\n|archivedate = 2007-09-06\n|title = Standard Operating Procedures \u2013 sheep Mulesing\n|website = New South Wales Department of Primary Industries\n|accessdate = 2008-03-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Model Code\">\n{{cite book\n|url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/22/pid/5389.htm\n|format = PDF\n|title = The Sheep\n|edition = 2nd\n|series = Primary Industries Report Series\n|pages = 17\u201323\n|work = Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals\n|publisher = [[CSIRO]] Publishing\n|author = Primary Industries Ministerial Council\n|year=2006 |accessdate=2008-03-01\n|isbn = 978-0-643-09357-7}}</ref>  Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]], causing breathing difficulties and discomfort.

Sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and [[idiom]] frequently with such phrases as \"[[black sheep]]\".

These are distinguished by the ram being depicted with horns and a tail, the sheep with neither and the lamb with its tail only. A further variant of the lamb, termed the Paschal lamb, is depicted as carrying a [[Christian cross]] and with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] over its head. Rams' heads, portrayed without a neck and facing the viewer, are also found in British armories. The fleece, depicted as an entire sheepskin carried by a ring around its midsection, originally became known through its use in the arms of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] and was later adopted by towns and individuals with connections to the wool industry.<ref name=\"Davies\">[[Arthur Fox-Davies]], ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', T.C. and E.C.

[[Astrology|Astrologically]], [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], the ram, is the first sign of the classical Greek [[zodiac]], and the sheep is the eighth of the twelve animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the [[Chinese zodiac]], related to the [[Chinese calendar]].<ref name = Cooper92/> In [[Mongolia]], [[shagai]] are an ancient form of dice made from the [[cuboid bone]]s of sheep that are often used for fortunetelling purposes.\n\n[[File:Bernhard Plockhorst - Good Shephard.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesus]] is depicted as \"The Good Shepherd\", with the sheep being [[Christianity|Christians]]]]\n\nSheep play an important role in all the Abrahamic faiths; [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], [[Moses]], [[King David]] and the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] were all shepherds. According to the Biblical story of the [[Binding of Isaac]], a ram is sacrificed as a substitute for Isaac after an angel stays Abraham's hand (in the Islamic tradition, Abraham was about to sacrifice Ishmael).

Some Christian [[saint]]s are considered [[Patron saints of occupations and activities|patrons of shepherds]], and even of sheep themselves. Christ is also portrayed as the [[Sacrificial lamb]] of God (''[[Agnus Dei]]'') and Easter celebrations in [[Greece]] and [[Romania]] traditionally feature a meal of Paschal lamb. A church leader is often called the [[pastor]], which is derived from the Latin word for shepherd. In many western Christian traditions bishops carry a staff, which also serves as a symbol of the episcopal office, known as a [[crosier]], which is modeled on the [[shepherd's crook]].\n\nSheep are key symbols in [[fable]]s and [[nursery rhyme]]s like ''[[The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing]]'', ''[[Little Bo Peep]]'', ''[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]'', and ''[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]''; novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and [[Haruki Murakami]]'s ''[[A Wild Sheep Chase]]''; songs such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] ''[[Sheep may safely graze]]'' (''Schafe k\u00f6nnen sicher weiden'') and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]'', and poems like [[William Blake]]'s \"[[The Lamb (poem)|The Lamb]]\".\n[[File:Nicolaes Pietersz Berchem, Sheep, NGA 52280.jpg|thumb|\"[[Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem]] (1620\u20131683), ''Sheep'', black and red chalk (possibly crayon); size overall: 15 x 25.5 cm (5 7/8 x 10 1/16 in.).

Four days after Cornelius' arrival to Villa Tremolo, the lovers, one by one, look over Felix in his coffin, each one remarking on how he looks the same, yet different.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Bibi Andersson]] \u2013 Humlan (Bumblebee)\n* [[Harriet Andersson]] \u2013 Isolde\n* [[Eva Dahlbeck]] \u2013 Adelaide\n* [[Karin Kavli]] \u2013 Madame Tussaud\n* [[Gertrud Fridh]] \u2013 Traviata\n* [[Mona Malm]] \u2013 Cecilia\n* [[Barbro Hiort af Orn\u00e4s]] \u2013 Beatrica\n* [[Allan Edwall]] \u2013 Jillker\n* [[Georg Funkquist]] \u2013 Tristan\n* [[Carl Billquist]] \u2013 The young man\n* [[Jarl Kulle]] \u2013 Cornelius\n}}\n\n==Release and reception==\nIn 2018, [[The Criterion Collection]] released the film on [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]], along with 38 other Bergman films, in the set ''[[Ingmar Bergman's Cinema]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Criterion Announces Massive 39-Film Ingmar Bergman Blu-ray Collection |url=http://collider.com/ingmar-bergman-criterion-blu-ray-collection/ |last=Chitwood |first=Adam |website=[[Collider.com]] |date=12 July 2018 |accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nCritic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that ''All These Women'' was \"the worst film he [Bergman] has ever made.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-serpents-egg-1978 |title=The Serpent's Egg |last=Ebert |first=Roger |accessdate=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Stanley Kauffmann]] of [[The New Republic]] wrote 'All These Women is intended to be hilarious, but the gift of splitting sides is not in him (Bergman).'.<ref>{{cite book |title=A world on Film|last1=Kauffmann|first1=Stanley |publisher=Delta Books |year=1968 |page=290}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Review in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0gEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA19 LIFE 16 Oct 1964] p.&nbsp;19\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0058124}}\n* {{Sfdb title}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110816044458/http://bergmanorama.webs.com/films/all_these_women.htm at bergmanorama]\n\n{{Ingmar Bergman}}\n\n[[Category:1964 films]]\n[[Category:1960s parody films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ingmar Bergman]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ingmar Bergman]]\n[[Category:Swedish films]]\n[[Category:Swedish comedy films]]\n[[Category:Swedish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Erik Nordgren]]\n\n{{1960s-comedy-film-stub}}\n{{Sweden-film-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ribbet32", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_These_Women"}

Texas Country is known for fusing [[Neotraditional country|neotraditional country]] with the outspoken, care-free views of [[outlaw country]]. Texas Country blends these sub-genres with a [[common people|\"common working man\"]] theme and witty undertones, these often combine with a stripped down music sound.\n\nNeither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas Country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene as the genre tends to be anti-Nashville. The genre differentiates from Nashville country with its rejection of pop influences that is found in Nashville Country recently, but does not necessarily mean the artist/group is Texas based.  For example, [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] is considered by some to be a Texas Country musician, despite his [[Kentucky]] ties. [[Adam Hood]], an [[Alabama]] native, also has had success in the genre. Even international musicians, such as [[Alberta, Canada]] native [[Corb Lund]], have been successful in the Texas Country scene. This just shows how many musicians all over the world have adopted the Texas sound.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] is essential in Texas Country Music. However, the use of [[electric guitar]]s, [[steel guitar]]s or [[pedal steel guitar]]s in the genre is not uncommon. [[bass guitar|Bass]] and [[percussion]] are used in live performances. The sounds of [[piano]], [[baritone guitar]], [[banjo]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]] or [[harmonica]] on studio recordings are the norm for the genre.\n\n==Vocals==\nThe line of delineation for vocals is unclear. Traditionally, the Texas Country scene has been a male dominated genre, however many women have had chart success in recent years. The Texas \"anthem\" is a common song type, referencing and sometimes embellishing on the different positive characteristics of the state. Many of these types of songs have been popular on the Texas Music Charts.<ref>[http://www.countryradioclassics.com/index.php/2007/09/21/texas-national-anthem-voting/ TX National Anthem voting ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703153140/http://www.countryradioclassics.com/index.php/2007/09/21/texas-national-anthem-voting |date=2008-07-03 }} (sponsored by Lone-Star Beer company)</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\nThe live performance is at the very root of the Texas Country scene.  Enthusiasm is the best descriptor for both band and crowd at a live Texas Country performance. \"It is not an uncommon sight to see clubs all over Texas packed to the rafters; girls and boys in cowboy hats and [[Wrangler Jeans|Wranglers]] [[Country-western two-step|two-step]]ping next to the mosh pit, where [[frat boy|college boys or \"Man Fans\"]] in khakis and college girls pressed up against the stage\".<ref>Lone Star Music. Kevin Fowler Biography. [http://www.lonestarmusic.com/biography.asp?id=86 November 9, 2006] LoneStar Music.</ref> An important factor Texas Country's success is in the frequency of live performances. It is not uncommon for a Texas Country band to tour 200+ dates a year, all, or nearly all, in the State of Texas{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. This allows the fan to attend a band's show more often, thus interacting with the music on a more personal level.\nPopular venues include, [[Gruene Hall]] (Gruene), [[Billy Bob's]] (Ft.

The winners in 25 categories are nominated and voted on by fans, friends and industry professionals and are awarded the night of the show.  The voting membership has grown to over 32,000 voting members in five years and continues to expand every year.  The awards show is open to the public and fans alike who cheer on their favorite artist/entertainers and radio stations.  Information about the show and voting procedures can be found at https://trrma.net/\n\n==Themes==\nLyrical content is the backbone of Texas country. [[Willie Nelson]], a legendary Country Music Outlaw, inspired his friend [[Waylon Jennings]], an outlaw country music legend himself, who is sometimes cited as an inspiration to present day Texas country musicians, to say, \u201cYour melody goes where the words take you\u201d.<ref>Jennings, Waylon and [[Lenny Kaye]].  ''Waylon: An Autobiography.''  New York: Warner Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nThere are 4 different types of themes in Country Music. These include the following categories: \"It's All Over\" (songs with a core theme of loss or regret), It's Not Working Out (songs with a focus on frustration over a relationship), \"Love and Devotion\" (sappy love songs) and \"The Right Way to Live\" (songs with a dominant theme of pride and homespun wisdom).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/chart-shows-4-themes-country-songs-50-years/|title=Chart Shows the 4 Themes in Country Music Over 50 Years|last=Smith|first=Lindi|date=2016-05-03|website=Wide Open Country|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\nSongs about traditional dance halls, open roads, family farms and hometown bars, along with other illustrations of Texas landscape, are all found in present-day Texas country artists' catalogs.  The ties of landscape and music seem to serve as remembrance and gratitude, as evident in most songs.  Appreciation for surroundings is not the only limitation for this theme.  The \"average man\" and his struggle with nature do appear as well.  \"The songs definitely incorporate a spirit of the times and constitute a spontaneous and fairly comprehensive record of life\".<ref>Clayton, Lawrence. \"Elements of Realism in the Songs of the Cowboy.\" American Renaissance and American West. Ed. Durer, Christopher S. et al. WY: University of Wyoming, 1982.</ref>\n\nA few things Texas Country Music also have in common are topics that are in their songs such as Religion, Patriotism, Red Neck Lifestyles, and Nostalgia. Religion tends to play a big role in Country Music since its roots are in religion \u2013 being born from Traditional Southern Folk and Gospel music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/music/the-ten-biggest-tropes-in-country-music-5694846|title=The ten biggest tropes in country music|last=Rogers|first=Ashley|date=2013-09-05|website=Westword|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> Patriotism is also big since they love to talk about how much they love their country. For example, \"[[American Soldier (song)|American Soldier]]\" by [[Toby Keith]] is a great example of patriotism being expressed. Texas Country also involves singing about \"redneck lifestyles\" which includes their country living with trucks, tractors, fishing, and guns. Nostalgia is also considered a characteristic that most songs Country songs have.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origination===\n\nCountry Music from Texas has been popular since the spread of the cowboy culture in the late 1800s. Texas helped popularize Country Music through the world and the state\u2019s rich and varied traditions continue to redefine Country Music.<ref>Hartman, Gary. The History of Texas Music. N.p.: Texas A&M University Press, 2008. Print.</ref>\n\nTexas Country's roots lie in the [[Outlaw country]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  Texan artists such as [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[David Allan Coe]] retreated from the Nashville Country Music scene to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Luckenbach, Texas|Luckenbach]], [[College station, tx|College Station]] and [[Houston]]. Other artists who were inspired by this movement included performers like [[Guy Clark]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], Gary P. Nunn [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Joe Ely]], [[Terry Allen (country singer)|Terry Allen]], [[Steve Earle]],  and [[Townes Van Zandt]]. All these stars have rated higher than 43 on the Texas Music Scene charts{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.\n\nThese artists were followed in turn by the work of singer-songwriters such as [[Pat Green]], [[Robert Earl Keen]], [[Max Stalling]], [[Wade Bowen]] and [[Cory Morrow]].\n\nWhile the genre has roots in Texas, Oklahoma artists such as [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers|Jason Boland]], [[Stoney LaRue]], [[Mike McClure]], and [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] have had a major influence on Texas Country. For this reason, \"Red Dirt Music\" is becoming a more popular term for the genre to pay homage to its Oklahoma influence. The term was coined in reference to the miles of red dirt that is common throughout the two states.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Robert Earl Keen]]'s ''[[No. 2 Live Dinner]]'', released in 1996, had it all; comedy accompanied with \"a sharp wit, a laid-back cowboy style, and an eye for detail... combined in [his] songs that are as easy on the ears as they are packed with insight\".<ref>Wolff, Kurt.  ''Country Music: The Rough Guide.''  London: Rough Guides Ltd, 2000.</ref>  Keen's home calling came after a short stint in Nashville, where he quickly became uncomfortable.  His 1996 live album release truly showcased the \u201cwide range\u201d of the talented Texas musician and popularized the single \"The Road Goes On Forever\", a song many music fans regard as the paradigm for Texas 'Country anthems'. [[Joe Ely]] and other Texas musicians have recorded cover versions of \u201cThe Road Goes On Forever\u201d.\n<!--\n RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE REMOVAL:\n no reference to verify these claims can be located.\nThe 1998 release of [[Roger Creager]]\u2019s ''Having Fun All Wrong'' had an immediate impact on the Texas scene.  \u201cThe Everclear Song\u201d reached \u201chit single\u201d status when it quickly spread across Texas college towns and has often been called \"The Anthem of Texas Country.\"{{Fact|date=July 2007}}.\n-->\n\n===2000s and the Texas influence in Nashville===\n\n[[Cory Morrow]], a [[Houston]] native, had been on the Texas scene since the mid-90s. With the release of his fourth album ''Outside the Lines'', Morrow found more mainstream success on the Country Music charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbec.com/texas-music-facts-tales/|title=Texas Music Facts and Some Tales|last=kbec|date=2017-10-24|website=KBEC 1390|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[Pat Green]], also an artist from Texas, began his career as part of the Texas Country scene later went on to widespread commercial success with gold album ''[[Wave on Wave]]'' after switching to a  \"Shania Twain/ Garth Brooks\" Nashville style of Country Music.  The album's title track hit No. 3 on the U.S. ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart and won a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Country Song.\n\n[[Kevin Fowler]], a former hair-metal/glam rocker was [[Dangerous Toys]] guitarist from the late 1980s until 1993, followed by his own founding of Thunderfoot, a Southern rock band based out of Austin. Originally from [[Amarillo]], he self-released his country debut album ''One For The Road'' in 1997. This followed with his smash independent follow-up album, ''Beer, Bait, and Ammo''.  He has since found national success, on a major label.\n\nTexas Country's influence continues to be felt in the mainstream music genre with artists such as [[Jack Ingram]], who had already established a name for himself in Texas Country, who won a [[CMT Music Award]] in 2007 and the 2008 [[Academy of Country Music]] award for New Male Vocalist of the Year.  He has also scored top 25 singles on ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart with songs such as \"[[Love You (Jack Ingram song)|Love You]]\" and his cover of [[Hinder|Hinder's]] \"[[Lips of an Angel]]\".  Another one of his singles, \"[[Wherever You Are (Jack Ingram song)|Wherever You Are]]\", went to number one on the Billboard Chart.\n\nMany independent artists, which is the fastest growing segment of the global recorded music business, <ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissamdaniels/2019/07/10/for-independent-musicians-goingyour-own-way-is-finally-starting-to-pay-off/#45980f4f14f2</ref> have gained commercial success through the Texas music scene, such as albums debuting in the Top 5 of Billboard's Top Country Album sales. <ref>https://www.houstonpress.com/music/indie-texas-country-artists-racking-up-major-league-sales-8721118</ref>\n\n==Radio stations==\nTexas Country is unique in that radio stations throughout Texas have embraced the subgenre and regularly mix Texas country into a Country radio format:\n\n===Internet===\n*[[Texas Country Mix (Internet Radio)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.txcountrymix.com/|title=Texas Country Mix (Internet Radio)}}</ref>\n*[[GotRadio Texas Best (Internet Radio)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gotradio.com/|title=GotRadio Texas Best (Internet Radio)}}</ref>\n\n===Terrestrial (AM/FM)===\n*[[KBSO|KBSO 94.7 Corpus Christi, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://947jalapenocountry.com|title=KBSO 94.7 Corpus Christi, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KFLP-FM|KFLP 106.1 Floydada/Plainview/Lubbock, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://1061flipfm.com|title=KFLP 106.1 Floydada/Plainview/Lubbock, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KFWR|KFWR 95.9 Fort Worth, Texas]]\n*[[KFYN|KFYN 104.3 Paris, Texas]]\n*[[KILT|KILT 100.3 HD3 Houston, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thebull.radio.com|title=KILT 100.3 HD3 Houston, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KKBQ|KKBQ 92.9 HD3 Pasadena, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thenew93q.com|title=KKBQ 92.9 HD3 Pasadena, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KKCN|KKCN 103.1 San Angelo, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://103kkcn.com|title=KKCN 103.1 San Angelo, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KNBT|KNBT 92.1 New Braunfels, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knbt.fm|title=KNBT 92.1 New Braunfels, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KOLI|KOLI 94.9 Wichita Falls, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://949theoutlaw.com|title=KOLI 94.9 Wichita Falls, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KOKE|KOKE 99.3/98.5 Austin, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kokefm.com|title=KOKE 99.3/98.5 Austin, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KORA|KORA 98.3 Bryan/College Station, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://983korafm.com|title=KORA 98.3 Bryan/College Station, Texas}}</ref>\n*[[KPLX|KPLX 99.5 Dallas/Ft.

Texas Country is known for fusing [[Neotraditional country|neotraditional country]] with the outspoken, care-free views of [[outlaw country]]. Texas Country blends these sub-genres with a [[common people|\"common working man\"]] theme and witty undertones, these often combine with a stripped down music sound.\n\nNeither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas Country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene as the genre tends to be anti-Nashville. The genre differentiates from Nashville country with its rejection of pop influences that is found in Nashville Country recently, but does not necessarily mean the artist/group is Texas based.  For example, [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] is considered by some to be a Texas Country musician, despite his [[Kentucky]] ties. [[Adam Hood]], an [[Alabama]] native, also has had success in the genre. Even international musicians, such as [[Alberta, Canada]] native [[Corb Lund]], have been successful in the Texas Country scene. This just shows how many musicians all over the world have adopted the Texas sound.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n{{unsourced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] is essential in Texas Country Music. However, the use of [[electric guitar]]s, [[steel guitar]]s or [[pedal steel guitar]]s in the genre is not uncommon. [[bass guitar|Bass]] and [[percussion]] are used in live performances. The sounds of [[piano]], [[baritone guitar]], [[banjo]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]] or [[harmonica]] on studio recordings are the norm for the genre.\n\n==Vocals==\nThe line of delineation for vocals is unclear. Traditionally, the Texas Country scene has been a male dominated genre, however many women have had chart success in recent years. The Texas \"anthem\" is a common song type, referencing and sometimes embellishing on the different positive characteristics of the state. Many of these types of songs have been popular on the Texas Music Charts.<ref>[http://www.countryradioclassics.com/index.php/2007/09/21/texas-national-anthem-voting/ TX National Anthem voting ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703153140/http://www.countryradioclassics.com/index.php/2007/09/21/texas-national-anthem-voting |date=2008-07-03 }} (sponsored by Lone-Star Beer company)</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\nThe live performance is at the very root of the Texas Country scene.  Enthusiasm is the best descriptor for both band and crowd at a live Texas Country performance. \"It is not an uncommon sight to see clubs all over Texas packed to the rafters; girls and boys in cowboy hats and [[Wrangler Jeans|Wranglers]] [[Country-western two-step|two-step]]ping next to the mosh pit, where [[frat boy|college boys or \"Man Fans\"]] in khakis and college girls pressed up against the stage\".<ref>Lone Star Music. Kevin Fowler Biography. [http://www.lonestarmusic.com/biography.asp?id=86 November 9, 2006] LoneStar Music.</ref> An important factor Texas Country's success is in the frequency of live performances. It is not uncommon for a Texas Country band to tour 200+ dates a year, all, or nearly all, in the State of Texas{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. This allows the fan to attend a band's show more often, thus interacting with the music on a more personal level.\nPopular venues include, [[Gruene Hall]] (Gruene), [[Billy Bob's]] (Ft. Worth), [http://www.cowboysdancehall.com/dallas/ Cowboys Red River]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cowboysdancehall.com/|title=Cowboys Dancehall: Dallas and San Antonio|website=CowboysDancehall.com|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref> (Dallas and San Antonio), John T.

The winners in 25 categories are nominated and voted on by fans, friends and industry professionals and are awarded the night of the show.  The voting membership has grown to over 32,000 voting members in five years and continues to expand every year.  The awards show is open to the public and fans alike who cheer on their favorite artist/entertainers and radio stations.  Information about the show and voting procedures can be found at https://trrma.net/\n\n==Themes==\nLyrical content is the backbone of Texas country. [[Willie Nelson]], a legendary Country Music Outlaw, inspired his friend [[Waylon Jennings]], an outlaw country music legend himself, who is sometimes cited as an inspiration to present day Texas country musicians, to say, \u201cYour melody goes where the words take you\u201d.<ref>Jennings, Waylon and [[Lenny Kaye]].  ''Waylon: An Autobiography.''  New York: Warner Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nThere are 4 different types of themes in Country Music. These include the following categories: \"It's All Over\" (songs with a core theme of loss or regret), It's Not Working Out (songs with a focus on frustration over a relationship), \"Love and Devotion\" (sappy love songs) and \"The Right Way to Live\" (songs with a dominant theme of pride and homespun wisdom).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/chart-shows-4-themes-country-songs-50-years/|title=Chart Shows the 4 Themes in Country Music Over 50 Years|last=Smith|first=Lindi|date=2016-05-03|website=Wide Open Country|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\nSongs about traditional dance halls, open roads, family farms and hometown bars, along with other illustrations of Texas landscape, are all found in present-day Texas country artists' catalogs.  The ties of landscape and music seem to serve as remembrance and gratitude, as evident in most songs.  Appreciation for surroundings is not the only limitation for this theme.  The \"average man\" and his struggle with nature do appear as well.  \"The songs definitely incorporate a spirit of the times and constitute a spontaneous and fairly comprehensive record of life\".<ref>Clayton, Lawrence. \"Elements of Realism in the Songs of the Cowboy.\" American Renaissance and American West. Ed. Durer, Christopher S. et al. WY: University of Wyoming, 1982.</ref>\n\nA few things Texas Country Music also have in common are topics that are in their songs such as Religion, Patriotism, Red Neck Lifestyles, and Nostalgia. Religion tends to play a big role in Country Music since its roots are in religion \u2013 being born from Traditional Southern Folk and Gospel music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/music/the-ten-biggest-tropes-in-country-music-5694846|title=The ten biggest tropes in country music|last=Rogers|first=Ashley|date=2013-09-05|website=Westword|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> Patriotism is also big since they love to talk about how much they love their country. For example, \"[[American Soldier (song)|American Soldier]]\" by [[Toby Keith]] is a great example of patriotism being expressed. Texas Country also involves singing about \"redneck lifestyles\" which includes their country living with trucks, tractors, fishing, and guns. Nostalgia is also considered a characteristic that most songs Country songs have.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origination===\n\nCountry Music from Texas has been popular since the spread of the cowboy culture in the late 1800s. Texas helped popularize Country Music through the world and the state\u2019s rich and varied traditions continue to redefine Country Music.<ref>Hartman, Gary. The History of Texas Music. N.p.: Texas A&M University Press, 2008. Print.</ref>\n\nTexas Country's roots lie in the [[Outlaw country]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  Texan artists such as [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[David Allan Coe]] retreated from the Nashville Country Music scene to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Luckenbach, Texas|Luckenbach]], [[College station, tx|College Station]] and [[Houston]]. Other artists who were inspired by this movement included performers like [[Guy Clark]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], Gary P. Nunn [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Joe Ely]], [[Terry Allen (country singer)|Terry Allen]], [[Steve Earle]],  and [[Townes Van Zandt]]. All these stars have rated higher than 43 on the Texas Music Scene charts{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.\n\nThese artists were followed in turn by the work of singer-songwriters such as [[Pat Green]], [[Robert Earl Keen]], [[Max Stalling]], [[Wade Bowen]] and [[Cory Morrow]].\n\nWhile the genre has roots in Texas, Oklahoma artists such as [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers|Jason Boland]], [[Stoney LaRue]], [[Mike McClure]], and [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] have had a major influence on Texas Country. For this reason, \"Red Dirt Music\" is becoming a more popular term for the genre to pay homage to its Oklahoma influence. The term was coined in reference to the miles of red dirt that is common throughout the two states.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Robert Earl Keen]]'s ''[[No. 2 Live Dinner]]'', released in 1996, had it all; comedy accompanied with \"a sharp wit, a laid-back cowboy style, and an eye for detail... combined in [his] songs that are as easy on the ears as they are packed with insight\".<ref>Wolff, Kurt.  ''Country Music: The Rough Guide.''  London: Rough Guides Ltd, 2000.</ref>  Keen's home calling came after a short stint in Nashville, where he quickly became uncomfortable.  His 1996 live album release truly showcased the \u201cwide range\u201d of the talented Texas musician and popularized the single \"The Road Goes On Forever\", a song many music fans regard as the paradigm for Texas 'Country anthems'. [[Joe Ely]] and other Texas musicians have recorded cover versions of \u201cThe Road Goes On Forever\u201d.\n<!--\n RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE REMOVAL:\n no reference to verify these claims can be located.\nThe 1998 release of [[Roger Creager]]\u2019s ''Having Fun All Wrong'' had an immediate impact on the Texas scene.  \u201cThe Everclear Song\u201d reached \u201chit single\u201d status when it quickly spread across Texas college towns and has often been called \"The Anthem of Texas Country.\"{{Fact|date=July 2007}}.\n-->\n\n===2000s and the Texas influence in Nashville===\n\n[[Cory Morrow]], a [[Houston]] native, had been on the Texas scene since the mid-90s. With the release of his fourth album ''Outside the Lines'', Morrow found more mainstream success on the Country Music charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kbec.com/texas-music-facts-tales/|title=Texas Music Facts and Some Tales|last=kbec|date=2017-10-24|website=KBEC 1390|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[Pat Green]], also an artist from Texas, began his career as part of the Texas Country scene later went on to widespread commercial success with gold album ''[[Wave on Wave]]'' after switching to a  \"Shania Twain/ Garth Brooks\" Nashville style of Country Music.  The album's title track hit No. 3 on the U.S. ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart and won a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Country Song.\n\n[[Kevin Fowler]], a former hair-metal/glam rocker was [[Dangerous Toys]] guitarist from the late 1980s until 1993, followed by his own founding of Thunderfoot, a Southern rock band based out of Austin. Originally from [[Amarillo]], he self-released his country debut album ''One For The Road'' in 1997. This followed with his smash independent follow-up album, ''Beer, Bait, and Ammo''.  He has since found national success, on a major label.\n\nTexas Country's influence continues to be felt in the mainstream music genre with artists such as [[Jack Ingram]], who had already established a name for himself in Texas Country, who won a [[CMT Music Award]] in 2007 and the 2008 [[Academy of Country Music]] award for New Male Vocalist of the Year.  He has also scored top 25 singles on ''Billboard's'' Hot Country Songs chart with songs such as \"[[Love You (Jack Ingram song)|Love You]]\" and his cover of [[Hinder|Hinder's]] \"[[Lips of an Angel]]\".

{"title_page": "Intertidal zone", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Foreshore|the area in Cape Town, South Africa|Foreshore, Cape Town}}\n{{short description|Area of coast exposed only at low tide}}\n{{Broader|Littoral zone}}\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2011}}\n{{ocean habitat topics|image=[[File:Newport beach.jpg|250px]]|caption=The rocky shoreline of [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], USA, showing a clear line where high tide occurs.}}\n\nThe '''intertidal zone''', also known as the '''foreshore''' or '''[[coast|seashore]]''', is the area that is above [[water level]] at low [[tide]] and [[underwater]] at high tide (in other words, the area within the [[tidal range]]). This area can include several types of [[marine habitat|habitats]] with various species of [[marine life|life]], such as [[seastars]], [[sea urchin]]s, and many species of [[coral]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Sometimes it is referred to as the [[littoral zone]], although that can be defined as a wider region.\n\n[[File:Bancao Beach at Low Tide showing Intertidal Zone from about 200 meters from the beach.jpg|thumb|Bancao Beach at low tide, showing the intertidal zone about 200 m from the beach]]\n\nThe well-known area also includes steep rocky [[cliff]]s, sandy [[beach]]es, or [[wetlands]] (e.g., vast [[mudflat]]s). The area can be a narrow strip, as in [[Pacific island]]s that have only a narrow tidal range, or can include many meters of shoreline where shallow beach slopes interact with high tidal excursion. The '''peritidal zone''' is similar but somewhat wider, extending from above the highest tide level to below the lowest.\n\nOrganisms in the intertidal zone are adapted to an environment of harsh extremes. The intertidal zone is also home to several species from different [[phylum|phyla]] ([[Porifera]], [[Annelida]], [[Coelenterata]], [[Mollusca]], [[Arthropoda]], etc.). Water is available regularly with the tides, but varies from fresh with [[rain]] to highly [[seawater|saline]] and dry [[salt]],  with drying between tidal inundations. [[ocean surface wave|Wave]] splash can dislodge residents from the littoral zone. With the intertidal zone's high exposure to [[sunlight]], the [[temperature]] can range from very hot with full [[sunshine]] to near freezing in colder climates. Some [[microclimate]]s in the littoral zone are moderated by local features and larger plants such as [[mangrove]]s. [[Adaptation]] in the littoral zone allows the use of [[nutrient]]s supplied in high volume on a regular basis from the [[sea]], which is actively moved to the zone by tides. Edges of habitats, in this case land and sea, are themselves often significant [[ecosystem|ecologies]], and the littoral zone is a prime example.\n\nA typical [[rocky shore]] can be divided into a spray zone or splash zone (also known as the [[Littoral zone#Supralittoral zone|supratidal zone]]), which is above the spring high-tide line and is covered by water only during storms, and an intertidal zone, which lies between the high and low tidal extremes. Along most [[shore]]s, the intertidal zone can be clearly separated into the following subzones: high tide zone, middle tide zone, and low tide zone. The intertidal zone is one of a number of [[marine biome]]s or [[habitat]]s, including [[estuary]], [[neritic zone|neritic]], [[photic zone|surface]], and [[profundal zone|deep zones]].\n\n==Zonation==\n[[Image:Tide pools at Pillar Point 7.jpg|thumb|upright|Tide pools at Pillar Point showing zonation on the edge of the rock ledge]]\n[[Image:Intertide zonation at Kalaloch.jpg|thumb|upright|A rock, seen at low tide, exhibiting typical intertidal zonation, Kalaloch, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], western United States.]]\nMarine biologists divide the intertidal region into three zones (low, middle, and high), based on the overall average exposure of the zone.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-intertidal-zone.html|title=What is the Intertidal Zone?|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref> The low intertidal zone, which borders on the shallow subtidal zone, is only exposed to air at the lowest of low tides and is primarily marine in character. The mid intertidal zone is regularly exposed and submerged by average tides. The high intertidal zone is only covered by the highest of the high tides, and spends much of its time as terrestrial habitat. The high intertidal zone borders on the [[Supralittoral zone|splash zone]] (the region above the highest still-tide level, but which receives wave splash). On shores exposed to heavy [[wave action]], the intertidal zone will be influenced by waves, as the spray from breaking waves will extend the intertidal zone.\n\nDepending on the substratum and topography of the shore, additional features may be noticed. On [[rocky shore]]s, [[tide pool]]s form in depressions that fill with water as the tide rises. Under certain conditions, such as those at [[Morecambe Bay]], [[quicksand]] may form.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/feb/12/thisweekssciencequestions|title=Why is Morecambe Bay so dangerous?|last=|first=|date=|work=The Guardian|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Low tide zone (lower littoral) ==\nThis subregion is mostly submerged - it is only exposed at the point of low tide and for a longer period of time during extremely low tides. This area is teeming with life;<ref name=\":2\" /> the most notable difference with this subregion to the other three is that there is much more marine vegetation, especially [[seaweed]]s. There is also a great biodiversity. Organisms in this zone generally are not well adapted to periods of dryness and temperature extremes. Some of the organisms in this area are [[abalone]], [[sea anemone]]s, [[brown seaweed]], [[chiton]]s, [[crab]]s, [[green algae]], [[hydroid (zoology)|hydroids]], [[isopod]]s, [[limpet]]s, [[mussel]]s, [[nudibranch]]s, [[sculpin]], [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]], [[sea lettuce]], [[sea palm]]s, [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[shrimp]], [[snail]]s, [[sponge]]s, [[Phyllospadix scouleri|surf grass]], [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]], and [[whelk]]s. Creatures in this area can grow to larger sizes because there is more available [[energy]] in the localized ecosystem. Also, marine vegetation can grow to much greater sizes than in the other three intertidal subregions due to the better water coverage. The water is shallow enough to allow plenty of [[sunlight|light]] to reach the vegetation to allow substantial [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activity, and the [[salinity]] is at almost normal levels. This area is also protected from large [[predator]]s such as [[fish]] because of the wave action and the relatively shallow water.\n\n==Ecology==\n{{Main|Intertidal ecology}}\n{{See also|Intertidal fish|Tide pool}}\n[[Image:Pteropurpura trialata is laying the eggs 1.jpg|thumb|A [[California]] tide pool in the low tide zone]]\nThe intertidal region is an important model system for the study of [[ecology]], especially on wave-swept rocky shores. The region contains a high diversity of species, and the zonation created by the tides causes species ranges to be compressed into very narrow bands. This makes it relatively simple to study species across their entire cross-shore range, something that can be extremely difficult in, for instance, terrestrial habitats that can stretch thousands of kilometres. Communities on wave-swept shores also have high turnover due to disturbance, so it is possible to watch ecological succession over years rather than decades.\n\nThe burrowing invertebrates that make up large portions of sandy beach ecosystems are known to travel relatively great distances in cross-shore directions as beaches change on the order of days, semilunar cycles, seasons, or years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Dugan|first=Jenifer E.|last2=Hubbard|first2=David M.|last3=Quigley|first3=Brenna J.|year=2013|title=Beyond beach width: Steps toward identifying and integrating ecological envelopes with geomorphic features and datums for sandy beach ecosystems|url=|journal=Geomorphology|volume=199|pages=95\u2013105|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.04.043}}</ref> The distribution of some species has been found to correlate strongly with geomorphic datums such as the high tide strand and the water table outcrop.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSince the foreshore is alternately covered by the sea and exposed to the air, organisms living in this environment must have adaptions for both wet and dry conditions. Hazards include being smashed or carried away by rough waves, exposure to dangerously high temperatures, and desiccation. Typical inhabitants of the intertidal rocky shore include [[Sea urchin|urchins]], [[sea anemone]]s, [[barnacle]]s, chitons, crabs, [[isopods]], mussels, [[starfish]], and many marine [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s such as limpets and whelks.\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{see also|Public trust doctrine}}\n\nAs with the dry sand part of a beach, legal and political disputes can arise over the ownership and use of the foreshore. One recent example is the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy]]. In legal discussions, the foreshore is often referred to as the ''wet-sand area''.\n\nFor privately owned beaches in the United States, some states such as [[Massachusetts]] use the low water mark as the dividing line between the property of the State and that of the beach owner, however the public still has fishing, fowling, and navigation right to the zone between low and high water.<ref>https://www.mass.gov/service-details/public-rights-along-the-shoreline</ref> Other states such as California use the high-water mark.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the foreshore is generally deemed to be owned by the [[The Crown|Crown]] although there are notable exceptions, especially what are termed ''several fisheries'', which can be historic deeds to title, dating back to [[John of England|King John]]'s time or earlier, and the [[Udal Law]], which applies generally in [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]].\n\nIn Greece, according to the L. 2971/01, the foreshore zone is defined as the area of the coast that might be reached by the maximum climbing of the waves on the coast (maximum wave run-up on the coast) in their maximum capacity (maximum referring to the \"usually maximum winter waves\" and of course not to exceptional cases, such as tsunamis etc.). The foreshore zone, apart of the exceptions of the law, is public, and permanent constructions are not allowed on it.\n\n==Other media==\n''The Intertidal Zone'' was used as a title for [[Stephen Hillenburg]]'s old comic strip.

Along most [[shore]]s, the intertidal zone can be clearly separated into the following subzones: high tide zone, middle tide zone, and low tide zone. The intertidal zone is one of a number of [[marine biome]]s or [[habitat]]s, including [[estuary]], [[neritic zone|neritic]], [[photic zone|surface]], and [[profundal zone|deep zones]].\n\n==Zonation==\n[[Image:Tide pools at Pillar Point 7.jpg|thumb|upright|Tide pools at Pillar Point showing zonation on the edge of the rock ledge]]\n[[Image:Intertide zonation at Kalaloch.jpg|thumb|upright|A rock, seen at low tide, exhibiting typical intertidal zonation, Kalaloch, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], western United States.]]\nMarine biologists divide the intertidal region into three zones (low, middle, and high), based on the overall average exposure of the zone.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-intertidal-zone.html|title=What is the Intertidal Zone?|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref> The low intertidal zone, which borders on the shallow subtidal zone, is only exposed to air at the lowest of low tides and is primarily marine in character. The mid intertidal zone is regularly exposed and submerged by average tides. The high intertidal zone is only covered by the highest of the high tides, and spends much of its time as terrestrial habitat. The high intertidal zone borders on the [[Supralittoral zone|splash zone]] (the region above the highest still-tide level, but which receives wave splash). On shores exposed to heavy [[wave action]], the intertidal zone will be influenced by waves, as the spray from breaking waves will extend the intertidal zone.\n\nDepending on the substratum and topography of the shore, additional features may be noticed. On [[rocky shore]]s, [[tide pool]]s form in depressions that fill with water as the tide rises. Under certain conditions, such as those at [[Morecambe Bay]], [[quicksand]] may form.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/feb/12/thisweekssciencequestions|title=Why is Morecambe Bay so dangerous?|last=|first=|date=|work=The Guardian|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Low tide zone (lower littoral) ==\nThis subregion is mostly submerged - it is only exposed at the point of low tide and for a longer period of time during extremely low tides. This area is teeming with life;<ref name=\":2\" /> the most notable difference with this subregion to the other three is that there is much more marine vegetation, especially [[seaweed]]s. There is also a great biodiversity. Organisms in this zone generally are not well adapted to periods of dryness and temperature extremes. Some of the organisms in this area are [[abalone]], [[sea anemone]]s, [[brown seaweed]], [[chiton]]s, [[crab]]s, [[green algae]], [[hydroid (zoology)|hydroids]], [[isopod]]s, [[limpet]]s, [[mussel]]s, [[nudibranch]]s, [[sculpin]], [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]], [[sea lettuce]], [[sea palm]]s, [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[shrimp]], [[snail]]s, [[sponge]]s, [[Phyllospadix scouleri|surf grass]], [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]], and [[whelk]]s. Creatures in this area can grow to larger sizes because there is more available [[energy]] in the localized ecosystem. Also, marine vegetation can grow to much greater sizes than in the other three intertidal subregions due to the better water coverage. The water is shallow enough to allow plenty of [[sunlight|light]] to reach the vegetation to allow substantial [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activity, and the [[salinity]] is at almost normal levels. This area is also protected from large [[predator]]s such as [[fish]] because of the wave action and the relatively shallow water.\n\n==Ecology==\n{{Main|Intertidal ecology}}\n{{See also|Intertidal fish|Tide pool}}\n[[Image:Pteropurpura trialata is laying the eggs 1.jpg|thumb|A [[California]] tide pool in the low tide zone]]\nThe intertidal region is an important model system for the study of [[ecology]], especially on wave-swept rocky shores. The region contains a high diversity of species, and the zonation created by the tides causes species ranges to be compressed into very narrow bands. This makes it relatively simple to study species across their entire cross-shore range, something that can be extremely difficult in, for instance, terrestrial habitats that can stretch thousands of kilometres. Communities on wave-swept shores also have high turnover due to disturbance, so it is possible to watch ecological succession over years rather than decades.\n\nThe burrowing invertebrates that make up large portions of sandy beach ecosystems are known to travel relatively great distances in cross-shore directions as beaches change on the order of days, semilunar cycles, seasons, or years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Dugan|first=Jenifer E.|last2=Hubbard|first2=David M.|last3=Quigley|first3=Brenna J.|year=2013|title=Beyond beach width: Steps toward identifying and integrating ecological envelopes with geomorphic features and datums for sandy beach ecosystems|url=|journal=Geomorphology|volume=199|pages=95\u2013105|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.04.043}}</ref> The distribution of some species has been found to correlate strongly with geomorphic datums such as the high tide strand and the water table outcrop.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSince the foreshore is alternately covered by the sea and exposed to the air, organisms living in this environment must have adaptions for both wet and dry conditions. Hazards include being smashed or carried away by rough waves, exposure to dangerously high temperatures, and desiccation. Typical inhabitants of the intertidal rocky shore include [[Sea urchin|urchins]], [[sea anemone]]s, [[barnacle]]s, chitons, crabs, [[isopods]], mussels, [[starfish]], and many marine [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s such as limpets and whelks.\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{see also|Public trust doctrine}}\n\nAs with the dry sand part of a beach, legal and political disputes can arise over the ownership and use of the foreshore. One recent example is the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy]]. In legal discussions, the foreshore is often referred to as the ''wet-sand area''.\n\nFor privately owned beaches in the United States, some states such as [[Massachusetts]] use the low water mark as the dividing line between the property of the State and that of the beach owner, however the public still has fishing, fowling, and navigation right to the zone between low and high water.<ref>https://www.mass.gov/service-details/public-rights-along-the-shoreline</ref> Other states such as California use the high-water mark.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the foreshore is generally deemed to be owned by the [[The Crown|Crown]] although there are notable exceptions, especially what are termed ''several fisheries'', which can be historic deeds to title, dating back to [[John of England|King John]]'s time or earlier, and the [[Udal Law]], which applies generally in [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]].\n\nIn Greece, according to the L. 2971/01, the foreshore zone is defined as the area of the coast that might be reached by the maximum climbing of the waves on the coast (maximum wave run-up on the coast) in their maximum capacity (maximum referring to the \"usually maximum winter waves\" and of course not to exceptional cases, such as tsunamis etc.). The foreshore zone, apart of the exceptions of the law, is public, and permanent constructions are not allowed on it.\n\n==Other media==\n''The Intertidal Zone'' was used as a title for [[Stephen Hillenburg]]'s old comic strip. The comic strip starred \"Bob The Sponge\", who became [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]].\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:CornishMussels.JPG|Mussels in the intertidal zone in [[Cornwall]], England.\nImage:CornishBarnacles.JPG|[[Barnacles]] and [[limpets]] in the intertidal zone near Newquay, Cornwall, England.\nImage:Micro-climate on rock at Sunrise-on- Sea.jpg|A [[tidal pool]] in the intertidal zone during low tide, Sunrise-on-Sea, [[South Africa]].\nImage:Life around stone at Sunrise-on-Sea.jpg|Unexplained crumbs of sand that appear to have been deposited around stone by escaping air.\nImage: Mussels Dalian.JPG|Rocks in intertidal zone completely covered by mussels, at Bangchuidao Scenic Area, [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning Province]], China.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ballantine Scale]]\n* [[Ecological forecasting]]\n* [[Littoral series]]\n* [[NaGISA]]\n* [[ShoreZone|Shorezone]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{EB1911 Poster|Foreshore}}\n*[http://www.enchantedlearning.com/biomes/intertidal/intertidal.shtml Enchanted Learning]\n*[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9048555 Enyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]\n*[http://www.nfb.ca/film/intertidal_zone/ Watch the online documentary ''The Intertidal Zone'']\n\n{{coastal geography}}\n\n[[Category:Aquatic ecology]]\n[[Category:Tides]]\n[[Category:Marine biology]]\n[[Category:Habitats]]\n[[Category:Coastal geography]]\n[[Category:Coastal and oceanic landforms]]\n[[Category:Fisheries science]]\n[[Category:Physical oceanography]]\n[[Category:Oceanographical terminology]]\n\n[[de:Watt (K\u00fcste)]]\n[[eo:Vado]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Fix typos for \"Encyclopedia\", replaced: Enyclop\u00e6dia \u2192 Encyclop\u00e6dia", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertidal_zone"}

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 DeLoreans were produced in total.\n\n==Sales and production==\n===Sales===\nPrior to the release of the DeLorean, there was a waiting list of anxious buyers, many of whom paid over [[List_price#Automobiles/motorcars|MSRP]], however that exuberance subsided very quickly and production output soon far exceeded sales volume.  October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> The DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained).

After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood.

To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n<gallery>\n|align=\n\nFile:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|Early pull strap\nFile:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|Later-style one-piece bolster\nFile:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|Mid-1981 silver wheel\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe Mock-up]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with Ital Design to have Giorgetto Giugiaro design the DeLorean Sports Car.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 DeLoreans were produced in total.\n\n==Sales and production==\n===Sales===\nPrior to the release of the DeLorean, there was a waiting list of anxious buyers, many of whom paid over [[List_price#Automobiles/motorcars|MSRP]], however that exuberance subsided very quickly and production output soon far exceeded sales volume.  October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> The DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel.

Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side.

Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n<gallery>\n|align=\n\nFile:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|Early pull strap\nFile:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|Later-style one-piece bolster\nFile:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|Mid-1981 silver wheel\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe Mock-up]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with Ital Design to have Giorgetto Giugiaro design the DeLorean Sports Car.
