He or she is nominated by both the [[Congress of Deputies]] and [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] through a [[Joint committee (legislative)|joint committee]] that chooses the candidate and proposes him or her to the Chambers. The candidate must be approved by three-fifths of both Chambers. If these qualified majorities are not reached, a new joint committee must to be formed to choose another candidate or to maintain the previous one but the second must to get in a second voting three fifths of the Congress and an absolute majority of the Senate. To be chosen ombudsman it is necessary to be a [[Spaniards|Spaniard]], adult and having the full enjoyment of one's civil and political rights.\n\nThe Ombudsman ceases by resignation, expiration of the term of appointment, by death or disability, by acting with gross negligence in compliance with the obligations and duties of the office or by having been convicted, by final judgment, for willful misconduct. In the case that the office is vacant, is the First Deputy Ombudsman who assumes the office as Acting Ombudsman.<ref name=LO81>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1981-10325|title=Organic Law 3/1981, of April 6, of the Ombudsman.|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==Prerogatives and incompatibilities==\n===Prerogatives===\nThe Ombudsman will not be receive instructions from any authority. It will carry out its functions independently and at its discretion.\n\nThe Ombudsman will enjoy [[absolute immunity]]. He can not be arrested, disciplined, fined, persecuted or judged on the basis of the opinions he formulates or the acts he performs in the exercise of the powers inherent to his position. In all other cases, and while he remains in the exercise of his functions, the Ombudsman can not be detained or retained except in the case of [[flagrante delicto]], corresponding to the decision on his indictment, imprisonment, prosecution and trial exclusively to the Criminal Room of the [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]].\n\nThe above rules will be applicable to the Deputy Ombudsmans in the performance of their duties.<ref name=LO81/>\n\n===Incompatibilities===\nThe condition of Ombudsman is incompatible with any representative mandate; with any political office or political propaganda activity; with the permanence in the active service of any [[Public Administration of Spain|Public Administration]]; with the affiliation to a political party or the performance of directive functions in a political party or in a union, association or foundation, and with the employment at the service of them; with the exercise of judicial and fiscal careers, and with any professional, liberal, mercantile or labor activity.\n\nThe Ombudsman must cease, within ten days following his appointment and before taking office, in any situation of incompatibility that may affect him, understanding otherwise that he does not accept the appointment.\n\nIf the incompatibility occurred once the position has been taken, it shall be understood that he resigns on the date on which it occurred.<ref name=LO81/>\n\n==Subordinates==\nThe Ombudsman is assisted by a First Deputy and a Second Deputy Ombudsman, in which he can delegate his functions and who will replace him by order, in the exercise of the same, in the cases of temporary impossibility and cessation. The Ombudsman shall appoint and separate his Deputies following the approval of the [[Cortes Generales]] in the manner determined by their Regulations. The Ombudsman may freely appoint the extra advisors necessary for the exercise of their functions, in accordance with the Regulations and within budgetary limits. People who are in the service of the Ombudsman are considered as a person at the service of the Cortes Generales.\n\nThe deputies and advisers will automatically cease at the moment of taking possession of a new Ombudsman.\n\nThe deputies have the same prerogatives and incompatibilities and the same requirements to be chosen Deputy Ombudsman as the Ombudsman.<ref name=LO81/>\n[[File:Palacio de los marqueses de Bermejilla del Rey.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Bermejillo]], the headquarters of the Ombudsman]]\n\n==Work area==\nThe Ombudsman not only looks after the fulfillment of the human rights in the [[General State Administration]] but also in the regional and local administrations. He or she can do so ''ex officio'' or by the request of a third party. When the Ombudsman receives complaints regarding the acting of the Administration of Justice, they should be redirected to the [[Prosecution Ministry|Public Prosecutor's Office]] so that the latter may investigate its reality and adopt the appropriate measures in accordance with the law, or transfer them to the [[General Council of the Judiciary]], according to the type of claim in question; all this without prejudice to the reference that in his general report to the Cortes Generales can do to the subject.\n\nThe Ombudsman will also ensure respect for the rights in the scope of the Military Administration, without it interfering in the command of the National Defense.\n\n===Coordination with regional ombudsmen===\nWith the evolution of the different regional administrations during the Spanish transition to democracy, numerous bodies similar to the Ombudsman were created and it was necessary to regulate the competences and relations between these bodies and the State Ombudsman and this was made by an Law in 1985.\n\nThe protection of the rights and freedoms in the regional level can be made in coordination between the regional Ombudsman and the State Ombudsman.

He or she is nominated by both the [[Congress of Deputies]] and [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] through a [[Joint committee (legislative)|joint committee]] that chooses the candidate and proposes him or her to the Chambers. The candidate must be approved by three-fifths of both Chambers. If these qualified majorities are not reached, a new joint committee must to be formed to choose another candidate or to maintain the previous one but the second must to get in a second voting three fifths of the Congress and an absolute majority of the Senate. To be chosen ombudsman it is necessary to be a [[Spaniards|Spaniard]], adult and having the full enjoyment of one's civil and political rights.\n\nThe Ombudsman ceases by resignation, expiration of the term of appointment, by death or disability, by acting with gross negligence in compliance with the obligations and duties of the office or by having been convicted, by final judgment, for willful misconduct. In the case that the office is vacant, is the First Deputy Ombudsman who assumes the office as Acting Ombudsman.<ref name=LO81>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1981-10325|title=Organic Law 3/1981, of April 6, of the Ombudsman.|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==Prerogatives and incompatibilities==\n===Prerogatives===\nThe Ombudsman will not be receive instructions from any authority. It will carry out its functions independently and at its discretion.\n\nThe Ombudsman will enjoy [[absolute immunity]]. He can not be arrested, disciplined, fined, persecuted or judged on the basis of the opinions he formulates or the acts he performs in the exercise of the powers inherent to his position. In all other cases, and while he remains in the exercise of his functions, the Ombudsman can not be detained or retained except in the case of [[flagrante delicto]], corresponding to the decision on his indictment, imprisonment, prosecution and trial exclusively to the Criminal Room of the [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]].\n\nThe above rules will be applicable to the Deputy Ombudsmans in the performance of their duties.<ref name=LO81/>\n\n===Incompatibilities===\nThe condition of Ombudsman is incompatible with any representative mandate; with any political office or political propaganda activity; with the permanence in the active service of any [[Public Administration of Spain|Public Administration]]; with the affiliation to a political party or the performance of directive functions in a political party or in a union, association or foundation, and with the employment at the service of them; with the exercise of judicial and fiscal careers, and with any professional, liberal, mercantile or labor activity.\n\nThe Ombudsman must cease, within ten days following his appointment and before taking office, in any situation of incompatibility that may affect him, understanding otherwise that he does not accept the appointment.\n\nIf the incompatibility occurred once the position has been taken, it shall be understood that he resigns on the date on which it occurred.<ref name=LO81/>\n\n==Subordinates==\nThe Ombudsman is assisted by a First Deputy and a Second Deputy Ombudsman, in which he can delegate his functions and who will replace him by order, in the exercise of the same, in the cases of temporary impossibility and cessation. The Ombudsman shall appoint and separate his Deputies following the approval of the [[Cortes Generales]] in the manner determined by their Regulations. The Ombudsman may freely appoint the extra advisors necessary for the exercise of their functions, in accordance with the Regulations and within budgetary limits. People who are in the service of the Ombudsman are considered as a person at the service of the Cortes Generales.\n\nThe deputies and advisers will automatically cease at the moment of taking possession of a new Ombudsman.\n\nThe deputies have the same prerogatives and incompatibilities and the same requirements to be chosen Deputy Ombudsman as the Ombudsman.<ref name=LO81/>\n[[File:Palacio de los marqueses de Bermejilla del Rey.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Bermejillo]], the headquarters of the Ombudsman]]\n\n==Work area==\nThe Ombudsman not only looks after the fulfillment of the human rights in the [[General State Administration]] but also in the regional and local administrations. He or she can do so ''ex officio'' or by the request of a third party. When the Ombudsman receives complaints regarding the acting of the Administration of Justice, they should be redirected to the [[Prosecution Ministry|Public Prosecutor's Office]] so that the latter may investigate its reality and adopt the appropriate measures in accordance with the law, or transfer them to the [[General Council of the Judiciary]], according to the type of claim in question; all this without prejudice to the reference that in his general report to the Cortes Generales can do to the subject.\n\nThe Ombudsman will also ensure respect for the rights in the scope of the Military Administration, without it interfering in the command of the National Defense.\n\n===Coordination with regional ombudsmen===\nWith the evolution of the different regional administrations during the Spanish transition to democracy, numerous bodies similar to the Ombudsman were created and it was necessary to regulate the competences and relations between these bodies and the State Ombudsman and this was made by an Law in 1985.\n\nThe protection of the rights and freedoms in the regional level can be made in coordination between the regional Ombudsman and the State Ombudsman. If the administration who made the violation of human rights is the State Administration acting in the region, the State Ombudsman has priority but may ask for assistance of the regional ombudsman in order to be more efficient as well as giving him a copy of the final report with the investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1985-23210|title=Law 36/1985, of November 6, which regulates the relations between the Institution of the Ombudsman and similar figures in the different Autonomous Communities.|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==List of Ombudsmans==\n; Status\n{{legend|#E6E6AA|Denotes service as [[acting (law)|acting]] Ombudsmans|border=black}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:right; text-align:center\"\n!No.\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n!1\u00ba\n|[[File:Joaqu\u00edn Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez recibido por Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez.jpg|75px]]\n|[[Joaqu\u00edn Ruiz-Gim\u00e9nez]]<br/><small>(1913&ndash;2009)</small>\n|30 December 1982\n|30 December 1987\n|- bgcolor=\"#e6e6aa\"\n!-\n|[[File:(\u00c1lvaro Gil-Robles) Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez conversa con el defensor del Pueblo.

His accuracy and ability to hit shot after shot perfectly straight gave him the nickname \"Pipeline Moe\".<ref name=\"cbc2019\">{{cite news |last=Giddens |first=David |title=Moe Norman: Golf's misunderstood genius |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sportslongform/entry/moe-norman-golfs-misunderstood-genius |accessdate=April 14, 2019 |publisher=CBC Sports |date=April 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada, Norman developed his golf from childhood at the Rockway municipal course in that city, starting as a [[caddie]] in his pre-teen years.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> He refined his skills competing against talented area players such as [[Gary Cowan]] and Gerry Kesselring. He won back-to-back Canadian Amateur Championships in 1955 and 1956.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> He turned professional in 1957 and played briefly on the [[PGA Tour]], but due to [[shyness]], [[bullying]] he encountered from certain pros, and a preference to stay in Canada, he stayed primarily in [[Ontario]] rather than travel extensively outside Canada.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> In the 80s, Norman also played several events on the [[Senior PGA Tour]].\n\nNorman's play, along with his way of dressing  were both described as unconventional. He devised what is known as \"The Single Plane Golf Swing\" \u2014- rigid arms extended far from his body, a very wide stance with minimal knee bend, shorter-than-usual backswing and extended follow-through with minimal hand action, which produced amazingly accurate ball placement.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> He played extremely fast, sometimes not slowing to line up his putts. He was inducted into the [[Canadian Golf Hall of Fame]] in 1995. He was self-taught and never took a golf lesson.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/>\n\nNorman was known for sometimes unconventional behavior on the course.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> It is said that on one hole his caddie told him he could get to the green with a driver and a 9-iron. Naturally, he hit off the tee with his 9-iron and then hit the green with his driver. In another event, rather than lay up short of a creek hazard which could not be carried, he bounced his drive across the bridge which crossed the creek.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/>\n\nNorman's skills as a ball striker are legendary. [[Sam Snead]] described Norman as the greatest striker of the ball. In January 2005, [[Tiger Woods]], the biggest golf star of the modern era, told ''[[Golf Digest]]'''s Jaime Diaz that only two golfers in history have \"owned their swings\": Moe Norman and [[Ben Hogan]].<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> Stated Woods, \"I want to own mine.\" Late in his life, Norman found better financial security when Natural Golf, an instruction company, and [[Titleist]], a major golf manufacturer, signed him to a lifetime contract after he allegedly told a reporter, \"Titleist never did nothing for me.\" Moe would often perform golf exhibitions across Canada &ndash;  Wally Uihlein, president of Titleist considered Moe's lifetime contract a \"Reverse Scholarship\".\n\nIn retrospect, no one will ever see a performance \"better\" than Moe Norman delivered at Swing Clinics in his later years. Moe may not have expressed his \"Swing Science\" as well as we might wish, but --like Ben Hogan-- there is little doubt the \"Cubic Swing Science\" he found via \"Trail & Error\" will live on for as long as golf is played. -- A True Pioneer Worthy Of Much Respect!\n\n\nNorman died in a [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] hospital from [[congestive heart failure]], having suffered from the condition since [[heart bypass]] surgery six years earlier. He also had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] two years before his death.\n\n==Career highlights==\n* [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] winner (1955, 1956)<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/>\n* 55 career [[Canadian Tour]] and other Canadian event victories\n* [[Canadian PGA Championship]] winner (1966, 1974)<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/>\n* Canadian PGA Seniors' Championship winner (1979\u20131985, 1987)\n* 33 course records\n* 17 holes-in-one<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/>\n* Several exhibition rounds under 60 ([[lowest rounds of golf]])\n* Inducted into the [[Canadian Golf Hall of Fame]] in 1995\n* Inducted into the [[Ontario Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1999<ref>{{cite web |title=Moe Norman |url=http://oshof.ca/index.php/honoured-members/item/61-moe-norman |publisher=Ontario Sports Hall of Fame |accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref>\n* Inducted into the [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2006\n* Two appearances by invitation as an amateur in the [[Masters Tournament]]: 1956 scored 75-78 then withdrew; 1957 scored 77-74 to miss the cut by one stroke\n\n==PGA career==\nAccording to [[ESPN]], Norman played the PGA Tour beginning in 1959. After a tournament in New Orleans, PGA officials gave Norman a dressing down regarding his playing antics. Feeling let down by the PGA's attitude towards him, Norman returned to Canada to play golf.\n\nAccording to the [[PGA Tour]] web site, the following is Norman's record on the PGA Tour: \n* 27 total events played, with 25 cuts made\n* 1 top ten finish and 7 top 25 finishes\n* $7,139 in tournament prize money\n\nAdditionally, Norman played on the [[Senior PGA Tour]] events from 1981 to 1984.

His accuracy and ability to hit shot after shot perfectly straight gave him the nickname \"Pipeline Moe\".<ref name=\"cbc2019\">{{cite news |last=Giddens |first=David |title=Moe Norman: Golf's misunderstood genius |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sportslongform/entry/moe-norman-golfs-misunderstood-genius |accessdate=April 14, 2019 |publisher=CBC Sports |date=April 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada, Norman developed his golf from childhood at the Rockway municipal course in that city, starting as a [[caddie]] in his pre-teen years.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> He refined his skills competing against talented area players such as [[Gary Cowan]] and Gerry Kesselring. He won back-to-back Canadian Amateur Championships in 1955 and 1956.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> He turned professional in 1957 and played briefly on the [[PGA Tour]], but due to [[shyness]], [[bullying]] he encountered from certain pros, and a preference to stay in Canada, he stayed primarily in [[Ontario]] rather than travel extensively outside Canada.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> In the 80s, Norman also played several events on the [[Senior PGA Tour]].\n\nNorman's play, along with his way of dressing  were both described as unconventional. He devised what is known as \"The Single Plane Golf Swing\" \u2014- rigid arms extended far from his body, a very wide stance with minimal knee bend, shorter-than-usual backswing and extended follow-through with minimal hand action, which produced amazingly accurate ball placement.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> He played extremely fast, sometimes not slowing to line up his putts. He was inducted into the [[Canadian Golf Hall of Fame]] in 1995. He was self-taught and never took a golf lesson.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/>\n\nNorman was known for sometimes unconventional behavior on the course.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> It is said that on one hole his caddie told him he could get to the green with a driver and a 9-iron. Naturally, he hit off the tee with his 9-iron and then hit the green with his driver. In another event, rather than lay up short of a creek hazard which could not be carried, he bounced his drive across the bridge which crossed the creek.<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/>\n\nNorman's skills as a ball striker are legendary. [[Sam Snead]] described Norman as the greatest striker of the ball. In January 2005, [[Tiger Woods]], the biggest golf star of the modern era, told ''[[Golf Digest]]'''s Jaime Diaz that only two golfers in history have \"owned their swings\": Moe Norman and [[Ben Hogan]].<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/> Stated Woods, \"I want to own mine.\" Late in his life, Norman found better financial security when Natural Golf, an instruction company, and [[Titleist]], a major golf manufacturer, signed him to a lifetime contract after he allegedly told a reporter, \"Titleist never did nothing for me.\" Moe would often perform golf exhibitions across Canada &ndash;  Wally Uihlein, president of Titleist considered Moe's lifetime contract a \"Reverse Scholarship\".\n\nNorman died in a [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] hospital from [[congestive heart failure]], having suffered from the condition since [[heart bypass]] surgery six years earlier. He also had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] two years before his death.\n\n==Career highlights==\n* [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] winner (1955, 1956)<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/>\n* 55 career [[Canadian Tour]] and other Canadian event victories\n* [[Canadian PGA Championship]] winner (1966, 1974)<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/>\n* Canadian PGA Seniors' Championship winner (1979\u20131985, 1987)\n* 33 course records\n* 17 holes-in-one<ref name=\"cbc2019\"/>\n* Several exhibition rounds under 60 ([[lowest rounds of golf]])\n* Inducted into the [[Canadian Golf Hall of Fame]] in 1995\n* Inducted into the [[Ontario Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1999<ref>{{cite web |title=Moe Norman |url=http://oshof.ca/index.php/honoured-members/item/61-moe-norman |publisher=Ontario Sports Hall of Fame |accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref>\n* Inducted into the [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2006\n* Two appearances by invitation as an amateur in the [[Masters Tournament]]: 1956 scored 75-78 then withdrew; 1957 scored 77-74 to miss the cut by one stroke\n\n==PGA career==\nAccording to [[ESPN]], Norman played the PGA Tour beginning in 1959. After a tournament in New Orleans, PGA officials gave Norman a dressing down regarding his playing antics. Feeling let down by the PGA's attitude towards him, Norman returned to Canada to play golf.\n\nAccording to the [[PGA Tour]] web site, the following is Norman's record on the PGA Tour: \n* 27 total events played, with 25 cuts made\n* 1 top ten finish and 7 top 25 finishes\n* $7,139 in tournament prize money\n\nAdditionally, Norman played on the [[Senior PGA Tour]] events from 1981 to 1984.

A four-ton motor lorry using the gearbox was made in a South London workshop and its success led the syndicate into giving birth to Commercial Cars Limited.\n\nIn October 1917, Underdown was appointed Director of Agricultural Machinery at The [[Ministry of Munitions]] and the following biographical notes were published:\n:Landowner, of 4,000 acres in Norfolk, a Governor of the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society]], chairman of the commercial vehicle committee of [[Agricultural Engineers Association|ABRAM]], chairman of the general vehicle committee of the [[SMMT]], Director of:\n:Direct United States Cable Co\n:The Trinidad Oilfields\n:[[Sheffield-Simplex|The Sheffield-Simplex Motor Works]]\n* page 3, The Commercial Motor, 25 October 1917\n</ref> barrister and director of [[Direct United States Cable Co]] with [[Horace Hutchinson|H G Hutchinson]] a director of [[Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation|Royal Exchange Assurance]]<ref>New Companies registered, p 1194, ''The Automotor Journal'' 23 September 1905</ref> to manufacture: commercial cars, omnibuses, [[charabanc]]s, fire engines and every kind of industrial vehicle.

After [[Peugeot]] purchased Chrysler Europe in 1978, the Commer factory was run in partnership with the truck division of [[Renault]], [[Renault Trucks]]. For some time, it continued to produce the Dodge commercial truck range with Renault badges, and there was a small amount of product development. Eventually, Dodge production was cancelled in favour of mainstream Renault models, and there was a switch to the production of Renault truck and bus engines in the early 1990s.\n\nMany Commer vans and lorries are notable for being fitted with the Rootes [[Commer TS3|TS3]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]], a [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] diesel three-cylinder horizontally opposed piston engine, which came to be known as the \"Commer Knocker\" owing to the distinct noise it produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.commer.org.nz/TheProducts/motors/TS3Background/TS3Background.html |title=The TS3 |accessdate=4 April 2015 |quote=The engine was a direct injection, high speed diesel engine with three horizontal cylinders, each containing two pistons.

protect the patients remained unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\nMid-March, the CDC changed its guidance from stating earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the [[N95 mask]]s. The [[American Nurses Association]] sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern \"that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" and \"that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\n\n===Hospitals and ventilators===\nIn 2020, hospitals in California hired rental ventilators and rationed N95 masks, raising complaints from nurses.

The change came given the shortages of the [[N95 mask]]s. The [[American Nurses Association]] sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern \"that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" and \"that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\n\n===Hospitals and ventilators===\nIn 2020, hospitals in California hired rental ventilators and rationed N95 masks, raising complaints from nurses.

It is named for the father of historian [[Thomas Jones (historian)|Thomas Jones]]. It is sometimes referred to as Oak Beach Island, and the former home of the infamous [[Oak Beach Inn]]. It is separated from Long Island by [[Great South Bay]]. The island straddles the county line between [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties and includes the [[census-designated place]]s of [[Gilgo, New York|Gilgo]] and [[Oak Beach\u2013Captree, New York]].\n\nThe southern side of the island is known for its beaches that face the open [[Atlantic Ocean]].

Fire Island passes through southern [[Suffolk County, New York]], and is southeast of [[Long Island]] separated from the main land by the [[Great South Bay]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], running approximately SW to NE. The land area is 8.687 sq. mi. (22.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), and a permanent population of 491 people was reported as of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]]. (There are hundreds of thousands of summertime residents, groupers and daytrippers.) The island is composed of three communities, as defined by the Census Bureau. The largest of these is [[Fire Island, New York|Fire Island (CDP)]], which is unincorporated and stretches through the southern portion of the towns of [[Babylon (town), New York|Babylon]], [[Islip (town), New York|Islip]], and [[Brookhaven, New York|Brookhaven]].\n{{wide image|FI Lighthouse pan.jpg|1050px|Distorted panoramic view of western Fire Island from the top of [[Fire Island Lighthouse]]}}\nThere are several ocean front communities such as, [[Davis Park]] and [[Watch Hill, New York|Watch Hill]] that are on the eastern side of the [[Great south bay]]. Fire Island has a variety of ocean front communities that can be reached by private boat, or seasonal [[ferry]] service from [[Long Island]]'s mainland. [[Fire Island]] has a 2000 census population of 310 inhabitants. There are also two villages in the Islip section of the island, [[Saltaire, New York|Saltaire]] (pop. 43) and [[Ocean Beach, New York|Ocean Beach]] (pop. 138). In addition, a part of Fire Island CDP is not even on the island, but on a separate island adjacent to [[West Hampton Dunes, New York|West Hampton Dunes]].\n\n[[Fire Island Inlet]] is an inlet on the south shore of Long Island, New York. It connects the Great South Bay with the [[Atlantic Ocean]], passing between [[Robert Moses State Park (Long Island)|Robert Moses State Park]] (the western end of Fire Island) on the south and Oak Beach and [[Captree State Park]] (the eastern end of Jones Island) on the north.

Jones Island and [[Fire Island]] at one time were connected. The [[Fire Island Light]] was at the mouth of the inlet when built in 1858, but is now six miles east of the inlet.\n\n===Westhampton Island===\nWesthampton Island<ref>http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:2634469</ref> is the easternmost outer barrier island in the [[Southampton (town), New York|Town of Southampton]].  The barrier island was part of [[Fire Island]] until a [[nor'easter]] in 1931 created [[Moriches Inlet]] and made Fire Island a proper island. In 1938, [[Shinnecock Inlet]] created this fourth barrier island. [[Cupsogue Beach County Park]] is located on the western end of the island.\n\n[[Image:Mastic-inlet-map.jpg|thumb|right|NASA satellite map of Moriches inlet]]\n\n[[Moriches Inlet]] is an [[inlet]] connecting [[Moriches Bay]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The inlet created a geographic oddity whereby the [[Brookhaven, New York|Town of Brookhaven]] actually has jurisdiction on land immediately west of the village of [[West Hampton Dunes, New York|West Hampton Dunes]]  although Brookhaven land access to it involves a nearly 20 mile drive through Southampton.\n\n[[Shinnecock Inlet]] is the easternmost of five major inlets <ref>http://www.nd.edu/~adcirc/shinnecock.htm</ref> connecting bays to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] through the narrow 100-mile-long [[barrier islands]] that stretch from [[New York City]] to [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]] on the south shore of [[Long Island]].\n\nThe inlet was formed by the [[Great Hurricane of 1938]] which killed several people when it permanently broke through the island in [[Hampton Bays, New York]].\n\nThe inlet is almost directly lined up with the [[Shinnecock Canal]] between Shinnecock Bay and the [[Peconic Bay]] and saves miles for boaters going to the open Atlantic. Consequently, management has been geared to keep the inlet dredged and open. However, maintenance of the inlet has been controversial on grounds that it causes beach erosion on Fire Island.\n\n{{further|Coastal Barrier Resources Act}}\n[[Image:FireIslandSummerDrawsToAClose.jpg|right|thumb|Great South Bay at mid-2007 sunset]]\n\n==See also==\n[[Image:Jamaicabay-1.gif|thumb|Map of Rockaway Inlet]]\n* [[Ocean Parkway (Long Island)]]\n* [[Robert Moses Causeway]]\n* [[Robert Moses State Park (Long Island)]]\n* [[Rockaway Inlet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/info.asp?parkID=151 Captree State Park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060924024748/http://www.nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/info.asp?parkID=46 Jones Beach State Park]\n* [http://nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/info.asp?parkID=45 New York State Parks: Robert Moses State Park - Long Island]\n* [http://www.greaternyroads.info/nypark/ocean/index.htm Ocean Parkway article from Greater New York Roads Website]\n* [http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ocean/ Ocean Parkway article from NYCROADS Website]\n\n{{coord|40.62|-73.26|region:US|format=dms|display=title}}\n\n{{Protected areas of New York}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Islands of Nassau County, New York]]\n[[Category:Barrier islands of New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Beaches of Nassau County, New York]]\n[[Category:Fire Island, New York]]\n[[Category:Robert Moses projects]]\n[[Category:State parks of New York (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Long Island}}\nThe '''Outer Barrier''', also known as the '''Long Island and New York City barrier islands''', refers to the string of [[barrier islands]] that divide the [[lagoon]]s south of [[Long Island, New York]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

[[Jones Beach State Park]], on the western tip of the island is a summer recreational destination for the [[New York City]] area.\n[[Image:Captree state park NY docks.jpg|thumb|right|Charter fishing boats at [[Captree State Park]]]]\n\nIt is accessible from Long Island on its western end by the [[Meadowbrook Parkway]] to [[Merrick, New York]], the [[Loop Parkway]] to [[Long Beach, New York]] and the [[Wantagh Parkway]] to [[Wantagh, New York]]. Its eastern end is linked to [[Babylon (village), New York|Babylon, New York]] as well as to [[Fire Island, New York]] by the [[Robert Moses Causeway]] via the [[Great South Bay Bridge]] and the [[State Boat Channel Bridge]]. The [[Ocean Parkway (Long Island)|Ocean Parkway]] connects all three [[causeway]]s and runs the length of the island, while The [[Fire Island Inlet Bridge]] continues on the [[Robert Moses Causeway]] finding its way to the New York's Fire Island on the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\n===Fire Island===\n{{main|Fire Island, New York}}\nFire Island  is a [[barrier island]], approximately 31 miles (50&nbsp;km) long and varying between approximately 0.1 mile (160 m) to 0.25 mile (400 m) wide. Fire Island passes through southern [[Suffolk County, New York]], and is southeast of [[Long Island]] separated from the main land by the [[Great South Bay]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], running approximately SW to NE. The land area is 8.687 sq. mi. (22.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), and a permanent population of 491 people was reported as of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]]. (There are hundreds of thousands of summertime residents, groupers and daytrippers.) The island is composed of three communities, as defined by the Census Bureau. The largest of these is [[Fire Island, New York|Fire Island (CDP)]], which is unincorporated and stretches through the southern portion of the towns of [[Babylon (town), New York|Babylon]], [[Islip (town), New York|Islip]], and [[Brookhaven, New York|Brookhaven]].\n{{wide image|FI Lighthouse pan.jpg|1050px|Distorted panoramic view of western Fire Island from the top of [[Fire Island Lighthouse]]}}\nThere are several ocean front communities such as, [[Davis Park]] and [[Watch Hill, New York|Watch Hill]] that are on the eastern side of the [[Great south bay]]. Fire Island has a variety of ocean front communities that can be reached by private boat, or seasonal [[ferry]] service from [[Long Island]]'s mainland. [[Fire Island]] has a 2000 census population of 310 inhabitants. There are also two villages in the Islip section of the island, [[Saltaire, New York|Saltaire]] (pop. 43) and [[Ocean Beach, New York|Ocean Beach]] (pop. 138). In addition, a part of Fire Island CDP is not even on the island, but on a separate island adjacent to [[West Hampton Dunes, New York|West Hampton Dunes]].\n\n[[Fire Island Inlet]] is an inlet on the south shore of Long Island, New York. It connects the Great South Bay with the [[Atlantic Ocean]], passing between [[Robert Moses State Park (Long Island)|Robert Moses State Park]] (the western end of Fire Island) on the south and Oak Beach and [[Captree State Park]] (the eastern end of Jones Island) on the north.

Jones Island and [[Fire Island]] at one time were connected. The [[Fire Island Light]] was at the mouth of the inlet when built in 1858, but is now six miles east of the inlet.\n\n===Westhampton Island===\nWesthampton Island<ref>http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:2634469</ref> is the easternmost outer barrier island in the [[Southampton (town), New York|Town of Southampton]].  The barrier island was part of [[Fire Island]] until a [[nor'easter]] in 1931 created [[Moriches Inlet]] and made Fire Island a proper island. In 1938, [[Shinnecock Inlet]] created this fourth barrier island. [[Cupsogue Beach County Park]] is located on the western end of the island.\n\n[[Image:Mastic-inlet-map.jpg|thumb|right|NASA satellite map of the inlet]]\n\n[[Moriches Inlet]] is an [[inlet]] connecting [[Moriches Bay]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The inlet created a geographic oddity whereby the [[Brookhaven, New York|Town of Brookhaven]] actually has jurisdiction on land immediately west of the village of [[West Hampton Dunes, New York|West Hampton Dunes]]  although Brookhaven land access to it involves a nearly 20 mile drive through Southampton.\n\n[[Shinnecock Inlet]] is the easternmost of five major inlets <ref>http://www.nd.edu/~adcirc/shinnecock.htm</ref> connecting bays to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] through the narrow 100-mile-long [[barrier islands]] that stretch from [[New York City]] to [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]] on the south shore of [[Long Island]].\n\nThe inlet was formed by the [[Great Hurricane of 1938]] which killed several people when it permanently broke through the island in [[Hampton Bays, New York]].\n\nThe inlet is almost directly lined up with the [[Shinnecock Canal]] between Shinnecock Bay and the [[Peconic Bay]] and saves miles for boaters going to the open Atlantic. Consequently, management has been geared to keep the inlet dredged and open. However, maintenance of the inlet has been controversial on grounds that it causes beach erosion on Fire Island.\n\n{{further|Coastal Barrier Resources Act}}\n[[Image:FireIslandSummerDrawsToAClose.jpg|right|thumb|Great South Bay at mid-2007 sunset]]\n\n==See also==\n[[Image:Jamaicabay-1.gif|thumb|Map of Rockaway Inlet]]\n* [[Ocean Parkway (Long Island)]]\n* [[Robert Moses Causeway]]\n* [[Robert Moses State Park (Long Island)]]\n* [[Rockaway Inlet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/info.asp?parkID=151 Captree State Park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060924024748/http://www.nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/info.asp?parkID=46 Jones Beach State Park]\n* [http://nysparks.state.ny.us/parks/info.asp?parkID=45 New York State Parks: Robert Moses State Park - Long Island]\n* [http://www.greaternyroads.info/nypark/ocean/index.htm Ocean Parkway article from Greater New York Roads Website]\n* [http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ocean/ Ocean Parkway article from NYCROADS Website]\n\n{{coord|40.62|-73.26|region:US|format=dms|display=title}}\n\n{{Protected areas of New York}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Islands of Nassau County, New York]]\n[[Category:Barrier islands of New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Beaches of Nassau County, New York]]\n[[Category:Fire Island, New York]]\n[[Category:Robert Moses projects]]\n[[Category:State parks of New York (state)]]\n", "name_user": "Bodysurfinyon", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWesthampton Island:changed \"the inlet\" to Moriches inlet in image caption", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Barrier"}

The family was French-speaking despite its Flemish roots; his mother's maiden name was De Ridder. He studied art at the [[Brussels Academy]] in 1924 under [[James Ensor]], but halted his studies in 1925 for lack of funding, first working in a stained glass studio, then designing wallpaper \u2013 both of which experiences are actively reflected in many of his works. He also worked as a freelance cartoonist, but painted all the while. In 1933 he studied briefly under [[Henri Matisse]] in France (see [[#Anecdotes|Anecdotes]]), having met him by chance in an artist's supply shop in [[Cagnes]], France. Thereafter he continued to paint and study full-time thanks to the sponsorship of his elder brother, Joseph Charles, and a group of friends.\n\nHis break came in July 1939 when he won a scholarship in a competition organised by the Belgian Government, who commissioned him to undertake a painting expedition to the [[Belgian Congo]]. His travels and experiences there influenced him profoundly, and the visions and emotions of that period echoed through his work for the rest of his life. In 1940 his wife Lucette (n\u00e9e Josz, 1908\u20131997) and son Ludovic (1935 \u2013 ) fled German occupation of [[Belgium]] and joined him in the Congo. Lucette could not cope with tropical conditions and they moved to the relatively milder climate of the South African Cape rather than return to war-torn Europe.\n\nEarly days in South Africa were difficult, and on occasion van Essche traded paintings and drawings for food and other essentials. But he soon became a prominent member of the South African art community, exhibiting locally and later in Europe as well. As an active member of [http://www.sahistory.org.za/media-and-journalism/new-group The New Group] he contributed strongly to contemporary art in South Africa. He had a solid knowledge of both modern art trends and the history of European painting which he imparted in his role as teacher, a profession he regarded as equally important as creating. He taught at the<ref>Witwatersrand</ref> Technical Art School from 1943 to 1945. In 1948 he founded the Continental School of Art in [[Cape Town]], leaving in 1951 to become a lecturer at the [[Michaelis School of Fine Art]] at the [[University of Cape Town]].  He was appointed Professor of Fine Art in 1962 (see [[#Anecdotes|Anecdotes]]) and his success as a teacher is attested to by the number of his former pupils who have become prominent artists themselves.\n\nVan Essche retired from academia in 1971, but continued to paint prolifically, despite poor health, including several heart attacks. He travelled in Europe and eventually settled near [[Thonon]], France, at his wife's behest. His health continued to deteriorate, and he could not travel to attend his own retrospective exhibition in [[Cape Town]] in 1974. He missed Africa terribly, painting African scenes while searching in vain for local inspiration. His new themes included hippies and musicians, but he destroyed much of this work. His European landscapes from this period are dark and depressed, in stark contrast to the vibrant African scenes that flowed nonetheless. His oils continued to sell well in South Africa, and his reputation grew. He succumbed to a heart attack in June 1977 following a fall, and poor medical care.\n\n==Chronological summary==\n\n* 1906 Born in Antwerp, Belgium\n* 1911 Family moved to Brussels; educated there\n* 1925 Interrupted his studies to earn a living working in stained glass studio\n* 1930 Became a member of the group 'La Jeune Peinture Belge'; won silver medal at the International Exhibition, Antwerp\n* 1933 Married Lucie Josz; studied under Matisse in South of France; group and one-man exhibitions in Paris and Belgian centres\n* 1939 Government sponsored painting expedition to Belgian Congo\n* 1940 Moved to South Africa; stayed temporarily in Cape Town; began exhibiting in South Africa\n* 1943 to 1945 Lectured at Wits Tech Art School, member of New Group\n* 1946 Founded Continental School of Art, Cape Town\n* 1948\u201365 Regularly represented South Africa at international art exhibitions\n* 1948 Foundation member of International Art Club; exhibited with fellow members in Turin, later elected chairman\n* 1951 Awarded the title of Chevalier de Leopold II by King Baudouin of Belgium\n* 1952 Appointed lecturer in Fine Art, Michaelis School, Cape Town; reputation in South Africa grown considerably; continued to exhibit at intervals in Europe\n* 1962 Appointed Professor of Fine Art, Michaelis School, University of Cape Town\n* 1966 Awarded Medal of Honour for Painting by South African Akademie\n* 1967 Subject of monograph 'Van Essche', by Carl Buchner\n* 1970 Retired from Michaelis School.\n* 1971 Departed for Europe; settled in Thonon-les-Bains, France.\n* 1972 Awarded the title Officer of Order of Leopold II by King Baudouin of Belgium.\n* 1974 Unable to attend Prestige Retrospective Exhibition of his work, South African National Art Gallery and Pretoria Art Museum\n* 1977 Deceased 12 June, Thonon, France.\n\n==Art==\n\nVan Essche's work exhibits contrasting influences, both artistic and environmental. From delicate renditions of the diffused tones of Flanders, to powerful depictions of Africa's landscapes, people and light, van Essche conveys unmistakable moods and a realism that is both beautifully poetic and strikingly honest. \"There must be blood in my painting...

On recognising the famous man, van Essche offered him the tube of paint. Matisse declined, but touched by the gesture invited van Essche to visit his studio. They formed a strong friendship and Matisse coached the young artist while in Cagnes, and later again in Paris.\n\n'''Resemblance to [[Le Corbusier]]:''' On his visits to Paris before and after the war, van Essche frequented many well-known contemporary artists and architects of the time. Due to some similarities in appearance, and especially the style of glasses both men wore, he was often mistaken for [[Le Corbusier]], much to his delight and amusement. It is unknown whether the two ever met.\n\n'''As Professor of Fine Art at the [[University of Cape Town]]''' van Essche shared the position of Dean of Art and Architecture on an annual rotating basis with [http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=1881 William Leonard Thornton WHITE], referred to by colleagues and friends as Thornton-White, until Thornton-White's death in 1965.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\n* 1927 First one-man exhibition, Brussels.\n* 1930 and 1935 La Jeune Peinture Belge, Brussels and Paris.\n* 1937 Ghent Salon.\n* 1939 One-man art exhibitions, Elizabethville, Leopoldville.\n* 1941 First South African one-man art exhibition, Cape Town.\n* 1948 Overseas Exhibition of South African Art, Tate Gallery.\n* 1948 to 1952 Exhibitions of International Art Club, South Africa.\n* 1950 Venice Bienalle.\n* 1952 Van Riebeeck Tercent Exhibition, Cape Town; Venice Bienalle.\n* 1953 Rhodes Centenary Exhibition, Bulawayo.\n* 1954 Venice Bienalle.\n* 1956 First Quad of South African Art.\n* 1957 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1960 Second Quad of South African Art.\n* 1961 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1963 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1965 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1966 Republic Fest Exhibition, Pretoria.\n* 1969 Group Exhibition, 'Le Petit Palais', Geneva.\n* 1971 Republic Fest Exhibition.\n* 1974/5 Prestige Retrospective Exhibition, South African National Art Gallery and Pretoria Art Museum.\n\n==Public Collections==\nSouth African National Art Gallery; Johannesburg Art Gallery; Pretoria Art museum; Durban Art Gallery; William Humphreys Art Gallery; AC White Gallery, Bloemfontein; Hester Rupert Museum; Rembrandt Foundation; King George VI Gallery; University of Wits Art Gallery, UNISA.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* van Essche, by Carl Buchner, 1967, Tafelberg, Cape Town, South Africa\n* Art & Artists of South Africa by E.

From delicate renditions of the diffused tones of Flanders, to powerful depictions of Africa's landscapes, people and light, van Essche conveys unmistakable moods and a realism that is both beautifully poetic and strikingly honest. \"There must be blood in my painting... I must remain human at all costs,\" he wrote to his friend Baron Robert d'Huart in 1961.\n\n==Education==\n\n* 1924 Brussels Academy under James Ensor.\n* 1933 Lessons with Henri Matisse, Paris, France.\n\n==Awards==\n\n* 1930 Silver medal, International Exhibition, Antwerp\n* 1951 Chevalier de Leopold II, King Baudouin of Belgium (Knighthood)\n* 1966 Medal of Honour, [http://akademie.org.za/ South African Academy for Science and Art]\n* 1972 Officer of Order of Leopold II, King Baudouin of Belgium\n\n==Anecdotes==\n\n'''Relationship with [[Henri Matisse]]:''' Maurice van Essche met Henri Matisse when buying paint in an artists' supply shop in 1933 in [[Cagnes]], in the south of France. van Essche had just purchased the last tube of Lemon Yellow when Matisse entered the store and asked the clerk for the same article. On recognising the famous man, van Essche offered him the tube of paint. Matisse declined, but touched by the gesture invited van Essche to visit his studio. They formed a strong friendship and Matisse coached the young artist while in Cagnes, and later again in Paris.\n\n'''Resemblance to [[Le Corbusier]]:''' On his visits to Paris before and after the war, van Essche frequented many well-known contemporary artists and architects of the time. Due to some similarities in appearance, and especially the style of glasses both men wore, he was often mistaken for [[Le Corbusier]], much to his delight and amusement. It is unknown whether the two ever met.\n\n'''As Professor of Fine Art at the [[University of Cape Town]]''' van Essche shared the position of Dean of Art and Architecture on an annual rotating basis with [http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=1881 William Leonard Thornton WHITE], referred to by colleagues and friends as Thornton-White, until Thornton-White's death in 1965.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\n* 1927 First one-man exhibition, Brussels.\n* 1930 and 1935 La Jeune Peinture Belge, Brussels and Paris.\n* 1937 Ghent Salon.\n* 1939 One-man art exhibitions, Elizabethville, Leopoldville.\n* 1941 First South African one-man art exhibition, Cape Town.\n* 1948 Overseas Exhibition of South African Art, Tate Gallery.\n* 1948 to 1952 Exhibitions of International Art Club, South Africa.\n* 1950 Venice Bienalle.\n* 1952 Van Riebeeck Tercent Exhibition, Cape Town; Venice Bienalle.\n* 1953 Rhodes Centenary Exhibition, Bulawayo.\n* 1954 Venice Bienalle.\n* 1956 First Quad of South African Art.\n* 1957 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1960 Second Quad of South African Art.\n* 1961 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1963 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1965 S\u00e3o Paulo Bienalle.\n* 1966 Republic Fest Exhibition, Pretoria.\n* 1969 Group Exhibition, 'Le Petit Palais', Geneva.\n* 1971 Republic Fest Exhibition.\n* 1974/5 Prestige Retrospective Exhibition, South African National Art Gallery and Pretoria Art Museum.\n\n==Public Collections==\nSouth African National Art Gallery; Johannesburg Art Gallery; Pretoria Art museum; Durban Art Gallery; William Humphreys Art Gallery; AC White Gallery, Bloemfontein; Hester Rupert Museum; Rembrandt Foundation; King George VI Gallery; University of Wits Art Gallery, UNISA.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* van Essche, by Carl Buchner, 1967, Tafelberg, Cape Town, South Africa\n* Art & Artists of South Africa by E.

UNEC was founded in 1930 and it is one of the biggest educational institutions of the [[South Caucasus]]. UNEC has 14 faculties, where 18.5 thousand students get education, and it offers master programs in 57 specialties, employing more than 1000 teachers, including 62 professors and 344 docents, among whom there are active members of the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], [[New York Academy of Sciences]], winners of state awards, honored teachers and scientists. UNEC is a full member of the [[European University Association]], [[Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World]], University Council of [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]] and Eurasian Association of Universities. Foreign students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate coourses at UNEC are approximately 650 out of 18,400 student enrollment overall. \n\nIn 2007, a Library and Information Center and a student Career Center started functioning at UNEC and also a new 7 floor educational building that meets the highest international standards was opened. The same year UNEC received the \u201cEuropean quality\u201d award and the   European Club of Rectors and [[European University Association]]. On its Main Building on Istiglaliyyat street, a 24/7 open library is operating since 2018.  \n\nThe strategic direction of UNEC development was to bring the educational process up to the international standards by 2010, finishing the international accreditation process and ensuring full compliance with [[Bologna Process]], as well as more active participation in the international market of educational services. Currently the university is chaired by rector professor Adalat Muradov and five vice rectors <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/idareetme11/rektor/|title=UNEC \u2014 RECTOR|website=unec.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/idareetme11/rectorate/|title=UNEC \u2014 RECTORATE|website=unec.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref>.\n\n== History ==\n\nOriginally a part of [[Baku State University]], it became a separate, independent institution in 1934.  Over the years its name has changed a number of times and it was re-merged and re-separated from Baku State on several occasions.  On its creation in 1930, the school was named the Trade-Cooperative Institute.  In 1933, the government of [[Azerbaijan SSR]] changed the name to the \"Azerbaijan Social-Economic University named after [[Karl Marx]]\" (similar to the naming of the [[Azerbaijan Medical University named after Nariman Narimanov]]), and introduced curricula on accounting, law and finance.  In 1936 the name was tweaked to the \"Azerbaijan Social-Economic Institute named after Karl Marx\".  With the onset of [[World War II]], UNEC was folded into [[Baku State University]]'s Department of Economics.  By 1944 the school was separated again, this time as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute.  It remained under this name until March 1959, when war caused it to be folded back into Baku State University.\n\nIn 1966 the school separated once again, and has remained independent since, initially as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute named after Dadash Bunyadzade.  In 1987 the name was changed to the Finance-Economic Institute; and in 2000 the name was finally changed to its current form by an act of the Azerbaijani government.\n\n== Derbent branch ==\nThe [[Derbent]] branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University was founded in 1993 by [[Heydar Aliyev]]. However, the official opening of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University in the city of Derbent of the [[Dagestan|Republic of Dagestan]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] was held only in November 2016. The total area of the Derbent branch is more than 11 thousand km2. There are 32 classrooms in the university, with a total capacity of 1,000 students. In the first year 69 people were recruited to the university. At the moment, students can study in four areas:\n\n* [[World economy]]\n* [[Finance]] and credit\n* [[Accounting]], analysis and [[audit]]\n* General Economy\n\nAlong with this, branch students also can enjoy all the privileges and international relations of the university - so they can also receive double diplomas and participate in international exchanges. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2691145.html|title=Official opening of UNEC\u2019s Darband branch|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ageu-derbent.ru/o_filiale/|title=Derbent Branch|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of the Derbent Branch of the Azerbaijan State University of Economics|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Zagatala branch ==\nUnder the Azerbaijan State University of Economics, there is also a branch in one of the north-western cities of Azerbaijan - [[Zaqatala District|Zagatala]]. The basis of the Zagatala branch was laid on the basis of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University under the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan of April 29, 2016. The official opening of the branch took place on September 15, 2016. Training takes place in 4 main directions:\n\n* [[Business administration|Business management]]\n* Finance\n* Accounting\n* [[Economy]]\n\nThe first set included 113 students from 37 different regions of Azerbaijan. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://salamnews.org/ru/news/read/235908|title=\u0412 \u0417\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430 UNEC|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/zagatala-branch/|title=Zagatala Branch|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== International Cooperation ==\nThe Azerbaijan State University of Economics has connections with foreign universities. \n\nThus, ASUE cooperates with the [[University of Siegen|Siegen University]] of Germany in the direction of organizing summer and winter schools. In 2016, a winter school was held at the University of Siegen, in which participated teachers and students from both universities. A joint project entitled \"Entrepreneurship education: as the main factor in creation of jobs and employment in Azerbaijan\" started in 2016 and is planned to be completed in 2019. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2878793.html|title=UNEC launches summer school together with Siegen University|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2446509.html|title=The International School of Economics is UNEC\u2019s gateway to the Western Universities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUNEC was declared the winner of the [[TEMPUS]] IV program of the 6th convocation for a project called \"Development and improvement of university management in the field of international relations\". As a winner, ASUE was awarded a grant for implementation by the [[European Commission]]. In 2017, this project, whose goal was the formation of international relations based on the attraction of students and teachers in the international educational environment, was realized. Closing ceremony was attended by such personalities as the rector of ASUE Adalat Muradov, head of the office of the national program [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus+]] Azerbaijan Parviz Bagirov, representative of the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Yashar Omarov, [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[University of Warwick]] Fellow James Kennedy, Vice-Rector for International Relations and Programs ASUE Shahin Bayramov and as well as representatives of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ue.poznan.pl/data/upload/articles/20151016/98254f399020401045/informacje-o-uczelni-asue.pdf|title=Azerbaijan State University of Economics|last=|first=|date=|website=Pozna\u0144 University of Economics and Business|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2726274.html|title=\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 UNIVIA, \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 UNEC|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, for the first time in Azerbaijan, ASUE joined the International Program of the London University - the [[London School of Economics and Political Science|London School of Economics]] (LSE). Within the framework of this program, ASUE students receive education both in accordance with the curriculum of ASUE and in the curriculum of the London School of Economics. Students are provided with all the necessary materials and benefits, and upon completion of the training the students of this program receive two diplomas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gov.az/en/page/61|title=International cooperation|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Education of the Republic of Azerbaijan|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the London School of Economics and Politics, students can receive a second diploma from the French [[University of Montpellier]] in 2016. This can be done in two ways: students can go to the University of Montpellier from the third year to continue their studies for a year there, or continue their studies at ASUE, but according to the curricula of Montpellier. In both cases, students receive accreditation and a second diploma from the University of Montpellier. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.haberler.com/unec-s-first-students-to-study-at-university-of-928998/|title=UNEC's First Students To Study At University Of Montpellier|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and Certificates ==\n'''2006''' - Azerbaijan State University of Economics was awarded the \"Golden Fortune\" prize, which was held by the International Academy of Rating Technologies and Sociology.

Ali Khan, the protagonist, took his final graduation exams in that building, which is located on one of Baku's most prestigious streets - Independence (Istiglaliyyat), though at the time of the novel, it was called Nikolay Street, named after the Russian czar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. Nino's school, now Public School No. 132, was located across the street.\n\nCuriously, both [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli|Yusif Vazir (Chamanzaminli)]] (1887-1943), the Core Author of ''Ali and Nino'',<ref>101 Reasons Why Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli is the Core Author of Ali and Nino, in [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai152_folder/152_index_eng.html Azerbaijan International, Vol. 15:2-4] (2011), pp. 262-333.</ref> as well as Essad Bey / [[Lev Nussimbaum]] (1905-1942) both attended this school. Vazirov attended Baku Realni High School (having transferred in as a refugee from [[Shusha]]) beginning in 1906 and he graduated in 1909. \n\n[[Lev Nussimbaum]] attended Men's Gymnasium No. 2, which at that time (1914-1920) was housed inside Baku Realni. Though Nussimbaum was often absent due to sickness and political unrest, he was enrolled from Junior Preparatory to the beginning of Fourth Grade when he fled the Bolshevik takeover of the Baku government (1920). This school offered classes through Eighth Grade. Documents indicate that Nussimbaum failed his Azerbaijani class in 1919, the only time records exist showing that he had enrolled in Azerbaijani.<ref>Azerbaijan Republic State History Archives: Fund 392, List 1, Case 470, Page 13.

UNEC was founded in 1930 and it is one of the biggest educational institutions of the [[South Caucasus]]. UNEC has 14 faculties, where 16 thousand students get education, and it offers master programs in 57 specialties, employing more than 1000 teachers, including 62 professors and 344 docents, among whom there are active members of the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], [[New York Academy of Sciences]], winners of state awards, honored teachers and scientists. UNEC is a full member of the [[European University Association]], [[Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World]], University Council of [[Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation]] and Eurasian Association of Universities. Foreign students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate coourses at UNEC are approximately 650 out of 18,400 student enrollment overall. \n\nIn 2007, a Library and Information Center and a student Career Center started functioning at UNEC and also a new 7 floor educational building that meets the highest international standards was opened. The same year UNEC received the \u201cEuropean quality\u201d award and the   European Club of Rectors and [[European University Association]]. On its Main Building on Istiglaliyyat street, a 24/7 open library is operating since 2018.  \n\nThe strategic direction of UNEC development was to bring the educational process up to the international standards by 2010, finishing the international accreditation process and ensuring full compliance with [[Bologna Process]], as well as more active participation in the international market of educational services. Currently the university is chaired by rector professor Adalat Muradov and five vice rectors <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/idareetme11/rektor/|title=UNEC \u2014 RECTOR|website=unec.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/idareetme11/rectorate/|title=UNEC \u2014 RECTORATE|website=unec.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref>.\n\n== History ==\n\nOriginally a part of [[Baku State University]], it became a separate, independent institution in 1934.  Over the years its name has changed a number of times and it was re-merged and re-separated from Baku State on several occasions.  On its creation in 1930, the school was named the Trade-Cooperative Institute.  In 1933, the government of [[Azerbaijan SSR]] changed the name to the \"Azerbaijan Social-Economic University named after [[Karl Marx]]\" (similar to the naming of the [[Azerbaijan Medical University named after Nariman Narimanov]]), and introduced curricula on accounting, law and finance.  In 1936 the name was tweaked to the \"Azerbaijan Social-Economic Institute named after Karl Marx\".  With the onset of [[World War II]], ASEU was folded into [[Baku State University]]'s Department of Economics.  By 1944 the school was separated again, this time as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute.  It remained under this name until March 1959, when war caused it to be folded back into Baku State University.\n\nIn 1966 the school separated once again, and has remained independent since, initially as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute named after Dadash Bunyadzade.  In 1987 the name was changed to the Finance-Economic Institute; and in 2000 the name was finally changed to its current form by an act of the Azerbaijani government.\n\n== Derbent branch ==\nThe [[Derbent]] branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University was founded in 1993 by [[Heydar Aliyev]]. However, the official opening of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University in the city of Derbent of the [[Dagestan|Republic of Dagestan]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] was held only in November 2016. The total area of the Derbent branch is more than 11 thousand km2. There are 32 classrooms in the university, with a total capacity of 1,000 students. In the first year 69 people were recruited to the university. At the moment, students can study in four areas:\n\n* [[World economy]]\n* [[Finance]] and credit\n* [[Accounting]], analysis and [[audit]]\n* General Economy\n\nAlong with this, branch students also can enjoy all the privileges and international relations of the university - so they can also receive double diplomas and participate in international exchanges. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2691145.html|title=Official opening of UNEC\u2019s Darband branch|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ageu-derbent.ru/o_filiale/|title=Derbent Branch|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of the Derbent Branch of the Azerbaijan State University of Economics|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Zagatala branch ==\nUnder the Azerbaijan State University of Economics, there is also a branch in one of the north-western cities of Azerbaijan - [[Zaqatala District|Zagatala]]. The basis of the Zagatala branch was laid on the basis of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University under the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan of April 29, 2016. The official opening of the branch took place on September 15, 2016. Training takes place in 4 main directions:\n\n* [[Business administration|Business management]]\n* Finance\n* Accounting\n* [[Economy]]\n\nThe first set included 113 students from 37 different regions of Azerbaijan. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://salamnews.org/ru/news/read/235908|title=\u0412 \u0417\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430 UNEC|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unec.edu.az/en/zagatala-branch/|title=Zagatala Branch|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== International Cooperation ==\nThe Azerbaijan State University of Economics has connections with foreign universities. \n\nThus, ASUE cooperates with the [[University of Siegen|Siegen University]] of Germany in the direction of organizing summer and winter schools. In 2016, a winter school was held at the University of Siegen, in which participated teachers and students from both universities. A joint project entitled \"Entrepreneurship education: as the main factor in creation of jobs and employment in Azerbaijan\" started in 2016 and is planned to be completed in 2019. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2878793.html|title=UNEC launches summer school together with Siegen University|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2446509.html|title=The International School of Economics is UNEC\u2019s gateway to the Western Universities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nASEU was declared the winner of the [[TEMPUS]] IV program of the 6th convocation for a project called \"Development and improvement of university management in the field of international relations\". As a winner, ASUE was awarded a grant for implementation by the [[European Commission]]. In 2017, this project, whose goal was the formation of international relations based on the attraction of students and teachers in the international educational environment, was realized. Closing ceremony was attended by such personalities as the rector of ASUE Adalat Muradov, head of the office of the national program [[Erasmus Programme|Erasmus+]] Azerbaijan Parviz Bagirov, representative of the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Yashar Omarov, [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[University of Warwick]] Fellow James Kennedy, Vice-Rector for International Relations and Programs ASUE Shahin Bayramov and as well as representatives of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ue.poznan.pl/data/upload/articles/20151016/98254f399020401045/informacje-o-uczelni-asue.pdf|title=Azerbaijan State University of Economics|last=|first=|date=|website=Pozna\u0144 University of Economics and Business|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trend.az/azerbaijan/society/2726274.html|title=\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 UNIVIA, \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 UNEC|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, for the first time in Azerbaijan, ASUE joined the International Program of the London University - the [[London School of Economics and Political Science|London School of Economics]] (LSE). Within the framework of this program, ASUE students receive education both in accordance with the curriculum of ASUE and in the curriculum of the London School of Economics. Students are provided with all the necessary materials and benefits, and upon completion of the training the students of this program receive two diplomas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gov.az/en/page/61|title=International cooperation|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Education of the Republic of Azerbaijan|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the London School of Economics and Politics, students can receive a second diploma from the French [[University of Montpellier]] in 2016. This can be done in two ways: students can go to the University of Montpellier from the third year to continue their studies for a year there, or continue their studies at ASUE, but according to the curricula of Montpellier. In both cases, students receive accreditation and a second diploma from the University of Montpellier. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.haberler.com/unec-s-first-students-to-study-at-university-of-928998/|title=UNEC's First Students To Study At University Of Montpellier|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and Certificates ==\n'''2006''' - Azerbaijan State University of Economics was awarded the \"Golden Fortune\" prize, which was held by the International Academy of Rating Technologies and Sociology.
