Each work in the series is set in a different decade, and depicts comic and tragic aspects of the [[African-American]] experience in the 20th century.\n\n==Early life==\nWilson was born '''Frederick August Kittel Jr.''' in the [[Hill District]] of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, the fourth of six children. His father, Frederick August Kittel Sr., was a [[Sudeten Germans|Sudeten German]] immigrant, who was a baker/pastry cook. His mother, Daisy Wilson, was an African-American woman from North Carolina who cleaned homes for a living.<ref Name=\"NYT\">Isherwood, Charles (October 3, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/03/theater/newsandfeatures/03wilson.html \"August Wilson, Theater's Poet of Black America, Is Dead at 60\"], ''The New York Times''.</ref> Wilson's anecdotal history reports that his maternal grandmother walked from [[North Carolina]] to [[Pennsylvania]] in search of a better life. Wilson's mother raised the children alone until he was five in a two-room apartment above a grocery store at 1727 Bedford Avenue; his father was mostly absent from his childhood. Wilson later wrote under his mother's surname. The economically depressed neighborhood where he was raised was inhabited predominantly by black Americans and Jewish and Italian immigrants. Life for Wilson and his other siblings was very tough because they were biracial. He struggled with finding a sense of belonging to a particular culture and didn't feel that he truly fit into African American culture or white culture until later in life. Wilson's mother divorced his father and married David Bedford in the 1950s, and the family moved from the Hill District to the then predominantly white working-class neighborhood of [[Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)|Hazelwood]], where they encountered racial hostility; bricks were thrown through a window at their new home. They were soon forced out of their house and on to their next home.<ref name= \"Little 2000\">{{cite book|last=Little|first=Johnathan|title=Twentieth-Century American Dramatists: Second Series|year=2000|publisher=Gale|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0-7876-3137-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/twentiethcentury228whea_0}}</ref> The Hill District went on to become the setting of numerous plays in the famous ''Pittsburgh Cycle''. His experiences growing up there with a strong matriarch shaped the way his plays would be written.\n\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= [[File:Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh - IMG 0789.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [http://video.pbs.org/video/2365429059/ American Masters, August Wilson: The Ground on Which I Stand], [[PBS]], 1:24:39<ref name=\"pbs\">{{cite web | title =American Masters, August Wilson: The Ground on Which I Stand| work = | publisher =[[PBS]] | date =February 20, 2012 | url =http://video.pbs.org/video/2365429059/ | accessdate =May 29, 2015}}</ref> }}\nIn 1959, Wilson was one of 14 African-American students at [[Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|Central Catholic High School]], from which he dropped out after one year.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> He then attended Connelley Vocational High School, but found the curriculum unchallenging. He dropped out of Gladstone High School in the 10th grade in 1960 after his teacher accused him of [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] a 20-page paper he wrote on [[Napoleon I of France]]. Wilson hid his decision from his mother because he did not want to disappoint her.  At the age of 16 he began working menial jobs, where he met a wide variety of people on whom some of his later characters were based, such as Sam in ''The Janitor'' (1985)\n\nWilson's extensive use of the [[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh]] resulted in its later \"awarding\" him an honorary high school diploma.  Wilson, who said he had learned to read at the age of four, began reading black writers at the library when he was 12 and spent the remainder of his teen years educating himself through the books of [[Ralph Ellison]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]], and others.<ref name= \"Little 2000\" />\n\n==Career==\n\nWilson knew that he wanted to be a writer, but this created tension with his mother, who wanted him to become a lawyer. She forced him to leave the family home and he enlisted in the United States Army for a three-year stint in 1962, but left after one year and went back to working various odd jobs as a porter, short-order cook, gardener, and dishwasher.\n\nFrederick August Kittel Jr. changed his name to August Wilson to honor his mother after his father's death in 1965. That same year, he discovered the blues as sung by [[Bessie Smith]], and he bought a stolen typewriter for $10, which he often pawned when money was tight.<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/> At 20, he decided he was a poet and submitted work to such magazines as ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]''.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> He began to write in bars, the local cigar store, and cafes\u2014longhand on table napkins and on yellow notepads, absorbing the voices and characters around him. He liked to write on cafe napkins because, he said, it freed him up and made him less self-conscious as a writer. He would then gather the notes and type them up at home.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/>  Gifted with a talent for catching dialect and accents, Wilson had an \"astonishing memory\", which he put to full use during his career. He slowly learned not to censor the language he heard when incorporating it into his work.<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/>\n\n[[File:PittsburghPaAWH2.jpg|thumb|right|[[August Wilson House|Wilson's childhood home]] at 1727 Bedford Avenue in Pittsburgh]]\n\n[[Malcolm X]]'s voice influenced Wilson's life and work (such as ''The Ground on Which I Stand,'' 1996). Both the [[Nation of Islam]] and the [[Black Power]] spoke to him regarding self-sufficiency, self-defense, and self-determination, and he appreciated the origin myths that [[Elijah Muhammad]] supported. In 1969 Wilson married Brenda Burton, a Muslim, and converted to Islam. He and Brenda had one daughter, Sakina Ansari-Wilson, and divorced in 1972.<ref name= \"Little 2000\" />\n\nIn 1968, he co-founded the [[Black Horizon Theater]] in the Hill District of Pittsburgh along with his friend [[Rob Penny]].<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> Wilson's first play, ''Recycling'', was performed for audiences in small theaters, schools and public housing community centers for 50 cents a ticket. Among these early efforts was ''[[Jitney (play)|Jitney]]'', which he revised more than two decades later as part of his 10-play cycle on 20th-century Pittsburgh.<ref name= \"Little 2000\" /> He had no directing experience.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> He recalled: \"Someone had looked around and said, 'Who's going to be the director?' I said, 'I will.' I said that because I knew my way around the library. So I went to look for a book on how to direct a play. I found one called ''The Fundamentals of Play Directing'' <ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X4UAAAAQBAJ|first1=Alexander|last1= Dean |first2=Lawrence |last2=Carra |date=2009 |title=Fundamentals of Play Directing|edition=5th |publisher=Waveland Press |location=Long Grove, IL |isbn=978-1-57766-648-6 }}</ref>  and checked it out.\"<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/>\n\nIn 1976 Vernell Lillie, who had founded the [[Kuntu Repertory Theatre]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] two years earlier, directed Wilson's ''The Homecoming''. That same year Wilson saw ''[[Sizwe Banzi is Dead]]'' at the [[Pittsburgh Public Theater]], his first professional play. Wilson, Penny, and poet Maisha Baton also started the Kuntu Writers Workshop to bring African-American writers together and to assist them in publication and production. Both organizations are still active.\n\nIn 1978 Wilson moved to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], at the suggestion of his friend, director [[Claude Purdy]], who helped him secure a job writing educational scripts for the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]].<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> In 1980 he received a fellowship for [[The Playwrights' Center]] in Minneapolis. He quit the Museum in 1981, but continued writing plays. For three years, he was a part-time cook for the [[Little Brothers of the Poor]]. Wilson had a long association with the [[Penumbra Theatre Company]] of St. Paul, which premiered some of his plays. He wrote ''Fullerton Street'', which has been unproduced and unpublished, in 1980. It follows the [[Joe Louis]]/[[Billy Conn]] fight in 1940 and the loss of values attendant on the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the urban North.<ref name= \"Little 2000\" />\n\nIn 1987, St. Paul's mayor [[George Latimer (Minnesota politician)|George Latimer]] named May 27 \"August Wilson Day\". He was honored because he is the only person from Minnesota to win a Pulitzer Prize.<ref name= \"Little 2000\" />\n\nIn 1990 Wilson left St. Paul after getting divorced and moved to [[Seattle]]. There he developed a relationship with [[Seattle Repertory Theatre]], which became the only theater in the country to produce his entire 10-play cycle and his one-man show ''How I Learned What I Learned.''<ref name= \"Little 2000\" />\n\nThough he was a writer dedicated to writing for theater, a Hollywood studio proposed filming Wilson's play ''Fences''. He insisted that a black director be hired for the film, saying: \"I declined a white director not on the basis of race but on the basis of culture. White directors are not qualified for the job. The job requires someone who shares the specifics of the culture of black Americans.\" The film remained unmade until 2016, when [[Denzel Washington]] directed the film ''[[Fences (film)|Fences]]'', starring Washington and [[Viola Davis]]. It earned Wilson a posthumous Oscar nomination.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Viagas|first1=Robert|title=Denzel Washington's Fences Film Begins Shooting Today|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/denzel-washington-39-s-fences-film-begins-shooting-today-com-382902|date=April 22, 2016|work=Playbill|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWilson received many honorary degrees, including an honorary Doctor of Humanities from the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he served as a member of the university's board of trustees from 1992 until 1995.<ref>{{cite news | author=Bruce Steele | title=Remembering August Wilson 1945\u20132005 | url=http://www.umc.pitt.edu/media/pcc051010/august_wilson_2005OCT10.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902071459/http://www.umc.pitt.edu/media/pcc051010/august_wilson_2005OCT10.html | work=The Pitt Chronicle | publisher=The University of Pittsburgh | date=October 10, 2005 | archivedate=September 2, 2006| accessdate=October 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nWilson maintained a strong voice in the progress and development of the (then) contemporary black theater, undoubtedly taking influences from the examples of his youth, such as those displayed during the [[Black Arts Movement]]. One of the most notable examples of Wilson's strong opinions and critiques of what was black theater's state in the 1990s, was the \"On Cultural Power: The August Wilson/Robert Brustein Discussion\" where Wilson argued for a completely black theater with all positions filled by blacks. Conversely, he argued that black actors should not play roles not specifically black (e.g. No black Hamlet). Brustein heatedly took an opposing view.\n\n==Post Black Arts Movement==\nWhile the work of August Wilson is not formally recognized within the literary canon of the [[Black Arts Movement]], he was certainly a product of its mission, helping to co-found the Black Horizon Theatre in his hometown of Pittsburgh in 1968. Situated in Pittsburgh's Hill District, a historically and predominantly Black neighborhood, the Black Horizon Theatre became a cultural hub of Black creativity and community building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/august-wilson-and-black-horizon-theatre|title=August Wilson and Black Horizon Theatre {{!}} Pitt Chronicle {{!}} University of Pittsburgh|website=www.chronicle.pitt.edu|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref> As a playwright of what is considered the Post-Black Arts Movement, August Wilson inherited the spirit of BAM, producing plays that celebrated the history and poetic sensibilities of Black people. His iconic Century Cycle successfully tracked and synthesized the experiences of Black America in the 20th Century, using each historical decade, from 1904 to 1997, to document the physical, emotional, mental, and political strivings of Black life in the wake of emancipation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.august-wilson-theatre.com/plays.php|title=August Wilson, Pulitzer winning playwright: Plays|website=www.august-wilson-theatre.com|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\nWilson's best known plays are ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'' (1985) (which won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] and a [[Tony Award]]), ''[[The Piano Lesson]]'' (1990) (a [[Pulitzer Prize]] and the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award), ''[[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom]]'', and ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]''.\n\nWilson stated that he was most influenced by \"the four Bs\": blues music, the [[Argentine]] writer and poet [[Jorge Luis Borges]], the playwright [[Amiri Baraka]] and the painter [[Romare Bearden]].<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> He went on to add writers [[Ed Bullins]] and [[James Baldwin]] to the list. He noted:\n\n{{quote|From Borges, those wonderful gaucho stories from which I learned that you can be specific as to a time and place and culture and still have the work resonate with the universal themes of love, honor, duty, betrayal, etc. From Amiri Baraka, I learned that all art is political, although I don't write political plays. From Romare Bearden I learned that the fullness and richness of everyday life can be rendered without compromise or sentimentality.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/>}}\n\nHe valued Bullins and Baldwin for their honest representations of everyday life.<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/>\n\nLike Bearden, Wilson worked with collage techniques in writing: \"I try to make my plays the equal of his canvases. In creating plays I often use the image of a stewing pot in which I toss various things that I'm going to make use of\u2014a black cat, a garden, a bicycle, a man with a scar on his face, a pregnant woman, a man with a gun.\" On the meaning of his work Wilson stated\n\n{{quote|I once wrote this short story called \"The Best Blues Singer in the World\", and it went like this\u2014\"The streets that Balboa walked were his own private ocean, and Balboa was drowning.\" End of story. That says it all. Nothing else to say. I've been rewriting that same story over and over again.

The plays are each set in a different decade and aim to sketch the Black experience in the 20th century and \"raise consciousness through theater\" and echo \"the poetry in the everyday language of black America\".<ref Name=\"Parisreview\">{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/839/the-art-of-theater-no-14-august-wilson| work=The Paris Review| title=August Wilson, The Art of Theater No. 14| author= Bonnie Lyons, George Plimpton| date=Winter 1999 }}</ref> His writing of the Black experience always featured strong female characters and sometimes included elements of the supernatural. In his book, he wrote \"My mother's a very strong, principled woman.

In the play, the piano is used and releases spirits of the ancestors. Wilson wanted to create such an event in the play that the audience was left to decide what was real or not. He was fascinated by the power of theater as a medium where a community at large could come together to bear witness to events and currents unfolding.<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/>\n\nWilson noted:\n\n{{quote|I think my plays offer (white Americans) a different way to look at black Americans,\" he told ''The Paris Review''. \"For instance, in ''Fences'' they see a garbageman, a person they don't really look at, although they see a garbageman every day. By looking at Troy's life, white people find out that the content of this black garbageman's life is affected by the same things \u2013 love, honor, beauty, betrayal, duty. Recognizing that these things are as much part of his life as theirs can affect how they think about and deal with black people in their lives.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/>}}\n\nAlthough the plays of the cycle are not strictly connected to the degree of a serial story, some characters appear (at various ages) in more than one of the cycle's plays. Children of characters in earlier plays may appear in later plays. The character most frequently mentioned in the cycle is Aunt Ester, a \"washer of souls\". She is reported to be 285 years old in ''[[Gem of the Ocean]]'', which takes place in her home at 1839 Wylie Avenue, and 322 in ''[[Two Trains Running]]''. She dies in 1985, during the events of ''[[King Hedley II]]''. Much of the action of ''[[Radio Golf]]'' revolves around the plan to demolish and redevelop that house, some years after her death. Aunt Ester is a symbolic and recurring figure that represents the African American struggle. She is \"not literally three centuries old but a succession of folk priestesses... [s]he embodies a weighty history of tragedy and triumph\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2009/11/09/August-Wilson-s-mythic-character-Aunt-Ester-explored-in-theater-festival/stories/200911090252|title=August Wilson's mythic character Aunt Ester explored in theater festival|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>.The plays often include an ''apparently'' mentally impaired oracular character (different in each play)\u2014for example, Hedley Sr. in ''[[Seven Guitars]]'', Gabriel in ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'', Stool Pigeon in ''[[King Hedley II]]'', or Hambone in ''[[Two Trains Running]]''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Each work in the series is set in a different decade, and depicts comic and tragic aspects of the [[African-American]] experience in the 20th century.\n\n==Early life==\nWilson was born '''Frederick August Kittel Jr.''' in the [[Hill District]] of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, the fourth of six children. His father, Frederick August Kittel Sr., was a [[Sudeten Germans|Sudeten German]] immigrant, who was a baker/pastry cook. His mother, Daisy Wilson, was an African-American woman from North Carolina who cleaned homes for a living.<ref Name=\"NYT\">Isherwood, Charles (October 3, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/03/theater/newsandfeatures/03wilson.html \"August Wilson, Theater's Poet of Black America, Is Dead at 60\"], ''The New York Times''.</ref> Wilson's anecdotal history reports that his maternal grandmother walked from [[North Carolina]] to [[Pennsylvania]] in search of a better life. Wilson's mother raised the children alone until he was five in a two-room apartment above a grocery store at 1727 Bedford Avenue; his father was mostly absent from his childhood. Wilson later wrote under his mother's surname. The economically depressed neighborhood where he was raised was inhabited predominantly by black Americans and Jewish and Italian immigrants. Life for Wilson and his other siblings was very tough because they were biracial. He struggled with finding a sense of belonging to a particular culture and didn't feel that he truly fit into African American culture or white culture until later in life. Wilson's mother divorced his father and married David Bedford in the 1950s, and the family moved from the Hill District to the then predominantly white working-class neighborhood of [[Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)|Hazelwood]], where they encountered racial hostility; bricks were thrown through a window at their new home. They were soon forced out of their house and on to their next home.<ref name= \"Little 2000\">{{cite book|last=Little|first=Johnathan|title=Twentieth-Century American Dramatists: Second Series|year=2000|publisher=Gale|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0-7876-3137-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/twentiethcentury228whea_0}}</ref> The Hill District went on to become the setting of numerous plays in the famous ''Pittsburgh Cycle''. His experiences growing up there with a strong matriarch shaped the way his plays would be written.\n\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= [[File:Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh - IMG 0789.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [http://video.pbs.org/video/2365429059/ American Masters, August Wilson: The Ground on Which I Stand], [[PBS]], 1:24:39<ref name=\"pbs\">{{cite web | title =American Masters, August Wilson: The Ground on Which I Stand| work = | publisher =[[PBS]] | date =February 20, 2012 | url =http://video.pbs.org/video/2365429059/ | accessdate =May 29, 2015}}</ref> }}\nIn 1959, Wilson was one of 14 African-American students at [[Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|Central Catholic High School]], from which he dropped out after one year.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> He then attended Connelley Vocational High School, but found the curriculum unchallenging. He dropped out of Gladstone High School in the 10th grade in 1960 after his teacher accused him of [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] a 20-page paper he wrote on [[Napoleon I of France]]. Wilson hid his decision from his mother because he did not want to disappoint her.  At the age of 16 he began working menial jobs, where he met a wide variety of people on whom some of his later characters were based, such as Sam in ''The Janitor'' (1985)\n\nWilson's extensive use of the [[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh]] resulted in its later \"awarding\" him an honorary high school diploma.  Wilson, who said he had learned to read at the age of four, began reading black writers at the library when he was 12 and spent the remainder of his teen years educating himself through the books of [[Ralph Ellison]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]], and others.<ref name= \"Little 2000\" />\n\n==Career==\n\nWilson knew that he wanted to be a writer, but this created tension with his mother, who wanted him to become a lawyer. She forced him to leave the family home and he enlisted in the United States Army for a three-year stint in 1962, but left after one year and went back to working various odd jobs as a porter, short-order cook, gardener, and dishwasher.\n\nFrederick August Kittel Jr. changed his name to August Wilson to honor his mother after his father's death in 1965. That same year, he discovered the blues as sung by [[Bessie Smith]], and he bought a stolen typewriter for $10, which he often pawned when money was tight.<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/> At 20, he decided he was a poet and submitted work to such magazines as ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]''.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> He began to write in bars, the local cigar store, and cafes\u2014longhand on table napkins and on yellow notepads, absorbing the voices and characters around him. He liked to write on cafe napkins because, he said, it freed him up and made him less self-conscious as a writer. He would then gather the notes and type them up at home.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/>  Gifted with a talent for catching dialect and accents, Wilson had an \"astonishing memory\", which he put to full use during his career. He slowly learned not to censor the language he heard when incorporating it into his work.<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/>\n\n[[File:PittsburghPaAWH2.jpg|thumb|right|[[August Wilson House|Wilson's childhood home]] at 1727 Bedford Avenue in Pittsburgh]]\n\n[[Malcolm X]]'s voice influenced Wilson's life and work (such as ''The Ground on Which I Stand,'' 1996). Both the [[Nation of Islam]] and the [[Black Power]] spoke to him regarding self-sufficiency, self-defense, and self-determination, and he appreciated the origin myths that [[Elijah Muhammad]] supported. In 1969 Wilson married Brenda Burton, a Muslim, and converted to Islam. He and Brenda had one daughter, Sakina Ansari-Wilson, and divorced in 1972.<ref name= \"Little 2000\" />\n\nIn 1968, he co-founded the [[Black Horizon Theater]] in the Hill District of Pittsburgh along with his friend [[Rob Penny]].<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> Wilson's first play, ''Recycling'', was performed for audiences in small theaters, schools and public housing community centers for 50 cents a ticket. Among these early efforts was ''[[Jitney (play)|Jitney]]'', which he revised more than two decades later as part of his 10-play cycle on 20th-century Pittsburgh.<ref name= \"Little 2000\" /> He had no directing experience.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> He recalled: \"Someone had looked around and said, 'Who's going to be the director?' I said, 'I will.' I said that because I knew my way around the library. So I went to look for a book on how to direct a play. I found one called ''The Fundamentals of Play Directing'' <ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X4UAAAAQBAJ|first1=Alexander|last1= Dean |first2=Lawrence |last2=Carra |date=2009 |title=Fundamentals of Play Directing|edition=5th |publisher=Waveland Press |location=Long Grove, IL |isbn=978-1-57766-648-6 }}</ref>  and checked it out.\"<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/>\n\nIn 1976 Vernell Lillie, who had founded the [[Kuntu Repertory Theatre]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] two years earlier, directed Wilson's ''The Homecoming''. That same year Wilson saw ''[[Sizwe Banzi is Dead]]'' at the [[Pittsburgh Public Theater]], his first professional play. Wilson, Penny, and poet Maisha Baton also started the Kuntu Writers Workshop to bring African-American writers together and to assist them in publication and production. Both organizations are still active.\n\nIn 1978 Wilson moved to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], at the suggestion of his friend, director [[Claude Purdy]], who helped him secure a job writing educational scripts for the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]].<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> In 1980 he received a fellowship for [[The Playwrights' Center]] in Minneapolis. He quit the Museum in 1981, but continued writing plays. For three years, he was a part-time cook for the [[Little Brothers of the Poor]]. Wilson had a long association with the [[Penumbra Theatre Company]] of St. Paul, which premiered some of his plays. He wrote ''Fullerton Street'', which has been unproduced and unpublished, in 1980. It follows the [[Joe Louis]]/[[Billy Conn]] fight in 1940 and the loss of values attendant on the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the urban North.<ref name= \"Little 2000\" />\n\nIn 1987, St. Paul's mayor [[George Latimer (Minnesota politician)|George Latimer]] named May 27 \"August Wilson Day\". He was honored because he is the only person from Minnesota to win a Pulitzer Prize.<ref name= \"Little 2000\" />\n\nIn 1990 Wilson left St. Paul after getting divorced and moved to [[Seattle]]. There he developed a relationship with [[Seattle Repertory Theatre]], which became the only theater in the country to produce his entire 10-play cycle and his one-man show ''How I Learned What I Learned.''<ref name= \"Little 2000\" />\n\nThough he was a writer dedicated to writing for theater, a Hollywood studio proposed filming Wilson's play ''Fences''. He insisted that a black director be hired for the film, saying: \"I declined a white director not on the basis of race but on the basis of culture. White directors are not qualified for the job. The job requires someone who shares the specifics of the culture of black Americans.\" The film remained unmade until 2016, when [[Denzel Washington]] directed the film ''[[Fences (film)|Fences]]'', starring Washington and [[Viola Davis]]. It earned Wilson a posthumous Oscar nomination.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Viagas|first1=Robert|title=Denzel Washington's Fences Film Begins Shooting Today|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/denzel-washington-39-s-fences-film-begins-shooting-today-com-382902|date=April 22, 2016|work=Playbill|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWilson received many honorary degrees, including an honorary Doctor of Humanities from the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he served as a member of the university's board of trustees from 1992 until 1995.<ref>{{cite news | author=Bruce Steele | title=Remembering August Wilson 1945\u20132005 | url=http://www.umc.pitt.edu/media/pcc051010/august_wilson_2005OCT10.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902071459/http://www.umc.pitt.edu/media/pcc051010/august_wilson_2005OCT10.html | work=The Pitt Chronicle | publisher=The University of Pittsburgh | date=October 10, 2005 | archivedate=September 2, 2006| accessdate=October 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nWilson maintained a strong voice in the progress and development of the (then) contemporary black theater, undoubtedly taking influences from the examples of his youth, such as those displayed during the [[Black Arts Movement]]. One of the most notable examples of Wilson's strong opinions and critiques of what was black theater's state in the 1990s, was the \"On Cultural Power: The August Wilson/Robert Brustein Discussion\" where Wilson argued for a completely black theater with all positions filled by blacks. Conversely, he argued that black actors should not play roles not specifically black (e.g. No black Hamlet). Brustein heatedly took an opposing view.\n\n==Post Black Arts Movement==\nWhile the work of August Wilson is not formally recognized within the literary canon of the [[Black Arts Movement]], he was certainly a product of its mission, helping to co-found the Black Horizon Theatre in his hometown of Pittsburgh in 1968. Situated in Pittsburgh's Hill District, a historically and predominantly Black neighborhood, the Black Horizon Theatre became a cultural hub of Black creativity and community building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/august-wilson-and-black-horizon-theatre|title=August Wilson and Black Horizon Theatre {{!}} Pitt Chronicle {{!}} University of Pittsburgh|website=www.chronicle.pitt.edu|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref> As a playwright of what is considered the Post-Black Arts Movement, August Wilson inherited the spirit of BAM, producing plays that celebrated the history and poetic sensibilities of Black people. His iconic Century Cycle successfully tracked and synthesized the experiences of Black America in the 20th Century, using each historical decade, from 1904 to 1997, to document the physical, emotional, mental, and political strivings of Black life in the wake of emancipation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.august-wilson-theatre.com/plays.php|title=August Wilson, Pulitzer winning playwright: Plays|website=www.august-wilson-theatre.com|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\nWilson's best known plays are ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'' (1985) (which won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] and a [[Tony Award]]), ''[[The Piano Lesson]]'' (1990) (a [[Pulitzer Prize]] and the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award), ''[[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom]]'', and ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]''.\n\nWilson stated that he was most influenced by \"the four Bs\": blues music, the [[Argentine]] writer and poet [[Jorge Luis Borges]], the playwright [[Amiri Baraka]] and the painter [[Romare Bearden]].<ref Name=\"NYT\"/> He went on to add writers [[Ed Bullins]] and [[James Baldwin]] to the list. He noted:\n\n{{quote|From Borges, those wonderful gaucho stories from which I learned that you can be specific as to a time and place and culture and still have the work resonate with the universal themes of love, honor, duty, betrayal, etc. From Amiri Baraka, I learned that all art is political, although I don't write political plays. From Romare Bearden I learned that the fullness and richness of everyday life can be rendered without compromise or sentimentality.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/>}}\n\nHe valued Bullins and Baldwin for their honest representations of everyday life.<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/>\n\nLike Bearden, Wilson worked with collage techniques in writing: \"I try to make my plays the equal of his canvases. In creating plays I often use the image of a stewing pot in which I toss various things that I'm going to make use of\u2014a black cat, a garden, a bicycle, a man with a scar on his face, a pregnant woman, a man with a gun.\" On the meaning of his work Wilson stated\n\n{{quote|I once wrote this short story called \"The Best Blues Singer in the World\", and it went like this\u2014\"The streets that Balboa walked were his own private ocean, and Balboa was drowning.\" End of story. That says it all. Nothing else to say. I've been rewriting that same story over and over again. All my plays are rewriting that same story.<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/>}}\n\n===The ''Pittsburgh Cycle''===\n<!-- Please note this began as the Pitt Cycle and sources still note it as such - The alternate title of Century Cycle is noted with refs in this section -->\nWilson's ''Pittsburgh Cycle'', also often referred to as his ''Century Cycle'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marintheatre.org/productions/fences/fences-august-wilsons-century-cycle|title=10 Plays, 100 Years - Playwright August Wilson Reveals the History of a Community (From the Playbill)|publisher=}}</ref> consists of ten plays\u2014nine of which are set in Pittsburgh's Hill District (the other being set in Chicago), an [[African-American neighborhood]] that takes on a mythic literary significance like [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex]], [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Yoknapatawpha County]], or Irish playwright [[Brian Friel]]'s [[Ballybeg (fictional town)|Ballybeg]]. The plays are each set in a different decade and aim to sketch the Black experience in the 20th century and \"raise consciousness through theater\" and echo \"the poetry in the everyday language of black America\".<ref Name=\"Parisreview\">{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/839/the-art-of-theater-no-14-august-wilson| work=The Paris Review| title=August Wilson, The Art of Theater No. 14| author= Bonnie Lyons, George Plimpton| date=Winter 1999 }}</ref> His writing of the Black experience always featured strong female characters and sometimes included elements of the supernatural. In his book, he wrote \"My mother's a very strong, principled woman. My female characters . . . come in a large part from my mother\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=August|title=The Ground on which I Stand|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|year=2001|isbn=9781559361873|location=|pages=151}}</ref> As for the elements of the supernatural, Wilson often featured some form of superstition or old tradition in plays that came down to supernatural roots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/august-wilson-the-ground-on-which-i-stand-august-wilsonbiography-and-career-timeline/3683/|title=August Wilson: The Ground on Which I Stand {{!}} Biography and Timeline {{!}} American Masters {{!}} PBS|date=2015-01-28|website=American Masters|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> One of his plays well known for featuring this is ''The Piano Lesson''. In the play, the piano is used and releases spirits of the ancestors. Wilson wanted to create such an event in the play that the audience was left to decide what was real or not. He was fascinated by the power of theater as a medium where a community at large could come together to bear witness to events and currents unfolding.<ref Name=\"Parisreview\"/>\n\nWilson noted:\n\n{{quote|I think my plays offer (white Americans) a different way to look at black Americans,\" he told ''The Paris Review''. \"For instance, in ''Fences'' they see a garbageman, a person they don't really look at, although they see a garbageman every day. By looking at Troy's life, white people find out that the content of this black garbageman's life is affected by the same things \u2013 love, honor, beauty, betrayal, duty. Recognizing that these things are as much part of his life as theirs can affect how they think about and deal with black people in their lives.<ref Name=\"NYT\"/>}}\n\nAlthough the plays of the cycle are not strictly connected to the degree of a serial story, some characters appear (at various ages) in more than one of the cycle's plays. Children of characters in earlier plays may appear in later plays. The character most frequently mentioned in the cycle is Aunt Ester, a \"washer of souls\". She is reported to be 285 years old in ''[[Gem of the Ocean]]'', which takes place in her home at 1839 Wylie Avenue, and 322 in ''[[Two Trains Running]]''. She dies in 1985, during the events of ''[[King Hedley II]]''. Much of the action of ''[[Radio Golf]]'' revolves around the plan to demolish and redevelop that house, some years after her death. Aunt Ester is a symbolic and recurring figure that represents the African American struggle. She is \"not literally three centuries old but a succession of folk priestesses... [s]he embodies a weighty history of tragedy and triumph\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2009/11/09/August-Wilson-s-mythic-character-Aunt-Ester-explored-in-theater-festival/stories/200911090252|title=August Wilson's mythic character Aunt Ester explored in theater festival|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>.The plays often include an ''apparently'' mentally impaired oracular character (different in each play)\u2014for example, Hedley Sr. in ''[[Seven Guitars]]'', Gabriel in ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'', Stool Pigeon in ''[[King Hedley II]]'', or Hambone in ''[[Two Trains Running]]''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

They are most famous for their 1989 debut album ''[[Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz]]'' and the two singles from it; \"Rock and Roll (Is Gonna Set the Night on Fire)\" and \"I Wanna Be with You\". The band broke up in 1991 but reformed in 1995, releasing several new records since that time, and continue to the present.\n\n==History==\n\nAfter rehearsing and playing a few shows on the Sunset Strip, Pretty Boy Floyd got their big break at [[Music Corporation of America|MCA Records]]. Their debut album named ''[[Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz]]'' was released in 1989 and produced by producer [[Howard Benson]].\n\nTwo singles, and accompanying promotional videos were released from the album; \"Rock and Roll (Is Gonna Set the Night on Fire)\" and \"I Wanna Be with You\", which gained rotation on [[MTV]].  They were also having success in Europe at the time, by being the cover subject of [[hard rock]] magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' on December 16, 1989.\n\nPretty Boy Floyd became embroiled in a dispute over the [[copyright]] of their band name, with a Canadian band, also called [[Pretty Boy Floyd (Canadian band)|Pretty Boy Floyd]]. The Canadian group released their debut ''Bullets and Lipstik'' the same year, but after a negotiated settlement agreed to surrender use of the name.\n\nTheir music featured on two film [[soundtrack]]s, first the demo version of \"48 Hours\" was included on the 1989 film ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]''. Two years later the previously unreleased \"Slam Dunk\" was released on the [[Ellen Barkin]] movie ''[[Switch (1991 film)|Switch]]'' soundtrack. However, by that time MCA Records had dropped the band.\n\nBy late 1995 Pretty Boy Floyd had reformed. They recorded a five-song EP, ''[[A Tale of Sex, Designer Drugs, and the Death of Rock n' Roll]]'', in 1998. The band featured former [[Big Bang Babies]] guitarist [[Keri Kelli]], Steve Summers (Steven Podwalski), Kristy Majors (Chris Maggiore, Jr.), and Kari Kane (Cary Ayers).\n\nIn February 2006 they toured the United States and then broke up again. Majors released ''Sex, Drugs 'N' Rock N Roll'' and toured Europe in March 2007. On March 1, 2008, Majors and Kane joined Summers to play on stage at The Knitting Factory in Hollywood, California. In 2009, the band celebrated their 20th anniversary of the release of ''Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz'' with a world tour. Troy Patrick Farrell was hired as the drummer, and Criss 6 of Los Angeles-based M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce tribute band ''True 2 Crue'' was hired as the new bassist.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=130514 | title= PRETTY BOY FLOYD To Release New Album, Covers CD, Live DVD|last= Blabbermouth.net |first= |date=November 17, 2009|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOriginal bassist, Vinnie Chas (Charles Pusateri) died on April 5, 2010 from heart failure.<ref name=\"Dead\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2010.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club January to June 2010 |publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |date= |accessdate=December 23, 2012}}</ref> Kari Kane (Cary Ayers) has worked as a special effects make-up artist since 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3130442/|title=Cary Ayers|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=December 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2011, they announced a new album of original material and a tour to support the album. The band has also announced that Ben Graves formerly of [[Murderdolls]] and has been hired as the new drummer. They set out on the \"America Rocks Tour\" with Jack Russell's Great White, [[Faster Pussycat]] and [[Lillian Axe]] on June 15, 2012. During the tour, Majors and Summers got into an argument and the band ended up quitting the tour early. In April 2014 Majors announced his new band, \"Kristy Majors and the Thrill Kills\", which consisted of two previous members of Pretty Boy Floyd: JK Famous on bass and Ben Graves on drums. The band released one album and one music video.\n\nSummers kept busy by doing an album for the band Shameless as well as doing some solo shows worldwide.\n\nIn July 2015, Steve Summers and Kristy Majors announced they would reunite together and were in the process of finishing their album. The new version of the band included JK Famous on bass and Tod \"T\" Burr on drums. The band debuted at the Cathouse Live 30th Anniversary Festival in Irvine, California, and had a string of shows to follow. The band continued to tour through 2016 and were awarded at the Hair Metal Awards show in Las Vegas alongside Scorpions and Twisted Sister. In August 2016, the band parted ways with Tod \"T\" Burr and brought back Ben Graves on drums.\n\n==Members==\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Current'''\n*Steve \"Sex\" Summers (Steve Podwalski) - [[Singing|Vocals]] (1987\u20131991, 1995-Present)\n*Criss 6 - [[Bass guitar|Bass]] (2019-Present)\n*Colton Seaver - [[Guitar]] (2019-Present)</small>\n*Vikki Foxx - [[Drums]] (2019-Present)</small>\n\n{{col-2}}\n'''Former'''\n*[[Aeriel Stiles]] \u2014 guitar <small>(1987\u20131988, 1991)</small>\n*Kristy \"Krash\" Majors (Chris Maggiore) - [[Guitar]]s <small>(1988-1990, 1995\u20132003, 2006-2019)</small>\n*[[Vinnie Chas]] \u2014 bass <small>(1987-1991)</small>\n*Kari Kane - drums <small> (1987-1991, 1995-1999)</small>\n*[[Keri Kelli]] \u2014 guitar <small>(1995\u20131999, 2000\u20132001)</small>\n*JK Famous - [[Bass guitar|Bass]] (2006-2008, 2016-2019)\n*T'Chad - guitar (2003-2004)\n*Lesli Sanders - bass (2001-2004)\n*Dish - drums (2001-2004)\n*Jimmy Mess - drums (2017-2019)\n*Tod \"T\" Burr - drums (2015-2016)\n*Ben Graves - drums (2016-2017)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n*''[[Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz]]'' (1989) US No. 130\n*''[[Size Really Does Matter]]'' (2004)\n*''Public Enemies'' (2017)\n\n=== EPs ===\n*''[[A Tale of Sex, Designer Drugs, and the Death of Rock n' Roll]]'' (1998)\n\n===Live albums===\n*''[[Live at the Pretty Ugly Club]]'' (2001)\n*''Live on the Sunset Strip'' (2014)\n\n===Compilation albums===\n*''[[Porn Stars (album)|Porn Stars]]'' (1999)\n*''The Vault'' - (2002)\n*''The vault II'' - (2003)\n*''[[Tonight Belongs to the Young]]'' - <small>[[Remaster]]ed [[Demo (music)|demos]]</small> - (2003)\n*''Dirty Glam'' - (2004)\n*''The Greatest Collection - The Ultimate Pretty Boy Floyd'' - (2004)\n*''Glam As Fuck - Vinyl'' - (2009)\n*''Kiss Of Death: A Tribute to KISS'' (2010)\n*''Stray Bullet'' - (2019)\n\n===Singles===\n*\"Rock and Roll (Is Gonna Set the Night on Fire)\" (1989)\n*\"I Wanna Be with You\" (1989)\n*\"Do You Wanna Touch\" (2008)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.prettyboyfloydband.com}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019}}\n* Official Kristy Majors website {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210063447/http://www.kristymajors.com/}}\n* [http://love-it-loud.com/interviews/kristy-majors-pretty-boy-floyd/ Kristy Majors interview at Love-It-Loud.com]\n* [http://www.skylight.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=902:pretty-boy-floydthe-wild-angels-are-back-&catid=35:most-wanted-interviews&Itemid=29 Interview with Steve Summers @ Skylight Webzine]\n* [http://www.reverbnation.com/prettyboyfloyd323 Pretty Boy Floyd on Reverb]\n\n{{Pretty Boy Floyd}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pretty Boy Floyd (American Band)}}\n[[Category:American glam metal musical groups]]\n[[Category:Hard rock musical groups from California]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1987]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2017}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name = Pretty Boy Floyd\n| background = group_or_band\n| image = \n| image_size = \n| caption = \n| alias = \n| origin = [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]], United States\n| genre = [[Glam metal]], [[hard rock]]\n| years_active = 1987\u20131991, 1995\u2013present\n| label = {{flatlist|\n* [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]\n* [[Cleopatra Records|Cleopatra]]<ref>Steve Huey [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/pretty-boy-floyd-mn0000360013/biography \"Pretty Boy Floyd - Biography\"] \"AllMusic.com\" Retrieved October 30, 2017. </ref>\n* [[Frontiers Records|Frontiers]]\n* Deadline\n}}\n| associated_acts = \n| website = \n| current_members = \n* Steve \"Sex\" Summers\n* Colton Seaver\n* Criss 6\n* Vikki Foxx\n| past_members = \n}}\n\n'''Pretty Boy Floyd''' is a [[glam metal]] band from [[Hollywood]], [[California]], formed in 1987.

It comprised three races: the men's race, the women's race and the junior men's race. Furthermore, a team competition was held in each category, with the winners being decided by combining the performances of a country's top three finishers. The country with the lowest aggregate time won the team competition. The junior men's race was held in only the first and second editions, and was removed from the programme from 1994 onwards.\n\nThe competition went largely unchanged until 2006, when the competition was renamed as the '''IAAF World Road Running Championships'''. Aside from the name change, the significant difference was the distance of the race, changing from a [[half marathon]] to a [[20 kilometres road race]]. The 20&nbsp;km race featured only at the [[2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships|2006 edition]], and the half marathon distance returned for the [[2007 IAAF World Road Running Championships|2007 World Road Running Championships]].\n\nOn 29 November 2007, the IAAF announced that the name of the competition would revert to its original title of the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, beginning with the [[2008 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] on 12 October 2008.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.net/news/Kind=512/newsId=42537.html Rio 2008 \u2013 championships renamed].

Runners compete on public roads which have been closed off to traffic specifically for the event.

It comprised three races: the men's race, the women's race and the junior men's race. Furthermore, a team competition was held in each category, with the winners being decided by combining the performances of a country's top three finishers. The country with the lowest aggregate time won the team competition. The junior men's race was held in only the first and second editions, and was removed from the programme from 1994 onwards.\n\nThe competition went largely unchanged until 2006, when the competition was renamed as the '''IAAF World Road Running Championships'''. Aside from the name change, the significant difference was the distance of the race, changing from a [[half marathon]] to a [[20 kilometres road race]]. The 20&nbsp;km race featured only at the [[2006 IAAF World Road Running Championships|2006 edition]], and the half marathon distance returned for the [[2007 IAAF World Road Running Championships|2007 World Road Running Championships]].\n\nOn 29 November 2007, the IAAF announced that the name of the competition would revert to its original title of the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, beginning with the [[2008 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] on 12 October 2008.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.net/news/Kind=512/newsId=42537.html Rio 2008 \u2013 championships renamed].

Runners compete on public roads which have been closed off to traffic specifically for the event.
