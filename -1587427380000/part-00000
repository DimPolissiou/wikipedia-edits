In the [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|antebellum]] years, free people of mixed race ([[free people of color]]) were considered legally white if individuals had less than one-eighth or [[quadroon|one-quarter African ancestry]] (depending on the state).<ref name=Rothman>Joshua D.

These and community acceptance were the more important factors if a person's racial status were questioned, not his or her documented ancestry. Because of the [[social mobility]] of antebellum society in frontier areas, many people did not have documentation about their ancestors anyway.\n\nBased on late 20th-century [[DNA]] analysis and a preponderance of historical evidence, [[Thomas Jefferson]] is widely believed to have fathered the six [[mixed-race]] children with his slave [[Sally Hemings]], who was herself three-quarters white. Four of these children, who were seven-eighths white, survived to adulthood. Hemings was a half-sister of [[Martha Jefferson|Martha Wayles Jefferson]].{{#tag:ref|\"Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF [Thomas Jefferson Foundation] and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings.\"<ref name=\"Sally Hemings 2011\">[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html \"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\"], Monticello Website, accessed 22 June 2011.</ref>|group=\"quote\"}} Their children were born into slavery because of her status; as they were seven-eighths European in ancestry, they were legally white under Virginia law of the time.<ref name=\"Sally Hemings 2011\"/> Jefferson allowed the two oldest to escape in 1822 (freeing them legally was a public action he elected to avoid because he would have had to gain permission from the state legislature); the two youngest he freed in his 1826 will.

In 1895 in [[South Carolina]] during discussion, [[George D. Tillman]] said,\n<blockquote>It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of... colored blood...It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood.

This was largely due to the majority of the early colonists being male. As many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes had matrilineal kinship systems, they considered the children to be born to the mother's family and clan. If they were raised in the culture, they were considered members of the community, and therefore, fully Native American. \n\nPrior to colonization, and still in traditional communities, the idea of determining belonging by degree of \"blood\" was, and is, unheard of. Native American tribes did not use blood quantum law until the [[United States government|government]] introduced the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]], instead determining tribal status on the basis of kinship, lineage and family ties.<ref name=Tallbear1>{{cite journal|author=Kimberly Tallbear |title=DNA, Blood, and Racializing the Tribe|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date= 2003 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=81\u2013107 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |jstor=140943|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0008}}</ref>\n\nAmong [[patrilineal]] tribes, such as the [[Omaha people|Omaha]], historically a child born to an Omaha mother and a white father could belong officially to the Omaha tribe only if the child were formally adopted into it by a male citizen.{{#tag:ref|In 1855, John Bigelk, nephew of Big Elk, described a Sioux attack in which the [[mixed-race]] man [[Logan Fontenelle]], son of an Omaha woman and a French trader, was killed: \"They killed the white man, the interpreter, who was with us.\" As the historian Melvin Randolph Gilmore noted, Bigelk called Fontenelle \"a white man because he had a white father.

The poet [[Langston Hughes]] wrote in his 1940 memoir:\n\n{{quote|You see, unfortunately, I am not black. There are lots of different kinds of blood in our family. But here in the United States, the word 'Negro' is used to mean anyone who has any Negro blood at all in his veins. In Africa, the word is more pure. It means all Negro, therefore black. I am brown.<ref>Langston Hughes, ''The Big Sea, an Autobiography'' (New York: Knopf, 1940).</ref>}}\n\nThis rule meant many mixed-race people, of diverse ancestry, were simply seen as African-American, and their more diverse ancestors forgotten and erased, making it difficult to accurately trace ancestry in the present day. \n\nMany descendants of those who were enslaved and trafficked by Europeans and Americans have assumed they have [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry. In 2006 [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]]'s 2006 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary on the genetic makeup of African Americans, ''[[African American Lives]]'', focused on these stories of Native American heritage in African-American communities.

Sociologically, however, the concept remains somewhat pervasive. Some African Americans turned it around, claiming people of African descent in order to strengthen their political unity when working on activism for civil rights and legislation. Research has shown that some white people associate bi-racial children with the non-white ancestry of the individual.<ref name=Davis/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/12/one-drop-rule-persists/|title='One-drop rule' persists|date=2010-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==Legislation and practice==\nBoth before and after the [[American Civil War]], many people of mixed ancestry who \"looked white\" and were of mostly white ancestry were legally absorbed into the white majority. State laws established differing standards. For instance, an 1822 Virginia law stated that to be defined as [[mulatto]] (that is, multi-racial), a person had to have at least one-quarter (equivalent to one grandparent) African ancestry.{{#tag:ref|\"To be defined as 'mulatto' under Virginia law in 1822, a person had to have at least one-quarter African ancestry.\" (This is the equivalent to one grandparent.)<ref name=Rothman/>{{rp|68}}|group=\"quote\"}} Social acceptance and identity were historically the keys to racial identity. Virginia's one-fourth standard remained in place until 1910, when the standard was changed to one sixteenth. In 1924, under the [[Racial Integrity Act]], even the one sixteenth standard was abandoned in favor of a more stringent standard. The act defined a person as legally \"colored\" (black) for classification and legal purposes if the individual had ''any'' African ancestry.\n\nAlthough the Virginia legislature increased restrictions on free blacks following the [[Nat Turner Rebellion]] of 1831, it refrained from establishing a one-drop rule. When a proposal was made by [[Travis H. Eppes]] and debated in 1853, representatives realized that such a rule could adversely affect whites, as they were aware of [[First Families of Virginia#Pocahontas|generations of interracial relationships]]. During the debate, a person wrote to the [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] newspaper:\n\n{{quote|[If a one-drop rule were adopted], I doubt not, if many who are reputed to be white, and are in fact so, do not in a very short time find themselves instead of being elevated, reduced by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, to the level of a free negro.<ref name=Rothman/>{{rp|230}} }}\n\nThe state legislators agreed. No such law was passed until 1924, apparently assisted by the fading recollection of such mixed familial histories. In the 21st century, such interracial family histories are being revealed as individuals undergo DNA genetic analysis.\n\nThe [[Melungeons]] are a group of multiracial families of mostly European and African ancestry whose ancestors were free in colonial Virginia. They migrated to the frontier in Kentucky and Tennessee. Their descendants have been documented over the decades as having tended to marry persons classified as \"white\".<ref>[http://freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1999\u20132005].</ref> Their descendants became assimilated into the majority culture from the 19th to the 20th centuries.\n\nPursuant to Reconstruction later in the 19th century, southern states acted to impose racial segregation by law and restrict the liberties of blacks, specifically passing laws to exclude them from politics and voting. From 1890 to 1908, all of the former Confederate states passed such laws, and most preserved disfranchisement until after passage of federal civil rights laws in the 1960s. At the South Carolina constitutional convention in 1895, an anti-[[miscegenation]] law and changes that would [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] blacks were proposed. Delegates debated a proposal for a one-drop rule to include in these laws. [[George D. Tillman]] said the following in opposition:\n\n{{quote|If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers.

The act stated that \"every person who shall have one-eighth or more of negro blood shall be deemed and held to be a person of color.\" (This was the equivalent of one great-grandparent.) Additionally, the act outlawed fornication, as well as the intermarrying of white females with men of color.

This was decades after the Civil War, [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]], and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era. It followed restoration of [[white supremacy]] in the South and the passage of [[Jim Crow]] [[racial segregation]] laws. In the 20th century, it was also associated with the rise of [[eugenics]] and ideas of [[racial purity]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} From the late 1870s on, white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained political power in the former Confederate states and passed racial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] laws controlling public facilities, and laws and constitutions from 1890 to 1910 to achieve disfranchisement of most blacks. Many poor whites were also disfranchised in these years, by changes to voter registration rules that worked against them, such as [[literacy tests]], longer residency requirements and [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]].\n\nThe first challenges to such state laws were overruled by [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions which upheld state constitutions that effectively disfranchised many. White Democratic-dominated legislatures proceeded with passing [[Jim Crow laws]] that instituted racial segregation in public places and accommodations, and passed other restrictive voting legislation. In ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', the Supreme Court allowed racial segregation of public facilities, under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nJim Crow laws reached their greatest influence during the decades from 1910 to 1930. Among them were hypodescent laws, defining as black anyone with any black ancestry, or with a very small portion of black ancestry.<ref name=\"highered.mcgraw-hill\" /> [[Tennessee]] adopted such a \"one-drop\" statute in 1910, and [[Louisiana]] soon followed. Then [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]] in 1911, [[Mississippi]] in 1917, [[North Carolina]] in 1923, [[Virginia]] in 1924, [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1927, and [[Oklahoma]] in 1931. During this same period, [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Utah]] retained their old \"blood fraction\" statutes ''[[de jure]]'', but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirty-second) to be equivalent to one-drop ''[[de facto]].''<ref>Pauli Murray, ed. ''States' Laws on Race and Color'' (Athens, 1997), 428, 173, 443, 37, 237, 330, 463, 22, 39, 358, 77, 150, 164, 207, 254, 263, 459.</ref>\n\nBefore 1930, individuals of visible mixed European and African ancestry were usually classed as [[mulatto]], or sometimes as black and sometimes as white, depending on appearance. Previously, most states had limited trying to define ancestry before \"the fourth degree\" (great-great-grandparents). But, in 1930, due to lobbying by southern legislators, the Census Bureau stopped using the classification of mulatto. Documentation of the long social recognition of [[mixed-race]] people was lost, and they were classified only as black or white.\n\nThe binary world of the one-drop rule disregarded the self-identification both of people of mostly European ancestry who grew up in white communities, and of people who were of mixed race and identified as American Indian. In addition, [[Walter Plecker]], Registrar of Statistics, ordered application of the 1924 Virginia law in such a way that vital records were changed or destroyed, family members were split on opposite sides of the color line, and there were losses of the documented continuity of people who identified as American Indian, as all people in Virginia had to be classified as white or black. Over the centuries, many Indian tribes in Virginia had absorbed people of other ethnicities through marriage or adoption, but maintained their cultures. Suspecting blacks of trying to \"[[Passing (racial identity)|pass]]\" as Indians, Plecker ordered records changed to classify people only as black or white, and ordered offices to reclassify certain family surnames from Indian to black.\n\nSince the late 20th century, Virginia has officially recognized eight American Indian tribes and their members; the tribes are trying to gain federal recognition. They have had difficulty because decades of birth, marriage, and death records were misclassified under Plecker's application of the law. No one was classified as Indian, although many individuals and families identified that way and were preserving their cultures.\n\nIn the case of mixed-race [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and European descendants, the one-drop rule in Virginia was extended only so far as those with more than one-sixteenth Indian blood. This was due to what was known as \"[[Racial Integrity Act of 1924#The Pocahontas exception|the Pocahontas exception]]\". Since many influential [[First Families of Virginia]] (FFV) claimed descent from the American Indian [[Pocahontas]] and her husband [[John Rolfe]] of the colonial era, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] declared that an individual could be considered white if having no more than one-sixteenth Indian \"blood\" (the equivalent of one great-great-grandparent).\n\nThe [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] of New York wrote in his book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916): \"The cross between a white man and an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] is an Indian; the cross between a white man and a Negro is a Negro; the cross between a white man and a [[Historical definitions of races in India|Hindu]] is a Hindu; and the cross between any of the three European races and a [[Jew]] is a Jew.\"<ref>Madison Grant, ''The Passing of the Great Race'', 1916.</ref> As noted above, Native American tribes such as the Omaha, which had patrilineal descent and inheritance, used hypodescent to classify the children of white men and Native American women as white.\n\n==Plecker case==\n{{Main|Walter Plecker}}\nThrough the 1940s, [[Walter Plecker]] of Virginia<ref>For the Plecker story, see {{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = J.

As the Registrar of Statistics, Plecker insisted on labeling mixed-race families of European-African ancestry as black. In 1924, Plecker wrote, \"Two races as materially divergent as the White and Negro, in morals, mental powers, and cultural fitness, cannot live in close contact without injury to the higher.\" In the 1930s and 1940s, Plecker directed offices under his authority to change vital records and reclassify certain families as black (or colored) (without notifying them) after Virginia established a binary system under its Racial Integrity Act of 1924. He also classified people as black who had formerly self-identified as Indian. When the United States Supreme Court struck down Virginia's law prohibiting inter-racial marriage in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967), it also declared Plecker's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|Virginia Racial Integrity Act]] and the one-drop rule unconstitutional.\n\nMany people in the U.S., among various ethnic groups, continue to have their own concepts related to the one-drop idea. They may still consider those multiracial individuals with any African ancestry to be black, or at least non-white (if the person has other minority ancestry), unless the person explicitly identifies as white. On the other hand, the [[Black Power Movement]] and some leaders within the black community also claimed as black those persons with any visible African ancestry, in order to extend their political base and regardless of how those people self-identified. The number of self-identified multi-racial people in the US is increasing.\n\n==Other countries of the Americas==\n{{Main|Race and ethnicity in Latin America}}\n[[File:Condoleezza Rice Colin Powell George W.

In the late 19th century, Southern whites regained political power and restored [[white supremacy]], passing [[Jim Crow]] laws and establishing [[racial segregation]] by law. In the 20th century, during the Black Power Movement, black race-based groups claimed all people of any African ancestry as black in a reverse way, to establish political power.\n\nIn colonial [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], many soldiers and explorers took [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] women as wives. Native-born Spanish women were always a minority. The colonists developed an elaborate classification and [[Casta|caste system]] that identified the mixed-race descendants of blacks, [[Amerindian]]s, and whites by different names, related to appearance and known ancestry. Racial caste not only depended on ancestry or skin color, but also could be raised or lowered by the person's financial status or class.\n\n[[File:Lena Horne - 1941.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Lena Horne]] was reportedly descended from the [[John C.

Although many are not considered black in their homelands, they have often been considered black in US society. According to ''The Washington Post'', their refusal to accept the United States' definition of black has left many feeling attacked from all directions. At times, white and black Americans might discriminate against them for their lighter or darker skin tones; African Americans might believe that [[Afro-Latin American|Afro-Latino]] immigrants are denying their blackness. At the same time, the immigrants think [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|lighter-skinned Latinos]] dominate [[Television in the United States#Broadcast television in non-English languages|Spanish-language television]] and media. A majority of [[Latin Americans]] possess some African or American Indian ancestry. Many of these immigrants feel it is difficult enough to accept a new language and culture without the additional burden of having to transform from white to black. Yvette Modestin, a dark-skinned native of Panama who worked in [[Boston]], said the situation was overwhelming: \"There's not a day that I don't have to explain myself.\"<ref name=WPost/>\n\nProfessor J.B. Bird has said that Latin America is not alone in rejecting the historical US notion that any visible African ancestry is enough to make one black:\n<blockquote>In most countries of the Caribbean, [[Colin Powell]] would be described as a [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|Creole]], reflecting his mixed heritage.

Mixed-race children of white mothers were born free, and many families of free people of color were started in those years. 80 percent of the free African-American families in the Upper South in the censuses of 1790 to 1810 can be traced as descendants of unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, not of slave women and white men. In the early colony, conditions were loose among the working class, who lived and worked closely together. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], their free mixed-race descendants migrated to the frontiers of nearby states along with other primarily European Virginia pioneers.<ref>Paul Heinegg, [http://www.freeafricanamericans.com ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], 1999\u20132005.</ref> The admixture also reflects later conditions under slavery, when white planters or their sons, or overseers, frequently raped African women.<ref>Moon, Dannell, \"Slavery\", in ''Encyclopedia of Rape,'' Merril D.

For example, he found that the black populations with the highest percentage of white ancestry lived in California and Seattle, Washington. These were both majority-white destinations during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of 1940\u20131970 of African Americans from the Deep South of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi.

Most respondents identified as black, explaining that this is because both black and white people see them as black as well.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Khanna|first1=Nikki|title=If you're half black, you're just black: Reflected Appraisals and the Persistence of the One-Drop Rule|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|date=2010|volume=51|issue=5|pages=96\u2013121|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.2009.01162.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.619.9359}}</ref>\n\n==Allusions==\n[[Charles W.

The American [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927) opens in 1887 on a Mississippi River boat, after the Reconstruction era and imposition of [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] in the South. Steve, a white man married to a mixed-race woman who [[passing (racial identity)|passes]] as white, is pursued by a Southern sheriff. He intends to arrest Steve and charge him with [[miscegenation]] for being married to a woman of partly black ancestry. Steve pricks his wife's finger and swallows some of her blood. When the sheriff arrives, Steve asks him whether he would consider a man to be white if he had \"negro blood\" in him. The sheriff replies that \"one drop of Negro blood makes you a Negro in these parts\". Steve tells the sheriff that he has \"more than a drop of negro blood in me\". After being assured by others that Steve is telling the truth, the sheriff leaves without arresting Steve.<ref name=tcm>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?scarlettTitleId=14440 ''Show Boat'' (1951) Overview], Turner Classic Movies.

These and community acceptance were the more important factors if a person's racial status were questioned, not his or her documented ancestry. Because of the [[social mobility]] of antebellum society in frontier areas, many people did not have documentation about their ancestors anyway.\n\nBased on late 20th-century [[DNA]] analysis and a preponderance of historical evidence, [[Thomas Jefferson]] is widely believed to have fathered the six [[mixed-race]] children with his slave [[Sally Hemings]], who was herself three-quarters white. Four of these children, who were seven-eighths white, survived to adulthood. Hemings was a half-sister of [[Martha Jefferson|Martha Wayles Jefferson]].{{#tag:ref|\"Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF [Thomas Jefferson Foundation] and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings.\"<ref name=\"Sally Hemings 2011\">[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html \"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\"], Monticello Website, accessed 22 June 2011.</ref>|group=\"quote\"}} Their children were born into slavery because of her status; as they were seven-eighths European in ancestry, they were legally white under Virginia law of the time.<ref name=\"Sally Hemings 2011\"/> Jefferson allowed the two oldest to escape in 1822 (freeing them legally was a public action he elected to avoid because he would have had to gain permission from the state legislature); the two youngest he freed in his 1826 will.

In 1895 in [[South Carolina]] during discussion, [[George D. Tillman]] said,\n<blockquote>It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of... colored blood...It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood.

This was largely due to the majority of the early colonists being male. As many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes had matrilineal kinship systems, they considered the children to be born to the mother's family and clan. If they were raised in the culture, they were considered members of the community, and therefore, fully Native American. \n\nPrior to colonization, and still in traditional communities, the idea of determining belonging by degree of \"blood\" was, and is, unheard of.

The poet [[Langston Hughes]] wrote in his 1940 memoir:\n\n{{quote|You see, unfortunately, I am not black. There are lots of different kinds of blood in our family. But here in the United States, the word 'Negro' is used to mean anyone who has any Negro blood at all in his veins. In Africa, the word is more pure. It means all Negro, therefore black. I am brown.<ref>Langston Hughes, ''The Big Sea, an Autobiography'' (New York: Knopf, 1940).</ref>}}\n\nThis rule meant many mixed-race people, of diverse ancestry, were simply seen as African-American, and their more diverse ancestors forgotten and erased, making it difficult to accurately trace ancestry in the present day. \n\nMany descendants of those who were enslaved and trafficked by Europeans and Americans have assumed they have [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry.

Sociologically, however, the concept remains somewhat pervasive.

State laws established differing standards. For instance, an 1822 Virginia law stated that to be defined as [[mulatto]] (that is, multi-racial), a person had to have at least one-quarter (equivalent to one grandparent) African ancestry.{{#tag:ref|\"To be defined as 'mulatto' under Virginia law in 1822, a person had to have at least one-quarter African ancestry.\" (This is the equivalent to one grandparent.)<ref name=Rothman/>{{rp|68}}|group=\"quote\"}} Social acceptance and identity were historically the keys to racial identity. Virginia's one-fourth standard remained in place until 1910, when the standard was changed to one sixteenth. In 1924, under the [[Racial Integrity Act]], even the one sixteenth standard was abandoned in favor of a more stringent standard. The act defined a person as legally \"colored\" (black) for classification and legal purposes if the individual had ''any'' African ancestry.\n\nAlthough the Virginia legislature increased restrictions on free blacks following the [[Nat Turner Rebellion]] of 1831, it refrained from establishing a one-drop rule. When a proposal was made by [[Travis H. Eppes]] and debated in 1853, representatives realized that such a rule could adversely affect whites, as they were aware of [[First Families of Virginia#Pocahontas|generations of interracial relationships]]. During the debate, a person wrote to the [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] newspaper:\n\n{{quote|[If a one-drop rule were adopted], I doubt not, if many who are reputed to be white, and are in fact so, do not in a very short time find themselves instead of being elevated, reduced by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, to the level of a free negro.<ref name=Rothman/>{{rp|230}} }}\n\nThe state legislators agreed. No such law was passed until 1924, apparently assisted by the fading recollection of such mixed familial histories. In the 21st century, such interracial family histories are being revealed as individuals undergo DNA genetic analysis.\n\nThe [[Melungeons]] are a group of multiracial families of mostly European and African ancestry whose ancestors were free in colonial Virginia. They migrated to the frontier in Kentucky and Tennessee. Their descendants have been documented over the decades as having tended to marry persons classified as \"white\".<ref>[http://freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1999\u20132005].</ref> Their descendants became assimilated into the majority culture from the 19th to the 20th centuries.\n\nPursuant to Reconstruction later in the 19th century, southern states acted to impose racial segregation by law and restrict the liberties of blacks, specifically passing laws to exclude them from politics and voting. From 1890 to 1908, all of the former Confederate states passed such laws, and most preserved disfranchisement until after passage of federal civil rights laws in the 1960s. At the South Carolina constitutional convention in 1895, an anti-[[miscegenation]] law and changes that would [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] blacks were proposed. Delegates debated a proposal for a one-drop rule to include in these laws. [[George D. Tillman]] said the following in opposition:\n\n{{quote|If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified.

The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice, and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins.

The act stated that \"every person who shall have one-eighth or more of negro blood shall be deemed and held to be a person of color.\" (This was the equivalent of one great-grandparent.) Additionally, the act outlawed fornication, as well as the intermarrying of white females with men of color. However, the act permitted the continuation of marriages between white persons and persons of color that were established before the law was enacted.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kAI4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=Laws+of+the+State+of+Florida,+First+Session+of+the+Fourteenth+General+Assembly+Under+the+Amended+Constitution+1865-6&source=bl&ots=itF_t21WYg&sig=kLxpaFDXlBW6JaPj95kS972f5iQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=21o7UqTEHLaz4AOR7IG4CA&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Laws%20of%20the%20State%20of%20Florida%2C%20First%20Session%20of%20the%20Fourteenth%20General%20Assembly%20Under%20the%20Amended%20Constitution%201865-6&f=false ''Laws of the State of Florida, First Session of the Fourteenth General Assembly Under the Amended Constitution 1865\u2013'6''].

This was decades after the Civil War, [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]], and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era. It followed restoration of [[white supremacy]] in the South and the passage of [[Jim Crow]] [[racial segregation]] laws. In the 20th century, it was also associated with the rise of [[eugenics]] and ideas of [[racial purity]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} From the late 1870s on, white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained political power in the former Confederate states and passed racial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] laws controlling public facilities, and laws and constitutions from 1890 to 1910 to achieve disfranchisement of most blacks. Many poor whites were also disfranchised in these years, by changes to voter registration rules that worked against them, such as [[literacy tests]], longer residency requirements and [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]].\n\nThe first challenges to such state laws were overruled by [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions which upheld state constitutions that effectively disfranchised many. White Democratic-dominated legislatures proceeded with passing [[Jim Crow laws]] that instituted racial segregation in public places and accommodations, and passed other restrictive voting legislation. In ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', the Supreme Court allowed racial segregation of public facilities, under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nJim Crow laws reached their greatest influence during the decades from 1910 to 1930. Among them were hypodescent laws, defining as black anyone with any black ancestry, or with a very small portion of black ancestry.<ref name=\"highered.mcgraw-hill\" /> [[Tennessee]] adopted such a \"one-drop\" statute in 1910, and [[Louisiana]] soon followed. Then [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]] in 1911, [[Mississippi]] in 1917, [[North Carolina]] in 1923, [[Virginia]] in 1924, [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1927, and [[Oklahoma]] in 1931. During this same period, [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Utah]] retained their old \"blood fraction\" statutes ''[[de jure]]'', but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirty-second) to be equivalent to one-drop ''[[de facto]].''<ref>Pauli Murray, ed. ''States' Laws on Race and Color'' (Athens, 1997), 428, 173, 443, 37, 237, 330, 463, 22, 39, 358, 77, 150, 164, 207, 254, 263, 459.</ref>\n\nBefore 1930, individuals of visible mixed European and African ancestry were usually classed as [[mulatto]], or sometimes as black and sometimes as white, depending on appearance. Previously, most states had limited trying to define ancestry before \"the fourth degree\" (great-great-grandparents). But, in 1930, due to lobbying by southern legislators, the Census Bureau stopped using the classification of mulatto. Documentation of the long social recognition of [[mixed-race]] people was lost, and they were classified only as black or white.\n\nThe binary world of the one-drop rule disregarded the self-identification both of people of mostly European ancestry who grew up in white communities, and of people who were of mixed race and identified as American Indian. In addition, [[Walter Plecker]], Registrar of Statistics, ordered application of the 1924 Virginia law in such a way that vital records were changed or destroyed, family members were split on opposite sides of the color line, and there were losses of the documented continuity of people who identified as American Indian, as all people in Virginia had to be classified as white or black. Over the centuries, many Indian tribes in Virginia had absorbed people of other ethnicities through marriage or adoption, but maintained their cultures. Suspecting blacks of trying to \"[[Passing (racial identity)|pass]]\" as Indians, Plecker ordered records changed to classify people only as black or white, and ordered offices to reclassify certain family surnames from Indian to black.\n\nSince the late 20th century, Virginia has officially recognized eight American Indian tribes and their members; the tribes are trying to gain federal recognition. They have had difficulty because decades of birth, marriage, and death records were misclassified under Plecker's application of the law. No one was classified as Indian, although many individuals and families identified that way and were preserving their cultures.\n\nIn the case of mixed-race [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and European descendants, the one-drop rule in Virginia was extended only so far as those with more than one-sixteenth Indian blood. This was due to what was known as \"[[Racial Integrity Act of 1924#The Pocahontas exception|the Pocahontas exception]]\". Since many influential [[First Families of Virginia]] (FFV) claimed descent from the American Indian [[Pocahontas]] and her husband [[John Rolfe]] of the colonial era, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] declared that an individual could be considered white if having no more than one-sixteenth Indian \"blood\" (the equivalent of one great-great-grandparent).\n\nThe [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] of New York wrote in his book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916): \"The cross between a white man and an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] is an Indian; the cross between a white man and a Negro is a Negro; the cross between a white man and a [[Historical definitions of races in India|Hindu]] is a Hindu; and the cross between any of the three European races and a [[Jew]] is a Jew.\"<ref>Madison Grant, ''The Passing of the Great Race'', 1916.</ref> As noted above, Native American tribes such as the Omaha, which had patrilineal descent and inheritance, used hypodescent to classify the children of white men and Native American women as white.\n\n==Plecker case==\n{{Main|Walter Plecker}}\nThrough the 1940s, [[Walter Plecker]] of Virginia<ref>For the Plecker story, see {{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = J.

As the Registrar of Statistics, Plecker insisted on labeling mixed-race families of European-African ancestry as black. In 1924, Plecker wrote, \"Two races as materially divergent as the White and Negro, in morals, mental powers, and cultural fitness, cannot live in close contact without injury to the higher.\" In the 1930s and 1940s, Plecker directed offices under his authority to change vital records and reclassify certain families as black (or colored) (without notifying them) after Virginia established a binary system under its Racial Integrity Act of 1924. He also classified people as black who had formerly self-identified as Indian. When the United States Supreme Court struck down Virginia's law prohibiting inter-racial marriage in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967), it also declared Plecker's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|Virginia Racial Integrity Act]] and the one-drop rule unconstitutional.\n\nMany people in the U.S., among various ethnic groups, continue to have their own concepts related to the one-drop idea. They may still consider those multiracial individuals with any African ancestry to be black, or at least non-white (if the person has other minority ancestry), unless the person explicitly identifies as white. On the other hand, the [[Black Power Movement]] and some leaders within the black community also claimed as black those persons with any visible African ancestry, in order to extend their political base and regardless of how those people self-identified. The number of self-identified multi-racial people in the US is increasing.\n\n==Other countries of the Americas==\n{{Main|Race and ethnicity in Latin America}}\n[[File:Condoleezza Rice Colin Powell George W.

Bush|Bush]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]] (on the right) are considered white.]]\nAmong the colonial slave societies, the United States was nearly unique in developing the one-drop rule; it derived both from the Southern slave culture (shared by other societies) and the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]], [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of slaves, and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In the late 19th century, Southern whites regained political power and restored [[white supremacy]], passing [[Jim Crow]] laws and establishing [[racial segregation]] by law. In the 20th century, during the Black Power Movement, black race-based groups claimed all people of any African ancestry as black in a reverse way, to establish political power.\n\nIn colonial [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], many soldiers and explorers took [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] women as wives. Native-born Spanish women were always a minority. The colonists developed an elaborate classification and [[Casta|caste system]] that identified the mixed-race descendants of blacks, [[Amerindian]]s, and whites by different names, related to appearance and known ancestry. Racial caste not only depended on ancestry or skin color, but also could be raised or lowered by the person's financial status or class.\n\n[[File:Lena Horne - 1941.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Lena Horne]] was reportedly descended from the [[John C. Calhoun]] family, and both sides of her family were a mixture of [[African-American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and [[European American]] descent.]]\nThe same racial culture shock has come to hundreds of thousands of dark-skinned immigrants to the United States from Brazil, [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], and other Latin American nations. Although many are not considered black in their homelands, they have often been considered black in US society. According to ''The Washington Post'', their refusal to accept the United States' definition of black has left many feeling attacked from all directions. At times, white and black Americans might discriminate against them for their lighter or darker skin tones; African Americans might believe that [[Afro-Latin American|Afro-Latino]] immigrants are denying their blackness. At the same time, the immigrants think [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|lighter-skinned Latinos]] dominate [[Television in the United States#Broadcast television in non-English languages|Spanish-language television]] and media. A majority of [[Latin Americans]] possess some African or American Indian ancestry. Many of these immigrants feel it is difficult enough to accept a new language and culture without the additional burden of having to transform from white to black. Yvette Modestin, a dark-skinned native of Panama who worked in [[Boston]], said the situation was overwhelming: \"There's not a day that I don't have to explain myself.\"<ref name=WPost/>\n\nProfessor J.B. Bird has said that Latin America is not alone in rejecting the historical US notion that any visible African ancestry is enough to make one black:\n<blockquote>In most countries of the Caribbean, [[Colin Powell]] would be described as a [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|Creole]], reflecting his mixed heritage. In [[Belize]], he might further be described as a \"High Creole\", because of his extremely light complexion.<ref>[http://www.johnhorse.com/black-seminoles/faq-black-seminoles.htm FAQ on the Black Seminoles, John Horse, and Rebellion<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref></blockquote>These examples show that the perception of race is relative to different societies and individuals.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{See also|Race in Brazil}}\n[[File:Reden\u00e7\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''A Reden\u00e7\u00e3o de Cam'' (''[[Curse of Ham|Redemption of Ham]]''), [[Modesto Brocos]], 1895, [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes]]. The painting depicts a black grandmother, mulatta mother, white father and their [[quadroon]] child, hence three generations of [[hypergamy]] through [[racial whitening]].]]\nPeople in many other countries have tended to treat race less rigidly, both in their self-identification and how they regard others. Just as a person with physically recognizable African ancestry can claim to be black in the United States, someone with recognizable [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] ancestry may be considered white in [[Brazil]], even if mixed race.\n\nIn December 2002, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran a story on the one-drop rule and differences in Latin American practices. In the reporter's opinion:\n<blockquote>Someone with [[Sidney Poitier]]'s deep chocolate complexion would be considered white if his hair were straight and he made a living in a profession. That might not seem so odd, Brazilians say, when you consider that the fair-complexioned actresses [[Rashida Jones]] ('[[Parks and Recreation]]' and '[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]') and [[Lena Horne]] are identified as black in the United States.<ref name=WPost>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/12/26/people-of-color-who-never-felt-they-were-black/071e165f-48b7-4aaa-9d86-23e907cfbc7f/ \"People of Color Who Never Felt They Were Black\"] ''The Washington Post''.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Jose Neinstein, a native white Brazilian and executive director of the [[Brazilian American|Brazilian-American]] Cultural Institute in Washington, in the United States, \"If you are not quite white, then you are black.\" However, in Brazil, \"If you are not quite black, then you are white.\" Neinstein recalls talking with a man of Poitier's complexion when in Brazil: \"We were discussing ethnicity, and I asked him, 'What do you think about this from your perspective as a black man?'

Mixed-race children of white mothers were born free, and many families of free people of color were started in those years. 80 percent of the free African-American families in the Upper South in the censuses of 1790 to 1810 can be traced as descendants of unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, not of slave women and white men. In the early colony, conditions were loose among the working class, who lived and worked closely together. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], their free mixed-race descendants migrated to the frontiers of nearby states along with other primarily European Virginia pioneers.<ref>Paul Heinegg, [http://www.freeafricanamericans.com ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], 1999\u20132005.</ref> The admixture also reflects later conditions under slavery, when white planters or their sons, or overseers, frequently raped African women.<ref>Moon, Dannell, \"Slavery\", in ''Encyclopedia of Rape,'' Merril D.

For example, he found that the black populations with the highest percentage of white ancestry lived in California and Seattle, Washington. These were both majority-white destinations during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of 1940\u20131970 of African Americans from the Deep South of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi.

The American [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927) opens in 1887 on a Mississippi River boat, after the Reconstruction era and imposition of [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] in the South. Steve, a white man married to a mixed-race woman who [[passing (racial identity)|passes]] as white, is pursued by a Southern sheriff. He intends to arrest Steve and charge him with [[miscegenation]] for being married to a woman of partly black ancestry. Steve pricks his wife's finger and swallows some of her blood. When the sheriff arrives, Steve asks him whether he would consider a man to be white if he had \"negro blood\" in him. The sheriff replies that \"one drop of Negro blood makes you a Negro in these parts\". Steve tells the sheriff that he has \"more than a drop of negro blood in me\". After being assured by others that Steve is telling the truth, the sheriff leaves without arresting Steve.<ref name=tcm>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?scarlettTitleId=14440 ''Show Boat'' (1951) Overview], Turner Classic Movies.

In the wake of [[postmodern literature]], critics such as [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Michel Foucault]] have examined the role and relevance of authorship to the meaning or interpretation of a text.\n\nBarthes challenges the idea that a text can be attributed to any single author. He writes, in his essay \"Death of the Author\" (1968), that \"it is language which speaks, not the author\".<ref name=\"barthes\">{{Citation\n| last = Barthes\n|first = Roland |\nchapter = The Death of the Author |\nyear = 1968 |\ntitle = Image, Music, Text |\npublication-date = 1997 | isbn = 0-00-686135-0}}</ref> The words and language of a text itself determine and expose meaning for Barthes, and not someone possessing legal responsibility for the process of its production.

To expose meanings in a written work without appealing to the celebrity of an author, their tastes, passions, vices, is, to Barthes, to allow language to speak, rather than author.\n\nMichel Foucault argues in his essay \"What is an author?\" (1969) that all authors are [[writer]]s, but not all writers are authors.

Foucault warns of the risks of keeping the author's name in mind during interpretation, because it could affect the value and meaning with which one handles an interpretation.\n\nLiterary critics Barthes and Foucault suggest that readers should not rely on or look for the notion of one overarching voice when interpreting a written work, because of the complications inherent with a writer's title of \"author\". They warn of the dangers interpretations could suffer from when associating the subject of inherently meaningful words and language with the personality of one authorial voice.

Publishers, at times, reduced the risk of this type of arrangement, by agreeing only to pay this after a certain number of copies had sold. In Canada, this practice occurred during the 1890s, but was not commonplace until the 1920s. Established and successful authors may receive advance payments, set against future royalties, but this is no longer common practice. Most independent publishers pay royalties as a percentage of net receipts \u2013 how net receipts are calculated varies from publisher to publisher. Under this arrangement, the author does not pay anything towards the expense of publication. The costs and financial risk are all carried by the publisher, who will then take the greatest percentage of the receipts. See Compensation for more.\n\n===Vanity publishing===\nThis type of publisher normally charges a flat fee for arranging publication, offers a platform for selling, and then takes a percentage of the sale of every copy of a book. The author receives the rest of the money made.\n\n==Relationship with editor==\n[[File:Ezra Pound 2.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph of Ezra H. Pound|[[Ezra Pound]] (pictured as a young man in 1913) made significant editing suggestions to [[T.S. Eliot]]'s \"[[The Waste Land]],\" helping transform the original drafts into the work known today.]]\nThe relationship between the author and the [[Book editor|editor]], often the author's only liaison to the publishing company, is often characterized as the site of tension. For the author to reach their audience, often through publication, the work usually must attract the attention of the editor. The idea of the author as the sole meaning-maker of necessity changes to include the influences of the editor and the publisher in order to engage the audience in writing as a social act. There are three principal areas covered by editors \u2013 Proofing (checking the Grammar and spelling, looking for typing errors), Story (potentially an area of deep angst for both author and publisher), and Layout (the setting of the final proof ready for publishing often requires minor text changes so a layout editor is required to ensure that these do not alter the sense of the text).\n\n[[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s essay \"The Field of Cultural Production\" depicts the publishing industry as a \"space of literary or artistic position-takings\", also called the \"field of struggles\", which is defined by the tension and movement inherent among the various positions in the field.<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. \"The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.\" The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 30.</ref> Bourdieu claims that the \"field of position-takings [...] is not the product of coherence-seeking intention or objective consensus\", meaning that an industry characterized by position-takings is not one of harmony and neutrality.<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. \"The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.\" The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 34</ref> In particular for the writer, their authorship in their work makes their work part of their identity, and there is much at stake personally over the negotiation of authority over that identity. However, it is the editor who has \"the power to impose the dominant definition of the writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take part in the struggle to define the writer\".<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. \"The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.\" The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 42</ref> As \"cultural investors,\" publishers rely on the editor position to identify a good investment in \"cultural capital\" which may grow to yield economic capital across all positions.<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. \"The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.\" The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 68</ref>\n\nAccording to the studies of James Curran, the system of shared values among editors in Britain has generated a pressure among authors to write to fit the editors' expectations, removing the focus from the reader-audience and putting a strain on the relationship between authors and editors and on writing as a social act. Even the book review by the editors has more significance than the readership's reception.<ref>Curran, James. \"Literary Editors, Social Networks and Cultural Tradition.\" Media Organizations in Society. James Curran, ed. London: Arnold, 2000, 230</ref>\n\n== Compensation ==\nA standard contract for an author will usually include provision for payment in the form of an advance and royalties. An advance is a lump sum paid in advance of publication. An advance must be earned out before royalties are payable. An advance may be paid in two lump sums: the first payment on contract signing, and the second on delivery of the completed manuscript or on publication.\n\nAn author's contract may specify, for example, that they will earn 10% of the retail price of each book sold. Some contracts specify a scale of royalties payable (for example, where royalties start at 10% for the first 10,000 sales, but then increase to a higher percentage rate at higher sale thresholds).\n\nAn author's book must earn the advance before any further royalties are paid. For example, if an author is paid a modest advance of $2000, and their royalty rate is 10% of a book priced at $20 \u2013 that is, $2 per book \u2013 the book will need to sell 1000 copies before any further payment will be made. Publishers typically withhold payment of a percentage of royalties earned against returns.\n\nIn some countries, authors also earn income from a government scheme such as the ELR (educational lending right) and PLR (public lending right) schemes in Australia. Under these schemes, authors are paid a fee for the number of copies of their books in educational and/or public libraries.\n\nThese days, many authors supplement their income from book sales with public speaking engagements, school visits, residencies, grants, and teaching positions.\n\n[[Ghostwriter]]s, technical writers, and textbooks writers are typically paid in a different way: usually a set fee or a per word rate rather than on a percentage of sales.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Academic authorship]]\n*[[Auteur]]\n*[[Author editing|Authors' editor]]\n*[[Distributive writing]]\n*[[Lead author]]\n*[[List of novelists]]\n*[[Lists of poets]]\n*[[Lists of writers]]\n*[[Novelist]]\n*[[Professional writing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Book Publishing Process}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Writing occupations]]\n[[Category:Literary criticism]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Creator of an original work}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2017}}\n\nAn '''author''' is the creator or originator of any written work such as a [[book]] or play, and is also considered a [[writer]].

If more than one person created the work, then a case of [[joint authorship]] can be made provided some criteria are met. In the [[copyright law]]s of various jurisdictions, there is a necessity for little flexibility regarding what constitutes authorship. The [[United States Copyright Office]], for example, defines copyright as \"a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to authors of \"original works of authorship\".<ref>{{Citation\n |title=Copyright Office Basics \n |publisher=[[U.S. Copyright Office]] \n |url=http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html \n |date=July 2006 \n |accessdate=30 March 2007\n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328100026/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html \n |archivedate=28 March 2008 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> \n\nHolding the title of \"author\" over any \"literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, [or] certain other intellectual works\" gives rights to this person, the owner of the copyright, especially the exclusive right to engage in or authorize any production or distribution of their work. Any person or entity wishing to use [[intellectual property]] held under copyright must receive permission from the copyright holder to use this work, and often will be asked to pay for the use of copyrighted material. After a fixed amount of time, the copyright expires on intellectual work and it enters the public domain, where it can be used without limit. Copyright laws in many jurisdictions \u2013 mostly following the lead of the United States, in which the entertainment and publishing industries have very strong [[lobbying]] power \u2013 have been amended repeatedly since their inception, to extend the length of this fixed period where the work is exclusively controlled by the copyright holder. However, copyright is merely the legal reassurance that one owns his/her work. Technically, someone owns their work from the time it's created. A notable aspect of authorship emerges with copyright in that, in many jurisdictions, it can be passed down to another upon one's death. The person who inherits the copyright is not the author, but enjoys the same legal benefits.\n\nQuestions arise as to the application of copyright law. How does it, for example, apply to the complex issue of [[fan fiction]]?  If the media agency responsible for the authorized production allows material from fans, what is the limit before legal constraints from actors, music, and other considerations, come into play? Additionally, how does copyright apply to fan-generated stories for books? What powers do the original authors, as well as the publishers, have in regulating or even stopping the fan fiction?  This particular sort of case also illustrates how complex intellectual property law can be, since such fiction may also involved [[trademark law]] (e.g. for names of characters in media franchises), [[likeness rights]] (such as for actors, or even entirely fictional entities), [[fair use]] rights held by the public (including the right to parody or satirize), and many other interacting complications.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nAuthors may portion out different rights they hold to different parties, at different times, and for different purposes or uses, such as the right to adapt a plot into a film, but only with different character names, because the characters have already been optioned by another company for a television series or a video game.  An author may also not have rights when working under contract that they would otherwise have, such as when creating a [[work for hire]] (e.g., hired to write a city tour guide by a municipal government that totally owns the copyright to the finished work), or when writing material using intellectual property owned by others (such as when writing a novel or screenplay that is a new installment in an already established media franchise).\n\n==Philosophical views of the nature of authorship==\n[[File:Mark Twain, Brady-Handy photo portrait, Feb 7, 1871, cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Mark Twain]] was a prominent American author in multiple genres including fiction and journalism during the 19th century.]]\nIn literary theory, critics find complications in the term ''author'' beyond what constitutes authorship in a legal setting.

For self-published books, this is often a more economical option than conducting a print run of hundreds or thousands of books. Many companies, such as Createspace (owned by Amazon.com), [[Outskirts Press]], Blurb, Lulu, [[Llumina Press]], ReadersMagnet, and iUniverse, allow printing single books at per-book costs not much higher than those paid by publishing companies for large print runs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rich|first=Motoko|title=Math of Publishing Meets the E-Book|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/business/media/01ebooks.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=9 May 2013|date=28 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenthal|first=Morris|title=Print on Demand Publishing|url=http://www.fonerbooks.com/pod.htm|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional publishing===\nWith commissioned publishing, the publisher makes all the publication arrangements and the author covers all expenses.\n\nThe more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher {{according to whom|date=August 2016}}, versus a [[self-publishing]] author or an unpublished one.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe author of a work may receive a percentage calculated on a wholesale or a specific price or a fixed amount on each book sold. Publishers, at times, reduced the risk of this type of arrangement, by agreeing only to pay this after a certain number of copies had sold. In Canada, this practice occurred during the 1890s, but was not commonplace until the 1920s. Established and successful authors may receive advance payments, set against future royalties, but this is no longer common practice. Most independent publishers pay royalties as a percentage of net receipts \u2013 how net receipts are calculated varies from publisher to publisher. Under this arrangement, the author does not pay anything towards the expense of publication. The costs and financial risk are all carried by the publisher, who will then take the greatest percentage of the receipts. See Compensation for more.\n\n===Vanity publishing===\nThis type of publisher normally charges a flat fee for arranging publication, offers a platform for selling, and then takes a percentage of the sale of every copy of a book. The author receives the rest of the money made.\n\n==Relationship with editor==\n[[File:Ezra Pound 2.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph of Ezra H. Pound|[[Ezra Pound]] (pictured as a young man in 1913) made significant editing suggestions to [[T.S. Eliot]]'s \"[[The Waste Land]],\" helping transform the original drafts into the work known today.]]\nThe relationship between the author and the [[Book editor|editor]], often the author's only liaison to the publishing company, is often characterized as the site of tension. For the author to reach their audience, often through publication, the work usually must attract the attention of the editor. The idea of the author as the sole meaning-maker of necessity changes to include the influences of the editor and the publisher in order to engage the audience in writing as a social act. There are three principal areas covered by editors \u2013 Proofing (checking the Grammar and spelling, looking for typing errors), Story (potentially an area of deep angst for both author and publisher), and Layout (the setting of the final proof ready for publishing often requires minor text changes so a layout editor is required to ensure that these do not alter the sense of the text).\n\n[[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s essay \"The Field of Cultural Production\" depicts the publishing industry as a \"space of literary or artistic position-takings\", also called the \"field of struggles\", which is defined by the tension and movement inherent among the various positions in the field.<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. \"The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.\" The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 30.</ref> Bourdieu claims that the \"field of position-takings [...] is not the product of coherence-seeking intention or objective consensus\", meaning that an industry characterized by position-takings is not one of harmony and neutrality.<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. \"The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.\" The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 34</ref> In particular for the writer, their authorship in their work makes their work part of their identity, and there is much at stake personally over the negotiation of authority over that identity. However, it is the editor who has \"the power to impose the dominant definition of the writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take part in the struggle to define the writer\".<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. \"The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.\" The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 42</ref> As \"cultural investors,\" publishers rely on the editor position to identify a good investment in \"cultural capital\" which may grow to yield economic capital across all positions.<ref>Bourdieu, Pierre. \"The Field of Cultural Production, or: The Economic World Reversed.\" The Field of Cultural Production: Essays on Art and Literature. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993, 68</ref>\n\nAccording to the studies of James Curran, the system of shared values among editors in Britain has generated a pressure among authors to write to fit the editors' expectations, removing the focus from the reader-audience and putting a strain on the relationship between authors and editors and on writing as a social act. Even the book review by the editors has more significance than the readership's reception.<ref>Curran, James. \"Literary Editors, Social Networks and Cultural Tradition.\" Media Organizations in Society. James Curran, ed. London: Arnold, 2000, 230</ref>\n\n== Compensation ==\nA standard contract for an author will usually include provision for payment in the form of an advance and royalties. An advance is a lump sum paid in advance of publication. An advance must be earned out before royalties are payable. An advance may be paid in two lump sums: the first payment on contract signing, and the second on delivery of the completed manuscript or on publication.\n\nAn author's contract may specify, for example, that they will earn 10% of the retail price of each book sold. Some contracts specify a scale of royalties payable (for example, where royalties start at 10% for the first 10,000 sales, but then increase to a higher percentage rate at higher sale thresholds).\n\nAn author's book must earn the advance before any further royalties are paid. For example, if an author is paid a modest advance of $2000, and their royalty rate is 10% of a book priced at $20 \u2013 that is, $2 per book \u2013 the book will need to sell 1000 copies before any further payment will be made. Publishers typically withhold payment of a percentage of royalties earned against returns.\n\nIn some countries, authors also earn income from a government scheme such as the ELR (educational lending right) and PLR (public lending right) schemes in Australia. Under these schemes, authors are paid a fee for the number of copies of their books in educational and/or public libraries.\n\nThese days, many authors supplement their income from book sales with public speaking engagements, school visits, residencies, grants, and teaching positions.\n\n[[Ghostwriter]]s, technical writers, and textbooks writers are typically paid in a different way: usually a set fee or a per word rate rather than on a percentage of sales.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Academic authorship]]\n*[[Auteur]]\n*[[Author editing|Authors' editor]]\n*[[Distributive writing]]\n*[[Lead author]]\n*[[List of novelists]]\n*[[Lists of poets]]\n*[[Lists of writers]]\n*[[Novelist]]\n*[[Professional writing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Book Publishing Process}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Writing occupations]]\n[[Category:Literary criticism]]\n", "name_user": "131.242.7.14", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eLegal significance of authorship)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author"}

Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them, yet she is ready to accept the challenge of friendship at the High School (\"It Roars\"). Cady is excited by the prospect of making new friends, but no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars (Reprise)\"). Janis and Damian decide to help Cady as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"). Janis and Damian describe the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics.\" The trio is led by Regina George, the \"Queen Bee\"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week. (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells her new friends Damian and Janis about the invite, Janis asks Cady to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis won't let him.\n\nIn AP Calculus class, Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks Cady to join Mathletes. Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina is mean to Kevin to get him to go away. Cady thinks Regina is nice for 'protecting' her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. However, amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, Cady doesn't pay attention to Janis' words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she's met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron Samuels, Gretchen is horrified because Aaron is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to Cady, as Regina's friend. The Plastics and Cady then hang out at Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\". Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that Janis and Regina used to be best friends. Regina tells Cady that Janis freaked out when Regina couldn't invite her to her thirteenth birthday party, and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day Aaron discusses his previous relationship with Regina, and how she made him feel like not-himself, telling Cady he has sworn off dating. After an awkwardly concealed verbal slip-up results in him explaining a math problem to her, Cady believes that if she acts stupid, Aaron will help her with her work, and therefore talk to her more (\"Stupid with Love (Reprise)\"). After using this tactic, Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Karen explains that in high school, Halloween revolves around looking sexy: the costume must be hot (\"Sexy\"). Cady doesn't know this and shows up at the party in a 'scary' costume, embarrassing herself. Later at the party, Gretchen, in order to gain Regina's approval, tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Spitefully, Regina decides to flirt with Aaron until he agrees to get back together with her (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells her friends what happened. Damian tells Cady the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends- in 8th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian and when Janis was unable to deny it, classmates bullied Janis until she left school. The three friends decide that they will work together to get revenge on Regina, giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars so that she will gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show is disastrous, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when Regina breaks one of the Plastics' artificial clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her from the lunch table, but Regina insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\").\n\n===Act Two===\n\nAfter winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting of her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen. (\"A Cautionary Tale (Reprise)\"). Cady tells Janis she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents and Damian and Janis dislike her new, Plastic-like behavior. Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and to stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a 'small' party while her parents are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina, and her friendship with the new Queen Bee Cady, while Regina's mother wonders why her daughter won't confide in her. She reminisces about the old days when Regina was a child while Gretchen is contemplating being friends with Cady. (\"What's Wrong With Me? (Reprise)\").\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. She becomes intoxicated as the party goes on and gets crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom. Cady tells Aaron the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron explains that he really liked who Cady was before she became a Plastic (\"More is Better\"). Aaron leaves, angry at Cady's transformation, and Cady chases after him. Outside, Cady runs into Janis and Damian, who came to confront Cady after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior. Janis throws the picture that she submitted to her art show at Cady, revealing the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)\").\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars given to her by Cady are what made her gain weight, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book, after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to the book in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen and Cady. (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fist fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about Damian. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina is distracted and is hit by a passing school bus.\n\nRegina's bus accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. Cady decides to take the full blame for the Burn Book, despite having not written the entire thing herself, because Ms. Norbury is about to be fired due to the things Cady wrote. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless (Reprise)\"). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn some extra credit and save her grade: Cady must join the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into Spring Fling with Aaron's help, after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation and make up.\n\nCady is elected as Spring Fling Queen but notices how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, breaking it into many pieces, and gives a piece to each girl at Spring Fling while complimenting each one - telling them they are all \"real, and rare\". She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").\nPretty good musical tbh!\u2764\ufe0f\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Original cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Every one of the principals gets a musical moment that tells us who they are, both the protective outer shell developed to survive the savage jungle of high school, and the tender human core, yearning to connect... While the show's book outshines the score, the songs pack in their share of wit, both in Benjamin's nimble lyrics (recalling her work on the Legally Blonde musical) and Richmond's buoyant tunes, which borrow with a wink from a variety of styles.\"<ref>Rooney, David.

They're the next-door versions of those cosmetically perfect pop and movie stars whose public vanities and follies we savor with such glee. Ms. Fey is an ace student of this universal prurience.

Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them, yet she is ready to accept the challenge of friendship at the High School (\"It Roars\"). Cady is excited by the prospect of making new friends, but no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars (Reprise)\"). Janis and Damian decide to help Cady as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"). Janis and Damian describe the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics.\" The trio is led by Regina George, the \"Queen Bee\"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week. (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells her new friends Damian and Janis about the invite, Janis asks Cady to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis won't let him.\n\nIn AP Calculus class, Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks Cady to join Mathletes. Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina is mean to Kevin to get him to go away. Cady thinks Regina is nice for 'protecting' her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. However, amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, Cady doesn't pay attention to Janis' words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she's met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron Samuels, Gretchen is horrified because Aaron is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to Cady, as Regina's friend. The Plastics and Cady then hang out at Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\". Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that Janis and Regina used to be best friends. Regina tells Cady that Janis freaked out when Regina couldn't invite her to her thirteenth birthday party, and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day Aaron discusses his previous relationship with Regina, and how she made him feel like not-himself, telling Cady he has sworn off dating. After an awkwardly concealed verbal slip-up results in him explaining a math problem to her, Cady believes that if she acts stupid, Aaron will help her with her work, and therefore talk to her more (\"Stupid with Love (Reprise)\"). After using this tactic, Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Karen explains that in high school, Halloween revolves around looking sexy: the costume must be hot (\"Sexy\"). Cady doesn't know this and shows up at the party in a 'scary' costume, embarrassing herself. Later at the party, Gretchen, in order to gain Regina's approval, tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Spitefully, Regina decides to flirt with Aaron until he agrees to get back together with her (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells her friends what happened. Damian tells Cady the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends- in 8th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian and when Janis was unable to deny it, classmates bullied Janis until she left school. The three friends decide that they will work together to get revenge on Regina, giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars so that she will gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show is disastrous, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when Regina breaks one of the Plastics' artificial clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her from the lunch table, but Regina insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\").\n\n===Act Two===\n\nAfter winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting of her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen. (\"A Cautionary Tale (Reprise)\"). Cady tells Janis she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents and Damian and Janis dislike her new, Plastic-like behavior. Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and to stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a 'small' party while her parents are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina, and her friendship with the new Queen Bee Cady, while Regina's mother wonders why her daughter won't confide in her. She reminisces about the old days when Regina was a child while Gretchen is contemplating being friends with Cady. (\"What's Wrong With Me? (Reprise)\").\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. She becomes intoxicated as the party goes on and gets crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom. Cady tells Aaron the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron explains that he really liked who Cady was before she became a Plastic (\"More is Better\"). Aaron leaves, angry at Cady's transformation, and Cady chases after him. Outside, Cady runs into Janis and Damian, who came to confront Cady after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior. Janis throws the picture that she submitted to her art show at Cady, revealing the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)\").\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars given to her by Cady are what made her gain weight, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book, after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to the book in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen and Cady. (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fist fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about Damian. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina is distracted and is hit by a passing school bus.\n\nRegina's bus accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. Cady decides to take the full blame for the Burn Book, despite having not written the entire thing herself, because Ms. Norbury is about to be fired due to the things Cady wrote. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless (Reprise)\"). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn some extra credit and save her grade: Cady must join the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into Spring Fling with Aaron's help, after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation and make up.\n\nCady is elected as Spring Fling Queen but notices how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, breaking it into many pieces, and gives a piece to each girl at Spring Fling while complimenting each one - telling them they are all \"real, and rare\". She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Original cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Fans of the original movie should be reassured that nothing important has been purged from the story.\"<ref>Stasio, Marilyn.

Every one of the principals gets a musical moment that tells us who they are, both the protective outer shell developed to survive the savage jungle of high school, and the tender human core, yearning to connect... While the show's book outshines the score, the songs pack in their share of wit, both in Benjamin's nimble lyrics (recalling her work on the Legally Blonde musical) and Richmond's buoyant tunes, which borrow with a wink from a variety of styles.\"<ref>Rooney, David.

They're the next-door versions of those cosmetically perfect pop and movie stars whose public vanities and follies we savor with such glee. Ms. Fey is an ace student of this universal prurience.
