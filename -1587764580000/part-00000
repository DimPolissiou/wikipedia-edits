She was noted for her performances in films including ''[[Uphaar]]'' (1971), ''[[Koshish]]'' (1972) and ''[[Kora Kagaz]]'' (1974), among others. She appeared alongside her husband Amitabh Bachchan in films such as ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'' (1973), ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'' (1975), ''[[Mili (1975 film)|Mili]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975).\n\nFollowing her marriage to actor [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and the birth of their children, Bachchan restricted her work in films. After her appearance in the ''[[Silsila (1981 film)|Silsila]]'' (1981), she took an indefinite sabbatical from films. She returned to acting with [[Govind Nihalani]]'s ''[[Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa]]'' in 1998.

Though she tried to break out of the mould with glamorous roles as in ''[[Jawani Diwani]]'', (1972)<ref name=\"Gulzar, p. 457\"/> and a negative character of the heroine faking amnesia, in ''[[Anamika (1973 film)|Anamika]]'' (1973), she was mostly recognised for roles of the sort which were credited with epitomising middle-class sensibility, which she played amiably in films of \"middle-cinema\" directors such as [[Gulzar]], [[Basu Chatterjee]] and indeed [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]].<ref>[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 91]]</ref> These films include ''[[Uphaar]]'' (1971), ''[[Piya Ka Ghar]]'' (1972), ''[[Parichay (film)|Parichay]]'' (1972), ''[[Koshish]]'' (1972)  and ''[[Bawarchi]]'' (1972), performed with marked sensitivity.<ref name=\"ba\" /><ref>[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 396]]</ref> By now, she was a popular star.<ref name=\"da\" />\n\nIn Gulzar's ''[[Koshish]]'' (1973), Bhaduri and [[Sanjeev Kumar]] played a deaf couple who struggle through their difficulties as handicapped people.

She was noted for her performances in films including ''[[Uphaar]]'' (1971), ''[[Koshish]]'' (1972) and ''[[Kora Kagaz]]'' (1974), among others. She appeared alongside her husband Amitabh Bachchan in films such as ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'' (1973), ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'' (1975), ''[[Mili (1975 film)|Mili]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975).\n\nFollowing her marriage to actor [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and the birth of their children, Bachchan restricted her work in films. After her appearance in the ''[[Silsila (1981 film)|Silsila]]'' (1981), she took an indefinite sabbatical from films.

The battalion demonstrated its bridging capabilities when the Santa Margarita River flooded in 1957.  An unprecedented, 339 feet of M-6 bridging were used to span the swollen river which, at that time, was the longest M-6 Bridge ever erected.  That same year, the battalion increased the size of the Fixed Bridge Platoon to a company and the Floating Bridge Platoon was redesignated to 1st Bridge Platoon together creating a new Bridge Company.\n\nIn 1962, Company B was embarked aboard ship in support of the Cuban Missile Crisis Response.\n\nOn 1 June 1965, Company A attached to Regimental Landing Team-7 and embarked ship headed for the Republic of Vietnam.

During the second half of 2001, Company B deployed to Egypt with Brigade Service Support Group (BSSG)-1 while participating in Exercise BRIGHT STAR-01 where they built and maintained a base camp for 3500 Marines.  After the attacks on September 11, 7 ESB attached engineers to MEU Service Support Group (MSSG)-15, 15th MEU, Task Force-58.  The Marines were among the first American forces to enter Afghanistan in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) as they helped establish Camp Rhino providing water purification, electricity, heavy equipment, security and EOD support.\n\nIn April 2002, Company A participated in DESERT SCIMITAR-02. Bridge platoon constructed a 457-foot continuous-span ribbon bridge over the rapidly flowing Colorado River.  The bridge crossed over nearly 1,700 Marines, and over 500 tactical vehicles.\n\nOn 28 January 2003, the battalion deployed to Camp Coyote, Kuwait in preparation for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF).  On 20 March, Company B and Company C, breached lanes through the Iraqi border obstacle belt providing entry for Task Force Tarawa and Regimental Combat Team (RCT)-7.  7th ESB supported the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) through all facets of engineering during the push to Baghdad before redeploying to Kuwait on 16 May 2003.\n\nThe battalion returned to Iraq in February 2004 with elements of Headquarters and Service (H&S) Company, Company A, Support Company, Bulk Fuel Company and EOD Company and assumed the role as Combat Service Support Battalion (CSSB)-1.  The bulk of the battalion operated out of Camp Fallujah supporting Regimental RCT-1 and other units in the Al Anbar Province.  CSSB-1 participated in Operation VIGILANT RESOLVE by establishing tactical control points (TCP's) around Fallujah, isolating the city in preparation for offensive operations of RCT-1.\n\nBy the end of September 2004, 7th ESB conducted a relief in place (RIP) with Company C replacing Company A, while H&S, Bulk Fuel and EOD Companies remained in Iraq, only rotating personnel from Camp Pendleton.  The battalion, minus a few detachments had redeployed back to Camp Pendleton by March 2005.\n\nContingents of 7th ESB companies formed Combat Logistics Battalion (CLB)-5 and deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in early 2006.  During the deployment, the battalion provided engineer support throughout the Al Anbar Province.  The battalion redeployed to Camp Pendleton in September 2006 while Company A conducted a RIP with Company C.

The unit falls under the command of [[1st Marine Logistics Group]] and the [[I Marine Expeditionary Force]].\n\n==Mission statement==\n\nProvide general engineering support of an expeditionary nature to the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), to include mobility, counter mobility and survivability enhancements, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), and general supply support to include the handling, storage and distribution of bulk water and fuel.<ref>http://www.1stmlg.marines.mil/Units/7ESB.aspx</ref>\n\n===Current units=== \n* Headquarters and Service Company\n* Alpha Company\n* Bravo Company \n* 1st Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company\n* Engineering Support Company\n* Bulk Fuel Company\n* Bridge Company\n\n==History==\nActivated on 29 September 1950, aboard Camp Pendleton, 7th Engineer Battalion was rapidly built up with equipment and troops for deployment to the [[Korean War]].  Activated companies included Headquarters, Support, A, B, EOD,Bulk Fuel, with a Fixed Bridge Platoon and Floating Bridge Platoon attached.  Deployment orders were never signed and deployment to Korea was not executed.\n\nWith all its new equipment, 7th Engineer Battalion became the training command for all engineers headed overseas to 1st Engineer Battalion in Korea.  From 1951\u20131954 the battalion also completed various engineering projects aboard Camp Pendleton and constructed cold weather training facilities in the San Jacinto and Sierra Mountains.\n\n7th Engineer Battalion was attached to the 1st Marine Division in October 1955.  In the same year, an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Platoon was attached to the battalion and was mainly used for clearing ranges.\nIn 1956, the battalion conducted a rigorous training cycle focusing on ambushes, construction and bridging.  The battalion demonstrated its bridging capabilities when the Santa Margarita River flooded in 1957.  An unprecedented, 339 feet of M-6 bridging were used to span the swollen river which, at that time, was the longest M-6 Bridge ever erected.  That same year, the battalion increased the size of the Fixed Bridge Platoon to a company and the Floating Bridge Platoon was redesignated to 1st Bridge Platoon together creating a new Bridge Company.\n\nIn 1962, Company B was embarked aboard ship in support of the Cuban Missile Crisis Response.\n\nOn 1 June 1965, Company A attached to Regimental Landing Team-7 and embarked ship headed for the Republic of Vietnam.  In August 1965, 7th Engineer Battalion was ordered to embark and depart for service in Vietnam, arriving in Da Nang on 24 August 1965.  From Da Nang, the battalion supported the III Marine Amphibious Force (MAF) throughout the I Corps Tactical Zone.\n\nDuring the following year the battalion constructed an M-4 aluminum pontoon bridge spanning 1,478 feet over the Da Nang River, the longest ever built.\n\nMany of the battalion's missions in 1967 included the construction of non-standard bridges, M-4 aluminum pontoon bridges, and pile bent bridges as well as the maintenance and upgrading of over 120&nbsp;km of roads.\nIn 1968, Company A constructed a coffer dam while Company D participated in Operation MAMELUKE THRUST. Service Company provided over 33 million gallons of fresh water to the Marines of III MAF.\n\nThroughout 1969 and 1970 the battalion continued upgrading and maintaining roads, mine sweeping and providing general engineer support until it returned to Camp Pendleton in September 1970.\n\nDuring April 1971, the battalion was reassigned to the 1st Marine Division and in June Company A detached from the battalion and was relocated to 29 Palms, California.\n\nIn March 1976, 7th Engineers was redesignated as 7th Engineer Support Battalion (7th ESB) and was reassigned to the newly formed 1st Force Service Support Group (1st FSSG).  1st Bulk Fuel Company was transferred from Supply Battalion at this time.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1979 the battalion participated in several exercises including VARSITY EAGLE, OPPORTUNE LIFT, and VARSITY CLEANEX on Camp Pendleton, Twentynine Palms, San Clemente Island, and Barstow, California.  Members of the battalion also participated in Operation KERNEL POTLATCH, a joint US-Canadian fleet landing exercise.\n\n7th Bulk Fuel Company was activated in April 1983 followed by the activation of Bridge Company in July of the same year bringing the battalion up to two bridge and two bulk fuel companies.\n\nFor the next two years Companies A, B, and C, conducted horizontal construction, building roads, earthwork for runways, and replacing AM-2 matting throughout all Marine Corps installations across the western United States.  Bulk Fuel Company trained on fire fighting and the Amphibious Assault Fuel System (AAFS).  Bridge Company continued increasing proficiency in constructing Medium Girder Bridges (MGB) and M4T6 rafts in the Del Mar Boat Basin.\n\nOn 20 December 1990, 7th ESB deployed in force to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation DESERT SHIELD and was transferred under operational control to Direct Support Command.  Operation DESERT STORM began on 23 February 1991 and 7th ESB participated in all aspects of the offensive operations.  The battalion returned home to Camp Pendleton by 24 April 1991.\n\n7th ESB deployed to Mogadishu, Somalia on 15 December 1992 in support of Operation RESTORE HOPE.  From 15 December 1992 to 25 January 1993, EOD Company assisted in over 300 calls for support recovering and disposing of over 350,000 pounds of ordnance and over two million rounds of ammunition.  Bulk Fuel Company employed and operated five AAFS and a Tactical Airfield Fuel Dispensing System (TAFDS) which serviced over 26 different nations during the operation.  The battalion's utilities section purified and provided over three million gallons of water to the multinational contingent.\n\nIn January 1993, while the battalion was deployed to Somalia, the Santa Margarita River flooded, which severely damaged Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Camp Pendleton.  The Marines of 7th ESB, purified drinking water, rebuilt eight miles of roads and rebuilt the levee that separates the MCAS and the Santa Margarita River.\n\n30 December 1994, Bridge Company was deactivated and its personnel and equipment redistributed throughout the battalion. In March 1995, Company A reactivated and constructed the Combat Skills Training Facility at Camp Deluz.\nDuring 1996, EOD techs provided range sweeps at multiple Marine Corps and Air Force installation across the southwestern U.S. Additionally, EOD also supported the U.S. Secret Service in Los Angeles and San Diego. February 1996, Company C deployed to the U.S. Army's National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California where it acted as a 'Soviet Engineer Battalion' as opposition force against U.S. Army units. During the fall of 1996, and per the Commandants Guidance, 7th ESB was tasked with constructing the obstacles courses, assault courses, and warrior stations for the Crucible, at Edson Range.\n\nCompany B deployed to Annette Island in Southeast Alaska in support of Operation ALASKAN ROAD in August 1997. During the three-month joint civil-military operation, Company B assisted with the construction of over 14.7 miles of paved roads, the improvement of 10 miles of unimproved roads, and the construction of a 300-man base camp.\n\nIn July 2000, Company C deployed to the Kingdom of Tonga constructing a music/library/administrative facility for the Tailulu College.  The Marines of Company C were the first Marine Corps Engineers to execute construction in the Kingdom of Tonga.\n\nDuring the first portion of 2001, 7th ESB deployed personnel in support of a US Department of State-sponsored Humanitarian Demining Training Program in Djibouti, Africa.  During the second half of 2001, Company B deployed to Egypt with Brigade Service Support Group (BSSG)-1 while participating in Exercise BRIGHT STAR-01 where they built and maintained a base camp for 3500 Marines.  After the attacks on September 11, 7 ESB attached engineers to MEU Service Support Group (MSSG)-15, 15th MEU, Task Force-58.  The Marines were among the first American forces to enter Afghanistan in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) as they helped establish Camp Rhino providing water purification, electricity, heavy equipment, security and EOD support.\n\nIn April 2002, Company A participated in DESERT SCIMITAR-02. Bridge platoon constructed a 457-foot continuous-span ribbon bridge over the rapidly flowing Colorado River.  The bridge crossed over nearly 1,700 Marines, and over 500 tactical vehicles.\n\nOn 28 January 2003, the battalion deployed to Camp Coyote, Kuwait in preparation for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF).  On 20 March, Company B and Company C, breached lanes through the Iraqi border obstacle belt providing entry for Task Force Tarawa and Regimental Combat Team (RCT)-7.  7th ESB supported the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) through all facets of engineering during the push to Baghdad before redeploying to Kuwait on 16 May 2003.\n\nThe battalion returned to Iraq in February 2004 with elements of Headquarters and Service (H&S) Company, Company A, Support Company, Bulk Fuel Company and EOD Company and assumed the role as Combat Service Support Battalion (CSSB)-1.  The bulk of the battalion operated out of Camp Fallujah supporting Regimental RCT-1 and other units in the Al Anbar Province.  CSSB-1 participated in Operation VIGILANT RESOLVE by establishing tactical control points (TCP's) around Fallujah, isolating the city in preparation for offensive operations of RCT-1.\n\nBy the end of September 2004, 7th ESB conducted a relief in place (RIP) with Company C replacing Company A, while H&S, Bulk Fuel and EOD Companies remained in Iraq, only rotating personnel from Camp Pendleton.  The battalion, minus a few detachments had redeployed back to Camp Pendleton by March 2005.\n\nContingents of 7th ESB companies formed Combat Logistics Battalion (CLB)-5 and deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in early 2006.  During the deployment, the battalion provided engineer support throughout the Al Anbar Province.  The battalion redeployed to Camp Pendleton in September 2006 while Company A conducted a RIP with Company C.  In October 2006, Company B was stood up and was assigned the bridging mission for the battalion.  Company A redeployed to Camp Pendleton in March 2007.\n\nIn August 2007, EOD Company and Company B deployed personnel to Iraq in support of OIF 6-8.2.\n\nThe battalion deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in February 2008 in support of OIF 6-8.1 and returned in September 2008.  Support Company and Company A attached Marines to CLB-7 to deploy in support of OIF 9.1.

In [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], she ran for [[President of the United States]]. While many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for President of the United States, some have questioned that priority given issues with the legality of her run. They disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because she was younger than the constitutionally mandated age of 35. (Woodhull's 35th birthday was in September 1873, seven months after the March inauguration). However, election coverage by contemporary newspapers does not suggest age was a significant issue; this may, however, be due to the fact that no one took the candidacy seriously.\n\nAn activist for women's rights and labor reforms, Woodhull was also an advocate of \"[[free love]]\", by which she meant the freedom to marry, divorce and bear children without social restriction or government interference.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/free-love-advocate-victoria-woodhull-excited-bloomington/article_2c2cb275-b36e-5a6a-bc6a-dd4821121900.html |title='Free love' advocate Victoria Woodhull excited Bloomington |newspaper= [[The Pantagraph]] |date= November 15, 2016 |accessdate= April 13, 2016 |last= Kemp |first= Bill}}</ref> \"They cannot roll back the rising tide of reform,\" she often said. \"The world moves.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Woman Who Ran for President \u2014 in 1872|url=https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/woodhull|website=The Attic|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nWoodhull twice went from [[rags to riches]], her first fortune being made on the road as a [[Magnet therapy|magnetic healer]]<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 46\">Johnson, 1956, p. 46</ref> before she joined the [[spiritualist]] movement in the 1870s.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 46-47\">Johnson, 1956, pp. 46\u201347</ref> Authorship of many of her articles is disputed (many of her speeches on these topics were collaborations between Woodhull, her backers, and her second husband, Colonel [[James Blood]]<ref>Johnson, 1956, p. 86, p. 87</ref>).

Women who married in the [[United States]] during the 19th century were bound into the unions, even if loveless, with few options to escape. [[Divorce]] was limited by law and considered socially scandalous. Women who divorced were stigmatized and often ostracized by society. Victoria Woodhull concluded that women should have the choice to leave unbearable marriages.<ref>Dubois and Dumenil, ''Through Women's Eyes: An American History with Documents''. (Bedford; St. Martin's, 2012)</ref>\n\nWoodhull believed in monogamous relationships, although she also said she had the right to change her mind. The choice to have sex or not was, in every case, the woman's choice, since this would place her in an equal status to the man, who had the capacity to rape and physically overcome a woman, whereas a woman did not have that capacity with respect to a man.<ref>[http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/IntercourseII.html Andrea Dworkin (1987).

In 1872, Woodhull publicly criticized well-known clergyman [[Henry Ward Beecher]] for adultery. Beecher was known to have had an affair with his parishioner Elizabeth Tilton, who had confessed to it, and the scandal was covered nationally. Woodhull was prosecuted on obscenity charges for sending accounts of the affair through the federal mails, and she was briefly jailed.

Its primary purpose was to support Victoria Claflin Woodhull for President of the United States. Published for the next six years, feminism was the ''Weekly'''s primary interest, but it became notorious for publishing controversial opinions on taboo topics, advocating among other things [[sex education]], [[free love]], women's suffrage, [[rational dress|short skirts]], [[spiritualism]], [[vegetarianism]], and licensed prostitution. History often states the paper advocated [[birth control]], but some historians disagree. The paper is now known for printing the first English version of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' in its edition of December 30, 1871, and the paper argued the cause of labor with eloquence and skill.

But a member of his church, [[Theodore Tilton]], disclosed to [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], a colleague of Woodhull, that his wife had confessed Beecher was committing [[adultery]] with her. Provoked by such hypocrisy, Woodhull decided to expose Beecher. He ended up standing trial in 1875, for adultery in a proceeding that proved to be one of the most sensational legal episodes of the era, gripping the attention of hundreds of thousands of Americans: the trial ended with a [[hung jury]], but the church won the case hands down.<ref name=\"Goldsmith, Other Powers\">Goldsmith, Other Powers</ref> On November 2, 1872, Woodhull, Claflin and Col.

She supported its goals by articles in her newspaper. In the United States, many Yankee radicals, former [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and other progressive activists, became involved in the organization, which had been founded in England. German-American and ethnic Irish nearly lost control of the organization, and feared its goals were going to be lost in the broad-based, democratic egalitarianism promoted by the Americans. In 1871, the Germans expelled most of the English-speaking members of the First International's U.S. sections, leading to the quick decline of the organization, as it failed to attract the ethnic working class in America.<ref name=\"Messer-Kruse p470\">{{cite book|title=The Yankee International: Marxism and the American Reform Tradition, 1848\u20131876 |first=Timothy |last=Messer-Kruse |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KL3eYgNEchoC |pages=2\u20134|isbn=978-0-8078-4705-3 }}</ref> Karl Marx commented disparagingly on Woodhull in 1872, and expressed approval of the expulsions.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Notes on the \"American split\" |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/09/splits.htm |quote= |publisher= |date= May 28, 1872 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nRecent scholarship has shown Woodhull to have been a far more significant presence in the socialist movement than previous historians had allowed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=Neil A. |title=Rebels and Renegades: A Chronology of Social and Political Dissent in the United States |date=2002 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=128}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Frisken |first1=Amanda |title=Victoria Woodhull's Sexual Revolution: Political Theater and the Popular Press in Nineteenth-Century America |date=2012 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |page=13}}</ref> Woodhull thought of herself as a revolutionary and her conception of social and political reorganization was, like Marx, based upon economics.

A year earlier, she had announced her intention to run. Also in 1871, she spoke publicly against the government being composed only of men; she proposed developing a new constitution and a new government a year thence.<ref>''A Lecture on Constitutional Equality'', also known as ''The Great Secession Speech'', speech to Woman's Suffrage Convention, New York, May 11, 1871, excerpt quoted in Gabriel, Mary, ''Notorious Victoria: The Life of Victoria Woodhull, Uncensored'' (Chapel Hill, N.Car.: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1st ed. 1998 ({{ISBN|1-56512-132-5}})), pp. 86\u201387 & n.

They nominated the former slave and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] leader [[Frederick Douglass]] for Vice President. He did not attend the convention and never acknowledged the nomination.  He served as a [[presidential elector]] in the [[United States Electoral College]] for the State of New York. This made her the first woman candidate.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n\nWoodhull's campaign was also notable for the nomination of [[Frederick Douglass]], although he did not take part in it. His nomination stirred up controversy about the mixing of [[whites]] and [[Black people|blacks]] in public life and fears of [[miscegenation]]. The Equal Rights Party hoped to use the nominations to reunite suffragists with African-American [[civil rights]] activists, as the exclusion of female suffrage from the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] two years earlier had caused a substantial rift between the groups.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nHaving been vilified in the media for her support of [[free love]], Woodhull devoted an issue of ''Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly'' (November 2, 1872) to an alleged adulterous affair between Elizabeth Tilton and Reverend [[Henry Ward Beecher]], a prominent Protestant minister in New York. He supported female suffrage but had lectured against free love in his sermons.  Woodhull published the article to highlight what she saw as a sexual double standard between men and women.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThat same day, a few days before the presidential election, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Federal Marshals]] arrested Woodhull; her second husband, [[Colonel James Blood]]; and her sister Tennie on charges of \"publishing an obscene newspaper\" because of the content of this issue.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arrest of Victoria Woodhull, Tennie C.

The arrest was arranged by [[Anthony Comstock]], the self-appointed moral defender of the nation at the time. Opponents raised questions about censorship and government persecution. The three were acquitted on a technicality six months later, but the arrest prevented Woodhull from attempting to vote during the 1872 presidential election. With the publication of the scandal, [[Theodore Tilton]], Elizabeth's husband, sued Beecher for \"alienation of affection.\" The later trial in 1875 was sensationalized across the nation and eventually resulted in a hung jury.<ref name=\"Goldsmith, Other Powers\" />\n\nWoodhull received no electoral votes in the election of 1872, an election in which six different candidates received at least one electoral vote, and an unknown (but negligible) percentage of the popular vote.

Newspapers reported that her 1892 attempt culminated in her nomination by the \"National Woman Suffragists' Nominating Convention\" on September 21. [[Marietta Stow|Marietta L. B. Stow]] of California was nominated as the candidate for vice president.  The convention was held at Willard's Hotel in [[Boonville (town), New York|Boonville, New York]], and [[Anna M. Parker]] was its president.  Some woman's suffrage organizations repudiated the nominations, however, claiming that the nominating committee was unauthorized. Woodhull was quoted as saying that she was \"destined\" by \"prophecy\" to be elected president of the United States in the upcoming election.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Life in England and third marriage ==\n\nIn October 1876, Woodhull divorced her second husband, Colonel Blood. After [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]'s death in 1877, [[William Henry Vanderbilt]] paid Woodhull and her sister Claflin $1,000 ({{Inflation|USD|1000|1877|fmt=eq|r=-3}}{{Inflation/fn|US}}) to leave the country because he was worried they might testify in hearings on the distribution of the elder Vanderbilt's estate.

After her husband died in 1901, Martin gave up publishing and retired to the country, establishing residence at [[Bredon|Bredon's Norton]], where she built a village school with Tennessee and Zula.

If there is any difference in the actual crime we should be glad to have those who practice the latter, point it out. The truth of the matter is that it is just as much a murder to destroy life in its embryotic condition, as it is to destroy it after the fully developed form is attained, for it is the self-same life that is taken.<ref>{{cite web|first=Victoria|last=Woodhull|title=When is it not murder to take a life?|url=http://www.iapsop.com/archive/materials/woodhull_and_claflins_weekly/woodhull_and_claflins_weekly_v1_n21_oct_8_1870.pdf|page=11|accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWoodhull also promoted [[eugenics]], which was popular in the early 20th century prior to World War II. It tied into her views on abortion, as she blamed abortion for assorted problems with pregnancies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 23, 1871|title=My Word on Abortion and Other Things|url=|journal=Woodhull and Claflins Weekly|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>  Her interest in eugenics might have been motivated by the profound intellectual impairment of her son.  She advocated, among other things, sex education, \"marrying well,\" and pre-natal care as a way to bear healthier children and to prevent mental and physical disease.  Her writings demonstrate views closer to those of the anarchist eugenists, rather than the coercive eugenists like [[Francis Galton|Sir Francis Galton]].  In 2006, publisher Michael W. Perry discovered, and published in his book \"Lady Eugenist\", that Woodhull supported the forcible sterilization of those she considered unfit to breed.  He cited a ''New York Times'' article from 1927 in which she concurred with the ruling of the case ''[[Buck v. Bell]]''. This was a stark contrast to her earlier works in which she advocated social freedom and opposed government interference in matters of love and marriage.{{cn|date=June 2019|<--- unsourced paragraph --->}}\n\nWoodhull-Martin died on June 9, 1927 at Norton Park in Bredon's Norton, Worcestershire.<ref>{{cite news |title=Victoria Martin, Suffragist, Dies.

In [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], she ran for [[President of the United States]]. While many historians and authors agree that Woodhull was the first woman to run for President of the United States, some have questioned that priority given issues with the legality of her run. They disagree with classifying it as a true candidacy because she was younger than the constitutionally mandated age of 35. (Woodhull's 35th birthday was in September 1873, seven months after the March inauguration). However, election coverage by contemporary newspapers does not suggest age was a significant issue; this may, however, be due to the fact that no one took the candidacy seriously.\n\nAn activist for women's rights and labor reforms, Woodhull was also an advocate of \"[[free love]]\", by which she meant the freedom to marry, divorce and bear children without social restriction or government interference.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/free-love-advocate-victoria-woodhull-excited-bloomington/article_2c2cb275-b36e-5a6a-bc6a-dd4821121900.html |title='Free love' advocate Victoria Woodhull excited Bloomington |newspaper= [[The Pantagraph]] |date= November 15, 2016 |accessdate= April 13, 2016 |last= Kemp |first= Bill}}</ref> \"They cannot roll back the rising tide of reform,\" she often said. \"The world moves.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Woman Who Ran for President \u2014 in 1872|url=https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/woodhull|website=The Attic|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nWoodhull twice went from [[rags to riches]], her first fortune being made on the road as a [[Magnet therapy|magnetic healer]]<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 46\">Johnson, 1956, p. 46</ref> before she joined the [[spiritualist]] movement in the 1870s.<ref name=\"Johnson, 1956, p. 46-47\">Johnson, 1956, pp. 46\u201347</ref> Authorship of many of her articles is disputed (many of her speeches on these topics were collaborations between Woodhull, her backers, and her second husband, Colonel [[James Blood]]<ref>Johnson, 1956, p. 86, p. 87</ref>).

He had served in the [[Union Army]] in [[Missouri]] during the [[American Civil War]], and had been elected as city auditor of [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]].\n\n=== Free love ===\nWoodhull's support of [[free love]] likely started after she discovered the infidelity of her first husband, Canning. Women who married in the [[United States]] during the 19th century were bound into the unions, even if loveless, with few options to escape. [[Divorce]] was limited by law and considered socially scandalous. Women who divorced were stigmatized and often ostracized by society. Victoria Woodhull concluded that women should have the choice to leave unbearable marriages.<ref>Dubois and Dumenil, ''Through Women's Eyes: An American History with Documents''. (Bedford; St. Martin's, 2012)</ref>\n\nWoodhull believed in monogamous relationships, although she also said she had the right to change her mind. The choice to have sex or not was, in every case, the woman's choice, since this would place her in an equal status to the man, who had the capacity to rape and physically overcome a woman, whereas a woman did not have that capacity with respect to a man.<ref>[http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/IntercourseII.html Andrea Dworkin (1987).

In 1872, Woodhull publicly criticized well-known clergyman [[Henry Ward Beecher]] for adultery. Beecher was known to have had an affair with his parishioner Elizabeth Tilton, who had confessed to it, and the scandal was covered nationally. Woodhull was prosecuted on obscenity charges for sending accounts of the affair through the federal mails, and she was briefly jailed.

Its primary purpose was to support Victoria Claflin Woodhull for President of the United States. Published for the next six years, feminism was the ''Weekly'''s primary interest, but it became notorious for publishing controversial opinions on taboo topics, advocating among other things [[sex education]], [[free love]], women's suffrage, [[rational dress|short skirts]], [[spiritualism]], [[vegetarianism]], and licensed prostitution. History often states the paper advocated [[birth control]], but some historians disagree. The paper is now known for printing the first English version of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' in its edition of December 30, 1871, and the paper argued the cause of labor with eloquence and skill.

But a member of his church, [[Theodore Tilton]], disclosed to [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], a colleague of Woodhull, that his wife had confessed Beecher was committing [[adultery]] with her. Provoked by such hypocrisy, Woodhull decided to expose Beecher. He ended up standing trial in 1875, for adultery in a proceeding that proved to be one of the most sensational legal episodes of the era, gripping the attention of hundreds of thousands of Americans: the trial ended with a [[hung jury]], but the church won the case hands down.<ref name=\"Goldsmith, Other Powers\">Goldsmith, Other Powers</ref> On November 2, 1872, Woodhull, Claflin and Col.

She supported its goals by articles in her newspaper. In the United States, many Yankee radicals, former [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and other progressive activists, became involved in the organization, which had been founded in England. German-American and ethnic Irish nearly lost control of the organization, and feared its goals were going to be lost in the broad-based, democratic egalitarianism promoted by the Americans. In 1871, the Germans expelled most of the English-speaking members of the First International's U.S. sections, leading to the quick decline of the organization, as it failed to attract the ethnic working class in America.<ref name=\"Messer-Kruse p470\">{{cite book|title=The Yankee International: Marxism and the American Reform Tradition, 1848\u20131876 |first=Timothy |last=Messer-Kruse |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KL3eYgNEchoC |pages=2\u20134|isbn=978-0-8078-4705-3 }}</ref> Karl Marx commented disparagingly on Woodhull in 1872, and expressed approval of the expulsions.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Notes on the \"American split\" |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/09/splits.htm |quote= |publisher= |date= May 28, 1872 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nRecent scholarship has shown Woodhull to have been a far more significant presence in the socialist movement than previous historians had allowed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hamilton |first1=Neil A. |title=Rebels and Renegades: A Chronology of Social and Political Dissent in the United States |date=2002 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=128}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Frisken |first1=Amanda |title=Victoria Woodhull's Sexual Revolution: Political Theater and the Popular Press in Nineteenth-Century America |date=2012 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |page=13}}</ref> Woodhull thought of herself as a revolutionary and her conception of social and political reorganization was, like Marx, based upon economics.
