Headquartered in Vermont, GNHUSA is a 501c(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization with a mission to increase personal happiness and the collective wellbeing by changing how the United States measure their progress and success. GNHUSA was founded after Linda Wheatley of Montpelier, Vermont, attended the 2008 Annual Gross National Happiness Research Conference in Thimphu, Bhutan. Wheatley returned to Vermont determined to introduce the little-known GNH concepts to the general public in the U.S. After establishing the nonprofit in the spring of 2009, representatives of the group attended the fifth international GNH research conference in Brazil in November 2009 and, in June 2010, hosted the first US-based conference on Gross National Happiness and other alternative indicators, at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont. In May 2012, GNHUSA with co-sponsors organized Measure What Matters, a conference building a collaborative of data experts in Vermont. The state of Vermont's Governor declared April 13 (President Jefferson\u2019s birthday) \u201cPursuit of Happiness Day,\u201d and became the first state to pass legislation enabling development of alternative indicators and to assist in making policy. GNHUSA collaborates with the Vermont Data Center to perform a [http://gnhusa.org/alternative-indicators/measuring-well-vermont-leads-way/ periodic study of well-being in the state], as a pilot for other states and municipalities. The organization also collaborates closely with the Happiness Alliance in collecting online GNH data, based on the domain of happiness developed by Bhutan.  In 2017, GNHUSA initiated the process of establishing chapters in all 50 states to work with local governments and institutions on well-being initiatives, beginning with Wisconsin and North Carolina. \nThe organization also promotes the U.N.-designated International Happiness Day (March 20) as an opportunity to discuss the concepts of well-being with others at [http://gnhusa.org/happiness-dinners/ Happiness Dinners] across the country.\n\nFrom August 25, 2012 to the present, GNHUSA has been carrying out a nationwide action research project, [http://gnhusa.org/serious-about-happiness/the-science-of-happiness-walking/ The Happiness Walk], carried out by GNHUSA board members and supporters.

Headquartered in Vermont, GNHUSA is a 501c(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization with a mission to increase personal happiness and the collective wellbeing by changing how the United States measure their progress and success. GNHUSA was founded after Linda Wheatley of Montpelier, Vermont, attended the 2008 Annual Gross National Happiness Research Conference in Thimphu, Bhutan. Wheatley returned to Vermont determined to introduce the little-known GNH concepts to the general public in the U.S. After establishing the nonprofit in the spring of 2009, representatives of the group attended the fifth international GNH research conference in Brazil in November 2009 and, in June 2010, hosted the first US-based conference on Gross National Happiness and other alternative indicators, at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont. In May 2012, GNHUSA with co-sponsors organized Measure What Matters, a conference building a collaborative of data experts in Vermont. The state of Vermont's Governor declared April 13 (President Jefferson\u2019s birthday) \u201cPursuit of Happiness Day,\u201d and became the first state to pass legislation enabling development of alternative indicators and to assist in making policy. GNHUSA collaborates with the Vermont Data Center to perform a [http://gnhusa.org/alternative-indicators/measuring-well-vermont-leads-way/ periodic study of well-being in the state], as a pilot for other states and municipalities. The organization also collaborates closely with the Happiness Alliance in collecting online GNH data, based on the domain of happiness developed by Bhutan.  In 2017, GNHUSA initiated the process of establishing chapters in all 50 states to work with local governments and institutions on well-being initiatives, beginning with Wisconsin and North Carolina. \nThe organization also promotes the U.N.-designated International Happiness Day (March 20) as an opportunity to discuss the concepts of well-being with others at [http://gnhusa.org/happiness-dinners/ Happiness Dinners] across the country.\n\nFrom August 25, 2012 to the present, GNHUSA has been carrying out a nationwide action research project, [http://gnhusa.org/serious-about-happiness/the-science-of-happiness-walking/ The Happiness Walk], carried out by GNHUSA board members and supporters. On the first leg, two GNHUSA board members walked 594 miles, from Vermont to Washington DC; the Walk most recently completed a leg from Santa Monica, CA to the Bay Area, with a side trip to Hawaii, and resumed March 1, 2018, walking from Petaluma CA to Seattle, Washington, on the 13th leg of the journey. Along the way, Walkers perform audio and video interviews and collect survey responses, introducing the concept of GNH and amassing data that will assist them in tailoring the GNH domains and indicators to American culture.\nGNHUSA also posts and promotes a [http://gnhusa.org/charter-for-happiness/ Charter for Happiness] which, as of May 7, 2018, has 469 signatories.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nGNH has been described by critics as a [[propaganda]] tool used by the Bhutanese government to distract from [[Ethnic cleansing in Bhutan|ethnic cleansing]] and [[human rights in Bhutan|human rights abuses]] it has committed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Thapa|first1=Saurav Jung|title=Bhutan's Hoax: of Gross National Happiness|work=Wave Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713000732/http://wavemag.com.np/issue/article3775.html|date=July 2011|archive-date=13 July 2011|url=http://wavemag.com.np/issue/article3775.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first1=Vishal|last1=Arora|title=Bhutan's Human Rights Record Defies 'Happiness' Claim|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/bhutans-human-rights-record-defies-happiness-claim/|date=25 April 2014|work=The Diplomat}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bhutanese democracy|Bhutanese democratic]] government started from 2008.

Later IS-2 converted models were replaced with the [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|122mm D-25T gun]] whilst retaining the same hull.]]\nThe [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] was criticized by its crews for its poor mobility and the lack of a larger caliber gun than the [[T-34]] medium tank. It was much more expensive than the T-34, without having greater combat performance. Moscow ordered some KV-1 assembly lines to shift to T-34 production, leading to fears that KV-1 production would be halted and the SKB-2 design bureau, led by Kotin, closed.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=4}} In 1942, this problem was partially addressed by the KV-1S tank, which had thinner armor than the original, making it lighter and faster. It was competitive with the T-34 but at the cost of no longer having the heavier armor. Production of the KV-1S was gradually replaced by the [[SU-152]]{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=44}} and ended in April 1943.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=42}}\n\nThe capture of a German [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tank in January 1943 led to a decision to develop a new heavy tank, which was given the codename Object 237.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=5}} Before Object 237 had time to mature, intense tank fighting in the summer of 1943 demanded a response. Dukhov's team was instructed to create a [[wikt:stopgap#Pronunciation|stopgap]] KV tank, the KV-85, which was armed with the [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|52-K]]-derivative gun of the [[SU-85]], the 85&nbsp;mm D-5T, that proved capable of penetrating the [[Tiger I]] from {{convert|1000|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The KV-85 was created by mounting an Object 237 turret on a KV-1S hull. To accommodate the Object 237 turret, the KV-1S hull was modified, increasing the diameter of the turret ring with fillets on the sides of the hull. The radio operator was replaced with an ammunition rack for the larger 85&nbsp;mm ammunition. The hull MG was then moved to the opposite side of the driver and fixed in place to be operated by the driver. From September to October 1943, a total of 130 KV-85s were produced, before the assembly lines began to shift over. Like the KV-1S, the KV-85 served in dwindling numbers and was quickly overshadowed by the superior IS series.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=45}}\n\nThe Object 237 prototype, a version of the cancelled [[KV-13]], was accepted for production as the '''IS-85''' heavy tank.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=6}} First deliveries were made in October 1943, and the tanks went immediately into service. Production ended in January 1944. Its designation was simplified to IS-1 after the introduction of the IS-122, later renamed as IS-2 for security purposes.\n\n===Object 240 IS-2===\n==== Gun ====\nBy 1943, engineers had succeeded in mounting the 85&nbsp;mm gun to the T-34 medium tank, making it as well-armed as the KV-85 heavy tank. Efforts to up-gun the IS-85 began in late 1943. Two candidate weapons were the D-25 122&nbsp;mm tank gun, the ballistic characteristics of which were identical to the [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|A-19 122&nbsp;mm gun]],<ref name=Testing/> and the [[D-10 tank gun|D-10 100&nbsp;mm gun]], which was based on a naval [[dual-purpose gun]]. The D-10 had been designed for anti-tank fire and had better armor penetration than the A-19, but the smaller caliber meant it had a less useful [[High explosives|high explosive]] round. Also, the D-10 was a relatively new weapon in short supply, while there was excess production capacity for the A-19 and its ammunition. Compared to the older [[F-34 tank gun|F-34 76.2&nbsp;mm]] tank gun, the D-25 delivered 5.37 times the muzzle energy.\n\nAfter testing both the D-25 and D-10 on the IS-122, the former was selected as the main armament of the new tank. The D-25 used a separate shell and powder charge, resulting in a lower rate of fire compared to the single-piece ammunition used in most tanks, a serious disadvantage in tank-to-tank engagements. Soviet proving-ground tests showed that the D-25 could penetrate the front armor of the German [[Panther tank|Panther]] at {{convert|2500|m|yd|abbr=on}} while the D-10 could do so at a maximum range of {{convert|1500|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Testing>{{cite web|title=Report on the results of testing of the 100 mm and the 122 mm tank guns at the Kubinka proving grounds|url=http://english.battlefield.ru/documents/29-technics/96-testing-100-mm-and-122-mm-tank-guns.html|website=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate=27 October 2014 |date=September 12, 1944 |last1=Tolochkov |last2=Volosatov}}</ref><ref>Zaloga 1984:172</ref> It was therefore considered an adequate anti-tank gun.

The 85&nbsp;mm guns could be reserved for the new T-34-85 medium tank and some of the IS-1s built were rearmed before leaving the factory and issued as IS-2s. It was slightly lighter and faster than the heaviest KV model 1942 tank, with thicker front armor and a much-improved turret design. The tank could carry thicker armor than the KV series, while remaining lighter, due to the better layout of the armor envelope. The KV's armor was less well-shaped and featured heavy armor even on the rear, while the IS series concentrated its armor at the front. The IS-2 was slightly heavier than the Panther, much lighter than the [[Tiger I]] and [[Tiger II]] and had a lower silhouette than both. Western observers tended to criticize Soviet tanks for their lack of finish and crude construction. The Soviets argued that it was warranted, considering the need for wartime expediency and the typically short battlefield life of their tanks.<ref>Perrett 1987:20</ref>\n\n[[File:IS-2 scheme of armour.jpg|thumb|Armor plan of IS-2, models 1943 (top) and 1944 (bottom).]]\nEarly IS-2s can be identified by the 'stepped' front hull casting with its small, opening driver's visor. The early tanks lacked gun tube travel locks or anti-aircraft-capable machine guns and had narrow mantlets.\n\nIn late 1944, the stepped hull front was replaced with an improved single casting of 120&nbsp;mm thickness angled at 60 degrees. This new nose lacked the opening driver's visor. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the IS-2M, but that designation actually refers to a much later modernization program from the 1950s. Other minor upgrades included the addition of a travel lock on the hull rear, wider mantlet and, on very late models, an [[DShK|anti-aircraft machine gun]].\n\nIn comparison to the Tiger I, the IS-2 had modest advantages in armour, even though it was 10 tons lighter<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven|title=IS-2 Heavy Tank 1944\u201373|date=1994|publisher=Osprey |page=25}}</ref> In 1944, IS-2 tank was the only large-scale Allied tank whose armor provided some protection from the well-known Tiger 88mm long-barreled guns and Panther 75mm L/70 guns.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the remaining IS-2 tanks (mostly model 1944 variants) were upgraded to the IS-2M standard, which introduced fittings such as external fuel tanks on the rear hull (the basic IS-2 had these only on the hull sides), stowage bins on both sides of the hull and protective skirting along the top edges of the [[Caterpillar track|tracks]].\n\n== Combat history ==\nThe IS-2 tank first saw combat in early 1944, equipping Guards Heavy Tank Regiments of the Red Army. First encountered by [[Otto Carius]] and a fellow Tiger I. After knocking out a column of T-34's, Carius moved into the nearby village of Malinava where he came face to face with the new IS-2. It was quickly destroyed, however as Carius moved further into the village he discovered a platoon of IS-2s dispatching of the group without a loss with the help of a second Tiger I. <ref>{{cite|title=Tigers in the Mud: The Combat Career of German Panzer Commander Otto Carius|first1=Otto|last1=Carius|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Tigers_in_the_Mud.htmlid=KdZZANBqbHMC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-0425236895}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}\nA regiment had 21 IS-2 tanks in four companies of five tanks each and one being used by the regimental commander.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=8}} The special tank regiments were reserved for important attacks, often to spearhead attempts to break through fortified German positions like anti-tank defence lines and bunkers.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=8}} The tanks supporting infantry in the assault by destroying bunkers, buildings, dug-in weapons and engaging German armoured vehicles.

Later IS-2 converted models were replaced with the [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|122mm D-25T gun]] whilst retaining the same hull.]]\nThe [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] was criticized by its crews for its poor mobility and the lack of a larger caliber gun than the [[T-34]] medium tank. It was much more expensive than the T-34, without having greater combat performance. Moscow ordered some KV-1 assembly lines to shift to T-34 production, leading to fears that KV-1 production would be halted and the SKB-2 design bureau, led by Kotin, closed.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=4}} In 1942, this problem was partially addressed by the KV-1S tank, which had thinner armor than the original, making it lighter and faster. It was competitive with the T-34 but at the cost of no longer having the heavier armor. Production of the KV-1S was gradually replaced by the [[SU-152]]{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=44}} and ended in April 1943.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=42}}\n\nThe capture of a German [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tank in January 1943 led to a decision to develop a new heavy tank, which was given the codename Object 237.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=5}} Before Object 237 had time to mature, intense tank fighting in the summer of 1943 demanded a response. Dukhov's team was instructed to create a [[wikt:stopgap#Pronunciation|stopgap]] KV tank, the KV-85, which was armed with the [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|52-K]]-derivative gun of the [[SU-85]], the 85&nbsp;mm D-5T, that proved capable of penetrating the [[Tiger I]] from {{convert|1000|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The KV-85 was created by mounting an Object 237 turret on a KV-1S hull. To accommodate the Object 237 turret, the KV-1S hull was modified, increasing the diameter of the turret ring with fillets on the sides of the hull. The radio operator was replaced with an ammunition rack for the larger 85&nbsp;mm ammunition. The hull MG was then moved to the opposite side of the driver and fixed in place to be operated by the driver. From September to October 1943, a total of 130 KV-85s were produced, before the assembly lines began to shift over. Like the KV-1S, the KV-85 served in dwindling numbers and was quickly overshadowed by the superior IS series.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=45}}\n\nThe Object 237 prototype, a version of the cancelled [[KV-13]], was accepted for production as the '''IS-85''' heavy tank.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=6}} First deliveries were made in October 1943, and the tanks went immediately into service. Production ended in January 1944. Its designation was simplified to IS-1 after the introduction of the IS-122, later renamed as IS-2 for security purposes.\n\n===Object 240 IS-2===\n==== Gun ====\nBy 1943, engineers had succeeded in mounting the 85&nbsp;mm gun to the T-34 medium tank, making it as well-armed as the KV-85 heavy tank. Efforts to up-gun the IS-85 began in late 1943. Two candidate weapons were the D-25 122&nbsp;mm tank gun, the ballistic characteristics of which were identical to the [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|A-19 122&nbsp;mm gun]],<ref name=Testing/> and the [[D-10 tank gun|D-10 100&nbsp;mm gun]], which was based on a naval [[dual-purpose gun]]. The D-10 had been designed for anti-tank fire and had better armor penetration than the A-19, but the smaller caliber meant it had a less useful [[High explosives|high explosive]] round. Also, the D-10 was a relatively new weapon in short supply, while there was excess production capacity for the A-19 and its ammunition. Compared to the older [[F-34 tank gun|F-34 76.2&nbsp;mm]] tank gun, the D-25 delivered 5.37 times the muzzle energy.\n\nAfter testing both the D-25 and D-10 on the IS-122, the former was selected as the main armament of the new tank. The D-25 used a separate shell and powder charge, resulting in a lower rate of fire compared to the single-piece ammunition used in most tanks, a serious disadvantage in tank-to-tank engagements. Soviet proving-ground tests showed that the D-25 could penetrate the front armor of the German [[Panther tank|Panther]] at {{convert|2500|m|yd|abbr=on}} while the D-10 could do so at a maximum range of {{convert|1500|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Testing>{{cite web|title=Report on the results of testing of the 100 mm and the 122 mm tank guns at the Kubinka proving grounds|url=http://english.battlefield.ru/documents/29-technics/96-testing-100-mm-and-122-mm-tank-guns.html|website=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate=27 October 2014 |date=September 12, 1944 |last1=Tolochkov |last2=Volosatov}}</ref><ref>Zaloga 1984:172</ref> It was therefore considered an adequate anti-tank gun.

The 85&nbsp;mm guns could be reserved for the new T-34-85 medium tank and some of the IS-1s built were rearmed before leaving the factory and issued as IS-2s. It was slightly lighter and faster than the heaviest KV model 1942 tank, with thicker front armor and a much-improved turret design. The tank could carry thicker armor than the KV series, while remaining lighter, due to the better layout of the armor envelope. The KV's armor was less well-shaped and featured heavy armor even on the rear, while the IS series concentrated its armor at the front. The IS-2 was slightly heavier than the Panther, much lighter than the [[Tiger I]] and [[Tiger II]] and had a lower silhouette than both. Western observers tended to criticize Soviet tanks for their lack of finish and crude construction. The Soviets argued that it was warranted, considering the need for wartime expediency and the typically short battlefield life of their tanks.<ref>Perrett 1987:20</ref>\n\n[[File:IS-2 scheme of armour.jpg|thumb|Armor plan of IS-2, models 1943 (top) and 1944 (bottom).]]\nEarly IS-2s can be identified by the 'stepped' front hull casting with its small, opening driver's visor. The early tanks lacked gun tube travel locks or anti-aircraft-capable machine guns and had narrow mantlets.\n\nIn late 1944, the stepped hull front was replaced with an improved single casting of 120&nbsp;mm thickness angled at 60 degrees. This new nose lacked the opening driver's visor. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the IS-2M, but that designation actually refers to a much later modernization program from the 1950s. Other minor upgrades included the addition of a travel lock on the hull rear, wider mantlet and, on very late models, an [[DShK|anti-aircraft machine gun]].\n\nIn comparison to the Tiger I, the IS-2 had modest advantages in armour, even though it was 10 tons lighter<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven|title=IS-2 Heavy Tank 1944\u201373|date=1994|publisher=Osprey |page=25}}</ref> In 1944, IS-2 tank was the only large-scale Allied tank whose armor provided some protection from the well-known Tiger 88mm long-barreled guns and Panther 75mm L/70 guns.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the remaining IS-2 tanks (mostly model 1944 variants) were upgraded to the IS-2M standard, which introduced fittings such as external fuel tanks on the rear hull (the basic IS-2 had these only on the hull sides), stowage bins on both sides of the hull and protective skirting along the top edges of the [[Caterpillar track|tracks]].\n\n== Combat history ==\nThe IS-2 tank first saw combat in early 1944, equipping Guards Heavy Tank Regiments of the Red Army. First encountered by [[Otto Carius]] and a fellow Tiger I. After knocking out a column of T-34's, Carius moved into the nearby village of Malinava where he came face to face with the new IS-2. It was quickly destroyed, however as Carius moved further into the village he discovered a platoon of IS-2s. {{citation needed}} A regiment had 21 IS-2 tanks in four companies of five tanks each and one being used by the regimental commander.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=8}} The special tank regiments were reserved for important attacks, often to spearhead attempts to break through fortified German positions like anti-tank defence lines and bunkers.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=8}} The tanks supporting infantry in the assault by destroying bunkers, buildings, dug-in weapons and engaging German armoured vehicles. Once a breakthrough was achieved, lighter and more mobile tanks were used for exploitation and mopping-up. The IS-2 tank first saw action in [[Ukraine]] in early 1944 and claimed to have destroyed more than forty Tigers and [[Elefant]]s for the loss of only eight tanks.

In the late 1960s the remaining Soviet heavy tanks were transferred to Red Army reserve service and storage. The IS-2 Model 1944 remained in service much longer in the armies of [[Cuba]], [[China]] and [[North Korea]]. A regiment of Chinese IS-2s was available for use in the [[Korean War]] but saw no service there.\n\nAfter the Korean War, China attempted to reverse-engineer the IS-2/IS-3 as the Type 122 medium tank.

It was later demolished in stages to make way for the [[Louvre Palace]]. Its main location was on the right bank of the [[Seine]] river.\n\n== The fortress ==\n{{Main|Wall of Philip II Augustus}}\n[[Image:Plan.chateau.Louvre.png|thumb|left|Map of the Louvre castle under Charles V (reigned 1364\u20131380) as reconstructed in 1856. The map is inverted with the South (and Seine river) at the top of the image.]]\n[[Image:Le Louvre sous Charles V, 1380.jpg|thumb|left|The Louvre in 1380 (under Charles V) as imagined in 1885.]]\n[[Image:Quartier du Louvre, 1380.jpg|thumb|left|Plan from around 1880 of the Louvre castle in 1380 after the construction of the Charles V wall.]]\n\nBefore his departure for the [[Third Crusade]] in 1190, King Philip II wanted to protect Paris, the capital of his Kingdom, against invasions. In particular, he wanted to defend Paris against English soldiers based in Normandy. Additionally and more specifically, King Phillip II wanted to build a place to keep his treasure and his archives safe. These archives were especially sacred to the King because they were lost during the [[Battle of Fr\u00e9teval]] in 1194 against [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], but he had since reconstructed and did not want to lose again.\n\nHe built the enclosure, [[Wall of Philip II Augustus|which bears his name]], around Paris between 1190 and 1209 for the right bank portion and between 1200 and 1215 for the left bank which was less exposed. The Louvre castle stands west, the most exposed side, as English soldiers were occupying Normandy less than 100&nbsp;km away. This decision was also motivated by a previous [[Siege of Paris (845)|Viking invasion in 845]] that almost captured the city.<ref name=\"philippe\">{{cite web |title=Le Louvre de Philippe Auguste |url=http://chrisagde.free.fr/capetiens/louvre.htm |accessdate=12 March 2019 |language=French}}</ref>\n\nThe castle itself is composed of a squared fortress (78 m by 72 m), surrounded by a 10 m wide moat fed by the water of the nearby Seine river. The wall on the west side, which overlooks the countryside, is thicker and doorless when compared to the other walls, as it was appraised to be the most exposed side, and therefore the most vulnerable for an attack. The perimeter is reinforced by ten defensive towers, with extra emphasis on the corners of the castle. The space between towers never exceeds 25 m, which is the distance corresponding to the effective range of a bow (of that time). They are pierced with [[arrowslit]]s to defend the ramparts. The castle has two entrances with the main one facing south and the Seine, while a secondary smaller one faces east and the city.

It was later demolished in stages to make way for the [[Louvre Palace]]. Its main location was on the right bank of the [[Seine]] river.\n\n== The fortress ==\n{{Main|Wall of Philip II Augustus}}\n[[Image:Plan.chateau.Louvre.png|thumb|left|Map of the Louvre castle under Charles V (reigned 1364\u20131380) as reconstructed in 1856.

In particular, he wanted to defend Paris against English soldiers based in Normandy. Additionally and more specifically, King Phillip II wanted to build a place to keep his treasure and his archives safe. These archives were especially sacred to the King because they were lost during the [[Battle of Fr\u00e9teval]] in 1194 against [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], but he had since reconstructed and did not want to lose again.\n\nHe built the enclosure, [[Wall of Philip II Augustus|which bears his name]], around Paris between 1190 and 1209 for the right bank portion and between 1200 and 1215 for the left bank which was less exposed. The Louvre castle stands west, the most exposed side, as English soldiers were occupying Normandy less than 100&nbsp;km away. This decision was also motivated by a previous [[Siege of Paris (845)|Viking invasion in 845]] that almost captured the city.<ref name=\"philippe\">{{cite web |title=Le Louvre de Philippe Auguste |url=http://chrisagde.free.fr/capetiens/louvre.htm |accessdate=12 March 2019 |language=French}}</ref>\n\nThe castle itself is composed of a squared fortress (78 m by 72 m), surrounded by a 10 m wide moat fed by the water of the nearby Seine river. The wall on the west side, which overlooks the countryside, is thicker and doorless when compared to the other walls, as it was appraised to be the most exposed side, and therefor the most vulnerable for an attack. The perimeter is reinforced by ten defensive towers, with extra emphasis on the corners of the castle. The space between towers never exceeds 25 m, which is the distance corresponding to the effective range of a bow (of that time). They are pierced with [[arrowslit]]s to defend the ramparts. The castle has two entrances with the main one facing south and the Seine, while a secondary smaller one faces east and the city. These doors are protected by [[drawbridge]]s and are framed between two twin towers. Two additional buildings housing the garrisons and the arsenals are located outside of the surrounding wall, to the west and south of the central courtyard, respectively.<ref name=philippe /><ref name=\"chateau\">{{cite web |title=Chateau du Louvres, XIIe, XIVe siecle \u2013 Description.|url=http://www.richesheures.net/epoque-6-15/chateau/75louvre-description.htm |accessdate=12 March 2019 |language=French}}</ref><ref name=\"paris\">{{cite web |title=Paris \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de Philippe Auguste, Le Louvre de Philippe Auguste |url=http://philippe-auguste.com/ville/louvre.html |accessdate=12 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119223718/http://philippe-auguste.com/ville/louvre.html |archivedate=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe set of curtains and walls are at a slight downward angle to hamper [[sapping]] attempts and to facilitate the rebound of projectiles thrown from the top against attacking soldiers.<ref name=chateau />\n\nA dungeon named the ''Grosse Tour'' (''Big Tower'' in French) was built in 1200 in the center of the courtyard.

Looting of [[art]], [[archaeology]] and other cultural property may be an opportunistic criminal act or may be a more organized case of [[Crime|unlawful]] or [[unethical]] pillage by the victor of a conflict.  The term \"looted art\" reflects bias, and whether particular art has been taken legally or illegally is often the subject of conflicting laws and subjective interpretations of governments and people; use of the term \"looted art\" in reference to a particular art object implies that the art was taken illegally.\n\nRelated terms include ''[[art theft]]'' (the stealing of valuable artifacts, mostly because of commercial reasons), ''[[illicit antiquities]]'' (covertly traded antiquities or artifacts of archaeological interest, found in illegal or unregulated excavations), ''[[provenance]]'' (the origin or source of a piece of art), and ''[[art repatriation]]'' (the process of returning artworks and antiques to their rightful owners).\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Palma Giovane Warsaw.JPG|thumb|right|''Virgin and Child with St. John the Baptist and St. Stanis\u0142aw'' by [[Palma il Giovane]] was looted by [[Napoleon]]<ref>{{cite book|author = Maria Kwiatkowska|title = Katedra \u015aw.

The contents of nearly all the tombs of the [[Pharaoh]]s were already completely looted by [[grave robber]]s before the invasion of Egypt by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&nbsp;BCE. There have been a total of seven [[Sack of Rome (disambiguation)|sackings of Rome]]. The [[Old Testament]] includes several references to looting and to the looting of art and treasures; in the [[Book of Chronicles]] it is said: \"King [[Shishak]] of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the Lord's temple and of the royal palace; he took everything, including the gold shields that [[Solomon]] had made\",<ref>2 Chronicles. Chapter. 12:9. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C.</ref> and in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] 15:11 [[The name of God in Judaism#In English|the Lord]] says: \"Jerusalem, I will surely send you away for your own good. I will surely bring the enemy upon you in a time of trouble and distress ... I will give away your wealth and your treasures as plunder. I will give it away free of charge for the sins you have committed throughout your land.\"<ref>Jeremiah 15:11. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C.</ref> Other famous examples include the Roman [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Sack of Corinth]] in 146 BC, the Sack of  [[Constantinople]] by the [[Fourth Crusade]], the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Sack of Baghdad in 1258]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and the looting of the [[Aztec]] gold. In only some of these was the removal of artworks for their own sake (rather than the value of their materials for example) a primary motivation.\n\nSince the rise of an [[Illicit antiquities|art market]] for monumental sculpture, abandoned monuments all over the world have been at risk, notably in [[Iran]], the old territories of [[Mesoamerican culture]] and Cambodia.<ref>Mydans, Seth. Raiders of Lost Art Loot Temples in Cambodia. New York Times, April 1, 1999,Section A, Page 4, Column 3, 1152 words</ref>\n\nAfter the looting of Europe by Napoleon, others copied the institutionalized model of systematic plunder and looting. During the [[American Civil War]], legal frameworks and guidelines emerged that justified and legalized the plunder and looting of opposing parties and nations. [[Henry Wager Halleck]], a United States Army officer, scholar, and lawyer argued: \"No belligerent would be justifiable in destroying temples, tombs, statutes [sic], paintings, or other works of art (except so far as their destruction may be the accidental or necessary result of military operations.) But, may he not seize and appropriate to his own use such works of genius and taste as belong to the hostile state, and are of a moveable character?\".<ref>Halleck. International law, or, Rules regulating the intercourse of states in peace and war. Ch. XIX, Sections 10\u201311. (1861)</ref>\n\nIn July 1862, [[Francis Lieber]], a professor at [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], who had worked with Halleck on guidelines for guerrilla warfare, was asked by Halleck, now [[General-in-Chief]] of [[Union Army|armies of the Union]], to develop a code of conduct for the armed forces. The code of conduct, published as General Orders No. 100 on April 24, 1863, signed by United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]], later became known as the [[Lieber Code]]<ref name=lieber>Francis Lieber, LL.D. [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lieber.htm Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928054214/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lieber.htm |date=2012-09-28 }}. Originally Issued as General Orders No. 100, Adjutant General's Office, 1863, Washington 1898: [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]</ref> and specifically authorized the Armies of the United States to plunder and loot the enemy \u2013 a mindset that Hitler's armies copied one century later. The Lieber Code said in Article 36: \"If such works of art, libraries, collections, or instruments belonging to a hostile nation or government, can be removed without injury, the ruler of the conquering state or nation may order them to be seized and removed for the benefit of the said nation.

During the time of the invasion, work on archaeological sites was halted. While the projects on the Greek-Cypriot southern area were started again after a short period of delay, the projects in the Turkish north were never started again. Many of the houses and workshops associated with archaeological projects in the north were looted, so the work that had been done was lost to the researchers.<ref name=\"Nicolaou, Kyriakos 1976\">Nicolaou, Kyriakos. 1976. \u201cArchaeological News from Cyprus, 1974\u201d.

The fighting not only was destroying Byzantine and Christian cultural heritage, but it was even destroying culture that had been in existence for far longer. There have been appeals filed with UNESCO, ICOM, and ICOMOS to help with the preservation of the remaining cultural heritage on the island, and a representative of UNESCO was appointed to help by 1976.<ref name=\"Nicolaou, Kyriakos 1976\"/>\n\n====Looted religious sites and icons====\n\nOn the island of Cyprus before the invasion, the majority of the inhabitants were Greek-Cypriots, and for these citizens, the Greek Orthodox Church was and continues today to be central to their identity and faith.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\"/> In the north, there is a fear that Christianity is dying out because the churches and monasteries have been destroyed, transformed, or are falling into ruin. The northern Turkish inhabitants have transformed some former religious sites into mosques, army barracks, stables, night clubs and hotels, and it has been documented that only 3 churches and 1 monastery are currently in a dignified state out of the 520 churches and monasteries that were in the northern area of the country before the Turkish invasion.<ref name=\"guardian1\">\u201cGreek Orthodox Church sues Turkey Over Access to Religious Sites in Cyprus\u201d.

The Greek Orthodox Church has taken Turkey to the European Court of Human Rights because they were preventing practicing Christians from worshiping at previously religious, but currently transformed buildings. Even though the buildings have been destroyed or converted, the Greek-Cypriot citizens still want to be able to worship at these places to keep continuity with their faith without regard to the destruction.<ref name=\"guardian1\"/>\n\n====Aydin Dikmen considered a key suspect====\n\n[[Ayd\u0131n Dikmen|Aydin Dikmen]] is a 60-year-old man who has been arrested in relation to the looting and selling of looted goods from the island of Cyprus. He had been suspected of being involved in the selling of looted art since 1982, but he kept a low profile and fell off the radar for some time.<ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/> His involvement was cemented when Peg Goldberg was sued by the Church of Cyprus in 1989 because she knew that she bought the mosaics from Dikmen; he claimed that he found the remains in the rubble of a church that had been forgotten and basically destroyed while he was working as an archaeologist in the northern part of Cyprus.<ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/><ref name=\"Bourloyannis, M.

However, in 1997, former colleagues of Dikmen helped the authorities arrest Dikmen and raid his many apartments. In these apartments, some of which Dikmen rented under false names and used as storage space, the authorities found a surplus of icons, frescoes, early Bibles, ancient pottery, statues, and coins from Cyprus. After learning of another residence of Dikmen\u2019s, the authorities found 30 to 40 more crates filled with icons, frescoes, mosaics, and artifacts.<ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/> Also in one of the residences, the authorities found drawings containing information on how to cut out mosaics to keep the faces of the religious figures intact, while still taking the piece away from the original space; this shows how systematic and planned out the looting of the churches and monasteries was for Dikmen and his associates in the northern part of Cyprus.<ref name=\"nytimes1998\"/><ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/> The organization and the intense planning involved brings up the issue of possible aid coming from Turkish authorities in the northern part of Cyprus; there are rumors that the government and military knew about the looting and chose to not do anything about it. This discomforting idea is continually straining the ties between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.<ref name=\"nytimes1998\"/>\n\nSince Dikmen\u2019s arrest in 1998, the Antiphonitis frescoes and the Kanakarian mosaics have been returned to Cyprus, and soon the 13th-century frescoes currently housed by the Menil Collection in Houston will be returned to the island, as well.<ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/><ref name=\"menil1\">\u201cThe Menil Collection Celebrates Return of Byzantine Frescoes With Public Events Honoring Sacred Works\u201d.

These mosaics have been looted from the Church of the Virgin of Kanakaria in the village of [[Lythrangomi]] in Northern Cyprus after surviving the 8th and 9th century.<ref name=\"cyprusnet2005\"/><ref name=\"europesworld2007\"/> These mosaics had survived the 8th- and 9th-century iconoclasm in the Byzantine world and were considered to be finer than other mosaics, even the mosaics found in Ravenna, Italy and the mosaics in St. Catherine\u2019s monastery in Sinai.<ref name=\"europesworld2007\"/> The Kanakaria mosaics were cut into pieces when they were looted from the original church, and Peg Goldberg was able to purchase four segments of these early mosaics from Aydin Dikmen. These mosaics are important to the cultural, artistic, and religious heritage of Cyprus because they are some of the few remaining Byzantine mosaics from the island; when and how these mosaics were taken from Cyprus is unknown because there is documentation to show that they were still intact in 1976, two years after the initial invasion by the Turkish troops.<ref name=\"europesworld2007\"/><ref name=\"Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992\"/>\n\nThese mosaics first came into the view of the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg approached the Getty Museum to purchase the mosaic pieces. The Getty Museum recognized them as the lost Kanakaria mosaics and informed Cyprus that they were in the United States. Shortly afterward, the Church of Cyprus filed a claim at the district court to try to reclaim the mosaics.<ref name=\"Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992\"/> The federal court in Indiana made a verdict in favor of the Church of Cyprus, and the mosaics were returned in 1991 to the Byzantine Museum in Nicosia, Cyprus.<ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/> The verdict showed that Goldberg could not own the pieces because Dikmen had stolen the mosaics and had no right to pass on the ownership of the stolen mosaics. Goldberg stated that the pieces had been bought \u201cin good faith\u201d from a \u201cTurkish antiquities dealer\u201d who found the mosaics in an abandoned church, but the judge ruled that not looking into the background and workings of the dealer was unacceptable because it was her responsibility to look into the people she was working with.<ref name=\"europesworld2007\"/><ref name=\"Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992\"/> This case called in the multilateral treaty of the 1970 [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property]], which calls for all available parties to help recover and return items that have been requested by the country of origin; using this international decree helped to show the importance of these artifacts which needed to be sent to their home land of Cyprus.<ref name=\"Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992\"/> People have been happy with this verdict for the Kanakaria case because they want others to realize that cultural heritage of the world is not for sale, and hopefully discourage further selling of looted art in the international market.<ref name=\"nytimes1990\">[[William H.

The Italian government and the [[Carabinieri Art Squad|Art Squad]] of the [[Carabinieri]], Italy's military police force, made special efforts to \"[crack] the network of looters, smugglers, and dealers supplying American museums,\" collecting \"mountains of evidence\u2014thousands of antiquities, photographs, and documents\u2014seized from looters and dealers in a series of dramatic raids.\" According to the BBC, Italian authorities have for several years insisted on the return of stolen or looted artworks from wealthy museums and collectors, particularly in America.<ref name=bbcgetty>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/273618.stm Getty Museum returns stolen art]. BBC. February 6, 1999</ref> Italy has successfully fought numerous lawsuits that have resulted in the repatriation of many items of looted art and antiquities from many famous American institutions, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles, the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], the [[Princeton Museum of Art]], the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], and the private collection of [[Leon Levy]] and his wife, [[Shelby White]].<ref>[http://www.archaeology.org/0607/abstracts/raiders.html Raiding the Tomb Raiders]. [[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]. Volume 59 Number 4, July/August 2006</ref>\n\nAs the result of lawsuits filed by the Italian and Turkish governments, as well as the work of investigative journalist [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] and archaeologist [[Vernon Silver]], both the Metropolitan Museum and the J. Paul Getty Museum have been repeatedly exposed as two of the world's biggest institutional recipients of looted and stolen Mediterranean artefacts, and the museums benefited from the illegal antiquities trade, both through direct acquisition, and via donations and bequests from major private collectors. A significant number of Met and Getty acquisitions over a period of at least 40 years were everntually shown to have been sourced from a major international illegal antiquities trading network that centred on Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]]. From the late 1960s, Medici rose to become the central figure in  a large criminal conspiracy, acting as the middleman between gangs of ''tombaroli'' (tomb robbers) - who systematically looted tens of thousands of important artefacts from Italian and other Mediterranean archaeological sites, as well as stealing objects from museums, churches and private collections - and an elite group of American and British dealers who helped Medici to \"launder\" his contraband and sell it to major buyers like the Met, the Getty and leading American private collectors.\n\nMedici typically paid the ''tombaroli'' small sums for the looted and stolen goods, and then smuggled them out of Italy to Switzerland, where they were restored. Taking advantage of the lax attitudes and practices of 'cooperative' auction houses - notably Sotheby's in London - Medici built up an elaborate network of front companies and elite antiquities dealers and galleries, including the British dealer [[Robin Symes]], Rome-based American dealer [[Robert E. Hecht]], and Hollywood dealer and producer [[Bruce McNall]]. A major investigation by the TPC (the art crimes division of the [[Carabinieri]]) beginning in the 1990s, which eventually resulted in Medici's conviction, recovered tens of thousands of looted artefacts, and extensive documentary evidence, including thousands of sequential photographs that showed the journey of these looted objects from excavation, through restoration, to their final placement in museum collections, as well as a crucial handwritten 'organigram' (organisational chart) that named and linked all the members of Medici's operation. TPC investigations also revealed that Medici used front companies to anonymously sell and then buy back many items, often multiple times, in order to manipulate the market, as well as allowing him to acquire the all-important Sotheby's provenances. In February 2016, TPC officials announced that a raid on Robin Symes' warehouse in the Geneva Freeport had uncovered a huge collection of 17,000 looted antiquities, nearly all of which are thought to have been sourced from Medici, and which Symes secretly placed there ca. 2000 in order to conceal their existence from the executors of the estate of his former lover and business partner, Christo Michelaides, who died in 1999.\n\n[[File:Euphronios krater side B MET L.2006.10.jpg|right|thumb|[[Euphronios krater]], a 2,500-year-old Greek vase, stolen from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled from Italy, returned to Italy by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2006]]\n\nIn 2006, the Metropolitan Museum of Art finally agreed to relinquish ownership of a 2,500-year-old Greek vase known as the [[Euphronios krater]], a [[krater]] painted by [[Euphronios]], after the TPC was able to establish that the object had been looted from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled out of Italy by the Medici gang. The Met also surrendered 15 pieces of Sicilian silver and four ancient vessels in exchange for long-term loans of other antiquities. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the case, \"of its kind, perhaps second only to the dispute between Greece and Great Britain over the Elgin marbles,\" \"became emblematic of the ethical questions surrounding the acquisition of ancient art by major museums.\"<ref>Randy Kennedy and Hugh Eakin.

February 2, 2006</ref>\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum has been involved in several other major controversies involving antiquities believed or proven to have been looted or stolen, including:\n\n* the [[Cloisters Cross]], a large [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] cross carved from walrus ivory, said to have been carved in England, but possibly made in Germany. It was initially offered to the [[British Museum]] in 1961 by its then owner, a shady Yugoslav 'collector' called [[Ante Topi\u0107 Mimara]], who is now widely believed to have acquired as part of a huge collection of art and antiquities that he stole at the end of WWII from the Central Collecting Point in Munich, the Allied clearinghouse for the repatriation of material looted by the Nazis. The British Museum eventually declined to buy the cross because Topi\u0107 Mimara would not provide proof that he had full title to the object, but immediately after the British Museum's option expired in 1963, the cross was purchased for the Met by curator [[Thomas Hoving]] for GBP\u00a3200,000. The Cross is currently still in the collection of the Met, at its [[Cloisters Museum]] annexe.<ref name=\"Peter Watson 2007 pp.133-146\">Peter Watson; Cecilia Todeschini (2007), ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'' (Public Affairs, NY), pp.133-146</ref>\n* the [[Karun Treasure]], also known as the Lydian Hoard, is a fabulous collection of 200 gold, silver, bronze and earthenware objects, dating from the 7th Century BCE. It formed part of a larger haul of some 450 objects that were looted by local tomb robbers from ancient four royal tombs near [[Sardis]], in Turkey in 1966-67. The contents of the tombs, including painted pieces of the walls, were stripped and sold (via Swiss and American middlemen) to the Metropolitan Museum between 1966 and 1970 for a total of US$1.5 million, but they were kept hidden in storage for more than 20 years. The Treasure was eventually put on display in 1984 in a major exhibition, where it was seen by Turkish journalist \u00d6zgen Acar, who had been investigating the looting of the tombs for many years. Although the Met intentionally mislabeled the objects as part of an \u201cEast Greek treasure,\u201d Acar immediately recognised them as the Lydian artefacts, from the descriptions he had been given by the looters. He alerted the Turkish government, and in 1986, they officially requested the hoard be returned. The Met refused, so Turkey began legal action to recover it.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21761 The History Blog: \"Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found\" (posted 28 November 2012)]</ref> After a six-year legal battle which reportedly cost the Turkish government UK\u00a325 million<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey Constanze Letch, \"King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey\", ''The Guardian'', 26 November 2012]</ref> the case ended dramatically after the minutes of the Met's own acquisition committee revealed that a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects.

The contents of nearly all the tombs of the [[Pharaoh]]s were already completely looted by [[grave robber]]s before the invasion of Egypt by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&nbsp;BCE. There have been a total of seven [[Sack of Rome (disambiguation)|sackings of Rome]]. The [[Old Testament]] includes several references to looting and to the looting of art and treasures; in the [[Book of Chronicles]] it is said: \"King [[Shishak]] of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the Lord's temple and of the royal palace; he took everything, including the gold shields that [[Solomon]] had made\",<ref>2 Chronicles. Chapter. 12:9. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C.</ref> and in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] 15:11 [[The name of God in Judaism#In English|the Lord]] says: \"Jerusalem, I will surely send you away for your own good. I will surely bring the enemy upon you in a time of trouble and distress ... I will give away your wealth and your treasures as plunder. I will give it away free of charge for the sins you have committed throughout your land.\"<ref>Jeremiah 15:11. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C.</ref> Other famous examples include the Roman [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Sack of Corinth]] in 146 BC, the Sack of  [[Constantinople]] by the [[Fourth Crusade]], the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Sack of Baghdad in 1258]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and the looting of the [[Aztec]] gold. In only some of these was the removal of artworks for their own sake (rather than the value of their materials for example) a primary motivation.\n\nSince the rise of an [[Illicit antiquities|art market]] for monumental sculpture, abandoned monuments all over the world have been at risk, notably in [[Iran]], the old territories of [[Mesoamerican culture]] and Cambodia.<ref>Mydans, Seth. Raiders of Lost Art Loot Temples in Cambodia. New York Times, April 1, 1999,Section A, Page 4, Column 3, 1152 words</ref>\n\nAfter the looting of Europe by Napoleon, others copied the institutionalized model of systematic plunder and looting. During the [[American Civil War]], legal frameworks and guidelines emerged that justified and legalized the plunder and looting of opposing parties and nations. [[Henry Wager Halleck]], a United States Army officer, scholar, and lawyer argued: \"No belligerent would be justifiable in destroying temples, tombs, statutes [sic], paintings, or other works of art (except so far as their destruction may be the accidental or necessary result of military operations.) But, may he not seize and appropriate to his own use such works of genius and taste as belong to the hostile state, and are of a moveable character?\".<ref>Halleck. International law, or, Rules regulating the intercourse of states in peace and war. Ch. XIX, Sections 10\u201311. (1861)</ref>\n\nIn July 1862, [[Francis Lieber]], a professor at [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], who had worked with Halleck on guidelines for guerrilla warfare, was asked by Halleck, now [[General-in-Chief]] of [[Union Army|armies of the Union]], to develop a code of conduct for the armed forces. The code of conduct, published as General Orders No. 100 on April 24, 1863, signed by United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]], later became known as the [[Lieber Code]]<ref name=lieber>Francis Lieber, LL.D. [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lieber.htm Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928054214/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lieber.htm |date=2012-09-28 }}.

The Lieber Code said in Article 36: \"If such works of art, libraries, collections, or instruments belonging to a hostile nation or government, can be removed without injury, the ruler of the conquering state or nation may order them to be seized and removed for the benefit of the said nation. The ultimate ownership is to be settled by the ensuing treaty of peace.\"<ref>Hartigan, Richard Shelly, ed. Lieber's Code and the Law of War. Chicago: Precedent, 1983.</ref><ref>Friedman, Leon.

Looted Art. http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/bibliography/index.php?content=looted_art</ref>\n\nThe Lieber Code further defined the conditions of looting and the relationship between private plunder and booty and institutionalized looting \"All captures and booty belong, according to the modern law of war, primarily to the government of the captor.\" (Article 45), \"Neither officers nor soldiers are allowed to make use of their position or power in the hostile country for private gain, not even for commercial transactions otherwise legitimate.\" (Article 46) and \"... [I]f large sums are found upon the persons of prisoners, or in their possession, they shall be taken from them, and the surplus, after providing for their own support, appropriated for the use of the army, under the direction of the commander, unless otherwise ordered by the government.\" (Article 72)<ref name=lieber/>\n\nMassive art looting occurred during [[World War II]]; see [[art theft during World War II]].\n\n==Looting of countries==\n\n===Looting of Afghanistan===\nMany art pieces and artifacts from Afghanistan were looted during several wars; scores of artworks were smuggled to Britain and sold to wealthy collectors. \"There are also fears that the bulk of the collection once in [[Kabul Museum]], ... is now in smugglers' or collectors' hands.

The northern Turkish inhabitants have transformed some former religious sites into mosques, army barracks, stables, night clubs and hotels, and it has been documented that only 3 churches and 1 monastery are currently in a dignified state out of the 520 churches and monasteries that were in the northern area of the country before the Turkish invasion.<ref name=\"guardian1\">\u201cGreek Orthodox Church sues Turkey Over Access to Religious Sites in Cyprus\u201d.

The Greek Orthodox Church has taken Turkey to the European Court of Human Rights because they were preventing practicing Christians from worshiping at previously religious, but currently transformed buildings. Even though the buildings have been destroyed or converted, the Greek-Cypriot citizens still want to be able to worship at these places to keep continuity with their faith without regard to the destruction.<ref name=\"guardian1\"/>\n\n====Aydin Dikmen considered a key suspect====\n\n[[Ayd\u0131n Dikmen|Aydin Dikmen]] is a 60-year-old man who has been arrested in relation to the looting and selling of looted goods from the island of Cyprus. He had been suspected of being involved in the selling of looted art since 1982, but he kept a low profile and fell off the radar for some time.<ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/> His involvement was cemented when Peg Goldberg was sued by the Church of Cyprus in 1989 because she knew that she bought the mosaics from Dikmen; he claimed that he found the remains in the rubble of a church that had been forgotten and basically destroyed while he was working as an archaeologist in the northern part of Cyprus.<ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/><ref name=\"Bourloyannis, M.

However, in 1997, former colleagues of Dikmen helped the authorities arrest Dikmen and raid his many apartments. In these apartments, some of which Dikmen rented under false names and used as storage space, the authorities found a surplus of icons, frescoes, early Bibles, ancient pottery, statues, and coins from Cyprus. After learning of another residence of Dikmen\u2019s, the authorities found 30 to 40 more crates filled with icons, frescoes, mosaics, and artifacts.<ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/> Also in one of the residences, the authorities found drawings containing information on how to cut out mosaics to keep the faces of the religious figures intact, while still taking the piece away from the original space; this shows how systematic and planned out the looting of the churches and monasteries was for Dikmen and his associates in the northern part of Cyprus.<ref name=\"nytimes1998\"/><ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/> The organization and the intense planning involved brings up the issue of possible aid coming from Turkish authorities in the northern part of Cyprus; there are rumors that the government and military knew about the looting and chose to not do anything about it. This discomforting idea is continually straining the ties between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.<ref name=\"nytimes1998\"/>\n\nSince Dikmen\u2019s arrest in 1998, the Antiphonitis frescoes and the Kanakarian mosaics have been returned to Cyprus, and soon the 13th-century frescoes currently housed by the Menil Collection in Houston will be returned to the island, as well.<ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/><ref name=\"menil1\">\u201cThe Menil Collection Celebrates Return of Byzantine Frescoes With Public Events Honoring Sacred Works\u201d.

These mosaics have been looted from the Church of the Virgin of Kanakaria in the village of [[Lythrangomi]] in Northern Cyprus after surviving the 8th and 9th century.<ref name=\"cyprusnet2005\"/><ref name=\"europesworld2007\"/> These mosaics had survived the 8th- and 9th-century iconoclasm in the Byzantine world and were considered to be finer than other mosaics, even the mosaics found in Ravenna, Italy and the mosaics in St. Catherine\u2019s monastery in Sinai.<ref name=\"europesworld2007\"/> The Kanakaria mosaics were cut into pieces when they were looted from the original church, and Peg Goldberg was able to purchase four segments of these early mosaics from Aydin Dikmen. These mosaics are important to the cultural, artistic, and religious heritage of Cyprus because they are some of the few remaining Byzantine mosaics from the island; when and how these mosaics were taken from Cyprus is unknown because there is documentation to show that they were still intact in 1976, two years after the initial invasion by the Turkish troops.<ref name=\"europesworld2007\"/><ref name=\"Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992\"/>\n\nThese mosaics first came into the view of the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg approached the Getty Museum to purchase the mosaic pieces. The Getty Museum recognized them as the lost Kanakaria mosaics and informed Cyprus that they were in the United States. Shortly afterward, the Church of Cyprus filed a claim at the district court to try to reclaim the mosaics.<ref name=\"Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992\"/> The federal court in Indiana made a verdict in favor of the Church of Cyprus, and the mosaics were returned in 1991 to the Byzantine Museum in Nicosia, Cyprus.<ref name=\"archaeology1998\"/> The verdict showed that Goldberg could not own the pieces because Dikmen had stolen the mosaics and had no right to pass on the ownership of the stolen mosaics. Goldberg stated that the pieces had been bought \u201cin good faith\u201d from a \u201cTurkish antiquities dealer\u201d who found the mosaics in an abandoned church, but the judge ruled that not looking into the background and workings of the dealer was unacceptable because it was her responsibility to look into the people she was working with.<ref name=\"europesworld2007\"/><ref name=\"Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992\"/> This case called in the multilateral treaty of the 1970 [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property]], which calls for all available parties to help recover and return items that have been requested by the country of origin; using this international decree helped to show the importance of these artifacts which needed to be sent to their home land of Cyprus.<ref name=\"Bourloyannis, M.

Paul Getty Museum have been repeatedly exposed as two of the world's biggest institutional recipients of looted and stolen Mediterranean artefacts, and the museums benefited from the illegal antiquities trade, both through direct acquisition, and via donations and bequests from major private collectors. A significant number of Met and Getty acquisitions over a period of at least 40 years were everntually shown to have been sourced from a major international illegal antiquities trading network that centred on Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]]. From the late 1960s, Medici rose to become the central figure in  a large criminal conspiracy, acting as the middleman between gangs of ''tombaroli'' (tomb robbers) - who systematically looted tens of thousands of important artefacts from Italian and other Mediterranean archaeological sites, as well as stealing objects from museums, churches and private collections - and an elite group of American and British dealers who helped Medici to \"launder\" his contraband and sell it to major buyers like the Met, the Getty and leading American private collectors.\n\nMedici typically paid the ''tombaroli'' small sums for the looted and stolen goods, and then smuggled them out of Italy to Switzerland, where they were restored. Taking advantage of the lax attitudes and practices of 'cooperative' auction houses - notably Sotheby's in London - Medici built up an elaborate network of front companies and elite antiquities dealers and galleries, including the British dealer [[Robin Symes]], Rome-based American dealer [[Robert E. Hecht]], and Hollywood dealer and producer [[Bruce McNall]]. A major investigation by the TPC (the art crimes division of the [[Carabinieri]]) beginning in the 1990s, which eventually resulted in Medici's conviction, recovered tens of thousands of looted artefacts, and extensive documentary evidence, including thousands of sequential photographs that showed the journey of these looted objects from excavation, through restoration, to their final placement in museum collections, as well as a crucial handwritten 'organigram' (organisational chart) that named and linked all the members of Medici's operation. TPC investigations also revealed that Medici used front companies to anonymously sell and then buy back many items, often multiple times, in order to manipulate the market, as well as allowing him to acquire the all-important Sotheby's provenances. In February 2016, TPC officials announced that a raid on Robin Symes' warehouse in the Geneva Freeport had uncovered a huge collection of 17,000 looted antiquities, nearly all of which are thought to have been sourced from Medici, and which Symes secretly placed there ca. 2000 in order to conceal their existence from the executors of the estate of his former lover and business partner, Christo Michelaides, who died in 1999.\n\n[[File:Euphronios krater side B MET L.2006.10.jpg|right|thumb|[[Euphronios krater]], a 2,500-year-old Greek vase, stolen from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled from Italy, returned to Italy by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2006]]\n\nIn 2006, the Metropolitan Museum of Art finally agreed to relinquish ownership of a 2,500-year-old Greek vase known as the [[Euphronios krater]], a [[krater]] painted by [[Euphronios]], after the TPC was able to establish that the object had been looted from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled out of Italy by the Medici gang. The Met also surrendered 15 pieces of Sicilian silver and four ancient vessels in exchange for long-term loans of other antiquities. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the case, \"of its kind, perhaps second only to the dispute between Greece and Great Britain over the Elgin marbles,\" \"became emblematic of the ethical questions surrounding the acquisition of ancient art by major museums.\"<ref>Randy Kennedy and Hugh Eakin.

February 2, 2006</ref>\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum has been involved in several other major controversies involving antiquities believed or proven to have been looted or stolen, including:\n\n* the [[Cloisters Cross]], a large [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] cross carved from walrus ivory, said to have been carved in England, but possibly made in Germany. It was initially offered to the [[British Museum]] in 1961 by its then owner, a shady Yugoslav 'collector' called [[Ante Topi\u0107 Mimara]], who is now widely believed to have acquired as part of a huge collection of art and antiquities that he stole at the end of WWII from the Central Collecting Point in Munich, the Allied clearinghouse for the repatriation of material looted by the Nazis. The British Museum eventually declined to buy the cross because Topi\u0107 Mimara would not provide proof that he had full title to the object, but immediately after the British Museum's option expired in 1963, the cross was purchased for the Met by curator [[Thomas Hoving]] for GBP\u00a3200,000. The Cross is currently still in the collection of the Met, at its [[Cloisters Museum]] annexe.<ref name=\"Peter Watson 2007 pp.133-146\">Peter Watson; Cecilia Todeschini (2007), ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'' (Public Affairs, NY), pp.133-146</ref>\n* the [[Karun Treasure]], also known as the Lydian Hoard, is a fabulous collection of 200 gold, silver, bronze and earthenware objects, dating from the 7th Century BCE. It formed part of a larger haul of some 450 objects that were looted by local tomb robbers from ancient four royal tombs near [[Sardis]], in Turkey in 1966-67. The contents of the tombs, including painted pieces of the walls, were stripped and sold (via Swiss and American middlemen) to the Metropolitan Museum between 1966 and 1970 for a total of US$1.5 million, but they were kept hidden in storage for more than 20 years. The Treasure was eventually put on display in 1984 in a major exhibition, where it was seen by Turkish journalist \u00d6zgen Acar, who had been investigating the looting of the tombs for many years. Although the Met intentionally mislabeled the objects as part of an \u201cEast Greek treasure,\u201d Acar immediately recognised them as the Lydian artefacts, from the descriptions he had been given by the looters. He alerted the Turkish government, and in 1986, they officially requested the hoard be returned. The Met refused, so Turkey began legal action to recover it.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21761 The History Blog: \"Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found\" (posted 28 November 2012)]</ref> After a six-year legal battle which reportedly cost the Turkish government UK\u00a325 million<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey Constanze Letch, \"King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey\", ''The Guardian'', 26 November 2012]</ref> the case ended dramatically after the minutes of the Met's own acquisition committee revealed that a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects.

Administratively, most of Lantau Island is part of the [[Islands District]] of Hong Kong. A small northeastern portion of the island is located in the [[Tsuen Wan District]].\n\nOriginally the site of fishing villages, the island has been developed in recent years with the construction of [[Tung Chung]] New Town on its north-western coast and the completion of several major infrastructure projects, including [[Lantau Link]] (1997), [[Hong Kong International Airport]] (1998), [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] (2005) and [[Ngong Ping 360]] (2006).\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Tung Chung overlook.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tung Chung]] New Town and [[Tung Chung Bay]] seen from the [[Ngong Ping 360]] cableway.]]\n[[File:Sunset Hill view 201511.jpg|thumb|left|[[Miscanthus]] in [[Sunset Peak, Hong Kong|Sunset Peak]] attract many people to come during November to January]]\nWith a land mass of {{convert|147.16|sqkm|2|abbr=out}}, it is the largest [[List of islands and peninsulas of Hong Kong|island in Hong Kong]],<ref name=\"mapping\">{{Citation |author=Lands Department |title=Hong Kong Geographic Data |date=February 2011 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-04-29 |url=http://www.landsd.gov.hk/mapping/en/publications/hk_geographic_data_sheet.pdf}}</ref> almost twice the size of [[Hong Kong Island]].\nLantau Island primarily consists of mountainous terrain.

The largest country park of Hong Kong, [[Lantau South Country Park]] is located on the island, which hosts two other parks, namely [[Lantau North Country Park]] and [[Lantau North (Extension) Country Park|its extension]]. These parks cover slightly more than half of the area of Lantau Island.\n\n[[Shek Pik Reservoir]] is the third largest freshwater [[Reservoirs of Hong Kong|reservoir in Hong Kong]].

The completion of the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] at [[Chek Lap Kok]] in 1998 has led to economic development in north-western Lantau; the once quiet village of [[Tung Chung]] became a [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]] and is now home to over 45,000 people located in 30 to 50 storey high-rise housing estates and condominiums located near the airport. The neighbouring [[Yat Tung Estate]] houses 37,273 people, primarily in public housing.

The resistance centred on two young princes, Emperor Gong's brothers. The older boy [[Emperor Duanzong of Song|Zhao Shi]], was declared emperor at the age of nine, ascending the throne as Emperor Duanzong of Song. In 1277, the imperial court sought refuge first in Silvermine Bay ([[Mui Wo]]) on Lantau Island (then known as Gangzhou ({{zh|t=\u7899\u5dde|labels=no}}), and later in today's [[Kowloon City]]. The older brother became ill, died, and was succeeded by the younger brother [[Zhao Bing]] (Emperor Bing of Song) at the age of seven. He died in 1279, and the Song Dynasty ended. These emperors are also believed to have held court in the [[Tung Chung]] valley, which takes its name from a local hero who gave up his life for the emperor.\n\nLantau Island and [[Tuen Mun]] were among the first European trading settlements in the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] area, established by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders in the 1510s. The Portuguese abandoned these settlements in around  1517, following their defeat by Chinese troops.<ref>{{Cite book|last=\u5f90\u627f\u6069|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=nV30CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=%E5%A4%A7%E5%B6%BC%E5%B1%B1+1517%E5%B9%B4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN6N-C8uDoAhXFc94KHarCAIwQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=%E5%A4%A7%E5%B6%BC%E5%B1%B1%201517%E5%B9%B4&f=false|title=\u57ce\u90a6\u820a\u4e8b: \u5341\u4e8c\u672c\u66f8\u770b\u9999\u6e2f\u672c\u571f\u53f2 (\u4fee\u8a02\u7248)|date=2016-03-01|publisher=Red Publish|isbn=978-988-8380-38-1|language=zh-TW}}</ref> Lantau was visited in 1607 by one of the early Dutch East India Company (VOC) fleet commanders Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge who describes his visit to the local \"mandarin\".

Five villages were subsequently resettled: Tai O, Tung Sai Chung, Lo Pui O, Shek Pik and Mui Wo.<ref name=\"Records\"/>\n\nSalt was illegally produced in Lantau island. This was discovered by the Chinese rulers during the 16th century, and the local warlord put many islanders to death as a result.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nLike [[Cheung Chau]], Lantau was once a base for pirates and smugglers, and was one of the haunts of [[Cheung Po Tsai]] in the 19th century. Silver [[Mining in Hong Kong|was mined]] at Mui Wo until the 19th century.\n\nLantau was a major site of resistance against the Japanese during the second world war. The resistance movement made use of the island's wooded areas and deep valleys in order to organise ambushes and move supplies. The resistance movement persevered through the war until the end of the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]] in 1945.\n\nIn 2000, Lantau Island acted as an important base for the [[Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe]] project and the [[APCN (cable system)|Asia-Pacific Cable Network]] which acts as an Internet bridge to the rest of the world.\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n[[File:Lantau Peak, Hongkong.jpg|thumb|[[Tian Tan Buddha]] with [[Lantau Peak]] in the background.]]\n[[File:Tai O (8).JPG|thumb|Stilt houses ([[pang uk]]) in [[Tai O]].]]\n[[File:Yeunghautemple2.JPG|thumb|The [[Hau Wong|Yeung Hau Temple]] in [[Tai O]] was built in 1699.]]\nGood place to visit you should go I reccomend\n\n===Tai O===\n[[Tai O]] is a fishing village located in the northwest of Lantau Island which is more than three centuries old. Tourists visit Tai O for its several hundred stilt houses (''[[pang uk]]''), though some of those houses have been repaired after a fire in July 2000 and others from damage caused by super typhoons and related storm surges in subsequent years. While Tai O is in the process of being revitalised with a series of measures such as new signages and two bridges to facilitate movement of visitors, Tai O retains most of its historical setting such as waterways, stilt houses and fishing boats and is famous for its fishing village scenery in a mountainous setting. Traditional [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese food]] like [[Salt-cured meat|salted fish]] and locally produced [[shrimp paste]] can be found there.\n\n===Tung Chung===\n[[Tung Chung Fort]] was built in 1817 to thwart the [[opium]] trade and defend the coast from [[pirate]]s. There are 6 old cannons and the enclosures are made of [[granite]]. During [[World War II]], the [[Japan]]ese army occupied the fort. In 1979, it was listed as one of the [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong|historical monuments]] of Hong Kong and was refurbished in 1988. The ruins of the [[Tung Chung Battery]], also a historical monument, are located nearby.\n\n===Trappist Haven Monastery===\nThe [[Trappist Haven Monastery]] at Tai Shui Hang, home to a number of [[Roman Catholic]] monks, sits on the east coast of Lantau Island, approximately halfway between the towns of Mui Wo and Discovery Bay. The Lantau [[Trappists|Trappist]] congregation was established in [[Beijing]] in the 19th century.\n\n===Hong Kong Disneyland===\n[[Hong Kong Disneyland]] lies on the northeastern part of the island, approximately two kilometres from Discovery Bay. It opened on 12 September 2005 on a massive [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|land reclamation]] project in [[Penny's Bay]]. The US$1.8 billion project includes a Disney [[theme park]], three hotels, and retail, dining and entertainment facilities stretching over 1.26&nbsp;km\u00b2 (310 acres). The project also has its own rail network linking from [[Sunny Bay (MTR)|Sunny Bay MTR station]] in [[Yam O]].\n\n===Nature===\nOver 50% of Lantau consists of national parks, including a large number of well-marked trails. The best known of these is the 70 kilometre, 12 section [[Lantau Trail]] composed of beauty of natural stone steps and the dense woodland along a 3-kilometer stretch. Section 11 of the Lantau Trail starts just across the [[Tung Chung Road]], which is not far from Ngong Ping 360. This section of the trail will reach South Lantau Road at Pui O and hikers can appreciate the beauty of natural stone steps and the dense woodland along the 3&nbsp;km journey.<ref>[http://www.np360.com.hk/en/lantau-outdoor-fun/land/lantau-trail.html Lantau Island] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022024353/http://www.np360.com.hk/en/lantau-outdoor-fun/land/lantau-trail.html |date=22 October 2015 }} Lantau Island</ref> The national parks feature campsites and youth hostels.

It is located off the north coast of Lantau, near the new town of [[Tung Chung]] and is connected to urban areas by the [[Lantau Link]], which is composed of the [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge]], the [[Ma Wan Viaduct]], and the [[Tsing Ma Bridge]].\n\n===Rail===\nThe airport also has a [[rapid transit|metro]] rail connection to the rest of Hong Kong via the [[MTR]]'s [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]], along with several [[bus]] routes. This was built in the 1990s, whilst the new airport was being built. Using the Airport Express, the journey time between [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Hong Kong's business district, and [[Airport Station (MTR)|Chep Lap Kok airport]] is 23 minutes (though the Airport Express doesn't make any stops in Lantau proper). In addition, one can reach [[Tung Chung Station|Tung Chung]] by train on the [[Tung Chung Line]] of the MTR, and the [[Disneyland Resort Line]] branches off of the Tung Chung Line at [[Sunny Bay Station]], serving the [[Disneyland Resort Station]] at [[Hong Kong Disneyland Resort]].\n\n===Water transport===\nTourists can get to Lantau using [[ferry]] services provided by [[New World First Ferry]]. This ferry service is available between Mui Wo and Central with a transportation time of about 30 to 50 minutes, depending on the vessel. A 24-hour ferry service operated by [[HKR International Limited]] connects Pier 3 in Central to [[Discovery Bay]] with a transportation time of 25 minutes.\n\nThere are also several smaller inter-island ferry services linking neighbouring islands and the mainland. These ferries, known locally as [[kai-to]]s (pronounced ''Guy-doe'') provide scheduled services. These include [[Nim Shue Wan]]; adjacent to [[Discovery Bay]], and [[Peng Chau]] Island with a stopover at the [[Trappist Haven Monastery]] on Lantau, [[Nim Shue Wan]] and [[Mui Wo]] on Lantau. Other Kai-To and ferry services link [[Peng Chau]], [[Mui Wo]] Lantau, [[Chi Ma Wan]] Lantau, and [[Cheung Chau]] Island, and another links [[Tuen Mun]], [[Tung Chung]], [[Sha Lo Wan]], and [[Tai O]].\n\nTravel between islands is also possible by [[Walla-walla|''walla walla'']], a traditional water [[taxicab|taxi]], typically from nearby [[Cheung Chau]] Island.\n\n===Road transport===\nResidents and tourists can travel within Lantau Island either by taxi or bus. The [[New Lantao Bus]] provides major bus services within the island, where one can get to Tai O and Po Lin Monastery from Mui Wo pier. Some of the roads and bridges were built in the 1990s, whilst the new airport was being built.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there are [[Taxicabs of Hong Kong|three types of taxis]]. Red taxis serve the urban areas, green taxis serve the [[New Territories]] while taxis on Lantau Island are blue in colour. All three taxi services can ply for passengers at the Airport and Tung Chung, but only the blue taxis can take passengers to other locations on Lantau Island. There are 75 blue taxis serving the Lantau Island area. (25 added in 2016)\n\nThe southern part of Lantau Island are the most dangerous roads in all of Hong Kong {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}due to the narrow and hilly roads that are inaccessible to buses with lack of [[safety barrier]]s. From February, 2016, owners of private vehicles that wish to travel to these roads must obtain a temporary permit. However, due to the dangerous roads, the permit only lasts from 8am-7pm, only has 25 allotments, and only available on weekdays, while residents of these areas must obtain a permanent permit.<ref>TVB - \u201cScoop\u201d 25-3-2016</ref>\n\n===Cable car===\nThe [[Ngong Ping 360]], a [[gondola lift]], is located on Lantau and is operated by the MTR. Opened in mid-September 2006, this provides a 5.7&nbsp;km 20 minute gondola cableway journey between [[Tung Chung]] and [[Ngong Ping]].\n\n== Proposed development ==\nThe Lantau Development Advisory Committee (LanDAC) was formed within the [[Development Bureau]] to advise the government on Lantau Island's development potential. The committee first met in 2014. Save Lantau Alliance, an activist group opposed to large-scale development of the island, called on the council members to disclose their conflicts of interest. Numerous members hold business interests on the island, including 10 non-official members who subsequently declared interests ranging from running the [[AsiaWorld\u2013Expo]] events centre (Allen Ha) to holding directorships at major developers with land holdings in and around Lantau (Andrew Lam of [[Shui On Land]], Randy Yu of [[Sino Land]], Ivan Chu of [[Swire]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Declared interests from the Lantau Development Advisory Committee|work=South China Morning Post|date=27 June 2014|page=C15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Fung|first1=Fanny W.Y.|last2=Cheung|first2=Chi-fai|title=Government development adviser's family owns land on Lantau|work=South China Morning Post|date=15 May 2014|page=C4}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the first meeting of the LanDAC, development chief [[Paul Chan Mo-po]] told the press that the government would not rule out developing country parks. LanDAC member Wu Chi-wai stated publicly that the committee was ignoring a 2007 concept plan for Lantau, developed with public consultation, and spoke against developing the country parks. [[Lam Chiu Ying]], conservationist and former head of the [[Hong Kong Observatory]], responded that Chan's remarks were \"unacceptable\" and stated, \"while other cities are aiming for an increase (in greenery), we are doing the opposite. It's ridiculous.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nip|first1=Amy|title=Development in Lantau country parks not ruled out, Paul Chan says|work=South China Morning Post|date=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe committee's first report, a 33-page document entitled \"Space for All\", was discreetly released online on 10 January 2016.<ref name=disneyscmp/> Only a Chinese version of the full report was released, with an English synopsis provided.

Administratively, most of Lantau Island is part of the [[Islands District]] of Hong Kong. A small northeastern portion of the island is located in the [[Tsuen Wan District]].\n\nOriginally the site of fishing villages, the island has been developed in recent years with the construction of [[Tung Chung]] New Town on its north-western coast and the completion of several major infrastructure projects, including [[Lantau Link]] (1997), [[Hong Kong International Airport]] (1998), [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] (2005) and [[Ngong Ping 360]] (2006).\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Tung Chung overlook.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tung Chung]] New Town and [[Tung Chung Bay]] seen from the [[Ngong Ping 360]] cableway.]]\n[[File:Sunset Hill view 201511.jpg|thumb|left|[[Miscanthus]] in [[Sunset Peak, Hong Kong|Sunset Peak]] attract many people to come during November to January]]\nWith a land mass of {{convert|147.16|sqkm|2|abbr=out}}, it is the largest [[List of islands and peninsulas of Hong Kong|island in Hong Kong]],<ref name=\"mapping\">{{Citation |author=Lands Department |title=Hong Kong Geographic Data |date=February 2011 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-04-29 |url=http://www.landsd.gov.hk/mapping/en/publications/hk_geographic_data_sheet.pdf}}</ref> almost twice the size of [[Hong Kong Island]].\nLantau Island primarily consists of mountainous terrain.

The largest country park of Hong Kong, [[Lantau South Country Park]] is located on the island, which hosts two other parks, namely [[Lantau North Country Park]] and [[Lantau North (Extension) Country Park|its extension]]. These parks cover slightly more than half of the area of Lantau Island.\n\n[[Shek Pik Reservoir]] is the third largest freshwater [[Reservoirs of Hong Kong|reservoir in Hong Kong]]. Completed in 1963, it covers an area of {{convert|1.01|km2|1|abbr=on}} and has a capacity of {{convert|24,500,000|m3|-3|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"mapping\"/>\n\nFan Lau Kok at the end of [[Fan Lau]] Peninsula is the southwest end of the territory of Hong Kong. The small island of [[Peaked Hill]], off Tsin Yue Wan ({{zh|t=\u714e\u9b5a\u7063|labels=no}}), marks the westernmost point on the land of Hong Kong territories.\n\n==Population==\nLantau Island has a relatively low population density.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Settlements are scattered throughout the island and each has its own distinctive characteristics. The completion of the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] at [[Chek Lap Kok]] in 1998 has led to economic development in north-western Lantau; the once quiet village of [[Tung Chung]] became a [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]] and is now home to over 45,000 people located in 30 to 50 storey high-rise housing estates and condominiums located near the airport. The neighbouring [[Yat Tung Estate]] houses 37,273 people, primarily in public housing. Over the next few years, the population of the [[North Lantau New Town]] is expected to increase to a target population of over 200,000 across {{convert|7.6|km2|1|abbr=on}} of [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclaimed land]] stretching from Tung Chung to [[Tai Ho Wan]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Discovery Bay===\n[[Discovery Bay]] is a privately owned residential development located on the south-eastern coast of Lantau.

The resistance centred on two young princes, Emperor Gong's brothers. The older boy [[Emperor Duanzong of Song|Zhao Shi]], was declared emperor at the age of nine, ascending the throne as Emperor Duanzong of Song. In 1277, the imperial court sought refuge first in Silvermine Bay ([[Mui Wo]]) on Lantau Island (then known as Gangzhou ({{zh|t=\u7899\u5dde|labels=no}}), and later in today's [[Kowloon City]]. The older brother became ill, died, and was succeeded by the younger brother [[Zhao Bing]] (Emperor Bing of Song) at the age of seven. He died in 1279, and the Song Dynasty ended. These emperors are also believed to have held court in the [[Tung Chung]] valley, which takes its name from a local hero who gave up his life for the emperor.\n\nLantau Island and [[Tuen Mun]] were among the first European trading settlements in the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] area, established by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders in the 1510s. The Portuguese abandoned these settlements in around  1517, following their defeat by Chinese troops.<ref>{{Cite book|last=\u5f90\u627f\u6069|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=nV30CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=%E5%A4%A7%E5%B6%BC%E5%B1%B1+1517%E5%B9%B4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN6N-C8uDoAhXFc94KHarCAIwQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=%E5%A4%A7%E5%B6%BC%E5%B1%B1%201517%E5%B9%B4&f=false|title=\u57ce\u90a6\u820a\u4e8b: \u5341\u4e8c\u672c\u66f8\u770b\u9999\u6e2f\u672c\u571f\u53f2 (\u4fee\u8a02\u7248)|date=2016-03-01|publisher=Red Publish|isbn=978-988-8380-38-1|language=zh-TW}}</ref> Lantau was visited in 1607 by one of the early Dutch East India Company (VOC) fleet commanders Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge who describes his visit to the local \"mandarin\".

This was discovered by the Chinese rulers during the 16th century, and the local warlord put many islanders to death as a result.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nLike [[Cheung Chau]], Lantau was once a base for pirates and smugglers, and was one of the haunts of [[Cheung Po Tsai]] in the 19th century. Silver [[Mining in Hong Kong|was mined]] at Mui Wo until the 19th century.\n\nLantau was a major site of resistance against the Japanese during the second world war. The resistance movement made use of the island's wooded areas and deep valleys in order to organise ambushes and move supplies. The resistance movement persevered through the war until the end of the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]] in 1945.\n\nIn 2000, Lantau Island acted as an important base for the [[Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe]] project and the [[APCN (cable system)|Asia-Pacific Cable Network]] which acts as an Internet bridge to the rest of the world.\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n[[File:Lantau Peak, Hongkong.jpg|thumb|[[Tian Tan Buddha]] with [[Lantau Peak]] in the background.]]\n[[File:Tai O (8).JPG|thumb|Stilt houses ([[pang uk]]) in [[Tai O]].]]\n[[File:Yeunghautemple2.JPG|thumb|The [[Hau Wong|Yeung Hau Temple]] in [[Tai O]] was built in 1699.]]\n===Ngong Ping===\nThe [[Ngong Ping]] Plateau features the [[Po Lin Monastery]] and its vegetarian restaurant, as well as the {{convert|85|ft|m|adj=on}}-high [[Bronze sculpture|bronze]] [[Tian Tan Buddha]] (or \"Giant Buddha\") statue, once the world's largest seated outdoor bronze Buddha statue.<ref>Lantau Island, Po Lin Monastery, Big Buddha, Temple\nhttp://www.hong-kong-travel.org/Po-Lin-Monastery/</ref> Walkers can ascend from Tung Chung to the monastery in two hours. Visitors can also take a 25-minute ride on a [[Ngong Ping 360]] from Tung Chung to the Ngong Ping Plateau. Ngong Ping 360 is a tourism experience which combines a 5.7&nbsp;km cable car journey with a cultural themed village and easy access to the Tian Tan Buddha Statue.\n\n===Tai O===\n[[Tai O]] is a fishing village located in the northwest of Lantau Island which is more than three centuries old. Tourists visit Tai O for its several hundred stilt houses (''[[pang uk]]''), though some of those houses have been repaired after a fire in July 2000 and others from damage caused by super typhoons and related storm surges in subsequent years. While Tai O is in the process of being revitalised with a series of measures such as new signages and two bridges to facilitate movement of visitors, Tai O retains most of its historical setting such as waterways, stilt houses and fishing boats and is famous for its fishing village scenery in a mountainous setting. Traditional [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese food]] like [[Salt-cured meat|salted fish]] and locally produced [[shrimp paste]] can be found there.\n\n===Tung Chung===\n[[Tung Chung Fort]] was built in 1817 to thwart the [[opium]] trade and defend the coast from [[pirate]]s. There are 6 old cannons and the enclosures are made of [[granite]]. During [[World War II]], the [[Japan]]ese army occupied the fort. In 1979, it was listed as one of the [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong|historical monuments]] of Hong Kong and was refurbished in 1988. The ruins of the [[Tung Chung Battery]], also a historical monument, are located nearby.\n\n===Trappist Haven Monastery===\nThe [[Trappist Haven Monastery]] at Tai Shui Hang, home to a number of [[Roman Catholic]] monks, sits on the east coast of Lantau Island, approximately halfway between the towns of Mui Wo and Discovery Bay. The Lantau [[Trappists|Trappist]] congregation was established in [[Beijing]] in the 19th century.\n\n===Hong Kong Disneyland===\n[[Hong Kong Disneyland]] lies on the northeastern part of the island, approximately two kilometres from Discovery Bay. It opened on 12 September 2005 on a massive [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|land reclamation]] project in [[Penny's Bay]]. The US$1.8 billion project includes a Disney [[theme park]], three hotels, and retail, dining and entertainment facilities stretching over 1.26&nbsp;km\u00b2 (310 acres). The project also has its own rail network linking from [[Sunny Bay (MTR)|Sunny Bay MTR station]] in [[Yam O]].\n\n===Nature===\nOver 50% of Lantau consists of national parks, including a large number of well-marked trails. The best known of these is the 70 kilometre, 12 section [[Lantau Trail]] composed of beauty of natural stone steps and the dense woodland along a 3-kilometer stretch. Section 11 of the Lantau Trail starts just across the [[Tung Chung Road]], which is not far from Ngong Ping 360. This section of the trail will reach South Lantau Road at Pui O and hikers can appreciate the beauty of natural stone steps and the dense woodland along the 3&nbsp;km journey.<ref>[http://www.np360.com.hk/en/lantau-outdoor-fun/land/lantau-trail.html Lantau Island] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022024353/http://www.np360.com.hk/en/lantau-outdoor-fun/land/lantau-trail.html |date=22 October 2015 }} Lantau Island</ref> The national parks feature campsites and youth hostels. Lantau's longest beach is [[Beaches of Hong Kong|Cheung Sha]] and one of its most famous hikes is to [[Sunset Peak (Hong Kong)|Sunset Peak]] (Tai Tung Shan {{zh|t=\u5927\u6771\u5c71|labels=no}}), the third highest peak in Hong Kong.<ref>Serious Hike: Sunset Peak on Lantau Island (Mui Wo/Pui O to Pak Kung Au) | hkfiles https://hkfiles.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/serious-hike-sunset-peak-on-lantau-island-mui-wopui-o-to-pak-kung-au/</ref>\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n[[File:Chinese white dolphin.jpg|thumb|Adult [[Chinese white dolphin]] swimming off the coast of Lantau Island]]\n[[Chinese white dolphin]]s, often called ''pink dolphins'', can be seen off the coast of Lantau. {{As of|2014}}, a [[Marine parks in Hong Kong|marine park]], the Southwest Lantau Marine Park, is being planned to protect them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201409/01/P201409010318.htm |title=Southwest Lantau Marine Park and Soko Islands Marine Park |date=1 September 2014 |website= |publisher=Hong Kong Government Press Release |accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> In the southern parts of Lantau Island, local residents rely on local oyster fields, lemon and tangerine trees to make preserved fruits.

The entire southern part of Lantau Island has a well-established eco-system<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a98mKowEQCI RTHK TV: Hong Kong Connection - 2016-4-17]</ref>\n\n==Prisons==\nThere are [[Hong Kong Correctional Services|six prisons]] on Lantau Island: [[Chi Ma Wan]] Correctional Institution, Chi Sun Correctional Institution (formerly the Chi Ma Wan Drug Addiction Treatment Centre), Ma Mo Ping Prison, Tong Fuk centre west of [[Tong Fuk]], Sha Tsui Detention Centre and the maximum security Shek Pik Prison, both located near [[Shek Pik Reservoir]]. Plans were put forward by the government to build an enormous \"Super Prison\" on the sparsely populated nearby island of [[Hei Ling Chau]], to be connected by a bridge to [[Mui Wo]]. However, this plan was indefinitely shelved after organised resistance by local residents.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Lantau MR route map 2010.png|thumb|MTR route map in the Lantau Island area.]]\n[[File:Discovery-Bay.jpg|thumb|right|Ferry in [[Discovery Bay]].]]\n[[File:HK Lantau Island Taxi.jpg|thumb|right|Blue Lantau taxi in Tung Chung.]]\n[[File:Hong Kong Ngong IMG 5664.JPG|thumb|[[Ngong Ping 360]] across [[Tung Chung Bay]].]]\n===Airport===\n[[Hong Kong International Airport]] (HKG/HKIA) is located on [[Chek Lap Kok]] island and started service in July 1998. It is located off the north coast of Lantau, near the new town of [[Tung Chung]] and is connected to urban areas by the [[Lantau Link]], which is composed of the [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge]], the [[Ma Wan Viaduct]], and the [[Tsing Ma Bridge]].\n\n===Rail===\nThe airport also has a [[rapid transit|metro]] rail connection to the rest of Hong Kong via the [[MTR]]'s [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]], along with several [[bus]] routes. This was built in the 1990s, whilst the new airport was being built. Using the Airport Express, the journey time between [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Hong Kong's business district, and [[Airport Station (MTR)|Chep Lap Kok airport]] is 23 minutes (though the Airport Express doesn't make any stops in Lantau proper). In addition, one can reach [[Tung Chung Station|Tung Chung]] by train on the [[Tung Chung Line]] of the MTR, and the [[Disneyland Resort Line]] branches off of the Tung Chung Line at [[Sunny Bay Station]], serving the [[Disneyland Resort Station]] at [[Hong Kong Disneyland Resort]].\n\n===Water transport===\nTourists can get to Lantau using [[ferry]] services provided by [[New World First Ferry]]. This ferry service is available between Mui Wo and Central with a transportation time of about 30 to 50 minutes, depending on the vessel. A 24-hour ferry service operated by [[HKR International Limited]] connects Pier 3 in Central to [[Discovery Bay]] with a transportation time of 25 minutes.\n\nThere are also several smaller inter-island ferry services linking neighbouring islands and the mainland. These ferries, known locally as [[kai-to]]s (pronounced ''Guy-doe'') provide scheduled services. These include [[Nim Shue Wan]]; adjacent to [[Discovery Bay]], and [[Peng Chau]] Island with a stopover at the [[Trappist Haven Monastery]] on Lantau, [[Nim Shue Wan]] and [[Mui Wo]] on Lantau. Other Kai-To and ferry services link [[Peng Chau]], [[Mui Wo]] Lantau, [[Chi Ma Wan]] Lantau, and [[Cheung Chau]] Island, and another links [[Tuen Mun]], [[Tung Chung]], [[Sha Lo Wan]], and [[Tai O]].\n\nTravel between islands is also possible by [[Walla-walla|''walla walla'']], a traditional water [[taxicab|taxi]], typically from nearby [[Cheung Chau]] Island.\n\n===Road transport===\nResidents and tourists can travel within Lantau Island either by taxi or bus. The [[New Lantao Bus]] provides major bus services within the island, where one can get to Tai O and Po Lin Monastery from Mui Wo pier. Some of the roads and bridges were built in the 1990s, whilst the new airport was being built.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there are [[Taxicabs of Hong Kong|three types of taxis]]. Red taxis serve the urban areas, green taxis serve the [[New Territories]] while taxis on Lantau Island are blue in colour. All three taxi services can ply for passengers at the Airport and Tung Chung, but only the blue taxis can take passengers to other locations on Lantau Island. There are 75 blue taxis serving the Lantau Island area. (25 added in 2016)\n\nThe southern part of Lantau Island are the most dangerous roads in all of Hong Kong {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}due to the narrow and hilly roads that are inaccessible to buses with lack of [[safety barrier]]s. From February, 2016, owners of private vehicles that wish to travel to these roads must obtain a temporary permit. However, due to the dangerous roads, the permit only lasts from 8am-7pm, only has 25 allotments, and only available on weekdays, while residents of these areas must obtain a permanent permit.<ref>TVB - \u201cScoop\u201d 25-3-2016</ref>\n\n===Cable car===\nThe [[Ngong Ping 360]], a [[gondola lift]], is located on Lantau and is operated by the MTR. Opened in mid-September 2006, this provides a 5.7&nbsp;km 20 minute gondola cableway journey between [[Tung Chung]] and [[Ngong Ping]].\n\n== Proposed development ==\nThe Lantau Development Advisory Committee (LanDAC) was formed within the [[Development Bureau]] to advise the government on Lantau Island's development potential. The committee first met in 2014. Save Lantau Alliance, an activist group opposed to large-scale development of the island, called on the council members to disclose their conflicts of interest. Numerous members hold business interests on the island, including 10 non-official members who subsequently declared interests ranging from running the [[AsiaWorld\u2013Expo]] events centre (Allen Ha) to holding directorships at major developers with land holdings in and around Lantau (Andrew Lam of [[Shui On Land]], Randy Yu of [[Sino Land]], Ivan Chu of [[Swire]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Declared interests from the Lantau Development Advisory Committee|work=South China Morning Post|date=27 June 2014|page=C15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Fung|first1=Fanny W.Y.|last2=Cheung|first2=Chi-fai|title=Government development adviser's family owns land on Lantau|work=South China Morning Post|date=15 May 2014|page=C4}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the first meeting of the LanDAC, development chief [[Paul Chan Mo-po]] told the press that the government would not rule out developing country parks. LanDAC member Wu Chi-wai stated publicly that the committee was ignoring a 2007 concept plan for Lantau, developed with public consultation, and spoke against developing the country parks. [[Lam Chiu Ying]], conservationist and former head of the [[Hong Kong Observatory]], responded that Chan's remarks were \"unacceptable\" and stated, \"while other cities are aiming for an increase (in greenery), we are doing the opposite. It's ridiculous.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nip|first1=Amy|title=Development in Lantau country parks not ruled out, Paul Chan says|work=South China Morning Post|date=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe committee's first report, a 33-page document entitled \"Space for All\", was discreetly released online on 10 January 2016.<ref name=disneyscmp/> Only a Chinese version of the full report was released, with an English synopsis provided.
