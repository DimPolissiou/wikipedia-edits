The discovery of nerves growing everywhere like a halo around the tumor cells was surprising.

But nerves did not grow into the arteries, which would flow from the embryo back to the tumor. This suggested to Montalcini that the tumor itself was releasing a substance that was stimulating the growth of nerves.\n\nShe was made a full professor in 1958.

The discovery of nerves growing everywhere like a halo around the tumor cells was surprising.

But nerves did not grow into the arteries, which would flow from the embryo back to the tumor. This suggested to Montalcini that the tumor itself was releasing a substance that was stimulating the growth of nerves.\n\nShe was made a full professor in 1958. In 1962, she established a second laboratory in [[Rome]] and divided her time between there and St. Louis.

wikidata|name}} City''', is a {{PH wikidata|income_class_ordinal}} [[{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}} It is geographically located at Metro Manila's approximate center and is also the country's [[Cities of the Philippines#List of cities|smallest city in terms of land area]].\n\nThe city is known historically for the site of the first battle of the [[Katipunan]], the organization which led the 1896 [[Philippine Revolution]] against the [[Spanish Empire]]. Notable landmarks today such as [[Pinaglabanan Shrine]] and heritage homes are located in the city. Other locations include [[Greenhills (mixed-use development)|Greenhills]] and [[Bonny Serrano Avenue|Santolan]] Town Plaza, making the city a major shopping hub with a range of upscale, boutique and bargain retail.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/short-sweet-historical-tour-san-juan-city/117710/|title=A short and sweet historical tour of San Juan City - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n\"San Juan City\" is a contraction of the city's traditional name of \"'''San Juan del Monte'''\" ({{literal translation|Saint John of the Mountain}}). As with numerous other places in the Philippines, the name combines a [[patron saint]] and a [[toponym]]; in this case Saint [[John the Baptist]] with the locale's hilly terrain and relatively higher elevation compared to surrounding areas.\n\nThe city's official name is \"Dakilang Lungs\u00f3d ng San Juan\" ({{literal translation|Great City of San Juan}}).\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Hispanic period]], the area of what is now San Juan was a part of the [[Kingdom of Namayan]], whose last recorded rulers were King Lacantagean and his [[Queen consort|consort]], Bouan. After the kingdom and other polities in the islands were absorbed into the [[Spanish Crown]] in the late 16th century, the realm of Namayan was christened ''[[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana de Sapa]]''. The present area of San Juan was meanwhile re-classified as a ''[[barrio]]'', becoming a small ''[[encomienda]]'' by 1590.\n\nIn 1602, the [[Order of Preachers|Dominicans]] built a retreat house in the vicinity for their immediate use, where ageing or convalescing friars stayed. Later, the Order constructed a convent and stone church dedicated to the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]]. To this day, the thrice-rebuilt [[Santuario del Santo Cristo]] stands on the same site, adjacent to Aquinas School and Dominican College.\n[[File:El Deposito, dep\u00f3sito de agua de Manila.png|left|thumb|200x200px|[[El Deposito]], 1900]]\nIn 1783, San Juan was partitioned from Santa Ana but was still a ''barrio'' within the [[Manila (province)|Province of Manila]]. The [[El Deposito]] [[reservoir]] was historically known as the site where the onset of the [[Philippine Revolution]] through the [[Battle of San Juan del Monte]] took place in 1896.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nhcp.gov.ph/pinaglabanan-memorial-shrine/|title=National Historical Commission of the Philippines official website|website=Pinaglabanan Memorial Shrine}}</ref> The opening salvo against [[Spain]] took place in San Juan in 1897 when the [[Katipunan]] attacked the ''alamac\u00e9n'' (armoury) or ''polvor\u00edn'' (gunpowder magazine) of the [[Spanish East Indies]] colonial government. The town was later incorporated into the [[Province of Rizal]] in 1901 under [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)#U.S. military government|American military rule]].\n\nOn 7 November 1975, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed Presidential Decree No. 824 that established the [[National Capital Region (Philippines)|National Capital Region]], and San Juan was among the towns excised from Rizal Province. Residents ratified the conversion of the municipality into a highly urbanised city on 17 June 2007, pursuant to Republic Act No. 9388 (\"An Act Converting the Municipality of San Juan into a Highly Urbanized City to be known as the City of San Juan\"). Then [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congressman]] Ronaldo B. Zamora sponsored the Cityhood Bill in the House of Representatives and worked for its approval.<ref>[http://www.op.gov.ph/directives/RA09388.pdf Republic Act No. 9388 - Charter of the City of San Juan]</ref>\n\nIn 2020, San Juan and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n=== Presidential ties ===\nAlthough not officially designated as such, San Juan is noted to be the \"City of Philippine Presidents.\" Four presidents since the [[History of the Philippines (1946-1965)|Third Republic]] were official residents of San Juan when they assumed office. They were the Macapagal ''p\u00e8re et fille'', [[Diosdado Macapagal|Diosdado Sr.]] (1961\u20131965) and [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Gloria Arroyo]] (2001\u20132010); [[Ferdinand Marcos]] (1965\u20131986); and [[Joseph Estrada]] (1998\u20132001), who also served as Mayor when San Juan was still a municipality.\n\n==Geography==\nSan Juan is the least-extensive city in the Philippines with a total area of just {{convert|595|ha|sqmi}}.\n\nSan Juan is bounded by [[Quezon City]] on the north and east, [[Mandaluyong]] on the south, and the [[City of Manila]] in the west.\n\nThe territory of San Juan was once much larger than it is now, extending all the way to what is now [[Caloocan City]]. Parts of the present-day Districts 1, 4 and 6 of [[Quezon City]] as well as areas of [[Mandaluyong]] were originally within the town's colonial-era borders. This also explains why San Juan Reservoir is in nearby Horseshoe Village, a subdivision now part of Quezon City.\n\n===Barangays===\nSan Juan is politically subdivided into 21 [[barangay]]s:\n\n[[File:Ph fil san juan.png|thumb|upright=1.1|{{center|'''Political map of San Juan'''}}]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:95%;\" width=50%\n|-\n!District 1\n!District 2\n|-\n|\n* [[Balong\u2013Bato]]\n* [[Batis, San Juan|Batis]]\n* [[Corazon de Jes\u00fas, San Juan|Corazon de Jes\u00fas]]\n* [[Ermita\u00f1o, San Juan|Ermita\u00f1o]]\n* [[Pasade\u00f1a, San Juan|Pasade\u00f1a]]\n* [[Pedro Cruz, San Juan|Pedro Cruz]]\n* [[Progreso, San Juan|Progreso]]\n* [[Rivera, San Juan|Rivera]]\n* [[Salap\u00e1n, San Juan|Salapan]]\n* [[San Perfecto, San Juan|San Perfecto]]\n|\n* [[Addition Hills, San Juan|Addition Hills]]\n* [[Greenhills (barangay)|Greenhills]]\n* [[Isabelita, San Juan|Isabelita]]\n* [[Kabayanan]]\n* [[Little Baguio]]\n* [[Maytunas, San Juan|Maytunas]]\n* [[Onse, San Juan|Onse]]\n* [[Saint Joseph, San Juan|Saint Joseph]]\n* [[Santa Lucia, San Juan|Santa Lucia]]\n* [[Tibagan]]\n* [[West Crame]]\n|}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of San Juan\n| 1903 = 1455\n| 1918 = 6172\n| 1939 = 18870\n| 1948 = 31493\n| 1960 = 56861\n| 1970 = 104559\n| 1975 = 122492\n| 1980 = 130088\n| 1990 = 126854\n| 1995 = 124187\n| 2000 = 117680\n| 2007 = 125338\n| 2010 = 121430\n| 2015 = 122180\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n===Religion===\nThe city also has several notable places of worship. [[St. John the Baptist Church (San Juan, Philippines)|Saint John the Baptist Parish]], more commonly known as \"''Pinaglabanan'' Church\", is where the city's patron saint, [[John the Baptist]], is enshrined. The [[Santuario del Santo Cristo]] is the settlement's oldest existing church, while Mary the Queen Parish in West Greenhills serves the local [[Filipino-Chinese]] community.\n\nFrom 1925\u20131971, the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] once headquartered in the town at its former Central Office Complex, now known as the Locale of F. Manalo. It features Art-Deco designed ensembles, crafted by [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist for Architecture]] [[Juan Nakpil]]. The Chapel is the centerpiece of the Complex, which also contains the old Central Office and Pastoral House which was the home of the church's first Executive Minister, ''Ka'' [[Felix Manalo]], along with other Ministers and Evangelical Workers. When Manalo died in 1963, a mausoleum was constructed on the grounds of the Complex by architect [[Carlos Santos-Viola]].\n\nSan Juan also has a number of Evangelical churches. Through the APOI ( Association of Pastors for Outreach and Intercession), they have contributed to the spiritual atmosphere of the city. Every January, the city celebrates the National Bible Week, where the reading of the Scripture happens during the flag raising ceremony in the City Hall. Through the blessing of the mayor, a bible was planted in the heart of the new city hall during its construction.\n\nMajor evangelical churches like Jesus is Lord, Victory Greenhills are also found in the city of San Juan.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n{{Further|Transportation in Metro Manila|Public transport in Manila|Major roads in Metro Manila}}\n\n[[File:MRT-2 J. Ruiz Station.jpg|thumb|The [[J. Ruiz station]] is the only rail and rapid transit station serving San Juan.]]\n\nModes of public transportation in San Juan include [[jeepney]]s and buses. Jeepney routes ply the [[Aurora Boulevard]] (R-6). The city is serviced by the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]]. The only Line 2 station in San Juan is the [[J. Ruiz station]].\nThe [[Circumferential Road 3|C-3]] (Araneta Avenue) also passes through San Juan. Secondary routes include Nicanor Domingo (abbreviated N. Domingo), which heads towards [[Cubao]] in [[Quezon City]], and Pinaglabanan/Santolan Road, which leads towards [[Ortigas Avenue]] and eventually the southern reaches of Quezon City near [[Camp Crame]], the headquarters of the [[Philippine National Police]].\n\n== Education ==\n{{See also|Category:Schools in San Juan, Metro Manila}}\nThe [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines, San Juan|Polytechnic University of the Philippines]] maintains a campus in San Juan.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Joseph Estrada]], Former San Juan Mayor, Former Manila Mayor, Former President of the Philippines, Actor\n* [[Arturo Tolentino]], Former Vice President of the Philippines\n* [[Paul Artadi]], Basketball Player / 2019 re-elected district 1 councilor \n* [[Edu Manzano]], Actor, Former US Military officer\n* [[JV Ejercito]], former San Juan Mayor, 2019 outgoing senator\n* [[Era\u00f1o Manalo]], former [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] Executive Minister from 1963-2009\n* [[Jinggoy Estrada]], former San Juan Mayor, senator, actor\n* [[Gabby Concepcion]], Actor\n* [[Franklin Drilon]], Lawyer, Politician, Current Senator of the Philippines\n* [[Jaymee Joaquin]], former TV host\n* [[Luis Manzano]], actor and TV host\n* [[Joross Gamboa]], actor\n* [[Janella Salvador]], actress singer artist\n* [[Grace Poe]], 2019 re-elected senator and former MTRCB chairwoman\n* [[Alfred Vargas]], actor, congressman ([[Quezon City]])\n* [[Krissy and Ericka|Ericka Villongco]], singer and actress\n* [[Krissy and Ericka|Krissy Villongco]], singer\n* [[Don Allado]], Ex-professional basketball player & coach\n* [[Philip Cezar]], PBA Player aka \"Tapal King\", vice mayor (1992-2001) and current basketball coach\n*[[Francis Zamora]], former Vice Mayor and incumbent Mayor (since June 30, 2019 up to present)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Sister cities==\n===Local===\n* [[Davao City]]<ref>[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2008/10/05/news/davao.san.juan.cities.ink.sisterhood.pact.html sunstar.com.ph, Davao, San Juan cities ink sisterhood pact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008005240/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2008/10/05/news/davao.san.juan.cities.ink.sisterhood.pact.html |date=2008-10-08 }}</ref>\n* [[Iloilo City]]<ref name=\"PanayNews-SisterCities\">{{cite news |last1=Tayona |first1=Glenda |last2=Silubrico |first2=Ruby |title=Iloilo to showcase culture to \u2018sister cities\u2019 tonight |url=https://www.panaynews.net/iloilo-to-showcase-culture-to-sister-cities-tonight/ |accessdate=9 April 2019 |work=Panay News |date=25 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409192355/https://www.panaynews.net/iloilo-to-showcase-culture-to-sister-cities-tonight/ |archivedate=9 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===International===\n*{{flagicon|USA}} {{flagicon|Puerto Rico}} [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], United States\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Maui, Hawaii]], United States<ref>{{cite web |title=San Juan, Philippines & Maui, Hawaii |url=http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/relationship/San%20Juan,%20Philippines%20/Maui,%20Hawaii |publisher=Sister Cities International |location=Washington, DC |accessdate=2015-02-04}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Santa Barbara, California]], United States<ref name=SoCalSisterCities>{{cite web |title=Socal Sister Cities Directory |url=http://socalsistercities.org/sister-city-directory/ |publisher=SoCal Chapter Inc. |website=Southern California Sister Cities Directory |accessdate=2015-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=San Juan, Philippines & Santa Barbara, California |url=http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/relationship/San%20Juan,%20Philippines%20/Santa%20Barbara,%20California |publisher=Sister Cities International |location=Washington, DC |accessdate=2015-02-04}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"120\">\nCity of San Juan Government Center - side view (Pinaglabanan, San Juan; 12-09-2019).jpg|City of San Juan Government Center\nPinaglabanan Shrine 11.jpg|Pinaglabanan Shrine\nSan Juan, Metro Manila (2344411253).jpg|Santuario del Santo Cristo\n02076jfSan Juan Del Monte Presidencia Hospital Barangays Progeso Rivera San Juan Cityfvf 04.jpg|Sn.

wikidata|name}} City''', is a {{PH wikidata|income_class_ordinal}} [[{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}} It is geographically located at Metro Manila's approximate center and is also the country's [[Cities of the Philippines#List of cities|smallest city in terms of land area]].\n\nThe city is known historically for the site of the first battle of the [[Katipunan]], the organization which led the 1896 [[Philippine Revolution]] against the [[Spanish Empire]]. Notable landmarks today such as [[Pinaglabanan Shrine]] and heritage homes are located in the city. Other locations include [[Greenhills (mixed-use development)|Greenhills]] and [[Bonny Serrano Avenue|Santolan]] Town Plaza, making the city a major shopping hub with a range of upscale, boutique and bargain retail.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/short-sweet-historical-tour-san-juan-city/117710/|title=A short and sweet historical tour of San Juan City - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n\"San Juan City\" is a contraction of the city's traditional name of \"'''San Juan del Monte'''\" ({{literal translation|Saint John of the Mountain}}). As with numerous other places in the Philippines, the name combines a [[patron saint]] and a [[toponym]]; in this case Saint [[John the Baptist]] with the locale's hilly terrain and relatively higher elevation compared to surrounding areas. \n\nThe city's official name is \"Dakilang Lungs\u00f3d ng San Juan\" ({{literal translation|Great City of San Juan}}).\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Hispanic period]], the area of what is now San Juan was a part of the [[Kingdom of Namayan]], whose last recorded rulers were King Lacantagean and his [[Queen consort|consort]], Bouan. After the kingdom and other polities in the islands were absorbed into the [[Spanish Crown]] in the late 16th century, the realm of Namayan was christened ''[[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana de Sapa]]''. The present area of San Juan was meanwhile re-classified as a ''[[barrio]]'', becoming a small ''[[encomienda]]'' by 1590. \n\nIn 1602, the [[Order of Preachers|Dominicans]] built a retreat house in the vicinity for their immediate use, where ageing or convalescing friars stayed. Later, the Order constructed a convent and stone church dedicated to the [[Christian cross|Holy Cross]]. To this day, the thrice-rebuilt [[Santuario del Santo Cristo]] stands on the same site, adjacent to Aquinas School and Dominican College.\n[[File:El Deposito, dep\u00f3sito de agua de Manila.png|left|thumb|200x200px|[[El Deposito]], 1900]]\nIn 1783, San Juan was partitioned from Santa Ana but was still a ''barrio'' within the [[Manila (province)|Province of Manila]]. The [[El Deposito]] [[reservoir]] was historically known as the site where the onset of the [[Philippine Revolution]] through the [[Battle of San Juan del Monte]] took place in 1896.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nhcp.gov.ph/pinaglabanan-memorial-shrine/|title=National Historical Commission of the Philippines official website|website=Pinaglabanan Memorial Shrine}}</ref> The opening salvo against [[Spain]] took place in San Juan in 1897 when the [[Katipunan]] attacked the ''alamac\u00e9n'' (armoury) or ''polvor\u00edn'' (gunpowder magazine) of the [[Spanish East Indies]] colonial government. The town was later incorporated into the [[Province of Rizal]] in 1901 under [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)#U.S. military government|American military rule]].\n\nOn 7 November 1975, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed Presidential Decree No. 824 that established the [[National Capital Region (Philippines)|National Capital Region]], and San Juan was among the towns excised from Rizal Province. Residents ratified the conversion of the municipality into a highly urbanised city on 17 June 2007, pursuant to Republic Act No. 9388 (\"An Act Converting the Municipality of San Juan into a Highly Urbanized City to be known as the City of San Juan\"). Then [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congressman]] Ronaldo B. Zamora sponsored the Cityhood Bill in the House of Representatives and worked for its approval.<ref>[http://www.op.gov.ph/directives/RA09388.pdf Republic Act No. 9388 - Charter of the City of San Juan]</ref>\n\nIn 2020, San Juan and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n=== Presidential ties ===\nAlthough not officially designated as such, San Juan is noted to be the \"City of Philippine Presidents.\" Four presidents since the [[History of the Philippines (1946-1965)|Third Republic]] were official residents of San Juan when they assumed office. They were the Macapagal ''p\u00e8re et fille'', [[Diosdado Macapagal|Diosdado Sr.]] (1961\u20131965) and [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Gloria Arroyo]] (2001\u20132010); [[Ferdinand Marcos]] (1965\u20131986); and [[Joseph Estrada]] (1998\u20132001), who also served as Mayor when San Juan was still a municipality.\n\n==Geography==\nSan Juan is the least-extensive city in the Philippines with a total area of just {{convert|595|ha|sqmi}}.\n\nSan Juan is bounded by [[Quezon City]] on the north and east, [[Mandaluyong]] on the south, and the [[City of Manila]] in the west.\n\nThe territory of San Juan was once much larger than it is now, extending all the way to what is now [[Caloocan City]]. Parts of the present-day Districts 1, 4 and 6 of [[Quezon City]] as well as areas of [[Mandaluyong]] were originally within the town's colonial-era borders. This also explains why San Juan Reservoir is in nearby Horseshoe Village, a subdivision now part of Quezon City.\n\n===Barangays===\nSan Juan is politically subdivided into 21 [[barangay]]s:\n\n[[File:Ph fil san juan.png|thumb|upright=1.1|{{center|'''Political map of San Juan'''}}]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:95%;\" width=50%\n|-\n!District 1\n!District 2\n|-\n|\n* [[Balong\u2013Bato]]\n* [[Batis, San Juan|Batis]]\n* [[Corazon de Jes\u00fas, San Juan|Corazon de Jes\u00fas]]\n* [[Ermita\u00f1o, San Juan|Ermita\u00f1o]]\n* [[Pasade\u00f1a, San Juan|Pasade\u00f1a]]\n* [[Pedro Cruz, San Juan|Pedro Cruz]]\n* [[Progreso, San Juan|Progreso]]\n* [[Rivera, San Juan|Rivera]]\n* [[Salap\u00e1n, San Juan|Salapan]]\n* [[San Perfecto, San Juan|San Perfecto]]\n|\n* [[Addition Hills, San Juan|Addition Hills]]\n* [[Greenhills (barangay)|Greenhills]]\n* [[Isabelita, San Juan|Isabelita]]\n* [[Kabayanan]]\n* [[Little Baguio]]\n* [[Maytunas, San Juan|Maytunas]]\n* [[Onse, San Juan|Onse]]\n* [[Saint Joseph, San Juan|Saint Joseph]]\n* [[Santa Lucia, San Juan|Santa Lucia]]\n* [[Tibagan]]\n* [[West Crame]]\n|}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of San Juan\n| 1903 = 1455\n| 1918 = 6172\n| 1939 = 18870\n| 1948 = 31493\n| 1960 = 56861\n| 1970 = 104559\n| 1975 = 122492\n| 1980 = 130088\n| 1990 = 126854\n| 1995 = 124187\n| 2000 = 117680\n| 2007 = 125338\n| 2010 = 121430\n| 2015 = 122180\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==Transportation==\n\n{{Further|Transportation in Metro Manila|Public transport in Manila|Major roads in Metro Manila}}\n\n[[File:MRT-2 J.

Jeepney routes ply the [[Aurora Boulevard]] (R-6). The city is serviced by the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]]. The only Line 2 station in San Juan is the [[J. Ruiz station]].\nThe [[Circumferential Road 3|C-3]] (Araneta Avenue) also passes through San Juan. Secondary routes include Nicanor Domingo (abbreviated N. Domingo), which heads towards [[Cubao]] in [[Quezon City]], and Pinaglabanan/Santolan Road, which leads towards [[Ortigas Avenue]] and eventually the southern reaches of Quezon City near [[Camp Crame]], the headquarters of the [[Philippine National Police]].\n\n== Education ==\n{{See Also|Category:Schools in San Juan, Metro Manila}}\nThe [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines, San Juan|Polytechnic University of the Philippines]] maintains a campus in San Juan.\n\n== Culture ==\n===Religion===\nThe city also has several notable places of worship. [[St. John the Baptist Church (San Juan, Philippines)|Saint John the Baptist Parish]], more commonly known as \"''Pinaglabanan'' Church\", is where the city's patron saint, [[John the Baptist]], is enshrined. The [[Santuario del Santo Cristo]] is the settlement's oldest existing church, while Mary the Queen Parish in West Greenhills serves the local [[Filipino-Chinese]] community.\n\nFrom 1925\u20131971, the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] once headquartered in the town at its former Central Office Complex, now known as the Locale of F. Manalo. It features Art-Deco designed ensembles, crafted by [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist for Architecture]] [[Juan Nakpil]]. The Chapel is the centerpiece of the Complex, which also contains the old Central Office and Pastoral House which was the home of the church's first Executive Minister, ''Ka'' [[Felix Manalo]], along with other Ministers and Evangelical Workers. When Manalo died in 1963, a mausoleum was constructed on the grounds of the Complex by architect [[Carlos Santos-Viola]].\n\nSan Juan also has a number of Evangelical churches. Through the APOI ( Association of Pastors for Outreach and Intercession), they have contributed to the spiritual atmosphere of the city. Every January, the city celebrates the National Bible Week, where the reading of the Scripture happens during the flag raising ceremony in the City Hall. Through the blessing of the mayor, a bible was planted in the heart of the new city hall during its construction. \n\nMajor evangelical churches like Jesus is Lord, Victory Greenhills are also found in the city of San Juan.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Joseph Estrada]], Former San Juan Mayor, Former Manila Mayor, Former President of the Philippines, Actor\n* [[Arturo Tolentino]], Former Vice President of the Philippines\n* [[Paul Artadi]], Basketball Player / 2019 re-elected district 1 councilor \n* [[Edu Manzano]], Actor, Former US Military officer\n* [[JV Ejercito]], former San Juan Mayor, 2019 outgoing senator\n* [[Era\u00f1o Manalo]], former [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] Executive Minister from 1963-2009\n* [[Jinggoy Estrada]], former San Juan Mayor, senator, actor\n* [[Gabby Concepcion]], Actor\n* [[Franklin Drilon]], Lawyer, Politician, Current Senator of the Philippines\n* [[Jaymee Joaquin]], former TV host\n* [[Luis Manzano]], actor and TV host\n* [[Joross Gamboa]], actor\n* [[Janella Salvador]], actress singer artist\n* [[Grace Poe]], 2019 re-elected senator and former MTRCB chairwoman\n* [[Alfred Vargas]], actor, congressman ([[Quezon City]])\n* [[Krissy and Ericka|Ericka Villongco]], singer and actress\n* [[Krissy and Ericka|Krissy Villongco]], singer\n* [[Don Allado]], Ex-professional basketball player & coach\n* [[Philip Cezar]], PBA Player aka \"Tapal King\", vice mayor (1992-2001) and current basketball coach\n*[[Francis Zamora]], former Vice Mayor and incumbent Mayor (since June 30, 2019 up to present)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Sister cities==\n===Local===\n* [[Davao City]]<ref>[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2008/10/05/news/davao.san.juan.cities.ink.sisterhood.pact.html sunstar.com.ph, Davao, San Juan cities ink sisterhood pact] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008005240/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2008/10/05/news/davao.san.juan.cities.ink.sisterhood.pact.html |date=2008-10-08 }}</ref>\n* [[Iloilo City]]<ref name=\"PanayNews-SisterCities\">{{cite news |last1=Tayona |first1=Glenda |last2=Silubrico |first2=Ruby |title=Iloilo to showcase culture to \u2018sister cities\u2019 tonight |url=https://www.panaynews.net/iloilo-to-showcase-culture-to-sister-cities-tonight/ |accessdate=9 April 2019 |work=Panay News |date=25 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409192355/https://www.panaynews.net/iloilo-to-showcase-culture-to-sister-cities-tonight/ |archivedate=9 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===International===\n*{{flagicon|USA}} {{flagicon|Puerto Rico}} [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], United States\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Maui, Hawaii]], United States<ref>{{cite web |title=San Juan, Philippines & Maui, Hawaii |url=http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/relationship/San%20Juan,%20Philippines%20/Maui,%20Hawaii |publisher=Sister Cities International |location=Washington, DC |accessdate=2015-02-04}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Santa Barbara, California]], United States<ref name=SoCalSisterCities>{{cite web |title=Socal Sister Cities Directory |url=http://socalsistercities.org/sister-city-directory/ |publisher=SoCal Chapter Inc. |website=Southern California Sister Cities Directory |accessdate=2015-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=San Juan, Philippines & Santa Barbara, California |url=http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/relationship/San%20Juan,%20Philippines%20/Santa%20Barbara,%20California |publisher=Sister Cities International |location=Washington, DC |accessdate=2015-02-04}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"120\">\nCity of San Juan Government Center - side view (Pinaglabanan, San Juan; 12-09-2019).jpg|City of San Juan Government Center\nPinaglabanan Shrine 11.jpg|Pinaglabanan Shrine\nSan Juan, Metro Manila (2344411253).jpg|Santuario del Santo Cristo\n02076jfSan Juan Del Monte Presidencia Hospital Barangays Progeso Rivera San Juan Cityfvf 04.jpg|Sn.
