It is a Grade I [[listed building]].<ref>{{NHLE |num=1366587 |desc=Grade I |accessdate=17 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Castle Bromwich Hall, circa 1809.jpeg|thumb| Drawing of the hall, from [[William Hutton (historian)|William Hutton]]'s 1809 book ''An history of Birmingham'' ]]\nThe Hall was built between 1557 and 1585 by [[Sir Edward Devereux, 1st Baronet of Castle Bromwich]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]] in [[Staffordshire]].  It was single storey with a plain entrance.  It was then bought by Sir John Bridgeman (son of [[Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever|Orlando Bridgeman]], keeper of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]]) in 1657.  He extended and improved the property in 1672, adding the second floor and a large front porch.  The porch projected out by ten feet from the main building.  Above the twisted columns of grey stone of the porch are two figures in niches, called Peace and Plenty.  The coat of arms and monogram of Sir John is carved into the stone above the doorway.\n\nThe Bridgemans were created Barons Bradford in 1794 and [[Earl of Bradford|Earls of Bradford]] in 1815.  A marriage brought [[Weston Park]] into their possession after which the Castle Bromwich Hall was often rented out.\n\n==Features==\n[[File:Castle Bromwich Hall2.jpg|thumb|right|Castle Bromwich Hall viewed through iron gates]]\n\nThe Hall is famous for having twelve windows (one for each [[Twelve apostles|Apostle]]) and four dormers above (one for each [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]]).  The garden door passed through a grapevine which was always trimmed into the form of a cross.  The Hall and Long Gallery were panelled with dark oak timber, and the dining room with pitch pine from the United States.  The ceilings were adorned with designs of fruits and shells.  In 1810 a tapestry of three sections made in [[Brussels]] was hung in the drawing room.  One of the windows in the Long Gallery had the arms of Sir Edward Devereux and his wife Catherine.  There were many secret doorways and hiding holes.  Built into the high garden wall was a brick open air cold water bath dated 1733.  The garden maze with 6&nbsp;ft high holly hedges was a mirror image of that at [[Hampton Court]].  The North Garden has double iron gates which lead into the adjacent Church grounds.\n\n==The family==\nThe Hall has had many famous visitors including Benjamin Disraeli (while Prime Minister) The Duke of Connaught, The Duke and Duchess of Teck, The Duke and Duchess of York, Prince and Princess Christian, Queen Mary and William Gladstone.\n\nThe last family member  to live in the Hall until her death in 1936 was [[Ida Bridgeman, Countess of Bradford]].\nShe really loved this home and the village, holding the garden fete in the Hall grounds and mingling with the villagers.\n\n==Modern times==\n[[File:Castle Bromwich Hall and Gardens from the air 02.jpg|thumb|The hall and gardens in August 2012]]\n\nIt was then used for storage during [[World War II]]. After the war, it was leased out as a Hall of Residence for graduate, student and craft apprentices of the [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]], and then used as building company offices while the outbuildings were used by other small companies.\n\nThe Hall was sold in 2007 to Theodore Alexander, furniture designers and manufacturers who planned to restore the property and open their European showroom there in 2008. In 2009, Castle Bromwich Hall was put up for sale, with the estate agents Knight Frank, with an asking price of \u00a35,000,000 (circa $8 million US). It was sold for \u00a31,750,000 (circa $2.8 million US), then underwent extensive restoration and was opened as a hotel in October 2011.\n\nThe Hall is usually open to the public for hotel accommodation only. The surrounding [[Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens]] are one of the last examples of Formal English Gardens in the country and have been restored by Castle Bromwich Gardens Trust (established 1985), which holds a long lease from the City of Birmingham. These gardens are a popular tourist attraction and are open to the public.\n\nThe conservation area of [[Castle Bromwich]] is centred on the Hall.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[https://www.castlebromwichhallgardens.org.uk Gardens Trust Website]\n\n{{coord|52.50591|N|1.79222|W|region:GB_source:enwiki-osgb36(SP142898)|display=title}}<!-- Note: WGS84 lat/long, converted from OSGB36 grid ref -->\n\n[[Category:Country houses in the West Midlands (county)]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed buildings in the West Midlands]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Solihull]]\n[[Category:Bridgeman family]]\n[[Category:Thomas Rickman buildings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Castle Bromwich Hall1.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]\n\n'''Castle Bromwich Hall''' is a [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] Mansion in the [[Castle Bromwich]] area of [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

From 1861 to 1881 he served as the Rabbi of [[Beregszasz]], Hungary and then until 1883 in his native town of [[Mad (village)|Mad]].

Until hospitals could be built at Southern Cross, Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, the sick men were often transported to the nearest township for medical treatment, and in all the towns of the Avon Valley, new hospitals were urgently needed.<ref name=\"old80\" />{{rp|46}} }}\n\nThe roof, originally shingled with hand-split she-oak shingles, was re-shingled in 1935.<ref name=\"auto\"> Oldham R and J: George Temple-Poole, Architect of the Golden Years 1885-1897, University of Western Australia Press, 1980, p.47.</ref>\n\nWhen the hospital closed in 1963, it was used as the Civil Defence Headquarters<ref> Beverley Times, 22 October 1965, p.6.</ref> and then sold to the United Department of Christian Education (Methodist Church) which called the building Mirrambeena House.<ref> Beverley Times, 3 June 1976, p.3.</ref> It was then sold to the National Trust in April 1976, and the building was restored under the guidance of architect John Pidgeon, and leased to the Youth Community Recreation and National Fitness Council and was used as a youth hostel.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The Youth Hostels Association ceased to use the building in 1995 and it is now a private residence.\n\n==Arts and Crafts design==\n\nThe hospital is a fine example of [[Federation Arts and Crafts]] design<ref>Apperly R, Irving R, Reynolds PA: A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Styles and Terms from 1788 to the Present, Angus and Robertson, North Ryde, 1989, pp 140-145.</ref> in Western Australia, being designed by [[Principal Architect (Western Australia)|Principal Architect]] [[George Temple-Poole]].
