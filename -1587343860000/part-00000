It has number 322 in the G.A. Plimpton Collection at [[Columbia University]].<ref>{{citation\n | contribution = 158. Cuneiform Tablet.

From a modern perspective, a method for constructing such triples is a significant early achievement, known long before the [[Greek Mathematics|Greek]] and [[Indian Mathematics|Indian]] mathematicians discovered solutions to this problem. At the same time, one should recall the tablet's author was a scribe, rather than a professional mathematician; it has been suggested that one of his goals may have been to produce examples for school problems.\n\nThere has been significant scholarly debate on the nature and purpose of the tablet. For readable popular treatments of this tablet see {{harvtxt|Robson|2002}} or, more briefly, {{harvtxt|Conway|Guy|1996}}. {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} is a more detailed and technical discussion of the interpretation of the tablet's numbers, with an extensive bibliography.\n\n== Provenance and dating ==\nPlimpton 322 is partly broken, approximately 13&nbsp;cm wide, 9&nbsp;cm tall, and 2&nbsp;cm thick. New York publisher [[George Arthur Plimpton]] purchased the tablet from an archaeological dealer, [[Edgar James Banks|Edgar J. Banks]], in about 1922, and bequeathed it with the rest of his collection to [[Columbia University]] in the mid 1930s. According to Banks, the tablet came from Senkereh, a site in southern Iraq corresponding to the ancient city of [[Larsa]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}}, p. 109.</ref>\n\nThe tablet is believed to have been written about 1800 BC, using the [[middle chronology]],<ref>When comparing dates given by different sources, note that many of Wikipedia's articles on the ancient world use the short chronology, while much of the history of mathematics literature uses the middle chronology.  An exception is {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, which uses the long chronology.</ref> based in part on the style of handwriting used for its [[cuneiform script]]: {{harvtxt|Robson|2002}} writes that this handwriting \"is typical of documents from southern Iraq of 4000\u20133500 years ago.\" More specifically, based on formatting similarities with other tablets from Larsa that have explicit dates written on them, Plimpton 322 might well be from the period 1822\u20131784 BC.<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}}, p. 111.</ref>  [[Eleanor Robson|Robson]] points out that Plimpton 322 was written in the same format as other administrative, rather than mathematical, documents of the period.<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}}, p. 110.</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nThe main content of Plimpton 322 is a table of numbers, with four columns and fifteen rows, in Babylonian [[sexagesimal]] notation. The fourth column is just a row number, in order from 1 to 15. The second and third columns are completely visible in the surviving tablet. However, the edge of the first column has been broken off, and there are two consistent extrapolations for what the missing digits could be; these interpretations differ only in whether or not each number starts with an additional digit equal to 1. With the differing extrapolations shown in parentheses, damaged portions of the first and fourth columns whose content is surmised shown in italics, and six presumed errors shown in boldface along with the generally proposed corrections in square brackets underneath, these numbers are\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\" scope=\"row\"\n!

Babylonian sexagesimal notation did not specify the power of 60 multiplying each number, which makes the interpretation of these numbers ambiguous.  The numbers in the second and third columns are generally taken to be integers.  The numbers in the first column can only be understood as fractions, and their values all lie between 1 and 2 (assuming the initial 1 is present\u2014they lie between 0 and 1 if it is absent).  These fractions are exact, not truncations or rounded off approximations.  The decimal translation of the tablet under these assumptions is shown below.  Most of the exact sexagesimal fractions in the first column do not have terminating decimal expansions and have been rounded to seven decimal places.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <math>d^2/\\ell^2</math> or <math>s^2/\\ell^2</math>\n!

The entries in the second and third columns of Row 11, unlike those of all other rows except possibly Row 15, contain a common factor.  It is possible that 45 and 1&nbsp;15 are to be understood as 3/4 and 5/4, which is consistent with the standard (0.75,1,1.25) scaling of the familiar [[Special right triangles|(3,4,5) right triangle]] in Babylonian mathematics.\n\nIn each row, the number in the second column can be interpreted as the shorter side <math>s</math> of a right triangle, and the number in the third column can be interpreted as the [[hypotenuse]] <math>d</math> of the triangle.  In all cases, the longer side <math>\\ell</math> is also an integer, making <math>s</math> and <math>d</math> two elements of a [[Pythagorean triple]].  The number in the first column is either the fraction <math display=\"inline\"> s^2/\\ell^2</math> (if the \"1\" is not included) or <math display=\"inline\"> \\tfrac{d^2}{\\ell^2}\\,=\\, 1+\\tfrac{s^2}{\\ell^2}</math> (if the \"1\" is included).  In every case, the long side <math>\\ell</math> is a [[regular number]], that is, an integer divisor of a power of 60 or, equivalently, a product of powers of 2, 3, and 5.  It is for this reason that the numbers in the first column are exact, as dividing an integer by a regular number produces a terminating sexagesimal number.  For instance, line 1 of the table can be interpreted as describing a triangle with short side 119 and hypotenuse 169, implying long side <math>\\sqrt{169^2-119^2}=120</math>, which is a regular number (2<sup>3</sup>\u00b73\u00b75).  The number in Column 1 is either (169/120)<sup>2</sup> or (119/120)<sup>2</sup>.\n\n===Column headings===\nEach column has a heading, written in the [[Akkadian language]].  Some words are [[Sumerogram|Sumerian logograms]], which would have been understood by readers as standing for Akkadian words.  These include \u00cdB.SI<sub>8</sub>, for Akkadian ''mithartum'' (\"square\"), MU.BI.IM, for Akkadian ''\u0161um\u0161u'' (\"its line\"), and SAG, for Akkadian ''p\u016btum'' (\"width\").  Each number in the fourth column is preceded by the Sumerogram KI, which, according to {{harvtxt|Neugebauer|Sachs|1945}}, \"gives them the character of ordinal numbers.\"  In the sexagesimal table above, italicized words and parts of words represent portions of the text that are unreadable due to damage to the tablet or illegibility, and that have been reconstructed by modern scholars.  The terms \u00cdB.SI<sub>8</sub> and takiltum have been left untranslated as there is ongoing debate about their precise meaning.\n\nThe headings of Columns 2 and 3 could be translated as \"square of the width\" and \"square of the diagonal\", but {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} (pp.&nbsp;173\u2013174) argues that the term \u00cdB.SI<sub>8</sub> can refer either to the area of the square or the side of the square, and that in this case it should be understood as \"'square-side' or perhaps 'square root'\".  Similarly {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}} (p.&nbsp;526) observe that the term often appears in the problems where completing the square is used to solve what would now be understood as quadratic equations, in which context it refers to the side of the completed square, but that it might also serve to indicate \"that a linear dimension or line segment is meant\".  {{harvtxt|Neugebauer|Sachs|1945}} (pp.&nbsp;35, 39), on the other hand, exhibit instances where the term refers to outcomes of a wide variety of different mathematical operations and propose the translation \"'solving number of the width (or the diagonal).'\"  Similarly, {{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}} (p.&nbsp;300) proposes the translation \"root\".\n\nIn Column 1, the first parts of both lines of the heading are damaged.  {{harvtxt|Neugebauer|Sachs|1945}} reconstructed the first word as ''takilti'' (a form of ''takiltum''), a reading that has been accepted by most subsequent researchers.  The heading was generally regarded as untranslatable until {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} proposed inserting a 1 in the broken-off part of line 2 and succeeded in deciphering the illegible final word, producing the reading given in the table above.  Based on a detailed linguistic analysis, Robson proposes translating ''takiltum'' as \"holding square\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, p. 191}}</ref>  {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}} survey the relatively few known occurrences of the word in Old Babylonian mathematics.  While they note that, in almost all cases, it refers to the linear dimension of the auxiliary square added to a figure in the process of completing the square, and is the quantity subtracted in the last step of solving a quadratic, they agree with Robson that in this instance it is to be understood as referring to the area of a square.  {{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, on the other hand, proposes that in the broken-off portion of the heading ''takiltum'' may have been preceded by ''a-\u0161a'' (\"area\").  There is now widespread agreement that the heading describes the relationship between the squares on the width (short side) and diagonal of a rectangle with length (long side) 1: subtracting (\"tearing out\") area 1 from the square on the diagonal leaves the area of the square on the width.\n\n===Errors===\nAs indicated in the table above, most scholars believe that the tablet contains six errors, and, with the exception of the two possible corrections in Row 15, there is widespread agreement as to what the correct values should be.  There is less agreement about how the errors occurred and what they imply with regard to the method of the tablet's computation.  A summary of the errors follows.\n\nThe errors in Row 2, Column 1 (neglecting to leave spaces between 50 and 6 for absent 1s and 10s) and Row 9, Column 2 (writing 9 for 8) are universally regarded as minor errors in copying from a work tablet (or possibly from an earlier copy of the table).  The error in Row 8, Column 1 (replacing the two sexagesimal digits 45 14 by their sum, 59) appears not to have been noticed in some of the early papers on the tablet.  It has sometimes been regarded (for example in {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}) as a simple mistake made by the scribe in the process of copying from a work tablet.  As discussed in {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, however, a number of scholars have proposed that this error is much more plausibly explained as an error in the calculation leading up to the number, for example, the scribe's overlooking a medial zero (blank space representing a zero digit) when performing a multiplication.  This explanation of the error is compatible with both of the main proposals for the method of construction of the table.  (See below.)\n\nThe remaining three errors have implications for the manner in which the tablet was computed.  The number 7&nbsp;12&nbsp;1 in Row 13, Column 2, is the square of the correct value, 2&nbsp;41.  Assuming either that the lengths in Column 2 were computed by taking the square root of the area of the corresponding square, or that the length and the area were computed together, this error might be explained either as neglecting to take the square root, or copying the wrong number from a work tablet.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, p. 298; {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, p. 192; {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, p, 538</ref>\n\nIf the error in Row 15 is understood as having written 56 instead of 28 in Column 2, then the error can be explained as a result of improper application of the trailing part algorithm, which is required if the table was computed by means of reciprocal pairs as described below.  This error amounts to applying an iterative procedure for removing regular factors common to the numbers in Columns 2 and 3 an improper number of times in one of the columns.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, p. 298; {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, p. 193; {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, p, 538</ref>\n\nThe number in Row 2, Column 3 has no obvious relationship to the correct number, and all explanations of how this number was obtained postulate multiple errors.  {{harvtxt|Bruins|1957}} observed that 3&nbsp;12&nbsp;01 might have been a simple miscopying of 3&nbsp;13.  If this were the case, then the explanation for the incorrect number 3&nbsp;13 is similar to the explanation of the error in Row 15.<ref>See also {{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, pp. 298\u2013299; {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, p. 193; {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, p, 537\u2013538.</ref>\n\nAn exception to the general consensus is {{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, where, in a departure from the earlier analysis by the same author ({{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}), it is hypothesized that the numbers in Row 15 are not in error, but were written as intended, and that the only error in Row 2, Column 3 was miswriting 3&nbsp;13 as 3&nbsp;12&nbsp;01.  Under this hypothesis, it is necessary to reinterpret Columns 2 and 3 as \"the factor-reduced cores of the front and diagonal\".  The factor-reduced core of a number is the number with perfect-square regular factors removed; computing the factor-reduced core was part of the process of calculating square roots in Old Babylonian mathematics.  According to Friberg, \"it was never the intention of the author of Plimpton 322 to reduce his series of ''normalized'' diagonal triples (with length equal to 1 in each triple) to a corresponding series of ''primitive'' diagonal triples (wth the front, length, and the diagonal equal to integers without common factors).\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, p. 449}}</ref>\n\n== Construction of the table ==\nScholars still differ on how these numbers were generated.  {{harvtxt|Buck|1980}} and {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} both identify two main proposals for the method of construction of the table: the method of generating pairs, proposed in {{harvtxt|Neugebauer|Sachs|1945}}, and the method of reciprocal pairs, proposed by Bruins<ref>{{harvtxt|Bruins|1949}}, {{harvtxt|Bruins|1951}}, {{harvtxt|Bruins|1957}}</ref> and elaborated on by Voils,<ref>unpublished, but described in {{harvtxt|Buck|1980}}</ref> {{harvtxt|Schmidt|1980}}, and Friberg.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, {{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}</ref>\n\n===Generating pairs===\nTo use modern terminology, if ''p'' and ''q'' are natural numbers such that ''p''>''q'' then (''p''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''q''<sup>2</sup>, 2''pq'', ''p''<sup>2</sup> + ''q''<sup>2</sup>) forms a Pythagorean triple.  The triple is primitive, that is the three triangle sides have no common factor, if ''p'' and ''q'' are [[coprime]] and not both odd.  Neugebauer and Sachs propose the tablet was generated by choosing ''p'' and ''q'' to be coprime regular numbers (but both may be odd\u2014see Row 15) and computing ''d'' = ''p''<sup>2</sup> + ''q''<sup>2</sup>, ''s'' = ''p''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''q''<sup>2</sup>, and ''l'' = 2''pq'' (so that ''l'' is also a regular number).  For example, line 1 would be generated by setting ''p'' = 12 and ''q'' = 5.  Buck and Robson both note that the presence of Column 1 is mysterious in this proposal, as it plays no role in the construction, and that the proposal does not explain why the rows of the table are ordered as they are, rather than, say, according to the value of <math>p</math> or <math>q</math>, which, under this hypothesis, might have been listed on columns to the left in the broken-off portion of the tablet.  Robson also argues that the proposal does not explain how the errors in the table could have plausibly arisen and is not in keeping with the mathematical culture of the time.\n\n===Reciprocal pairs===\nIn the reciprocal-pair proposal, the starting point is a single regular sexagesimal fraction ''x'' along with its reciprocal, 1/''x''.  \"Regular sexagesimal fraction\" means that ''x'' is a product of (possibly negative) powers of 2, 3, and 5.  The quantities (''x''\u22121/''x'')/2, 1, and (''x''+1/''x'')/2 then form what would now be called a rational Pythagorean triple.  Moreover, the three sides all have finite sexagesimal representations.\n\nAdvocates of this proposal point out that regular reciprocal pairs (''x'',1/''x'') show up in a different problem from roughly the same time and place as Plimpton 322, namely the problem of finding the sides of a rectangle of area 1 whose long side exceeds its short side by a given length ''c'' (which nowadays might be computed as the solutions to the [[quadratic equation]] <math display=\"inline\"> x-\\tfrac1x=c</math>).  {{harvtxt|Robson|2002}} analyzes the tablet, YBC 6967, in which such a problem is solved by calculating a sequence of intermediate values ''v''<sub>1</sub> = ''c''/2, ''v''<sub>2</sub> = ''v''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, ''v''<sub>3</sub> = 1 + ''v''<sub>2</sub>, and ''v''<sub>4</sub> = ''v''<sub>3</sub><sup>1/2</sup>, from which one can calculate ''x'' = ''v''<sub>4</sub> + ''v''<sub>1</sub> and 1/''x'' = ''v''<sub>4</sub> \u2212 ''v''<sub>1</sub>.  While the need to compute the square root of ''v''<sub>3</sub> will, in general result in answers that do not have finite sexagesimal representations, the problem on YBC 6967 was set up\u2014meaning the value of ''c'' was suitably chosen\u2014to give a nice answer.  This is, in fact, the origin of the specification above that ''x'' be a regular sexagesimal fraction:  choosing ''x'' in this way ensures that both ''x'' and 1/''x'' have finite sexagesimal representations.  To engineer a problem with a nice answer, the problem setter would simply need to choose such an ''x'' and let the initial datum ''c'' equal ''x'' \u2212 1/''x''.  As a side effect, this produces a rational Pythagorean triple, with legs ''v''<sub>1</sub> and 1 and hypotenuse ''v''<sub>4</sub>.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the problem on YBC 6967 actually solves the equation <math display=\"inline\"> x-\\tfrac{1\\ 00}x=x-\\tfrac{60}x=c</math>, which entails replacing the expression for ''v''<sub>3</sub> above with ''v''<sub>3</sub> = 60 + ''v''<sub>2</sub>.  The side effect of obtaining a rational triple is thereby lost as the sides become ''v''<sub>1</sub>, <math>\\sqrt{60}</math>, and ''v''<sub>4</sub>.  In this proposal it must be assumed that the Babylonians were familiar with both variants of the problem.\n\nRobson argues that the columns of Plimpton 322 can be interpreted as:\n::''v''<sub>3</sub> = ((''x'' + 1/''x'')/2)<sup>2</sup> = 1 + (''c''/2)<sup>2</sup> in the first column,\n::''a''\u00b7''v''<sub>1</sub> = ''a''\u00b7(''x'' \u2212 1/''x'')/2 for a suitable multiplier ''a'' in the second column, and\n::''a''\u00b7''v''<sub>4</sub> = ''a''\u00b7(''x'' + 1/''x'')/2 in the third column.\nIn this interpretation, ''x'' and 1/''x'' (or possibly ''v''<sub>1</sub> and ''v''<sub>4</sub>) would have appeared on the tablet in the broken-off portion to the left of the first column.  The presence of Column 1 is therefore explained as an intermediate step in the calculation, and the ordering of rows is by descending values of ''x'' (or ''v''<sub>1</sub>).  The multiplier ''a'' used to compute the values in columns 2 and 3, which can be thought of as a rescaling of the side lengths, arises from application of the \"trailing part algorithm\", in which both values are repeatedly multiplied by the reciprocal of any regular factor common to the last sexagesimal digits of both, until no such common factor remains.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, p. 24</ref>  As discussed above, the errors in the tablet all have natural explanations in the reciprocal-pair proposal.  On the other, Robson points out that the role of Columns 2 and 3 and the need for the multiplier ''a'' remain unexplained by this proposal, and suggests that the goal of the tablet's author was to provide parameters not for quadratic problems of the type solved on YBC 6967, but rather \"for some sort of right-triangle problems.\"  She also notes that the method used to generate the table and the use for which it was intended need not be the same.<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, pp. 201\u2013202}}</ref>\n\nStrong additional support for the idea that the numbers on the tablet were generated using reciprocal pairs comes from two tablets, MS 3052 and MS 3971, from the [[Sch\u00f8yen Collection]].  J\u00f6ran Friberg translated and analyzed the two tablets and discovered that both contain examples of the calculation of the diagonal and side lengths of a rectangle using reciprocal pairs as the starting point.  The two tablets are both Old Babylonian, of approximately the same age as Plimpton 322, and both are believed to come from Uruk, near Larsa.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, pp. 245, 255</ref>  Further analysis of the two tablets was carried out in {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}.  MS 3971 contains a list of five problems, the third of which begins with \"In order for you to see five diagonals\" and concludes with \"five diagonals\".  The given data for each of the five parts of the problem consist of a reciprocal pair.  For each part the lengths of both the diagonal and the width (short side) of a rectangle are computed.  The length (long side) is not stated but the calculation implies that it is taken to be 1.  In modern terms, the calculation proceeds as follows: given ''x'' and 1/''x'', first compute (''x''+1/''x'')/2, the diagonal.  Then compute\n\n: <math>\n\\sqrt{\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right]^2-1},\n</math>\n\nthe width.  Due to damage to the part of the tablet containing the first of the five parts, the statement of the problem for this part, apart from traces of the initial data, and the solution have been lost.  The other four parts are, for the most part intact, and all contain very similar text.   The reason for taking the diagonal to be half the sum of the reciprocal pair is not stated in the intact text.  Note that the computation of the width is equivalent to (''x''\u22121/''x'')/2, but that this more direct method of computation has not been used, the rule relating the square of the diagonal to the sum of the squares of the sides having been preferred.\n\nThe text of the second problem of MS 3052 has also been badly damaged, but what remains is structured similarly to the five parts of MS 3971, Problem 3.  The problem contains a figure, which, according to Friberg, is likely a \"rectangle ''without'' any diagonals\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, p. 275</ref>  {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}} emphasize that the preserved portions of the text explicitly state the length to be 1 and explicitly compute the 1 that gets subtracted from the square of the diagonal in the process of calculating the width as the square of the length.  The initial data and computed width and diagonal for the six problems on the two tablets are given in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Problem !! ''x'' !! 1/''x'' !! width !! length !! diagonal\n|-\n| MS 3052 \u00a7 2 || 2 || 1/2 || 3/4 || 1 || 5/4\n|-\n| MS 3971 \u00a7 3a || 16/15(?) || 15/16(?) || 31/480(?) || 1 || 481/480(?)\n|-\n| MS 3971 \u00a7 3b || 5/3 || 3/5 || 8/15 || 1 || 17/15\n|-\n| MS 3971 \u00a7 3c || 3/2 || 2/3 || 5/12 || 1 || 13/12\n|-\n| MS 3971 \u00a7 3d || 4/3 || 3/4 || 7/24 || 1 || 25/24\n|-\n| MS 3971 \u00a7 3e || 6/5 || 5/6 || 11/60 || 1 || 61/60\n|}\n\nThe parameters of MS 3971 \u00a7 3a are uncertain due to damage to the tablet.  Note that the parameters of the problem from MS 3052 correspond to a rescaling of the standard (3,4,5) right triangle, which appears as Row 11 of Plimpton 322.  None of the parameters in the problems from MS 3971 match any of the rows of Plimpton 322.  As discussed below, all of the rows of Plimpton 322 have ''x''\u22659/5, while all the problems on MS 3971 have ''x''<9/5.  The parameters of MS 3971 do, however, all correspond to rows of de Solla Price's proposed extension of the table of Plimpton 322, also discussed below.\n\nIt must be emphasized that the role of the reciprocal pair is different in the problem on YBC 6967 than on MS 3052 and MS 3971 (and by extension, on Plimpton 322).  In the problem of YBC 6967, the members of the reciprocal pair are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle of area 1.  The geometric meaning of ''x'' and 1/''x'' is not stated in the surviving text of the problems on MS 3052 and MS 3971.  The goal appears to have been to apply a known procedure for producing rectangles with finite sexagesimal width and diagonal.<ref>{{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, p. 559</ref>  It should also be pointed out that the trailing point algorithm was not used to rescale the side lengths in these problems.\n\n===Comparison of the proposals===\nThe quantity ''x'' in the reciprocal-pair proposal corresponds to the ratio ''p''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''q'' in the generating-pair proposal.  Indeed, while the two proposals differ in calculation method, there is little mathematical difference between the results as both produce the same triples, apart from an overall factor of 2 in the case where ''p'' and ''q'' are both odd.  (Unfortunately, the only place where this occurs in the tablet is in Row 15, which contains an error and cannot therefore be used to distinguish between the proposals.)  Proponents of the reciprocal-pair proposal differ on whether ''x'' was computed from an underlying ''p'' and ''q'', but with only the combinations ''p''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''q'' and ''q''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''p'' used in tablet computations<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}</ref> or whether ''x'' was obtained directly from other sources, such as reciprocal tables.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bruins|1957}}, {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}</ref>  One difficulty with the latter hypothesis is that some of the needed values of ''x'' or 1/''x'' are four-place sexagesimal numbers, and no four-place reciprocal tables are known.  Neugebauer and Sachs had, in fact, noted the possibility of using reciprocal pairs in their original work, and rejected it for this reason.  Robson, however, argues that known sources and computational methods of the Old Babylonian period can account for all values of ''x'' used.\n\n===Selection of pairs===\nNeugebauer and Sachs note that the triangle dimensions in the tablet range from those of a nearly isosceles right triangle (with short leg, 119, nearly equal to long leg, 120) to those of a right triangle with acute angles close to 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, and that the angle decreases in a fairly uniform fashion in steps of approximately 1\u00b0.  They suggest that the pairs ''p'', ''q'' were chosen deliberately with this goal in mind.\n\nIt was observed by {{harvtxt|de Solla Price|1964}}, working within the generating-pair framework, that every row of the table is generated by a ''q'' that satisfies 1&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''q''<60, that is, that ''q'' is always a single-digit sexagesimal number.  The ratio ''p''/''q'' takes its greatest value, 12/5=2.4, in Row 1 of the table, and is therefore always less than <math>\\sqrt{2}+1\\approx2.414</math>, a condition which guarantees that ''p''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''q''<sup>2</sup> is the long leg and 2''pq'' is the short leg of the triangle and which, in modern terms, implies that the angle opposite the leg of length ''p''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''q''<sup>2</sup>\nis less than 45\u00b0.  The ratio is least in Row 15 where ''p''/''q''=9/5 for an angle of about 31.9\u00b0.  Furthermore, there are exactly 15 regular ratios between 9/5 and 12/5 inclusive for which ''q'' is a single-digit sexagesimal number, and these are in one-to-one correspondence with the rows of the tablet.  He also points out that the even spacing of the numbers might not have been by design: it could also have arisen merely from the density of regular-number ratios in the range of numbers considered in the table.\n\nIt was argued by de Solla Price that the natural lower bound for the ratio would be 1, which corresponds to an angle of 0\u00b0.  He found that, maintaining the requirement that ''q'' be a single-digit sexagesimal number, there are 23 pairs in addition to the ones represented by the tablet, for a total of 38 pairs.  He notes that the vertical scoring between columns on the tablet has been continued onto the back, suggesting that the scribe might have intended to extend the table.  He claims that the available space would correctly accommodate 23 additional rows.  Proponents of the reciprocal-pair proposal have also advocated this scheme.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} does not directly address this proposal, but does agree that the table was not \"full\".  She notes that in the reciprocal-pair proposal, every ''x'' represented in the tablet is at most a four-place sexagesimal number with at most a four-place reciprocal, and that the total number of places in ''x'' and 1/''x'' together is never more than 7.  If these properties are taken as requirements, there are exactly three values of ''x'' \"missing\" from the tablet, which she argues might have been omitted because they are unappealing in various ways.  She admits the \"shockingly ''ad hoc''\" nature of this scheme, which serves mainly as a rhetorical device for criticizing all attempts at divining the selection criteria of the tablet's author.<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, p. 199</ref>\n\n== Purpose and authorship ==\n{{harvs|authorlink=Otto E. Neugebauer|last=Neugebauer|first=Otto E.|year=1957|txt}} argued for a [[number theory|number-theoretic]] interpretation, but also believed that the entries in the table were the result of a deliberate selection process aimed at achieving the fairly regular decrease of the values in Column 1 within some specified bounds.\n\n{{harvtxt|Buck|1980}} and {{harvtxt|Robson|2002}} both mention the existence of a [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] explanation, which Robson attributes to the authors of various general histories and unpublished works, but which may derive from the observation in {{harvtxt|Neugebauer|Sachs|1945}} that the values of the first column can be interpreted as the squared [[Trigonometric function|secant or tangent]] (depending on the missing digit) of the angle opposite the short side of the right triangle described by each row, and the rows are sorted by these angles in roughly one-degree increments. In other words, if you take the number in the first column, discounting the (1), and derive its square root, and then divide this into the number in column two, the result will be the length of the long side of the triangle. Consequently, the square root of the number (minus the one) in the first column is what we would today call the [[tangent]] of the angle opposite the short side. If the (1) is included, the square root of that number is the [[Secant (trigonometry)|secant]].<ref>See also {{citation | last = Joyce | first = David E. | title = Plimpton 322 | url = http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/mathhist/plimpnote.html | year = 1995 }} and {{Citation | last = Maor | first = Eli | title = Trigonometric Delights | publisher = Princeton University Press | isbn = 978-0-691-09541-7 | year = 1993 | chapter = Plimpton 322: The Earliest Trigonometric Table? | pages = 30\u201334 | chapter-url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6287.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100805230810/http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6287.html | archivedate = 5 August 2010 | accessdate = November 28, 2010 | url-status = dead }}.</ref>\n\nIn contraposition with these earlier explanations of the tablet,\n{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}} claims that historical, cultural and linguistic evidence all reveal the tablet to be more likely constructed from ''\"a list of [[Regular number|regular]] [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] [[Ordered pair|pairs]].\"''<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}}, p. 116.</ref>  Robson argues on linguistic grounds that the trigonometric theory is \"conceptually anachronistic\": it depends on too many other ideas not present in the record of Babylonian mathematics from that time. In 2003, the MAA awarded Robson with the [[Lester R. Ford Award]] for her work, stating it is ''\"unlikely that the author of Plimpton 322 was either a professional or amateur mathematician.  More likely he seems to have been a teacher and Plimpton 322 a set of exercises.\"''<ref>{{citation | publisher = [[Mathematical Association of America]] | title = MathFest 2003 Prizes and Awards | url = http://www.maa.org/features/080503_writingprize.html | year = 2003}}.</ref>  Robson takes an approach that in modern terms would be characterized as [[algebra]]ic, though she describes it in concrete [[geometry|geometric]] terms and argues that the Babylonians would also have interpreted this approach geometrically.\n\nThus, the tablet can be interpreted as giving a sequence of worked-out exercises.  It makes use of mathematical methods typical of [[scribe|scribal]] schools of the time, and it is written in a document format used by administrators in that period.<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}}, pp. 117\u2013118.</ref>  Therefore, Robson argues that the author was probably a scribe, a bureaucrat in Larsa.<ref name=\"Robson118\">{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}}, p. 118.</ref>\nThe repetitive mathematical set-up of the tablet, and of similar tablets such as BM 80209, would have been useful in allowing a teacher to set problems in the same format as each other but with different data.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]\n*[[YBC 7289]]\n*[[IM 67118]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Britton | first1 = John P.\n | last2 = Proust | first2 = Christine\n | last3 = Shnider | first3 = Steve\n | title = Plimpton 322: a review and a different perspective\n | journal = Archive for History of Exact Sciences\n | volume = 65\n | issue = 5\n | pages =519\u2013566\n | year = 2011 \n| doi = 10.1007/s00407-011-0083-4\n }}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Bruins | first = Evert M.\n | journal = Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen Proceedings\n | pages = 629\u2013632\n | title = On Plimpton 322, Pythagorean numbers in Babylonian mathematics\n | volume = 52\n | year = 1949}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Bruins | first = Evert M.\n | journal = Sumer\n | pages = 117\u2013121\n | title = Pythagorean triads in Babylonian mathematics: The errors on Plimpton 322\n | volume = 11\n | year = 1951}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Bruins | first = E.

From a modern perspective, a method for constructing such triples is a significant early achievement, known long before the [[Greek Mathematics|Greek]] and [[Indian Mathematics|Indian]] mathematicians discovered solutions to this problem. At the same time, one should recall the tablet's author was a scribe, rather than a professional mathematician; it has been suggested that one of his goals may have been to produce examples for school problems.\n\nThere has been significant scholarly debate on the nature and purpose of the tablet. For readable popular treatments of this tablet see {{harvtxt|Robson|2002}} or, more briefly, {{harvtxt|Conway|Guy|1996}}. {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} is a more detailed and technical discussion of the interpretation of the tablet's numbers, with an extensive bibliography.\n\n== Provenance and dating ==\nPlimpton 322 is partly broken, approximately 13&nbsp;cm wide, 9&nbsp;cm tall, and 2&nbsp;cm thick. New York publisher [[George Arthur Plimpton]] purchased the tablet from an archaeological dealer, [[Edgar James Banks|Edgar J. Banks]], in about 1922, and bequeathed it with the rest of his collection to [[Columbia University]] in the mid 1930s. According to Banks, the tablet came from Senkereh, a site in southern Iraq corresponding to the ancient city of [[Larsa]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}}, p. 109.</ref>\n\nThe tablet is believed to have been written about 1800 BC, using the [[middle chronology]],<ref>When comparing dates given by different sources, note that many of Wikipedia's articles on the ancient world use the short chronology, while much of the history of mathematics literature uses the middle chronology.  An exception is {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, which uses the long chronology.</ref> based in part on the style of handwriting used for its [[cuneiform script]]: {{harvtxt|Robson|2002}} writes that this handwriting \"is typical of documents from southern Iraq of 4000\u20133500 years ago.\" More specifically, based on formatting similarities with other tablets from Larsa that have explicit dates written on them, Plimpton 322 might well be from the period 1822\u20131784 BC.<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}}, p. 111.</ref>  [[Eleanor Robson|Robson]] points out that Plimpton 322 was written in the same format as other administrative, rather than mathematical, documents of the period.<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}}, p. 110.</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nThe main content of Plimpton 322 is a table of numbers, with four columns and fifteen rows, in Babylonian [[sexagesimal]] notation. The fourth column is just a row number, in order from 1 to 15. The second and third columns are completely visible in the surviving tablet. However, the edge of the first column has been broken off, and there are two consistent extrapolations for what the missing digits could be; these interpretations differ only in whether or not each number starts with an additional digit equal to 1. With the differing extrapolations shown in parentheses, damaged portions of the first and fourth columns whose content is surmised shown in italics, and six presumed errors shown in boldface along with the generally proposed corrections in square brackets underneath, these numbers are \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\" scope=\"row\"\n!

Babylonian sexagesimal notation did not specify the power of 60 multiplying each number, which makes the interpretation of these numbers ambiguous.  The numbers in the second and third columns are generally taken to be integers.  The numbers in the first column can only be understood as fractions, and their values all lie between 1 and 2 (assuming the initial 1 is present\u2014they lie between 0 and 1 if it is absent).  These fractions are exact, not truncations or rounded off approximations.  The decimal translation of the tablet under these assumptions is shown below.  Most of the exact sexagesimal fractions in the first column do not have terminating decimal expansions and have been rounded to seven decimal places.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <math>d^2/\\ell^2</math> or <math>s^2/\\ell^2</math>\n!

The entries in the second and third columns of Row 11, unlike those of all other rows except possibly Row 15, contain a common factor.  It is possible that 45 and 1&nbsp;15 are to be understood as 3/4 and 5/4, which is consistent with the standard (0.75,1,1.25) scaling of the familiar [[Special right triangles|(3,4,5) right triangle]] in Babylonian mathematics.\n\nIn each row, the number in the second column can be interpreted as the shorter side <math>s</math> of a right triangle, and the number in the third column can be interpreted as the [[hypotenuse]] <math>d</math> of the triangle.  In all cases, the longer side <math>\\ell</math> is also an integer, making <math>s</math> and <math>d</math> two elements of a [[Pythagorean triple]].  The number in the first column is either the fraction <math display=\"inline\"> s^2/\\ell^2</math> (if the \"1\" is not included) or <math display=\"inline\"> \\tfrac{d^2}{\\ell^2}\\,=\\, 1+\\tfrac{s^2}{\\ell^2}</math> (if the \"1\" is included).  In every case, the long side <math>\\ell</math> is a [[regular number]], that is, an integer divisor of a power of 60 or, equivalently, a product of powers of 2, 3, and 5.  It is for this reason that the numbers in the first column are exact, as dividing an integer by a regular number produces a terminating sexagesimal number.  For instance, line 1 of the table can be interpreted as describing a triangle with short side 119 and hypotenuse 169, implying long side <math>\\sqrt{169^2-119^2}=120</math>, which is a regular number (2<sup>3</sup>\u00b73\u00b75).  The number in Column 1 is either (169/120)<sup>2</sup> or (119/120)<sup>2</sup>.\n\n===Column headings===\nEach column has a heading, written in the [[Akkadian language]].  Some words are [[Sumerogram|Sumerian logograms]], which would have been understood by readers as standing for Akkadian words.  These include \u00cdB.SI<sub>8</sub>, for Akkadian ''mithartum'' (\"square\"), MU.BI.IM, for Akkadian ''\u0161um\u0161u'' (\"its line\"), and SAG, for Akkadian ''p\u016btum'' (\"width\").  Each number in the fourth column is preceded by the Sumerogram KI, which, according to {{harvtxt|Neugebauer|Sachs|1945}}, \"gives them the character of ordinal numbers.\"  In the sexagesimal table above, italicized words and parts of words represent portions of the text that are unreadable due to damage to the tablet or illegibility, and that have been reconstructed by modern scholars.  The terms \u00cdB.SI<sub>8</sub> and takiltum have been left untranslated as there is ongoing debate about their precise meaning.\n\nThe headings of Columns 2 and 3 could be translated as \"square of the width\" and \"square of the diagonal\", but {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} (pp. 173\u2013174) argues that the term \u00cdB.SI<sub>8</sub> can refer either to the area of the square or the side of the square, and that in this case it should be understood as \"'square-side' or perhaps 'square root'\".  Similarly {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}} (p. 526) observe that the term often appears in the problems where completing the square is used to solve what would now be understood as quadratic equations, in which context it refers to the side of the completed square, but that it might also serve to indicate \"that a linear dimension or line segment is meant\".  {{harvtxt|Neugebauer|Sachs|1945}} (pp. 35, 39), on the other hand, exhibit instances where the term refers to outcomes of a wide variety of different mathematical operations and propose the translation \"'solving number of the width (or the diagonal).'\"  Similarly, {{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}} (p. 300) proposes the translation \"root\".\n\nIn Column 1, the first parts of both lines of the heading are damaged.  {{harvtxt|Neugebauer|Sachs|1945}} reconstructed the first word as ''takilti'' (a form of ''takiltum''), a reading that has been accepted by most subsequent researchers.  The heading was generally regarded as untranslatable until {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} proposed inserting a 1 in the broken-off part of line 2 and succeeded in deciphering the illegible final word, producing the reading given in the table above.  Based on a detailed linguistic analysis, Robson proposes translating ''takiltum'' as \"holding square\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, p. 191}}</ref>  {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}} survey the relatively few known occurrences of the word in Old Babylonian mathematics.  While they note that, in almost all cases, it refers to the linear dimension of the auxiliary square added to a figure in the process of completing the square, and is the quantity subtracted in the last step of solving a quadratic, they agree with Robson that in this instance it is to be understood as referring to the area of a square.  {{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, on the other hand, proposes that in the broken-off portion of the heading ''takiltum'' may have been preceded by ''a-\u0161a'' (\"area\").  There is now widespread agreement that the heading describes the relationship between the squares on the width (short side) and diagonal of a rectangle with length (long side) 1: subtracting (\"tearing out\") area 1 from the square on the diagonal leaves the area of the square on the width.\n\n===Errors===\nAs indicated in the table above, most scholars believe that the tablet contains six errors, and, with the exception of the two possible corrections in Row 15, there is widespread agreement as to what the correct values should be.  There is less agreement about how the errors occurred and what they imply with regard to the method of the tablet's computation.  A summary of the errors follows.\n\nThe errors in Row 2, Column 1 (neglecting to leave spaces between 50 and 6 for absent 1s and 10s) and Row 9, Column 2 (writing 9 for 8) are universally regarded as minor errors in copying from a work tablet (or possibly from an earlier copy of the table).  The error in Row 8, Column 1 (replacing the two sexagesimal digits 45 14 by their sum, 59) appears not to have been noticed in some of the early papers on the tablet.  It has sometimes been regarded (for example in {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}) as a simple mistake made by the scribe in the process of copying from a work tablet.  As discussed in {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, however, a number of scholars have proposed that this error is much more plausibly explained as an error in the calculation leading up to the number, for example, the scribe's overlooking a medial zero (blank space representing a zero digit) when performing a multiplication.  This explanation of the error is compatible with both of the main proposals for the method of construction of the table.  (See below.)\n\nThe remaining three errors have implications for the manner in which the tablet was computed.  The number 7&nbsp;12&nbsp;1 in Row 13, Column 2, is the square of the correct value, 2&nbsp;41.  Assuming either that the lengths in Column 2 were computed by taking the square root of the area of the corresponding square, or that the length and the area were computed together, this error might be explained either as neglecting to take the square root, or copying the wrong number from a work tablet.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, p. 298; {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, p. 192; {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, p, 538</ref>\n\nIf the error in Row 15 is understood as having written 56 instead of 28 in Column 2, then the error can be explained as a result of improper application of the trailing part algorithm, which is required if the table was computed by means of reciprocal pairs as described below.  This error amounts to applying an iterative procedure for removing regular factors common to the numbers in Columns 2 and 3 an improper number of times in one of the columns.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, p. 298; {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, p. 193; {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, p, 538</ref>\n\nThe number in Row 2, Column 3 has no obvious relationship to the correct number, and all explanations of how this number was obtained postulate multiple errors.  {{harvtxt|Bruins|1957}} observed that 3&nbsp;12&nbsp;01 might have been a simple miscopying of 3&nbsp;13.  If this were the case, then the explanation for the incorrect number 3&nbsp;13 is similar to the explanation of the error in Row 15.<ref>See also {{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, pp. 298\u2013299; {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, p. 193; {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, p, 537\u2013538.</ref>\n\nAn exception to the general consensus is {{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, where, in a departure from the earlier analysis by the same author ({{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}), it is hypothesized that the numbers in Row 15 are not in error, but were written as intended, and that the only error in Row 2, Column 3 was miswriting 3&nbsp;13 as 3&nbsp;12&nbsp;01.  Under this hypothesis, it is necessary to reinterpret Columns 2 and 3 as \"the factor-reduced cores of the front and diagonal\".  The factor-reduced core of a number is the number with perfect-square regular factors removed; computing the factor-reduced core was part of the process of calculating square roots in Old Babylonian mathematics.  According to Friberg, \"it was never the intention of the author of Plimpton 322 to reduce his series of ''normalized'' diagonal triples (with length equal to 1 in each triple) to a corresponding series of ''primitive'' diagonal triples (wth the front, length, and the diagonal equal to integers without common factors).\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, p. 449}}</ref>\n\n== Construction of the table ==\nScholars still differ on how these numbers were generated.  {{harvtxt|Buck|1980}} and {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} both identify two main proposals for the method of construction of the table: the method of generating pairs, proposed in {{harvtxt|Neugebauer|Sachs|1945}}, and the method of reciprocal pairs, proposed by Bruins<ref>{{harvtxt|Bruins|1949}}, {{harvtxt|Bruins|1951}}, {{harvtxt|Bruins|1957}}</ref> and elaborated on by Voils,<ref>unpublished, but described in {{harvtxt|Buck|1980}}</ref> {{harvtxt|Schmidt|1980}}, and Friberg.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, {{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}</ref> \n\n===Generating pairs===\nTo use modern terminology, if ''p'' and ''q'' are natural numbers such that ''p''>''q'' then (''p''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''q''<sup>2</sup>, 2''pq'', ''p''<sup>2</sup> + ''q''<sup>2</sup>) forms a Pythagorean triple.  The triple is primitive, that is the three triangle sides have no common factor, if ''p'' and ''q'' are [[coprime]] and not both odd.  Neugebauer and Sachs propose the tablet was generated by choosing ''p'' and ''q'' to be coprime regular numbers (but both may be odd\u2014see Row 15) and computing ''d'' = ''p''<sup>2</sup> + ''q''<sup>2</sup>, ''s'' = ''p''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''q''<sup>2</sup>, and ''l'' = 2''pq'' (so that ''l'' is also a regular number).  For example, line 1 would be generated by setting ''p'' = 12 and ''q'' = 5.  Buck and Robson both note that the presence of Column 1 is mysterious in this proposal, as it plays no role in the construction, and that the proposal does not explain why the rows of the table are ordered as they are, rather than, say, according to the value of <math>p</math> or <math>q</math>, which, under this hypothesis, might have been listed on columns to the left in the broken-off portion of the tablet.  Robson also argues that the proposal does not explain how the errors in the table could have plausibly arisen and is not in keeping with the mathematical culture of the time.\n\n===Reciprocal pairs===\nIn the reciprocal-pair proposal, the starting point is a single regular sexagesimal fraction ''x'' along with its reciprocal, 1/''x''.  \"Regular sexagesimal fraction\" means that ''x'' is a product of (possibly negative) powers of 2, 3, and 5.  The quantities (''x''\u22121/''x'')/2, 1, and (''x''+1/''x'')/2 then form what would now be called a rational Pythagorean triple.  Moreover, the three sides all have finite sexagesimal representations.\n\nAdvocates of this proposal point out that regular reciprocal pairs (''x'',1/''x'') show up in a different problem from roughly the same time and place as Plimpton 322, namely the problem of finding the sides of a rectangle of area 1 whose long side exceeds its short side by a given length ''c'' (which nowadays might be computed as the solutions to the [[quadratic equation]] <math display=\"inline\"> x-\\tfrac1x=c</math>).  {{harvtxt|Robson|2002}} analyzes the tablet, YBC 6967, in which such a problem is solved by calculating a sequence of intermediate values ''v''<sub>1</sub> = ''c''/2, ''v''<sub>2</sub> = ''v''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, ''v''<sub>3</sub> = 1 + ''v''<sub>2</sub>, and ''v''<sub>4</sub> = ''v''<sub>3</sub><sup>1/2</sup>, from which one can calculate ''x'' = ''v''<sub>4</sub> + ''v''<sub>1</sub> and 1/''x'' = ''v''<sub>4</sub> \u2212 ''v''<sub>1</sub>.  While the need to compute the square root of ''v''<sub>3</sub> will, in general result in answers that do not have finite sexagesimal representations, the problem on YBC 6967 was set up\u2014meaning the value of ''c'' was suitably chosen\u2014to give a nice answer.  This is, in fact, the origin of the specification above that ''x'' be a regular sexagesimal fraction:  choosing ''x'' in this way ensures that both ''x'' and 1/''x'' have finite sexagesimal representations.  To engineer a problem with a nice answer, the problem setter would simply need to choose such an ''x'' and let the initial datum ''c'' equal ''x'' \u2212 1/''x''.  As a side effect, this produces a rational Pythagorean triple, with legs ''v''<sub>1</sub> and 1 and hypotenuse ''v''<sub>4</sub>.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the problem on YBC 6967 actually solves the equation <math display=\"inline\"> x-\\tfrac{1\\ 00}x=x-\\tfrac{60}x=c</math>, which entails replacing the expression for ''v''<sub>3</sub> above with ''v''<sub>3</sub> = 60 + ''v''<sub>2</sub>.  The side effect of obtaining a rational triple is thereby lost as the sides become ''v''<sub>1</sub>, <math>\\sqrt{60}</math>, and ''v''<sub>4</sub>.  In this proposal it must be assumed that the Babylonians were familiar with both variants of the problem.\n\nRobson argues that the columns of Plimpton 322 can be interpreted as:\n::''v''<sub>3</sub> = ((''x'' + 1/''x'')/2)<sup>2</sup> = 1 + (''c''/2)<sup>2</sup> in the first column,\n::''a''\u00b7''v''<sub>1</sub> = ''a''\u00b7(''x'' \u2212 1/''x'')/2 for a suitable multiplier ''a'' in the second column, and\n::''a''\u00b7''v''<sub>4</sub> = ''a''\u00b7(''x'' + 1/''x'')/2 in the third column.\nIn this interpretation, ''x'' and 1/''x'' (or possibly ''v''<sub>1</sub> and ''v''<sub>4</sub>) would have appeared on the tablet in the broken-off portion to the left of the first column.  The presence of Column 1 is therefore explained as an intermediate step in the calculation, and the ordering of rows is by descending values of ''x'' (or ''v''<sub>1</sub>).  The multiplier ''a'' used to compute the values in columns 2 and 3, which can be thought of as a rescaling of the side lengths, arises from application of the \"trailing part algorithm\", in which both values are repeatedly multiplied by the reciprocal of any regular factor common to the last sexagesimal digits of both, until no such common factor remains.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, p. 24</ref>  As discussed above, the errors in the tablet all have natural explanations in the reciprocal-pair proposal.  On the other, Robson points out that the role of Columns 2 and 3 and the need for the multiplier ''a'' remain unexplained by this proposal, and suggests that the goal of the tablet's author was to provide parameters not for quadratic problems of the type solved on YBC 6967, but rather \"for some sort of right-triangle problems.\"  She also notes that the method used to generate the table and the use for which it was intended need not be the same.<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, pp. 201\u2013202}}</ref>\n\nStrong additional support for the idea that the numbers on the tablet were generated using reciprocal pairs comes from two tablets, MS 3052 and MS 3971, from the [[Sch\u00f8yen Collection]].  J\u00f6ran Friberg translated and analyzed the two tablets and discovered that both contain examples of the calculation of the diagonal and side lengths of a rectangle using reciprocal pairs as the starting point.  The two tablets are both Old Babylonian, of approximately the same age as Plimpton 322, and both are believed to come from Uruk, near Larsa.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, pp. 245, 255</ref>  Further analysis of the two tablets was carried out in {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}.  MS 3971 contains a list of five problems, the third of which begins with \"In order for you to see five diagonals\" and concludes with \"five diagonals\".  The given data for each of the five parts of the problem consist of a reciprocal pair.  For each part the lengths of both the diagonal and the width (short side) of a rectangle are computed.  The length (long side) is not stated but the calculation implies that it is taken to be 1.  In modern terms, the calculation proceeds as follows: given ''x'' and 1/''x'', first compute (''x''+1/''x'')/2, the diagonal.  Then compute\n\n: <math>\n\\sqrt{\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right]^2-1},\n</math>\n\nthe width.  Due to damage to the part of the tablet containing the first of the five parts, the statement of the problem for this part, apart from traces of the initial data, and the solution have been lost.  The other four parts are, for the most part intact, and all contain very similar text.   The reason for taking the diagonal to be half the sum of the reciprocal pair is not stated in the intact text.  Note that the computation of the width is equivalent to (''x''\u22121/''x'')/2, but that this more direct method of computation has not been used, the rule relating the square of the diagonal to the sum of the squares of the sides having been preferred.  \n\nThe text of the second problem of MS 3052 has also been badly damaged, but what remains is structured similarly to the five parts of MS 3971, Problem 3.  The problem contains a figure, which, according to Friberg, is likely a \"rectangle ''without'' any diagonals\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|2007}}, p. 275</ref>  {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}} emphasize that the preserved portions of the text explicitly state the length to be 1 and explicitly compute the 1 that gets subtracted from the square of the diagonal in the process of calculating the width as the square of the length.  The initial data and computed width and diagonal for the six problems on the two tablets are given in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Problem !! ''x'' !! 1/''x'' !! width !! length !! diagonal\n|-\n| MS 3052 \u00a7 2 || 2 || 1/2 || 3/4 || 1 || 5/4\n|-\n| MS 3971 \u00a7 3a || 16/15(?) || 15/16(?) || 31/480(?) || 1 || 481/480(?)\n|-\n| MS 3971 \u00a7 3b || 5/3 || 3/5 || 8/15 || 1 || 17/15\n|-\n| MS 3971 \u00a7 3c || 3/2 || 2/3 || 5/12 || 1 || 13/12\n|-\n| MS 3971 \u00a7 3d || 4/3 || 3/4 || 7/24 || 1 || 25/24\n|-\n| MS 3971 \u00a7 3e || 6/5 || 5/6 || 11/60 || 1 || 61/60\n|}\n\nThe parameters of MS 3971 \u00a7 3a are uncertain due to damage to the tablet.  Note that the parameters of the problem from MS 3052 correspond to a rescaling of the standard (3,4,5) right triangle, which appears as Row 11 of Plimpton 322.  None of the parameters in the problems from MS 3971 match any of the rows of Plimpton 322.  As discussed below, all of the rows of Plimpton 322 have ''x''\u22659/5, while all the problems on MS 3971 have ''x''<9/5.  The parameters of MS 3971 do, however, all correspond to rows of de Solla Price's proposed extension of the table of Plimpton 322, also discussed below.\n\nIt must be emphasized that the role of the reciprocal pair is different in the problem on YBC 6967 than on MS 3052 and MS 3971 (and by extension, on Plimpton 322).  In the problem of YBC 6967, the members of the reciprocal pair are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle of area 1.  The geometric meaning of ''x'' and 1/''x'' is not stated in the surviving text of the problems on MS 3052 and MS 3971.  The goal appears to have been to apply a known procedure for producing rectangles with finite sexagesimal width and diagonal.<ref>{{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}, p. 559</ref>  It should also be pointed out that the trailing point algorithm was not used to rescale the side lengths in these problems.\n\n===Comparison of the proposals===\nThe quantity ''x'' in the reciprocal-pair proposal corresponds to the ratio ''p''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''q'' in the generating-pair proposal.  Indeed, while the two proposals differ in calculation method, there is little mathematical difference between the results as both produce the same triples, apart from an overall factor of 2 in the case where ''p'' and ''q'' are both odd.  (Unfortunately, the only place where this occurs in the tablet is in Row 15, which contains an error and cannot therefore be used to distinguish between the proposals.)  Proponents of the reciprocal-pair proposal differ on whether ''x'' was computed from an underlying ''p'' and ''q'', but with only the combinations ''p''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''q'' and ''q''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''p'' used in tablet computations<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}</ref> or whether ''x'' was obtained directly from other sources, such as reciprocal tables.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bruins|1957}}, {{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}</ref>  One difficulty with the latter hypothesis is that some of the needed values of ''x'' or 1/''x'' are four-place sexagesimal numbers, and no four-place reciprocal tables are known.  Neugebauer and Sachs had, in fact, noted the possibility of using reciprocal pairs in their original work, and rejected it for this reason.  Robson, however, argues that known sources and computational methods of the Old Babylonian period can account for all values of ''x'' used.\n\n===Selection of pairs===\nNeugebauer and Sachs note that the triangle dimensions in the tablet range from those of a nearly isosceles right triangle (with short leg, 119, nearly equal to long leg, 120) to those of a right triangle with acute angles close to 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, and that the angle decreases in a fairly uniform fashion in steps of approximately 1\u00b0.  They suggest that the pairs ''p'', ''q'' were chosen deliberately with this goal in mind.\n\nIt was observed by {{harvtxt|de Solla Price|1964}}, working within the generating-pair framework, that every row of the table is generated by a ''q'' that satisfies 1&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''q''<60, that is, that ''q'' is always a single-digit sexagesimal number.  The ratio ''p''/''q'' takes its greatest value, 12/5=2.4, in Row 1 of the table, and is therefore always less than <math>\\sqrt{2}+1\\approx2.414</math>, a condition which guarantees that ''p''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''q''<sup>2</sup> is the long leg and 2''pq'' is the short leg of the triangle and which, in modern terms, implies that the angle opposite the leg of length ''p''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''q''<sup>2</sup>\nis less than 45\u00b0.  The ratio is least in Row 15 where ''p''/''q''=9/5 for an angle of about 31.9\u00b0.  Furthermore, there are exactly 15 regular ratios between 9/5 and 12/5 inclusive for which ''q'' is a single-digit sexagesimal number, and these are in one-to-one correspondence with the rows of the tablet.  He also points out that the even spacing of the numbers might not have been by design: it could also have arisen merely from the density of regular-number ratios in the range of numbers considered in the table.\n\nIt was argued by de Solla Price that the natural lower bound for the ratio would be 1, which corresponds to an angle of 0\u00b0.  He found that, maintaining the requirement that ''q'' be a single-digit sexagesimal number, there are 23 pairs in addition to the ones represented by the tablet, for a total of 38 pairs.  He notes that the vertical scoring between columns on the tablet has been continued onto the back, suggesting that the scribe might have intended to extend the table.  He claims that the available space would correctly accommodate 23 additional rows.  Proponents of the reciprocal-pair proposal have also advocated this scheme.<ref>{{harvtxt|Friberg|1981}}, {{harvtxt|Britton|Proust|Shnider|2011}}</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Robson|2001}} does not directly address this proposal, but does agree that the table was not \"full\".  She notes that in the reciprocal-pair proposal, every ''x'' represented in the tablet is at most a four-place sexagesimal number with at most a four-place reciprocal, and that the total number of places in ''x'' and 1/''x'' together is never more than 7.  If these properties are taken as requirements, there are exactly three values of ''x'' \"missing\" from the tablet, which she argues might have been omitted because they are unappealing in various ways.  She admits the \"shockingly ''ad hoc''\" nature of this scheme, which serves mainly as a rhetorical device for criticizing all attempts at divining the selection criteria of the tablet's author.<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2001}}, p. 199</ref>\n\n== Purpose and authorship ==\n{{harvs|authorlink=Otto E. Neugebauer|last=Neugebauer|first=Otto E.|year=1957|txt}} argued for a [[number theory|number-theoretic]] interpretation, but also believed that the entries in the table were the result of a deliberate selection process aimed at achieving the fairly regular decrease of the values in Column 1 within some specified bounds.\n\n{{harvtxt|Buck|1980}} and {{harvtxt|Robson|2002}} both mention the existence of a [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] explanation, which Robson attributes to the authors of various general histories and unpublished works, but which may derive from the observation in {{harvtxt|Neugebauer|Sachs|1945}} that the values of the first column can be interpreted as the squared [[Trigonometric function|secant or tangent]] (depending on the missing digit) of the angle opposite the short side of the right triangle described by each row, and the rows are sorted by these angles in roughly one-degree increments. In other words, if you take the number in the first column, discounting the (1), and derive its square root, and then divide this into the number in column two, the result will be the length of the long side of the triangle. Consequently, the square root of the number (minus the one) in the first column is what we would today call the [[tangent]] of the angle opposite the short side. If the (1) is included, the square root of that number is the [[Secant (trigonometry)|secant]]. <ref>See also {{citation | last = Joyce | first = David E. | title = Plimpton 322 | url = http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/mathhist/plimpnote.html | year = 1995 }} and {{Citation | last = Maor | first = Eli | title = Trigonometric Delights | publisher = Princeton University Press | isbn = 978-0-691-09541-7 | year = 1993 | chapter = Plimpton 322: The Earliest Trigonometric Table? | pages = 30\u201334 | chapter-url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6287.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100805230810/http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6287.html | archivedate = 5 August 2010 | accessdate = November 28, 2010 | url-status = dead }}.</ref> \n\nIn contraposition with these earlier explanations of the tablet,\n{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}} claims that historical, cultural and linguistic evidence all reveal the tablet to be more likely constructed from ''\"a list of [[Regular number|regular]] [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] [[Ordered pair|pairs]].\"''<ref>{{harvtxt|Robson|2002}}, p. 116.</ref>  Robson argues on linguistic grounds that the trigonometric theory is \"conceptually anachronistic\": it depends on too many other ideas not present in the record of Babylonian mathematics from that time.

The railway is now part of the [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] system.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Norfolk Southern]] operates on the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] mainline between [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. There is a bridge where train watchers can watch trains in a convenient location. This bridge is a single-lane old iron pedestrian bridge that once paralleled the bridge that carried State Route 53 traffic across the railroad.  The route was bypassed with the current alignment of Route 53 in 1936. Railfans are most welcome at this location.  There is a small motel in town that welcomes visitors and railfans.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cassandrarailroadoverlook.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116055215/http://www.cassandrarailroadoverlook.com/ |archive-date=2015-01-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThere are no traffic lights in the Borough of Cassandra.

EB1911|wstitle=Charleroi (Pennsylvania)|volume=5|page=897}}</ref> The 2010 census recorded a population of 4,120.\n\nThere has been a large-scale cessation of industrial activities in the region. The decrease in the population is associated with the decline of regional heavy and medium industries, especially the steel-making industry, all once fed by the cheap transportation on the [[Monongahela River]] which extends from upstream of Charleroi well into northern [[West Virginia]] and north & downstream past McKeesport to the mouth of the Monongahela at Pittsburgh. Colloquially, the stretch from Charleroi north to McKeesport (historically because of press coverage of High School sports leagues), is known as the \"Mon Valley\"; or by some speakers (politicians, reporters and weathermen), the school-league-term has long been extended to mean from the river mouth to northern West Virginia.\n\n== History ==\nCharleroi got its name from the Belgian city, [[Charleroi]]. There lived many [[Belgian Americans|Belgian immigrants]] in the Monongahela area at the end of the 19th century, some of whom were glass makers. The neighbouring city of Pittsburgh has had the Belgian Charleroi as a [[sister city]] since 1976.<ref>[http://www.charleroi-decouverte.be/index.php?id=133 Les villes jumel\u00e9es avec Charleroi]</ref>\n[[Image:First National Bank Charleroi Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|250px|First National Bank (1922)<br />National Register of Historic Places]]\nThe Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, today [[PPG Industries]], had one of its major factories located at the current chamber plaza, at one point employing up to a thousand employees, making it one of the largest glass factories in the world at the time. For years it was the home to one of [[Corning Glass]] Companies leading employers. Today it is home to [[Corelle Brands]], which makes [[Pyrex]]. In celebration of the 100th anniversary of Pyrex products, Charleroi renamed itself \"Pyrex, PA\" for 100 days in 2015.<ref name=\"pyrex100\">[http://triblive.com/lifestyles/history/8223960-74/pyrex-glass-says \"Pyrex, Pa.: Charleroi celebrating the centennial of its famed product\"] Trib Live, May 11, 2015</ref>\n\nCharleroi was home to one of the first movie theatres in the nation, the electric theatre which opened in October 1905.

EB1911|wstitle=Charleroi (Pennsylvania)|volume=5|page=897}}</ref> The 2010 census recorded a population of 4,120.\n\nThere has been a large-scale cessation of industrial activities in the region. The decrease in the population is associated with the decline of regional heavy and medium industries, especially the steel-making industry, all once fed by the cheap transportation on the [[Monongahela River]] which extends from upstream of Charleroi well into northern [[West Virginia]] and north & downstream past McKeesport to the mouth of the Monongahela at Pittsburgh. Colloquially, the stretch from Charleroi north to McKeesport (historically because of press coverage of High School sports leagues), is known as the \"Mon Valley\"; or by some speakers (politicians, reporters and weathermen), the school-league-term has long been extended to mean from the river mouth to northern West Virginia.\n\n== History ==\nCharleroi got its name from the Belgian city, [[Charleroi]]. There lived many [[Belgian Americans|Belgian immigrants]] in the Monongahela area at the end of the 19th century, some of whom were glass makers. The neighbouring city of Pittsburgh has had the Belgian Charleroi as a [[sister city]] since 1976.<ref>[http://www.charleroi-decouverte.be/index.php?id=133 Les villes jumel\u00e9es avec Charleroi]</ref>\n[[Image:First National Bank Charleroi Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|250px|First National Bank (1922)<br />National Register of Historic Places]]\nThe Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, today [[PPG Industries]], had one of its major factories located at the current chamber plaza, at one point employing up to a thousand employees, making it one of the largest glass factories in the world at the time. For years it was the home to one of [[Corning Glass]] Companies leading employers. Today it is home to [[Corelle Brands]], which makes [[Pyrex]].

In 1974, he received his doctorate from [[Jean Zinn-Justin]] at the [[University of Paris-Sud]] in [[Orsay]]. From 1975 to 2004 he was in the same capacity as an engineer of the [[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission]] in Saclay and at the same time (1995 through 1998) Professor at the [[Paris Diderot University]].  From 1995 to 2000 he was director of the CNRS theoretical physics department.

Like their Polynesian neighbours, the [[Tonga]]ns start their matches with a war dance \u2013 the Sipi Tau. They are members of the [[Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance]] (PIRA) along with [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]]. The Ikale Tahi achieved a historic 19\u201314 victory over France in the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], but having lost to [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] and [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], were unable to achieve what would have been their first-ever presence at the quarter-finals.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Tonga at the Rugby World Cup}}\n{{See also|Rugby union in Tonga}}\n\nRugby was brought to the region in the early 20th century by sailors and missionaries, and the [[Tonga Rugby Football Union]] was formed in late 1923. Tonga beat [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] 9\u20136 in their first test in 1924 played in the capital [[Nuku\u02bbalofa|Nuku{{Okina}}alofa]]. However, Tonga lost the second test 14\u20133 and drew the decider 0\u20130.\n\nBetween 1924 and 1938 Tonga and Fiji played three test series every alternate year. Matches between the two Pacific nations were hard fought; many have claimed that the ancient feuding wars between the Islanders were transplanted onto the rugby field. Troubles during the third Test of Fiji's 1928 tour to Tonga forced the game to be abandoned with Tonga leading 11\u20138. In 1954 Tonga played host to a touring Western Samoa.\n\nTonga beat [[New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby union team|New Zealand M\u0101ori]] in 1969, but had to wait until 1973 before they played their second test match, a 30\u201312 defeat against Australia in Sydney. They got their revenge when they beat Australia in Ballymore, [[Brisbane]] 16\u201311, scoring four tries to two in June 1973. The following year they traveled to the Arms Park for a non-cap international against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], a game that ended in a 26\u20137 defeat.\n\nThe first Tongan tour to Great Britain was in 1974, when they played 10 games, including those in Wales against East Wales, [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]], North Wales, [[Newport RFC|Newport]], West Wales and a Wales XV. The only tour victory was by 18\u201313 in the opener against East Wales. The 'tests' were lost by 44\u20138 to a Scotland XV and by 26\u20137 to the Wales XV.\n\nThey remained a little-known quantity in Europe until 1986, when Wales embarked on a tour of Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa. Early in the game against Tonga, Welsh flanker Mark Brown was knocked over by three Tongan forwards, leading to a mass brawl involving the entire team except Malcolm Dacey and Mark Titley. [[Robert Jones (rugby union)|Robert Jones]] describes the event in his book ''Raising The Dragon'' as \"the worst brawl I have ever seen on a rugby field.\" At the post-match dinner [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] was asked to give a few words in Welsh and as the hosts politely applauded he described them as \"the dirtiest team I have ever played against\"{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nTonga were drawn to play Wales again in the inaugural [[1987 Rugby World Cup]] in New Zealand. The previous meeting, plus the decision to rest some of the leading players, led to a poor Welsh performance though they managed to win 29\u201316. Tonga lost its other two games to Ireland (32\u20139) and Canada (37\u20134).\n\nThey failed to qualify for the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]]. In 1994 they won the South Pacific championship on try count and so qualified for the [[Super 10 (Southern Hemisphere competition)|Super 10]], in which they finished bottom of their pool with only one point.\n\nThey qualified for the [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995 World Cup]] ahead of Fiji on points difference. Tonga managed only two victories in the next two World Cups, against the 29\u201311 [[Ivory Coast national rugby union team|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] in 1995 and [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] in 1999. The win over the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire brought tragedy when Ivorian winger Max Brito was left paralyzed.\n\nJune 1999 brought a 20\u201316 defeat of [[France national rugby union team|France]] in [[Nuku\u02bbalofa|Nuku{{Okina}}alofa]] over a touring France but in 2000 they were defeated 102\u20130 (including 15 tries) by [[All Blacks|New Zealand]].\n\nAfter losing their first four matches to Fiji and Samoa, Tonga finished third in the Oceania qualifying group. As a result, they had to play home and away matches against Papua New Guinea, which they won 47\u201314 and 84\u201312, followed by a play-off against South Korea, who finished as runners-up in the Asian section. Tonga thrashed them 75\u20130 and 119\u20130.\n\nAt the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] Tonga lost all their games and finished bottom of their pool. Although they kept Wales to 20\u201327, they were again thrashed by New Zealand 91\u20137.\n\nIn 2007 Tonga participated in the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], winning two of their pool matches and nearly defeating the eventual champions, South Africa, before losing 30\u201325.\n\nTonga achieved one of the most unexpected victories in Rugby World Cup history with their 19\u201314 win over France in the 2011 World Cup.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOn 24 November 2012, Tonga beat [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], at [[Pittodrie Stadium]], 21\u201315 for their first victory over a traditional rugby power on a European pitch.\n\n==Sipi Tau==\n{{main|Kailao}}\nLike several Pacific rugby nations, Tonga has a pre-game war dance, called the Sipi Tau. It is a form of the [[Kailao]], which was originally a war dance that was imported to Tonga from [[Wallis Island]]. It is usually performed at both public and private ceremonies.\n\nDuring the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] in [[Australia]], in Tonga's match against the [[All Blacks]], the All Blacks began their traditional [[Haka of the All Blacks|haka]], and then Tonga answered to the haka through the sipi tau whilst the All Blacks were performing, bringing the teams within metres of one another just prior to kick-off.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rugbyunion/items/s974777.htm Haka and Sipi Tau set Lang Park alight] ABC</ref>\n\n==Wins against Tier 1 nations==\n{{Rugbybox collapsible2\n|date=30 June

''{{okina}}Ikale Tahi (Sea Eagles)''. Like their Polynesian neighbours, the [[Tonga]]ns start their matches with a war dance \u2013 the Sipi Tau. They are members of the [[Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance]] (PIRA) along with [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]]. The Ikale Tahi achieved a historic 19\u201314 victory over France in the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], but having lost to [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] and [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], were unable to achieve what would have been their first-ever presence at the quarter-finals.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Tonga at the Rugby World Cup}}\n{{See also|Rugby union in Tonga}}\n\nRugby was brought to the region in the early 20th century by sailors and missionaries, and the [[Tonga Rugby Football Union]] was formed in late 1923. Tonga beat [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] 9\u20136 in their first test in 1924 played in the capital [[Nuku\u02bbalofa|Nuku{{Okina}}alofa]]. However, Tonga lost the second test 14\u20133 and drew the decider 0\u20130.\n\nBetween 1924 and 1938 Tonga and Fiji played three test series every alternate year. Matches between the two Pacific nations were hard fought; many have claimed that the ancient feuding wars between the Islanders were transplanted onto the rugby field. Troubles during the third Test of Fiji's 1928 tour to Tonga forced the game to be abandoned with Tonga leading 11\u20138. In 1954 Tonga played host to a touring Western Samoa.\n\nTonga beat [[New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby union team|New Zealand M\u0101ori]] in 1969, but had to wait until 1973 before they played their second test match, a 30\u201312 defeat against Australia in Sydney. They got their revenge when they beat Australia in Ballymore, [[Brisbane]] 16\u201311, scoring four tries to two in June 1973. The following year they traveled to the Arms Park for a non-cap international against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], a game that ended in a 26\u20137 defeat.\n\nThe first Tongan tour to Great Britain was in 1974, when they played 10 games, including those in Wales against East Wales, [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]], North Wales, [[Newport RFC|Newport]], West Wales and a Wales XV. The only tour victory was by 18\u201313 in the opener against East Wales. The 'tests' were lost by 44\u20138 to a Scotland XV and by 26\u20137 to the Wales XV.\n\nThey remained a little-known quantity in Europe until 1986, when Wales embarked on a tour of Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa. Early in the game against Tonga, Welsh flanker Mark Brown was knocked over by three Tongan forwards, leading to a mass brawl involving the entire team except Malcolm Dacey and Mark Titley. [[Robert Jones (rugby union)|Robert Jones]] describes the event in his book ''Raising The Dragon'' as \"the worst brawl I have ever seen on a rugby field.\" At the post-match dinner [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] was asked to give a few words in Welsh and as the hosts politely applauded he described them as \"the dirtiest team I have ever played against\"{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nTonga were drawn to play Wales again in the inaugural [[1987 Rugby World Cup]] in New Zealand. The previous meeting, plus the decision to rest some of the leading players, led to a poor Welsh performance though they managed to win 29\u201316. Tonga lost its other two games to Ireland (32\u20139) and Canada (37\u20134).\n\nThey failed to qualify for the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]]. In 1994 they won the South Pacific championship on try count and so qualified for the [[Super 10 (Southern Hemisphere competition)|Super 10]], in which they finished bottom of their pool with only one point.\n\nThey qualified for the [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995 World Cup]] ahead of Fiji on points difference. Tonga managed only two victories in the next two World Cups, against the 29\u201311 [[Ivory Coast national rugby union team|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] in 1995 and [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] in 1999. The win over the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire brought tragedy when Ivorian winger Max Brito was left paralyzed.\n\nJune 1999 brought a 20\u201316 defeat of [[France national rugby union team|France]] in [[Nuku\u02bbalofa|Nuku{{Okina}}alofa]] over a touring France but in 2000 they were defeated 102\u20130 (including 15 tries) by [[All Blacks|New Zealand]].\n\nAfter losing their first four matches to Fiji and Samoa, Tonga finished third in the Oceania qualifying group. As a result, they had to play home and away matches against Papua New Guinea, which they won 47\u201314 and 84\u201312, followed by a play-off against South Korea, who finished as runners-up in the Asian section. Tonga thrashed them 75\u20130 and 119\u20130.\n\nAt the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] Tonga lost all their games and finished bottom of their pool. Although they kept Wales to 20\u201327, they were again thrashed by New Zealand 91\u20137.\n\nIn 2007 Tonga participated in the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], winning two of their pool matches and nearly defeating the eventual champions, South Africa, before losing 30\u201325.\n\nTonga achieved one of the most unexpected victories in Rugby World Cup history with their 19\u201314 win over France in the 2011 World Cup.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOn 24 November 2012, Tonga beat [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], at [[Pittodrie Stadium]], 21\u201315 for their first victory over a traditional rugby power on a European pitch.\n\n==Sipi Tau==\n{{main|Kailao}}\nLike several Pacific rugby nations, Tonga has a pre-game war dance, called the Sipi Tau. It is a form of the [[Kailao]], which was originally a war dance that was imported to Tonga from [[Wallis Island]]. It is usually performed at both public and private ceremonies.\n\nDuring the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] in [[Australia]], in Tonga's match against the [[All Blacks]], the All Blacks began their traditional [[Haka of the All Blacks|haka]], and then Tonga answered to the haka through the sipi tau whilst the All Blacks were performing, bringing the teams within metres of one another just prior to kick-off.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rugbyunion/items/s974777.htm Haka and Sipi Tau set Lang Park alight] ABC</ref>\n\n==Wins against Tier 1 nations==\n{{Rugbybox collapsible2\n|date=30 June

Tonenshau in Brussels where his mother had gone to nurse his father after being severely injured in the Battle of Waterloo. At the age of seven William started working in the Delabole slate quarries in Cornwall, where his father worked. At the age of 26 Chapman emigrated to the United States, where he leased property in Northampton County which he later purchased and began the Chapman Slate Company. While the quarries were originally opened in 1850,  The company itself was officially incorporated by a special act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania in 1864 with a capital stock of $300,000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Portrait and Biographical Record of Lehigh, Northampton and Carbon Counties, Pennsylvania|last=|first=|publisher=Chapman Publishing Company|year=1894|isbn=|location=Chicago, Ill|pages=821\u2013823}}</ref>\n\nThe Quarry itself grew to a considerable size measuring from 700 to 800 feet along a longitudinal joint and was about 200 feet wide and 300 feet deep.\n[[File:Chapmans Quarries (2674241513).jpg|thumb|A Birdseye view of Chapman's Quarries]]\nChapman died in Bethlehem, PA in 1903 at the age of 86.\n\n==Geography==\nChapman is located at {{Coord|40|45|42|N|75|24|15|W|type:city}} (40.761567, -75.404270).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and 0.0% is water.
