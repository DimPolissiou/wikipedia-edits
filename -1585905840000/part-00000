The experienced director [[Roland Emmerich]], known for films such as ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' and ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'', acted as executive producer, with [[Gabriele Walther]] and W\u00f6bke acting as producers.\n\nThe film is about a young woman named Marie ([[Hannah Herzsprung]]), her boyfriend Phillip ([[Lars Eidinger]]) and her younger sister Leonie ([[Lisa Vicari]]) who are driving through the blighted wasteland of Germany after a [[climate crisis]] has destroyed society. Parched by thirst, the trio scavenge for water, gas and supplies. The trio are joined by a male survivor, Tom ([[Stipe Erceg]]), who they encounter in the ruins. Later, after the group is ambushed by [[carjacker]]s who abduct Leonie and take the vehicle, all of the group end up being captured by a farming family who hold survivors in the farm's former [[slaughterhouse]] to use them as a [[Cannibalism|source of food]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film tells the story of a small group of survivors in post-apocalyptic [[Germany]] in the year 2016. Solar flares have destroyed the earth's atmosphere and global temperatures have risen by 10&nbsp;\u00b0C. The sun is so hot that travel outside during daylight hours is dangerous. Crops have failed, little water or food is available and there is a breakdown of social order. The film tells the story of a young woman named Marie, her younger sister Leonie and Phillip, a young man who is also romantically connected with Marie. The trio are travelling through the dry wasteland in a [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] station wagon with metal mesh on the windows. To avoid the sun's harsh rays, newspaper and cardboard have been taped over the inside of the windows, except for a narrow strip for the driver to see. They are heading for the mountains, where rumor has it that water can still be found. They scavenge wrecked cars and gas stations for extra gas, water (from heating pipes and toilets) and food, always alert for hostile survivors who might attack them.\n\nWhen the trio find a ruined gas station, Phillip tries to obtain gasoline from the station's underground tanks and from abandoned vehicles while the women scavenge for supplies in the buildings. While the trio are working away, a hooded man steals food and water from their car and then holds Leonie as a hostage. After Phillip and the attacker fight and the aggressor is subdued, they agree to a truce of sorts. The attacker, whose name is Tom, tells them he is a mechanic. Phillip agrees to bring Tom along as a passenger in the car, on their search for water, if Tom will repair the heat-damaged engine. The quartet drive along through the roads towards the mountains until they stop due to a huge metal structure that is blocking the roadway. The group work together to move the blockage and then three of the group climb down a hill to look at a wrecked car for items to scavenge, leaving Leonie in the car alone.\n\nSuddenly, the group hear Leonie's screams, and they realize the blocked road was a [[ambush|trap]]. Leonie is abducted by [[carjacking|carjackers]]. Although the others try to help her, it is too late. When the trio of remaining survivors reunite in the woods, Tom convinces them to try to free Leonie. Tom spots smoke in the distance and encourages the group to investigate. The smoke is coming from a large fire at a survivors' encampment, where Leonie and other hostages are kept chained up. Tom convinces Marie and Phillip, who are both terrified of the abductors, that they should throw a [[Molotov cocktail]] to create a diversion so that Marie can take the car back and rescue Leonie. The rescue attempt misfires; Marie manages to get the car started and escape with Phillip, but Phillip could not break Leonie's chains so the pair leave without her; moreover, Phillip's foot is badly injured in a fight with one of the abductors. Phillip encourages Marie to consider Leonie a lost cause, but Marie insists on trying to rescue her. Marie leaves alone to search for Leonie. Marie falls asleep in a ruined church, and is awakened by a middle-aged woman. The woman offers Marie water and invites her to come to her family farm as a guest.\n\nMarie sleeps in the woman's barn, only to awake to find herself locked in. Peering out the slats of the barn, she sees what looks like abducted captives being led about. The woman opens the locked door and tells Marie that Phillip will be used like livestock, in the absence of other food. The middle-aged woman tells Marie that she and Leonie will be forced to marry the woman's two adult sons. When one of the sons opens the door, Marie engages in kissing with him, but then strikes him with a large piece of wood. Injured, he tries to choke her, but then Leonie smashes a heavy object on him, knocking him out. Leonie escapes from the barn and hides in the woods, but Marie is bound and put in the [[slaughterhouse]], where she witnesses Phillip's execution. She manages to cut her ziplock cuffs and escape. She opens a locked door in the barn, where she finds many captives, including Tom. The captives flee from the farm, with the family in pursuit. Tom fights with and dispatches several of the farmers. Marie manages to escape and she runs through the woods in search of her sister. When she finds her sister, she is being bound by one of the middle-aged woman's adult sons. The middle-age woman confronts Marie, who kills the older woman and releases Leonie. The two sisters and Tom flee to the mountains, where they find water. Up in the sky, they see birds.

The experienced director [[Roland Emmerich]], known for films such as ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' and ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'', acted as executive producer, with [[Gabriele Walther]] and W\u00f6bke acting as producers.\n\nThe film is about a young woman named Marie ([[Hannah Herzsprung]]), her boyfriend Phillip ([[Lars Eidinger]]) and her younger sister Leonie ([[Lisa Vicari]]) who are driving through the blighted wasteland of Germany after a [[climate crisis]] has destroyed society. Parched by thirst, the trio scavenge for water, gas and supplies. The trio are joined by a male survivor, Tom ([[Stipe Erceg]]), who they encounter in the ruins. Later, after the group is ambushed by [[carjacker]]s who abduct Leonie and take the vehicle, all of the group end up being captured by a farming family who hold survivors in the farm's former [[slaughterhouse]] to use them as a [[Cannibalism|source of food]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film tells the story of a small group of survivors in post-apocalyptic [[Germany]] in the year 2016. Solar flares have destroyed the earth's atmosphere and global temperatures have risen by 10&nbsp;\u00b0C. The sun is so hot that travel outside during daylight hours is dangerous. Crops have failed, little water or food is available and there is a breakdown of social order. The film tells the story of a young woman named Marie, her younger sister Leonie and Phillip, a young man who is also romantically connected with Marie. The trio are travelling through the dry wasteland in a [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] station wagon with metal mesh on the windows. To avoid the sun's harsh rays, newspaper and cardboard have been taped over the inside of the windows, except for a narrow strip for the driver to see. They are heading for the mountains, where rumor has it that water can still be found. They scavenge wrecked cars and gas stations for extra gas, water (from heating pipes and toilets) and food, always alert for hostile survivors who might attack them.\n\nWhen the trio find a ruined gas station, Phillip tries to obtain gasoline from the station's underground tanks and from abandoned vehicles while the women scavenge for supplies in the buildings. While the trio are working away, a hooded man steals food and water from their car and then holds Leonie as a hostage. After Phillip and the attacker fight and the aggressor is subdued, they agree to a truce of sorts. The attacker, whose name is Tom, tells them he is a mechanic. Phillip agrees to bring Tom along as a passenger in the car, on their search for water, if Tom will repair the heat-damaged engine. The quartet drive along through the roads towards the mountains until they stop due to a huge metal structure that is blocking the roadway. The group work together to move the blockage and then three of the group climb down a hill to look at a wrecked car for items to scavenge, leaving Leonie in the car alone.\n\nSuddenly, the group hear Leonie's screams, and they realize the blocked road was a [[ambush|trap]]. Leonie is abducted by [[carjacking|carjackers]]. Although the others try to help her, it is too late. When the trio of remaining survivors reunite in the woods, Tom convinces them to try to free Leonie. Tom spots smoke in the distance and encourages the group to investigate. The smoke is coming from a large fire at a survivors' encampment, where Leonie and other hostages are kept chained up. Tom convinces Marie and Phillip, who are both terrified of the abductors, that they should throw a [[Molotov cocktail]] to create a diversion so that Marie can take the car back and rescue Leonie. The rescue attempt misfires; Marie manages to get the car started and escape with Phillip, but Phillip could not break Leonie's chains so the pair leave without her; moreover, Phillip's foot is badly injured in a fight with one of the abductors. Phillip encourages Marie to consider Leonie a lost cause, but Marie insists on trying to rescue her. Marie leaves alone to search for Leonie. Marie falls asleep in a ruined church, and is awakened by a middle-aged woman. The woman offers Marie water and invites her to come to her family farm as a guest.\n\nMarie sleeps in the woman's barn, only to awake to find herself locked in. Peering out the slats of the barn, she sees what looks like abducted captives being led about. The woman opens the locked door and tells Marie that Phillip will be used like livestock, in the absence of other food. The middle-aged woman tells Marie that she and Leonie will be forced to marry the woman's two adult sons. When one of the sons opens the door, Marie engages in kissing with him, but then strikes him with a large piece of wood. Injured, he tries to choke her, but then Leonie smashes a heavy object on him, knocking him out. Leonie escapes from the barn and hides in the woods, but Marie is bound and put in the [[slaughterhouse]], where she witnesses Phillip's execution. She manages to cut her ziplock cuffs and escape. She opens a locked door in the barn, where she finds many captives, including Tom. The captives flee from the farm, with the family in pursuit. Tom fights with and dispatches several of the farmers. Marie manages to escape and she runs through the woods in search of her sister. When she finds her sister, she is being bound by one of the middle-aged woman's adult sons. The middle-age woman confronts Marie, who kills the older woman and releases Leonie. The two sisters and Tom flee to the mountains, where they find water. Up in the sky, they see birds. Looking over the ridge at a chain of hills in hope of a better fate there, they can see nothing but even more blighted wasteland down in the valley.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Hannah Herzsprung]] as Marie\n* [[Stipe Erceg]] as Tom\n* [[Angela Winkler]] as farmer Elisabeth \n* [[Michael Kranz]] as Micha (voice)\n* [[Yoann Blanc]] as Micha\n* [[Lars Eidinger]] as Phillip\n* [[Lisa Vicari]] as Leonie\n* [[Anne Hartung]] as Sophia\n* [[Lilo Baur]] as Frenchwoman\n* [[Marco Calamandrei]] as Frenchman\n* [[Ellen Schweiger]] as Grandma\n* [[Christoph Gaugler]] as farmer Br\u00fcckner\n\n== Release ==\n''Hell'' opened in September 2011 in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/46701/trailer-tim-fehlbaums-hell-now-has-subtitles|title=Trailer for Tim Fehlbaum's Hell Now Has Subtitles|last=Moore|first=Debi|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>  On 10 July 2012, it was released on video-on-demand, and on 21 August 2012, it was released on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/56783/new-trailer-thats-hot-hell|title=New Trailer That's as Hot as Hell|last=Barton|first=Steve|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nJay Weissberg of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as \"a tightly crafted post-apocalyptic survival tale that makes up in conviction what it lacks in originality.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2011/film/reviews/hell-2-1117945878/|title=Review: 'Hell'|last=Weissberg|first=Jay|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>  Karsten Kastelan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, \"And while this Swiss-German co-production's straightforward storytelling and white-knuckle suspense are commendable, its success will in large part depend on how much agony and human deceit audiences are willing to take.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/review/hell-film-review-208031|title=Hell: Film Review|last=Kastelan|first=Karsten|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>  Paul Mount of ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' rated it 7/10 stars and wrote that though it lacks originality, it is a \"stark and powerful film\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-and-blu-ray-home-entertainment-reviews/2866-blu-ray-review-hell|title=Blu-ray Review: HELL|last=Mount|first=Paul|work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>  Dan Geary of ''[[Total Film]]'' rated it 1/5 stars and criticized the cinematography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/blu-ray/hell-2011|title=Hell (2011)|last=Geary|first=Dan|work=[[Total Film]]|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>  Mike Ferraro of [[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \"Hell does a great job of creating atmosphere and suspense.

Famously Prince performed at The Camden Palace in 1988 on his Love Sexy Tour with Ronnie Wood (Rolling Stones) as guest guitarist, he later that evening held a invite only after party in the club and performed a couple of further impromptu numbers that night. Prince appeared and performed further full concerts at the club in later decades. Husker Du played their first show outside of the US at the venue in 1985.\n\nThe Early Nineties saw Delerium leave the Camden Palace club, and as Rave music took hold, Camden Palace became a mecca for the burgeoning Rave music Scene 1989 - 1992. The DJs during this period were DMC DJ John Saunderson and Chris Paul early PA performances included both Prodigy and NJoi. Appearances from live bands continued, however, including Blur and Cardiacs.\n\nIn the later 1990s the Camden Palace was famous for holding its weekly rave events and was illuminated with UV lights, state of the art sound system and d\u00e9cor of the rave scene. During this time the legendary weekly House/Acid house event, Clockwork orange was held on a Saturday with Andy Manston and Danny Gould running until 2001, Frantic ( Hard House/Trance) and the iconic House/Trance event, Peach with Graham Gold, Pele, Darren Pearce and Dave Lambert running until the Camden palace closed in 2004.\n\nAlthough in recent years such events have made a return to the venue since its incarnation as Koko, including reunions of peach and clockwork orange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clockworkorange.co/history/ |title=History &#124; Clockwork Orange |website=Clockworkorange.co |date=18 August 2014 |accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==2004 restoration and relaunch==\nBy 2004 the Camden Palace was rundown and in a state of disuse.<ref name=brief/><ref name=go/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dontstayin.com/uk/london/koko |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130094541/http://www.dontstayin.com/uk/london/koko |archivedate=30 January 2013  }}</ref> That year the theatre was purchased by [[Oliver Bengough]] and his company Mint Entertainment.<ref name=haute/><ref name=brief/> Bengough saw the potential of the theatre and embarked on a multimillion-pound [[Restoration (building)|restoration]] process lasting more than six months.<ref name=design/><ref name=go/> The restoration process included all new technical facilities, enabling the scope of operations to be broadened to include [[Live concert|live concert performances]], [[club night]]s, [[Corporate sponsorship|corporate events]] and [[television production]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://livedesignonline.com/news/show_business_koko_londons_new/ |title=KOKO: London's New Live Music Venue &#124; Business & People News content from Live Design |website=Livedesignonline.com |date=5 October 2004 |accessdate=25 September 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819151446/http://livedesignonline.com/news/show_business_koko_londons_new |archivedate=19 August 2014  }}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described the modern interior amenities and the building's historic facade as \"lend[ing] a sense of grandeur to any gig\".<ref name=design/><ref name=best/><ref name=unlike>{{cite web|last=Fumagalli|first=Max|title=KOKO There's no business like monkey business|url=http://unlike.net/london/after-dark/koko|website=Unlike.net|accessdate=25 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017231053/http://unlike.net/london/after-dark/koko|archivedate=17 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince restoration, KOKO's commitment to sustainability has been recognised with an award for Environmental Excellence in Camden Organisations (EECO), for Innovation in Waste Management and Recycling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juliesbicycle.com/about-jb/news/944,KOKO+wins+Environmental+Excellence+in+Camden+Organisations+%28EECO%29.html|title=News / Julie's Bicycle|website=Juliesbicycle.com|accessdate=25 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129020657/http://www.juliesbicycle.com/about-jb/news/944,KOKO+wins+Environmental+Excellence+in+Camden+Organisations+%28EECO%29.html|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The venue has been praised for \u2018the continued exceptional effort by staff to achieve a 95% recycling rate in the difficult events and entertainment industry, and for the use of recycled materials within the building in order to close the recycling loop.\u2019<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenlondon.net/content/koko-wins-environment-award |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917112658/http://www.greenlondon.net/content/koko-wins-environment-award |archivedate=17 September 2013  }}</ref>\n\nThe key points in KOKO's innovative recycling and waste management strategy include: \n* Recycling paper and cardboards (including flyers), as well as approximately 30,960 glass bottles, 20,088 aluminium cans and 77,166 plastic cups every month; \n* Replacing 982 light bulbs with GLOWB low energy light bulbs; \n* Reducing emissions, by working with \u2018[[Carbon Trust|The Carbon Trust]]' and \u2018Better Climate for Camden\u2019: by switching to a green energy supplier, KOKO aims to prevent the release into the atmosphere of 520 tonnes of CO2 over the next 12 months; \n* as KOKO currently produces approximately 310.809 tonnes of CO2 per annum, they have teamed up with Solar Aid who supply Solar Lanterns to under-developed countries to help offset this.\n\n==Notable events==\nOn 19 March 1964, [[The Rolling Stones]] performed there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.koko.uk.com/history-koko|title=History of KOKO {{!}} KOKO London|website=www.koko.uk.com|language=en|access-date=23 December 2017}}</ref> On 10 March 1970, [[Faces (band)|The Faces]] performed there.

The ratios can be done in any number of phases to facilitate the reaction.
