In 1805 he married Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Lasserey, daughter of Jacques Ambroise Lasserey. They also had one child, Count Alexander Henryk, French Henri Alexandre.  Due to his implication in the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|1794 uprising]] of [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]] he got stripped of his title of Prince, the title was reinstated 1903 by [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] to Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Marguerite Wolodkowicz, his granddaughter. Henry also got granted the title of count by [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]]. <ref>Autobiographic Novel, \"Printemps gris\" ,written by Willy de Spens d\u00b4Estignols, Edtitions de la table ronde 1974</ref> \n\nSon of Josef [[Wo\u0142odkowicz]] and of Regina Broniec, he was a prominent member of the [[szlachta|Polish nobility]] and [[military officer]], who after the [[partitions of Poland]] emigrated to [[France]] in 1796 with 2 r\u00e9giments paid on his own money and aided the [[French Revolution]], becoming an officer and [[cavalry]] commander in the [[French Army]]. From 1807 he served in the military of [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a temporary Polish state created and allied with [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Member of the French [[La Grande Arm\u00e9e]] in the [[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia]], he was taken prisoner by [[Russia]]ns during the [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|battle of Smolensk]] in 1812<!--original French text gives 1813, see talk-->, in which his first son Joseph got killed, and [[deportation|deported]] to [[Siberia]]. \n\n\nAccording to some his name his carved on the Arc de Triomphe as \"Henry\", his surname given by Napoleon. The Wolodkowicz family tried three times to correct the name to Wolodkowicz, in 1825, 1928 with the backing of the polish embassy and 1980. The French government always replied, that they can\u00b4t alter a historic monument. Others argue it is the name of a French colonel Claude Fran\u00e7ois Henry who died 1812 in Spain during the siege Valencia. \n\n==External links==\n*[http://napoleon.org.pl/index.php/biografie/generalowie-ksiestwa-warszawskiego/382-wolodkowicz-jan-chrzciciel-henryk-1765-1825 Andrzej Malejka, ''Wo\u0142odkowicz Jan Chrzciciel Henryk (1765-1825)'' (pol.)]\n*[http://arnauld.divry.pagesperso-orange.fr/Henry.htm Henry, Claude Fran\u00e7ois (fr.)]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Jan_Henryk_Wo\u0142odkowicz]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wolodkowicz, Jan Henryk}}\n[[Category:1765 births]]\n[[Category:1825 deaths]]\n[[Category:Polish nobility]]\n[[Category:Polish generals in other armies]]\n\n\n{{Poland-noble-stub}}\n{{Poland-mil-bio-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:Jan Henryk Wo\u0142odkowicz.png|thumb|Jan Henryk Wolodkowicz]]\n\n\n'''Jan Henryk [[Wo\u0142odkowicz]]''' ({{Lang-fr|Henri Jean-Witold Wolodkowicz}}) (1765\u20131825), son of Josef [[Wo\u0142odkowicz]] and of Regina Broniec, was a prominent member of the [[szlachta|Polish nobility]] and [[military officer]], who after the [[partitions of Poland]] emigrated to [[France]] in 1796 with 2 r\u00e9giments paid on his own money and aided the [[French Revolution]], becoming an officer and [[cavalry]] commander in the [[French Army]].

The founding Letters Patent were amended by succeeding monarchs on a number of occasions, such as by [[James VI and I|James I]] in 1613 and most notably in 1637 by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (who increased the number of fellows from seven to sixteen, established the Board \u2013 then the Provost and the seven senior Fellows \u2013 and reduced the panel of Visitors in size) and supplemented as late as the reign of Queen Victoria (and later still amended by the [[Oireachtas]] in 2000).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/corporate/legal-faq/|title=Legal FAQ - Secretary's Office - Trinity College Dublin|website=www.tcd.ie|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref>\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\nDuring the eighteenth century Trinity College was seen as the university of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. [[Parliament of Ireland|Parliament]], meeting on the other side of College Green, made generous grants for building. The first building of this period was the Old Library building, begun in 1712, followed by the Printing House and the Dining Hall. During the second half of the century, Parliament Square slowly emerged. The great building drive was completed in the early nineteenth century by Botany Bay, the square which derives its name in part from the herb garden it once contained (and which was succeeded by Trinity College's own Botanic Gardens). Following early steps in [[Catholic Emancipation]], Catholics were first allowed to apply for admission in 1793,<ref>Catholic Relief Act, 1793, section 13</ref> prior to the equivalent change at the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. Certain disabilities remained.   In December 1845 [[Denis Caulfield Heron]] was the subject of a hearing at Trinity College. Heron had previously been examined and, on merit, declared a scholar of the college but had not been allowed to take up his place due to his Catholic religion. Heron appealed to the Courts which issued a [[writ of mandamus]] requiring the case to be adjudicated by the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]] and the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Primate of Ireland]].<ref>[[The Times]], ''Important Collegiate Question., Denis C. Heron'' 13 December 1845; pg3 col E</ref> The decision of [[Richard Whately]] and [[John George de la Poer Beresford]] was that Heron would remain excluded from Scholarship.<ref>The Times; ''Ireland. Protestant Alliance''; 9 January 1846; pg5 col D</ref> This decision confirmed that the legal position remained that persons who were not Anglicans (Presbyterians were also affected) could not be elected to Scholarship, Fellowship or be made a Professor. However within less than three decades of this, all disabilities imposed on Catholics were repealed as in 1873, all religious tests were abolished, except for entry to the [[divinity school]].  However, the Irish Catholic bishops responding to the increased ease, due to these changes, with which Catholics could attend an Institution which the Bishops saw as thoroughly Protestant in ethos, and in light of the establishment of the Catholic University, in 1871 implemented a general ban on Catholics entering Trinity College, with few exceptions.  \"The ban\" despite its longevity, is associated in the popular mind with [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] [[John Charles McQuaid]] as he was made responsible for enforcing the ban from 1956 until it was rescinded by the Catholic Bishops of Ireland in 1970, shortly before McQuaid's retirement. Prior to 1956, it was the responsibility of the local Bishop.\n\n[[File:Bram Stoker1.jpg|thumb|[[Bram Stoker]]]]\n\nThe nineteenth century was also marked by important developments in the professional schools. The law school was reorganised after the middle of the century. Medical teaching had been given in the college since 1711, but it was only after the establishment of the school on a firm basis by legislation in 1800, and under the inspiration of one Macartney, that it was in a position to play its full part, with such teachers as Graves and Stokes, in the great age of Dublin medicine. The Engineering School was established in 1842 and was one of the first of its kind in Ireland and Britain.\n\n===20th century===\nIn April 1900, [[Queen Victoria]] visited College Green in Dublin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.qut.edu.au/4115/|title=Queen Victoria's Royal visit to Dublin, Ireland, 4th April - 26th April, 1900|last=L'Estrange|first=Robert Augustus Henry|date=1900|website=digitalcollections.qut.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\nWomen were admitted to Trinity College as full members for the first time in 1904. For the period from 1904 to 1907, women from Oxford and Cambridge came to Trinity College to receive their [[ad eundem degree]] and were known as [[Steamboat ladies]].\n\nIn 1907, the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] proposed the reconstitution of the [[University of Dublin]]. A \"Dublin University Defence Committee\" was created and was successful in campaigning against any change to the status quo, while the Catholic bishops' rejection of the idea ensured its failure among the Catholic population. Chief among the concerns of the bishops was the remains of the [[Catholic University of Ireland]], which would become subsumed into a new university, which on account of Trinity College would be part Anglican. Ultimately this episode led to the creation of the [[National University of Ireland]]. Trinity College was one of the targets of the Volunteer and Citizen Army forces during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] but was successfully defended by a small number of unionist students,<ref>\"Soldiers are we\" by Charles Townshend, ''[[History Today]]'', 1 April 2006, p163-164</ref> most of whom were members of the university [[Officers' Training Corps]]. From July 1917 until March 1918 the [[Irish Convention]] met in the college in an attempt to address the political aftermath of the Easter rising. (Subsequently, following the failure of the Convention to reach \"substantial agreement\", the [[Irish Free State]] was set up in 1922.) In the post-independence period Trinity College suffered from a cool relationship with the new state.  On 3 May 1955 the [[Provost (education)|Provost]], Dr A.J. McConnell, pointed out in a piece in the ''[[Irish Times]]'' that certain state-funded County Council scholarships excluded Trinity College from the list of approved institutions.  This, he suggested, amounted to religious discrimination, which was forbidden by the constitution.\n[[File:Trinity College.jpg|thumb|Trinity College Front Square]]\nThe School of Commerce was established in 1925, and the School of Social Studies in 1934. Also in 1934, the first female professor was appointed.\n\n1958 saw the first Catholic to reach the Board of Trinity as a Senior Fellow.\n\nIn 1962 the School of Commerce and the School of Social Studies amalgamated to form the School of Business and Social Studies. In 1969 the several schools and departments were grouped into Faculties as follows: Arts (Humanities and Letters); Business, Economic and Social Studies; Engineering and Systems Sciences; Health Sciences (since October 1977 all undergraduate teaching in dental science in the Dublin area has been located in Trinity College); Science.\n\nIn 1970 the [[Catholic Church]] lifted its ban on Catholics attending the college without special dispensation. At the same time, the Trinity College authorities invited the appointment of a Catholic chaplain to be based in the college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.ie/~duacon/nl19-3.htm |title=IOL.ie |publisher=IOL.ie |date=22 January 2000 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> There are now two such Catholic chaplains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcd.ie/Chaplaincy/catholic.htm |title=TCD.ie |publisher=TCD.ie |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105181037/http://www.tcd.ie/Chaplaincy/catholic.htm |archivedate=5 January 2010  }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, there was a proposal for [[University College, Dublin]], of the National University of Ireland, to become a constituent college of a newly reconstituted University of Dublin. This plan, suggested by [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] and [[Donogh O'Malley]], was dropped after opposition by Trinity College students.\n\nFrom 1975, the Colleges of Technology that now form the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] had their degrees conferred by the University of Dublin. This arrangement was discontinued in 1998 when the DIT obtained degree-granting powers of its own.\n\nThe [[School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (Trinity College, Dublin)|School of Pharmacy]] was established in 1977 and around the same time, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was transferred to [[University College, Dublin]]. Student numbers increased sharply during the 1980s and 1990s, with total enrolment more than doubling, leading to pressure on resources and subsequent investment programme.\n\nIn 1991, Thomas Noel Mitchell became the first Roman Catholic elected Provost of Trinity College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/provost/history/former-provosts/tn_mitchell.php|title=Thomas Noel Mitchell - Provost & President : Trinity College Dublin|first=Provost & President, Trinity College|last=Dublin|website=Tcd.ie|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nTrinity College is today in the centre of Dublin. At the beginning of the new century, it embarked on a radical overhaul of academic structures to reallocate funds and reduce administration costs, resulting in, for instance, the mentioned reduction from six to five to eventually three faculties under a subsequent restructuring by a later governing authority. The ten-year strategic plan prioritises four research themes with which the college seeks to compete for funding at the global level. Comparative funding statistics reviewing the difference in departmental unit costs and overall costs before and after this restructuring are not however apparent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/about/content/pdf/TCDStrategicPlan2006_English.pdf |title=TCD Strategic Plan 2006|website=Tcd.ie|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref> The '''Hamilton Mathematics Institute''' in Trinity College, named in honour of William Rowan Hamilton, was launched in 2005 and aims to improve the international profile of Irish mathematics, to raise public awareness of mathematics and to support local mathematical research through workshops, conferences and a visitor programme.\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Parliament Square from the Graduates Memorial Building (GMB) - geograph.org.uk - 1742048.jpg|thumb|Parliament Square]]\nTrinity College retains a tranquil collegiate atmosphere despite its location in the centre of a capital city (and despite its being one of the most significant tourist attractions in Dublin). This is, in large part, due to the compact design of the college, whose main buildings look inwards and are arranged in large quadrangles (called squares), and the existence of only a few public entrances.\n\nThe main college grounds are approximately 190,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (47 acres), including the Trinity College Enterprise Centre nearby, and buildings account for around 200,000 m\u00b2, ranging from works of older architecture to more modern buildings. The main entrance to the college is on the College Green, and its grounds are bounded by Nassau and Pearse Streets. The college is bisected by [[College Park, Dublin|College Park]], which has a cricket and rugby pitch.\n\n[[File:Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (Goldsmith Hall).jpg|thumb|left|Interior courtyard of the modern Goldsmith Hall college residence]]\nThe western side of the college is older, featuring the iconic [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]], as well as many fine buildings, including the Chapel and Examination Hall (designed by [[Sir William Chambers]]), [[Graduates Memorial Building]], [[Museum Building (Trinity College, Dublin)|Museum Building]], and the [[The Rubrics|Rubrics]], all spread across College's five squares. The [[Provost's House, Trinity College, Dublin|Provost's House]] sits a little way up from the College Front Gate such that the House is actually on [[Grafton Street]], one of the two principal shopping streets in the city, while its garden faces into the college. The [[Douglas Hyde Gallery]], a contemporary art gallery, is located in the college as is the Samuel Beckett Theatre. It hosts national and international performances and is used by the Dublin International Theatre Festival, the Dublin Dance Festival, and The Fringe Festival, among others. During the academic term it is predominantly used as a teaching and performance space for Drama students and staff.\n\nThe eastern side of the college is occupied by Science buildings, most of which are modern developments, arranged in three rows instead of quadrangles. In 2010, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked the it as one of the 15 most beautiful college grounds in the world.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/08/31/beautiful-campuses-lifestyle-education-colleges-10-university-architecture_slide_7.html | work=Forbes | title=The World's Most Beautiful College Campuses}}</ref>\n\nThe college also incorporates a number of buildings and facilities spread throughout the city, from the Politics and Sociology Departments, located on [[Dame Street]], to the Faculty of Health Sciences buildings, located at [[St. James's Hospital]] and [[Tallaght University Hospital]]. The Trinity Centre at St James's Hospital incorporates additional teaching rooms, as well as the Institute of Molecular Medicine and John Durkan Leukaemia Institute. The college also owns a large set of residences four kilometres to the south of the college on the [[Dartry Road]], in [[Rathmines]], called [[Trinity Hall, Dublin|Trinity Hall]].<ref group=\"Note\">Trinity Hall which houses 1,100 students, of whom the majority are first years.</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, the College announced plans, estimated at \u20ac230 million, to redevelop the campus and a new hub near [[Grand Canal Dock]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/trinity-college-campus-future-estates-strategy|title=Trinity College Dublin reveals \u20ac230m blueprint for the campus of the future|last=Kennedy|first=John|date=2018-11-22|website=Silicon Republic|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Trinity College Dublin, Parliament Square.jpg|750px|A panorama taken from Parliament Square.

It is no longer compulsory for students to attend these.\n\nThe chapel has been ecumenical since 1970, and is now also used daily in the celebration of Mass for the Roman Catholic members of the college. In addition to the Anglican chaplain, who is known as the Dean of Residence, there are two Roman Catholic chaplains and one Methodist chaplain. Ecumenical events are often held in the chapel, such as the annual carol service and the service of thanksgiving on Trinity Monday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Chaplaincy/|title=Chaplaincy - Trinity College Dublin|website=Tcd.ie|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Library===\n{{Main|Trinity College Library}}\n[[File:Long Room Interior, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland - Diliff.jpg|thumb|The Long Room of the Old Library]]\nThe [[Trinity College Library|Library of Trinity College]] is the largest research library in Ireland. As a result of its historic standing, Trinity College Library Dublin is a [[legal deposit]] library (as per [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]]) for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and has a similar standing in Irish law. The college is therefore legally entitled to a copy of every book published in Great Britain and Ireland and consequently receives over 100,000 new items every year. The library contains about five million books, including 30,000 current serials and significant collections of manuscripts, maps, and printed music. Three million books are held in the book depository, \"Stacks\", in [[Santry]], from which requests are retrieved twice daily.\n\n[[File:Trinity college library.jpg|thumb|left|The Old Library, housing the Book of Kells and other ancient manuscripts.]]\nThe Library proper is composed of several library buildings in college. The original (Old) Library is Thomas Burgh's masterpiece. A huge building, it originally towered over the university and city after its completion. Even today, surrounded by similarly scaled buildings, it is imposing and dominates the view of the university from Nassau Street. It was founded with the college and first endowed by [[James Ussher]] (1625\u201356), Archbishop of Armagh, who endowed his own valuable library, comprising several thousand printed books and manuscripts, to the college. The [[Book of Kells]] is by far the Library's most famous book and is located in the Old Library, along with the [[Book of Durrow]], the Book of Howth and other ancient texts. Also incorporating the Long Room, the Old Library is one of Ireland's biggest tourist attractions and holds thousands of rare, and in many cases very early, volumes. In the 18th century, the college received the [[Trinity College harp|Brian Boru harp]], one of the three surviving medieval Gaelic harps, and a national symbol of Ireland, which is now housed in the library.\n\n[[File:Trinity Pomodoro.jpg|thumb|Arnaldo Pomodoro's ''[[Sphere Within Sphere]]'' sculpture stands outside the Berkeley Library]]\nThe buildings referred to as the college's BLU ('''B'''erkeley '''L'''ecky '''U'''ssher) Arts library complex consist of the [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] Library in Fellow's Square, built in 1956, the Lecky Library, attached to the Arts building, and the James Ussher Library which, opening officially in 2003, overlooks College Park and houses the Glucksman Map Library. The Glucksman Library contains half a million printed maps, the largest collection of cartographic materials in Ireland. This includes the first Ordnance Surveys of Ireland, conducted in the early 19th century.\n\nThe Library also includes the [[William Rowan Hamilton|William Hamilton]] Science and Engineering Library and the [[John Stearne (physician)|John Stearne]] Medical Library, housed at St James's Hospital.\n\n===Business School===\n{{Main|Trinity Business School}}\nThe ''Trinity College Business School building'' is an \u20ac80 million construction for Trinity's Business School. It was opened on May 23, 2019 by Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar.

Patrick Prendergast has been the Provost since 2011.\n\n===Governance===\n[[File:Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (Sculpture of George Salmon).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of former provost [[George Salmon]] (by John Hughes) and the [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]], both in Parliament Square]]\nThe [[body corporate]] of the college consists of the provost, [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellows]] and scholars. The college is governed according to its statutes which are, in effect, the College Constitution. Statutes are of two kinds, those which originally could only be amended by Royal Charter or Royal Letters Patent, and which now can only be changed by an Act of the Oireachtas and those which can be changed by the board but only with the consent of the Fellows.  When a change requires parliamentary legislation, the customary procedure is that the Board requests the change by applying for a Private Bill. For this, the consent of the whole Body Corporate is needed, with Scholars voting alongside Fellows. An example of a change that requires parliamentary legislation is an alteration to the composition of the Board. This last happened when the governance of the college and university was revised and restated by an Act of the Oireachtas in 2000.\n\nThe Provost serves a ten-year term and is elected by a body of electors consisting essentially of all full-time academic staff, and a very small number of students. Originally the Provost was appointed for life. While the Provost was elected by the Fellows at the start, the appointment soon became a Crown one, reflecting the growing importance of the college and of the office of provost, which became both prestigious and well paid. However, as time passed it became customary that the appointments were only made after taking soundings of college opinion, which meant mostly the views of the Board. With the establishment of the Free State in 1922, the power of appointment passed to the Government. It was agreed that when a vacancy occurred the college would provide a list of three candidates to the Government, from which the choice would be made. The college was allowed to rank the candidates in order of preference and in practice, the most preferred candidate was always appointed. Now the Provost while still formally appointed by the Government is elected by staff plus student representatives, who gather in an electoral meeting, and vote by exhaustive ballot until a candidate obtains an absolute majority; the process takes a day. The Provost takes precedence over everyone else in the college, acts as the chief executive and accounting officer and chairs the board and council. The provost also enjoys a special status in the University of Dublin.\n\nFellows and scholars are elected by the board. Fellows were once elected for life on the basis of a competitive examination. The number of fellows was fixed and a competition to fill a vacancy would occur on the death or resignation of a fellow. Originally all the teaching was carried out by the Fellows. Fellows are now elected from among current college academics, serve until reaching retirement age, and there is no formal limit on their number. Only a minority of academic staff are fellows.  Election to fellowship is recognition for staff that they have excelled in their field and as such, amounts to a promotion for those receiving it. Any person appointed to a professorship who is not already a fellow, is elected a fellow at the next opportunity.\n\nScholars continue to be selected by competitive examination from the Undergraduate body. The Scholarship examination is now set according to the several undergraduate courses. (So there is a scholarship examination in History, or in Mathematics or Engineering, and so forth).  The Scholarship examination is taken in the second year of a four-year degree course (though, in special circumstances, such as illness, bereavement, or studying abroad during the second year, permission may be given to sit the examination in the third year). In theory, a student can sit the examination in any subject, not just the one they are studying. They hold their Scholarship until they are of \"MA standing\" that is, three years after obtaining the BA degree. (So most are Scholars for a term of five years).\n\nFellows are entitled to residence in the college free of charge; most fellows do not exercise this right in practice, with the legal requirement to provide accommodation to them being fulfilled by providing an office. Scholars are also entitled to residence in the college free of charge, they also receive an allowance, and have the fees paid for courses they are taking within the college. However, due to pressure on college accommodation, Scholars are no longer entitled (as they once were) to free rooms for the full duration of their scholarship should they cease to be students.  Fellows and Scholars are also entitled to one free meal a day, usually in the evening (\"Commons\"). Scholars retain the right to free meals for the full duration of their scholarship even after graduation, and ceasing to be students, should they choose to exercise it.\n\n====The Board====\nAside from the Provost, Fellows and Scholars, Trinity College has a Board (dating from 1637), which carries out general governance. Originally the Board consisted of the Provost and Senior Fellows only. There were seven Senior Fellows, defined as those seven fellows that had served longest, Fellowship at that time being for life, unless resigned. Over the years a representational element was added, for example by having elected representatives of the Junior Fellows and of those Professors who were not Fellows, with the last revision before Irish Independence being made by [[Royal Letters Patent]] in 1911. At that time there were, as well as the Senior Fellows, two elected representatives of those Professors that were not Fellows and elected representatives of the Junior Fellows. Over the years, while formal revision did not take place, partly due to the complexity of the process, a number of additional representatives were added to the Board but as \"observers\" and not full voting members. These included representatives of academic staff who were not Fellows, and representatives of students. In practice all attending Board meetings were treated as equals, with votes while not common, being taken by a show of hands. But it remained the case, that legally only the full members of the Board could have their votes recorded and it was mere convention that they always ratified the decision taken by the show of hands.\n\nThe governance of Trinity College was next formally changed in 2000, by the [[Oireachtas]], in legislation proposed by the Board of the college, and approved by the Body Corporate viz ''The Trinity College, Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Act, 2000''. This was introduced separately from the Universities Act 1997. It states that the Board shall comprise:\n* The Provost, Vice-Provost/Chief Academic Officer, Senior Lecturer, Registrar and Bursar;\n* Six Fellows;\n* Five members of the academic staff who are not Fellows, at least three of whom must be of a rank not higher than senior lecturer;\n* Two members of the academic staff of the rank of professor;\n* Three members of the non-academic staff;\n* Four students of the college, at least one of whom shall be a post-graduate student;\n* One member, not an employee or student of the college, chosen by a Board committee from nominations made by organisations \"representative of such business or professional interest as the Board considers appropriate\";\n* One member nominated by the [[Minister for Education and Skills]] following consultation with the Provost.\n\nThe fellows, non-fellow academic staff as well as non-academic staff are elected to serve for a fixed term. The four student members are the President, Education Officer and Welfare Officer of the Students' Union and the president of the Graduate Students' Union (all ex officio) and are elected annually for one-year terms. The vice-provost/chief academic officer, senior lecturer, registrar and bursar are 'annual officers' appointed for one-year (renewable) terms by the Provost. The two significant changes are that the Senior Fellows are no longer on the Board and that two members of the Board are now drawn from without the college.\n\n====The Council====\nThere is a Council (dating from 1874), which oversees academic matters. All decisions of the Council require the approval of the Board, but if the decision in question does not require a new expenditure, the approval is normally formal, without debate. The Council had a significant number of elected representatives from the start, and was also larger than the Board, which at that time, continued to consist of the Provost and seven Senior Fellows only. The Council is the formal body which makes academic staff appointments, always, in practice on the recommendation of appointments panels, but which have themselves been appointed by the Council. An illustration of the relationship between the Board and the Council, is where a decision is made to create a new professorial chair. As this involves paying a salary, the initial decision to create the chair is made by the Council, but the decision to make provision for the salary is made by the Board, consequently, the Board might overrule, or defer a Council decision on grounds of cost.\n\n====The Senate====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Seal of the University of Dublin.png|Seal of the University Senate|thumb|upright]] -->\nThe University of Dublin was modelled on [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]] in the form of a [[collegiate university]], Trinity College being named by the Queen as the ''mater universitatis'' (\"mother of the university\"). As no other college was ever established, the college is the sole constituent college of the university and so Trinity College and the University of Dublin are for most practical purposes synonymous. However, the actual statutes of the university and the college<ref name=\"gsu.tcd.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gsu.tcd.ie/files/Statutes-Current.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Statutes-Current.doc |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318181124/http://www.gsu.tcd.ie/files/Statutes-Current.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> grant the university separate corporate legal rights to own property and borrow money and employ staff. Moreover, while the board of the college has the sole power to propose amendments to the statutes of the university and college, amendments to the university statutes require the consent of the Senate of the university. Consequently, in theory, the Senate can overrule the Board, but only in very limited and particular circumstances. However, it is also the case that the university cannot act independently of the initiative of the Board of Trinity College. The most common example of when the two bodies must collaborate is when a decision is made to establish a new degree. All matters relating to syllabus, examination and teaching are for the college to determine, but actual clearance for the award of the degree is a matter for the university. In the same way, when an individual is awarded an Honorary Degree, the proposal for the award is made by the Board of Trinity College, but this is subject to agreement by a vote of the Senate of Dublin University. All graduates of the university who have at least a master's degree are eligible to be members of the Senate, but in practice, only a few hundred are, with a large proportion being current members of the staff of Trinity College.\n\n====Visitors====\nThe college also has an oversight structure of two visitors, the chancellor of the university, who is elected by the Senate, and the judicial visitor, who is appointed by the Irish Government from a list of two names submitted by the Senate of the university. The current judicial visitor is the Hon. Dr. Justice Maureen Harding Clark. In the event of a disagreement between the two visitors, the opinion of the chancellor prevails. The visitors act as a final \"court of appeal\" within the college, with their modes of appointment giving them the needed independence from the college administration.\n\n===Academic associations===\n[[File:Trinity-College-Campanile-Front.JPG|thumb|upright|Parliament Square: The [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]]]]\nTrinity College is a [[sister college]] to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] of the [[University of Oxford]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] of the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|date=17 June 2005|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article534008.ece|title=Professor A.

Since the new [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, graduates of the university have formed a constituency which elects three [[Members of the Seanad \u00c9ireann|Senator]]s to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]]. The current representatives of the university constituency are [[Ivana Bacik]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]] and [[Lynn Ruane]]. Notable representatives have included [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Edward Gibson]], [[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|W. E. H. Lecky]], [[Edward Carson]], [[Noel Browne]], [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] and [[Mary Robinson]]. The franchise was originally restricted to the Provost, Fellows and Scholars of Trinity College. This was expanded in 1832 to include those who had received an M.A. and in 1918 all those who had received a degree from the university.\n\n==Academic profile==\nSince considerable academic restructuring in 2008, the college has three academic faculties:\n* Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Engineering, Mathematics and Sciences\n* Health Sciences\n\nEach faculty is headed by a dean (there is also a Dean of Postgraduate Studies), and faculties are divided into schools, of which there were 24 as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/structure/ |title=Faculties and Schools |publisher=Trinity College, Dublin |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Second-level programmes===\nSince 2014, Trinity College's Science Department has established and operated a scheme for second-level students to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

First-year students at the undergraduate level are called Junior Freshmen; second years, Senior Freshmen; third years, Junior Sophisters; and fourth years, Senior Sophisters. After a proposal in 2017 by the SU Equality Committee, a three-year process changing the titles of first and second years to Junior and Senior Fresh was approved by the Trinity College Board.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Meehan|first1=Sarah|title=Undergraduate name \"Freshman\" to change to gender-neutral \"Fresh\"|url=http://trinitynews.ie/undergraduate-name-freshman-to-change-to-gender-neutral-fresh/|accessdate=28 November 2017|publisher=Trinity News|date=28 November 2017}}</ref> The Freshman Years usually have a set or minimally flexible basic curriculum with the Sophister years allowing for a much greater degree of course variation, as well as taking a year abroad. The passing of two sets of examinations is a prerequisite for a degree. Junior and Senior Freshmen sit preliminary annual exams in Trinity Term of each year which must be passed so that they \"rise\" to the year above. At the end of the Junior Sophister year, undergraduates sit Part I of the Moderatorship exams, subject to attaining an upper-second,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} allows them to take an Honours degree and sit the Part II (Final) of the Moderatorship exams. Successful candidates receive first-, upper or lower second-, or third-class honours, or simply a \"pass\" without honours if they perform insufficiently in Part I of the Moderatorship.\n\nMost non-professional courses take a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. As a matter of tradition, bachelor's degree graduates are eligible, after nine terms from matriculation and without additional study, to purchase for a fee an upgrade of their bachelor's degree to a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]].\nThe four-year degree structure makes undergraduate teaching at Dublin closer to the North American model than that of other universities in England and Ireland (Scottish universities generally also require four years of study for a bachelor's degree).\n\nDegree titles vary according to the subject of study. The [[Trinity College Dublin Law School|Law School]] awards the [[LL.B.]], the LL.B. (ling. franc.) and the LL.B. (ling. germ.). Other degrees include the BAI (engineering) and BBS (business studies).

[[Michaelmas term]] lasts from October to December; [[Hilary term]] from January to March; and [[Trinity term]] from April to June, with each term separated by a vacation. Whilst teaching takes place across all three terms in postgraduate courses, for undergraduate programmes, teaching is condensed within the first two terms since 2009, with each term consisting of a twelve-week period of teaching known as the Teaching Term.

Furthermore, applicants for certain courses may be required to achieve more specific qualifications than those prescribed for minimum matriculation requirements.<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/undergraduate-studies/admission-requirements.pdf |title= Admission Requirements |publisher=Tcd.ie}}</ref>  Eligible applicants must then compete for places based on the results of their [[School leaving qualification|school leaving examinations]], however, applicants can additionally take [[matriculation examination]]s<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=https://www.tcd.ie/Admissions/undergraduate/assets/pdf/Matric%20Syllabus.pdf |title= Matriculation Examination Syllabus |publisher=Tcd.ie}}</ref> which are held in the university in April, in which each subject is considered equivalent to that of the [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Irish Leaving Certificate]]. Applications for restricted courses<ref>{{cite web|author=Central Applications Office |url=https://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=restrictedcourses&bb=restrictions |title= Restricted-Application Courses |publisher=cao.ie}}</ref> require further assessment considered in the admissions process, such as the [[Health Professions Admissions Test]] (HPAT) for medicine or [[Educational entrance examination|entrance tests]] for music and drama courses. As applications for most courses far exceeds available places, admission is highly selective, demanding excellent grades in the aforementioned examinations. Through the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]], candidates may list several courses at Trinity College and at other third-level institutions in Ireland in order of preference. Places are awarded in mid-August every year by the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]] after matching the number of places available to the academic attainments of the applicants. Qualifications are measured as \"points\", with specific scales for the Leaving Certificate, UK GCE [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]], the [[International Baccalaureate]] and all other European Union school-leaving examinations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=http://www.tcd.ie/Admissions/undergraduate/requirements/matriculation/other/ |title=A list of EU exams and conversion ratios |publisher=Tcd.ie |date=26 February 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor applicants who are not citizens or residents of the [[European Union]], different application procedures apply.;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228220105/http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege|url-status=dead|title=Topuniversities.com|archivedate=28 February 2009}}</ref> 16% of students are from outside Ireland, and 40% of these are from outside the European Union.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Disadvantaged, disabled, or mature students can also be admitted through a program that is separate from the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]], the Trinity Access Programme,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Trinity_Access |title=TCD.ie |publisher=TCD.ie |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> which aims to facilitate the entry of sectors of society which would otherwise be under-represented.

On Trinity Monday (the first day of Trinity Term), the Board of the college sits and elects to the Scholarship all those who achieve First in the examination. Election to become a scholar of Trinity Dublin is widely regarded as \u201cthe most prestigious undergraduate award in the country\u201d.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/2019/04/58-scholars-15-fellows-and-two-honorary-fellows-elected/|title=58 Scholars, 15 Fellows and Two Honorary Fellows Elected|last=|first=|date=|work=The University Times|access-date=}}</ref> Those from EU member countries are entitled to free rooms and Commons (the college's [[Formal (university)|Formal]] Hall), an annual stipend and exemption from fees for the duration of their scholarship, which lasts for fifteen terms. Scholars from non-EU member countries have their fees reduced by the current value of EU member fees. Scholars may add the suffix \"'''SCH.'''\" to their names, have the note \"discip. schol.\" appended to their name at Commencements and are entitled to wear Bachelor's Robes and a velvet mortarboard.\n\nCompetition for Scholarship involves a searching examination and successful candidates must be of exceptional ability. The concept of scholarship is a valued tradition of the college, and many of the college's most distinguished members were elected scholars (including Samuel Beckett and Ernest Walton). The Scholars' dinner, to which 'Scholars of the decade' (those elected in the current year, and every year multiple of a decade previous to it, e.g., 2013, 2003,..) are invited, forms one of the major events in Trinity's calendar. A scholarship at Trinity College is a prestigious undergraduate award; a principal aim of the college is the pursuit of excellence, and one of the most tangible demonstrations of this is the institution of scholarship.\n\nUnder the Foundation Charter (of 1592), Scholars were part of the body corporate (three Scholars were named in the charter \"in the name of many\"). Until 1609 there were about 51 Scholars at any one time. A figure of seventy was permanently fixed in the revising Letters Patent of Charles I in 1637. Trinity Monday was appointed as the day when all future elections to Fellowship and Scholarship would be announced (at this time Trinity Monday was always celebrated on the Monday after the feast of the [[Trinity Sunday|Holy Trinity]]). Up to this point, all undergraduates were Scholars, but soon after 1637 the practice of admitting students other than Scholars commenced.\n\nUntil 1856, only the classical subjects were examined. The questions concerned all the classical authors prescribed for the entrance examination and for the undergraduate course up to the middle of the Junior Sophister year. So candidates had no new material to read, 'but they had to submit to a very searching examination on the fairly lengthy list of classical texts which they were supposed by this time to have mastered'. The close link with the undergraduate syllabus is underlined by the refusal until 1856 to admit Scholars to the Library (a request for admission was rejected by the Board in 1842 on the grounds that Scholars should stick to their prescribed books and not indulge in 'those desultory habits' that admission to an extensive library would encourage). During the second half of the nineteenth century, the content of the examination gradually came to include other disciplines.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, \"Non-Foundation\" Scholarships were introduced. This initially was a device to permit women to be, in effect, elected Scholars, despite the then commonly accepted legal view that the statute revision of 1637 only permitted males to be elected Foundation Scholars. Clearly, when women were not permitted in the college, this had not caused any difficulties, but with the admission of women as full members of the college, an anomaly was created. Non-Foundation Scholarship granted to the women elected to it all the rights of men, but with the exception of voting rights at a meeting of the Body Corporate, a very rare event in any case. As women are now admitted to Foundation Scholarship on exactly the same basis as men Non-Foundation Scholarships are retained as a device to allow for more than seventy persons to be Scholars at any one time provided sufficient meet the qualifying standards. Foundation Scholarships are given to those whose performance is considered particularly exceptional, with the remaining qualifying persons that year being elected as Non-Foundation Scholars. While the number of Foundation Scholars remains fixed at seventy, there is, in theory, no limit on the number of Non-Foundation scholars. Non-Foundation and Foundation Scholars receive the same benefits and therefore the two groups are regarded in equal esteem and usually refer to themselves collectively as the [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|Scholars of Trinity College Dublin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/undergraduate-studies/foundation-and-non-foundation-scholarships.pdf|title=Trinity College Dublin, Calendar, Undergraduate Studies Part II, Part D9, Foundation and Non-Foundation Scholarships|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It is worth noting that when the college had only a few hundred members the Foundation Scholars could easily amount to ten per cent of the whole undergraduate body; now that the college numbers members in thousands even the addition of current numbers of Non Foundation Scholars means that the proportion of students elected Scholars is still lower than it has even been before, and being elected to Scholarship is more competitive than it was.\n\n===Research===\nTrinity College is the most productive internationally recognised research centre in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege Topuniversities.com] \"Interdisciplinarity forms a key element in the College strategy in increasing Trinity's international standing as a research-led university.

The most successful Trinity College sports club \u2013 based on Intervarsities victories \u2013 is [[Dublin University Fencing Club]] (DU Fencing Club). A total of forty-one Intervarsity titles have been won by the club in sixty-four years of competition. While the modern DU Fencing Club was founded in 1936, its origins can be dated to the 1700s when a 'Gentleman's Club of the Sword' existed, primarily for duelling practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fencing.tcdlife.ie |title=Dublin University Fencing Club \u2013 Club News |website=Fencing.tcdlife.ie |accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref> There are several graduate sport clubs that exist separate to the Central Athletic Club including the Dublin University Museum Players (cricket), the Lady Elizabeth Boat Club (rowing) and the Mary Lyons Memorial Mallets (croquet).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Publications===\nTrinity College has a tradition of student publications, ranging from the serious to the satirical. Most student publications are administered by Trinity Publications, previously called the Dublin University Publications Committee (often known as 'Pubs'), which maintains and administers the Publications office (located in No 6) and all the associated equipment needed to publish newspapers and magazines.\n\nThere are two rival student newspapers in Trinity. [[Trinity College Dublin Students' Union]] funds ''[[The University Times]]''. Since its founding in 2009, the paper has consistently won national and international awards, including the award for best all-around non-daily student newspaper in the world from the US-based [[Society of Professional Journalists]]. Even though it is funded by the union, it is often critical of its activities. In 2019, Provost Patrick Prendergast said that \"The University Times has pursued an independent course in many aspects of College life, and done so fearlessly.\"\n\n''[[Trinity News]]'', meanwhile, is Ireland's oldest student newspaper, having been founded in 1953. Like ''The University Times'', it publishes both an online edition and a print edition every three weeks during the academic year. For the last 10 years the paper has been edited by a full-time student editor, who takes a sabbatical year from their studies, supported by a voluntary part-time staff of 30 student section editors and writers.\n\nStudent magazines currently in publication include the satirical newspaper ''[[The Piranha (newspaper)|The Piranha]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitypublications.info/Our%20Publications.html |title=Trinity Publications |publisher=Trinitypublications.info |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> (formerly ''Piranha!'' magazine but rebranded in 2009), the generalist ''[[T.C.D. Miscellany]]'' (founded in 1895; one of Ireland's oldest magazines), the film journal ''[[Trinity Film Review]]'' (TFR) and the literary ''[[Icarus (magazine)|Icarus]]''. Other publications include the ''Student Economic Review'' and the [[Trinity College Law Review]], produced independently by students of economics and law respectively, the ''Trinity College Journal of Postgraduate Research'', produced by the Graduate Students Union, the ''Social and Political Review'' (SPR),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spr.tcdlife.ie/ |title=Welcome to The Social and Political Review of Trinity College Dublin |publisher=Spr.tcdlife.ie |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> now in its 22nd year, the ''Trinity Student Medical Journal'',<ref>{{cite web |author=Dublin Life (Email) |url=http://www.tsmj.tcd.ie |title=TCD.ie |publisher=Tsmj.tcd.ie |date=26 August 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108195955/http://www.tsmj.tcd.ie/ |archivedate=8 January 2009  }}</ref> ''The Attic'', student writing produced by the ''Dublin University Literary Society'', the ''Afro-Caribbean Journal'' produced by the ''Afro-Caribbean Society,'' and ''grass'' an intermedial magazine based on collaboration between media.

College races are held each year on Trinity Wednesday.\n\nThe start of Trinity Week is marked by the election of Fellows and Scholars to the College on Trinity Monday. The Board of the College, having chosen the new Scholars (those who achieved a First in the Foundation Scholarship) and Fellows,<ref>{{cite web |title=58 Scholars, 15 Fellows and Two Honorary Fellows Elected |url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/2019/04/58-scholars-15-fellows-and-two-honorary-fellows-elected/ |website=The University Times}}</ref> announce in front square those appointed, before an ecumenical service is held in the College Chapel, with music sung by the [[Choir of Trinity College, Dublin|Chapel Choir]].\n\n===Other Traditions===\n\nThere is a long-standing rivalry with nearby [[University College Dublin]], which is largely friendly in nature. Every year, Colours events are contested between the sporting clubs of each University.\n\nMost students of the college (undergraduates especially) never walk underneath the [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]], as the tradition suggests that should the bell ring whilst they pass under it, they will fail their annual examinations. This is negated only if they touch the foot of the statue of George Salmon within five seconds of the bell ringing.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn [[James Plunkett]]'s ''Farewell Companions'', one of the characters claims to have been \"through Trinity\", having entered at College Green and left at the Nassau Street Gate.\n\nParts of ''[[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]]'',<ref>{{cite web |author=Kevin Rockett |authorlink=Kevin Rockett |title=Michael Collins (1996) |work=Shot at Trinity |publisher=Trinity College Dublin |url=http://www.tcd.ie/film/shotattrinity/?film=michael-collins |accessdate=20 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522104139/http://www.tcd.ie/film/shotattrinity/?film=michael-collins |archivedate=22 May 2015  }}</ref> ''[[The First Great Train Robbery]]'',<ref>{{cite web |author=David Ingoldsby |title=The Great Train Robbery (1978) |work=Shot at Trinity |publisher=Trinity College Dublin |url=http://www.tcd.ie/film/shotattrinity/?post_type=film&p=83 |accessdate=20 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522103842/http://www.tcd.ie/film/shotattrinity/?post_type=film&p=83 |archivedate=22 May 2015  }}</ref> ''[[Circle of Friends (1995 film)|Circle of Friends]]'',<ref>{{cite web |author=Ruth Barton |title=Circle of Friends (1995) |work=Shot at Trinity |publisher=Trinity College Dublin |url=http://www.tcd.ie/film/shotattrinity/?film=circle-of-friends |accessdate=20 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522103621/http://www.tcd.ie/film/shotattrinity/?film=circle-of-friends |archivedate=22 May 2015  }}</ref> ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Conolly |first=Jez |author2=Whelan, Caroline  |title=World Film Locations: Dublin |publisher=Intellect Books |year=2011 |location=Bristol |page=38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ce9MOsVbu-AC&pg=PA38 |isbn=978-1-84150-550-3 |issn=2045-9009 }}</ref> ''[[Ek Tha Tiger]]''<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/news/type/view/id/1353285 |title=Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif to go back to college |publisher=Bollywood Hungama |date=20 July 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> and ''[[Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx]]''<ref>{{cite web |author=Aidan Delaney |title=Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx (1970) |work=Shot at Trinity |publisher=Trinity College Dublin |url=http://www.tcd.ie/film/shotattrinity/?film=quackser-fortune-has-a-cousin-in-the-bronx |accessdate=20 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522103413/http://www.tcd.ie/film/shotattrinity/?film=quackser-fortune-has-a-cousin-in-the-bronx |archivedate=22 May 2015  }}</ref> were filmed in Trinity College.

Shown here are the Madonna and Child from Kells (folio 7v).]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe first University of Dublin (known as the [[Medieval University of Dublin]] and unrelated to the current university) was created by [[Pope Clement V|the Pope]] in 1311,<ref>London: Newman, Cardinal Henry; The Rise and Progress of Universities, Chapter 17 (The Ancient University of Dublin), 207\u2013212</ref> and had a Chancellor, lecturers and students (granted protection by the Crown) over many years, before coming to an end at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nFollowing this, and some debate about a new university at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], in 1592 a small group of Dublin citizens obtained a charter by way of [[letters patent]] from Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]<ref group=\"Note\" name=letterspatent>\nExtracts from Letters Patent (\"First or Foundation Charter\") of Elizabeth I, 1592: \"...we...found and establish a College, mother of a (the) University, near the town of Dublin for the better education, training and instruction of Anglo-Protestant scholars and students in our realm...and also that provision should be made...for the relief and support of a provost and some fellows and scholars...it shall be called THE COLLEGE OF THE HOLY AND UNDIVIDED TRINITY NEAR DUBLIN FOUNDED BY THE MOST SERENE QUEEN ELIZABETH.

The founding Letters Patent were amended by succeeding monarchs on a number of occasions, such as by [[James VI and I|James I]] in 1613 and most notably in 1637 by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (who increased the number of fellows from seven to sixteen, established the Board \u2013 then the Provost and the seven senior Fellows \u2013 and reduced the panel of Visitors in size) and supplemented as late as the reign of Queen Victoria (and later still amended by the [[Oireachtas]] in 2000).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/corporate/legal-faq/|title=Legal FAQ - Secretary's Office - Trinity College Dublin|website=www.tcd.ie|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref>\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\nDuring the eighteenth century Trinity College was seen as the university of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. [[Parliament of Ireland|Parliament]], meeting on the other side of College Green, made generous grants for building. The first building of this period was the Old Library building, begun in 1712, followed by the Printing House and the Dining Hall. During the second half of the century, Parliament Square slowly emerged. The great building drive was completed in the early nineteenth century by Botany Bay, the square which derives its name in part from the herb garden it once contained (and which was succeeded by Trinity College's own Botanic Gardens). Following early steps in [[Catholic Emancipation]], Catholics were first allowed to apply for admission in 1793,<ref>Catholic Relief Act, 1793, section 13</ref> prior to the equivalent change at the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. Certain disabilities remained.   In December 1845 [[Denis Caulfield Heron]] was the subject of a hearing at Trinity College. Heron had previously been examined and, on merit, declared a scholar of the college but had not been allowed to take up his place due to his Catholic religion. Heron appealed to the Courts which issued a [[writ of mandamus]] requiring the case to be adjudicated by the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]] and the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Primate of Ireland]].<ref>[[The Times]], ''Important Collegiate Question., Denis C. Heron'' 13 December 1845; pg3 col E</ref> The decision of [[Richard Whately]] and [[John George de la Poer Beresford]] was that Heron would remain excluded from Scholarship.<ref>The Times; ''Ireland. Protestant Alliance''; 9 January 1846; pg5 col D</ref> This decision confirmed that the legal position remained that persons who were not Anglicans (Presbyterians were also affected) could not be elected to Scholarship, Fellowship or be made a Professor. However within less than three decades of this, all disabilities imposed on Catholics were repealed as in 1873, all religious tests were abolished, except for entry to the [[divinity school]].  However, the Irish Catholic bishops responding to the increased ease, due to these changes, with which Catholics could attend an Institution which the Bishops saw as thoroughly Protestant in ethos, and in light of the establishment of the Catholic University, in 1871 implemented a general ban on Catholics entering Trinity College, with few exceptions.  \"The ban\" despite its longevity, is associated in the popular mind with [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] [[John Charles McQuaid]] as he was made responsible for enforcing the ban from 1956 until it was rescinded by the Catholic Bishops of Ireland in 1970, shortly before McQuaid's retirement. Prior to 1956, it was the responsibility of the local Bishop.\n\n[[File:Bram Stoker1.jpg|thumb|[[Bram Stoker]]]]\n\nThe nineteenth century was also marked by important developments in the professional schools. The law school was reorganised after the middle of the century. Medical teaching had been given in the college since 1711, but it was only after the establishment of the school on a firm basis by legislation in 1800, and under the inspiration of one Macartney, that it was in a position to play its full part, with such teachers as Graves and Stokes, in the great age of Dublin medicine. The Engineering School was established in 1842 and was one of the first of its kind in Ireland and Britain.\n\n===20th century===\nIn April 1900, [[Queen Victoria]] visited College Green in Dublin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.qut.edu.au/4115/|title=Queen Victoria's Royal visit to Dublin, Ireland, 4th April - 26th April, 1900|last=L'Estrange|first=Robert Augustus Henry|date=1900|website=digitalcollections.qut.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\nWomen were admitted to Trinity College as full members for the first time in 1904. For the period from 1904 to 1907, women from Oxford and Cambridge came to Trinity College to receive their [[ad eundem degree]] and were known as [[Steamboat ladies]].\n\nIn 1907, the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] proposed the reconstitution of the [[University of Dublin]]. A \"Dublin University Defence Committee\" was created and was successful in campaigning against any change to the status quo, while the Catholic bishops' rejection of the idea ensured its failure among the Catholic population. Chief among the concerns of the bishops was the remains of the [[Catholic University of Ireland]], which would become subsumed into a new university, which on account of Trinity College would be part Anglican. Ultimately this episode led to the creation of the [[National University of Ireland]]. Trinity College was one of the targets of the Volunteer and Citizen Army forces during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] but was successfully defended by a small number of unionist students,<ref>\"Soldiers are we\" by Charles Townshend, ''[[History Today]]'', 1 April 2006, p163-164</ref> most of whom were members of the university [[Officers' Training Corps]]. From July 1917 until March 1918 the [[Irish Convention]] met in the college in an attempt to address the political aftermath of the Easter rising. (Subsequently, following the failure of the Convention to reach \"substantial agreement\", the [[Irish Free State]] was set up in 1922.) In the post-independence period Trinity College suffered from a cool relationship with the new state.  On 3 May 1955 the [[Provost (education)|Provost]], Dr A.J. McConnell, pointed out in a piece in the ''[[Irish Times]]'' that certain state-funded County Council scholarships excluded Trinity College from the list of approved institutions.  This, he suggested, amounted to religious discrimination, which was forbidden by the constitution.\n[[File:Trinity College.jpg|thumb|Trinity College Front Square]]\nThe School of Commerce was established in 1925, and the School of Social Studies in 1934. Also in 1934, the first female professor was appointed.\n\n1958 saw the first Catholic to reach the Board of Trinity as a Senior Fellow.\n\nIn 1962 the School of Commerce and the School of Social Studies amalgamated to form the School of Business and Social Studies. In 1969 the several schools and departments were grouped into Faculties as follows: Arts (Humanities and Letters); Business, Economic and Social Studies; Engineering and Systems Sciences; Health Sciences (since October 1977 all undergraduate teaching in dental science in the Dublin area has been located in Trinity College); Science.\n\nIn 1970 the [[Catholic Church]] lifted its ban on Catholics attending the college without special dispensation. At the same time, the Trinity College authorities invited the appointment of a Catholic chaplain to be based in the college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.ie/~duacon/nl19-3.htm |title=IOL.ie |publisher=IOL.ie |date=22 January 2000 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> There are now two such Catholic chaplains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcd.ie/Chaplaincy/catholic.htm |title=TCD.ie |publisher=TCD.ie |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105181037/http://www.tcd.ie/Chaplaincy/catholic.htm |archivedate=5 January 2010  }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, there was a proposal for [[University College, Dublin]], of the National University of Ireland, to become a constituent college of a newly reconstituted University of Dublin. This plan, suggested by [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]] and [[Donogh O'Malley]], was dropped after opposition by Trinity College students.\n\nFrom 1975, the Colleges of Technology that now form the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] had their degrees conferred by the University of Dublin. This arrangement was discontinued in 1998 when the DIT obtained degree-granting powers of its own.\n\nThe [[School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (Trinity College, Dublin)|School of Pharmacy]] was established in 1977 and around the same time, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was transferred to [[University College, Dublin]]. Student numbers increased sharply during the 1980s and 1990s, with total enrolment more than doubling, leading to pressure on resources and subsequent investment programme.\n\nIn 1991, Thomas Noel Mitchell became the first Roman Catholic elected Provost of Trinity College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/provost/history/former-provosts/tn_mitchell.php|title=Thomas Noel Mitchell - Provost & President : Trinity College Dublin|first=Provost & President, Trinity College|last=Dublin|website=Tcd.ie|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nTrinity College is today in the centre of Dublin. At the beginning of the new century, it embarked on a radical overhaul of academic structures to reallocate funds and reduce administration costs, resulting in, for instance, the mentioned reduction from six to five to eventually three faculties under a subsequent restructuring by a later governing authority. The ten-year strategic plan prioritises four research themes with which the college seeks to compete for funding at the global level. Comparative funding statistics reviewing the difference in departmental unit costs and overall costs before and after this restructuring are not however apparent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/about/content/pdf/TCDStrategicPlan2006_English.pdf |title=TCD Strategic Plan 2006|website=Tcd.ie|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref> The '''Hamilton Mathematics Institute''' in Trinity College, named in honour of William Rowan Hamilton, was launched in 2005 and aims to improve the international profile of Irish mathematics, to raise public awareness of mathematics and to support local mathematical research through workshops, conferences and a visitor programme.\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Parliament Square from the Graduates Memorial Building (GMB) - geograph.org.uk - 1742048.jpg|thumb|Parliament Square]]\nTrinity College retains a tranquil collegiate atmosphere despite its location in the centre of a capital city (and despite its being one of the most significant tourist attractions in Dublin). This is, in large part, due to the compact design of the college, whose main buildings look inwards and are arranged in large quadrangles (called squares), and the existence of only a few public entrances.\n\nThe main college grounds are approximately 190,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (47 acres), including the Trinity College Enterprise Centre nearby, and buildings account for around 200,000 m\u00b2, ranging from works of older architecture to more modern buildings. The main entrance to the college is on the College Green, and its grounds are bounded by Nassau and Pearse Streets. The college is bisected by [[College Park, Dublin|College Park]], which has a cricket and rugby pitch.\n\n[[File:Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (Goldsmith Hall).jpg|thumb|left|Interior courtyard of the modern Goldsmith Hall college residence]]\nThe western side of the college is older, featuring the iconic [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]], as well as many fine buildings, including the Chapel and Examination Hall (designed by [[Sir William Chambers]]), [[Graduates Memorial Building]], [[Museum Building (Trinity College, Dublin)|Museum Building]], and the [[The Rubrics|Rubrics]], all spread across College's five squares. The [[Provost's House, Trinity College, Dublin|Provost's House]] sits a little way up from the College Front Gate such that the House is actually on [[Grafton Street]], one of the two principal shopping streets in the city, while its garden faces into the college. The [[Douglas Hyde Gallery]], a contemporary art gallery, is located in the college as is the Samuel Beckett Theatre. It hosts national and international performances and is used by the Dublin International Theatre Festival, the Dublin Dance Festival, and The Fringe Festival, among others. During the academic term it is predominantly used as a teaching and performance space for Drama students and staff.\n\nThe eastern side of the college is occupied by Science buildings, most of which are modern developments, arranged in three rows instead of quadrangles.

As a result of its historic standing, Trinity College Library Dublin is a [[legal deposit]] library (as per [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]]) for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and has a similar standing in Irish law. The college is therefore legally entitled to a copy of every book published in Great Britain and Ireland and consequently receives over 100,000 new items every year. The library contains about five million books, including 30,000 current serials and significant collections of manuscripts, maps, and printed music. Three million books are held in the book depository, \"Stacks\", in [[Santry]], from which requests are retrieved twice daily.\n\n[[File:Trinity college library.jpg|thumb|left|The Old Library, housing the Book of Kells and other ancient manuscripts.]]\nThe Library proper is composed of several library buildings in college. The original (Old) Library is Thomas Burgh's masterpiece. A huge building, it originally towered over the university and city after its completion. Even today, surrounded by similarly scaled buildings, it is imposing and dominates the view of the university from Nassau Street. It was founded with the college and first endowed by [[James Ussher]] (1625\u201356), Archbishop of Armagh, who endowed his own valuable library, comprising several thousand printed books and manuscripts, to the college. The [[Book of Kells]] is by far the Library's most famous book and is located in the Old Library, along with the [[Book of Durrow]], the Book of Howth and other ancient texts. Also incorporating the Long Room, the Old Library is one of Ireland's biggest tourist attractions and holds thousands of rare, and in many cases very early, volumes. In the 18th century, the college received the [[Trinity College harp|Brian Boru harp]], one of the three surviving medieval Gaelic harps, and a national symbol of Ireland, which is now housed in the library.\n\n[[File:Trinity Pomodoro.jpg|thumb|Arnaldo Pomodoro's ''[[Sphere Within Sphere]]'' sculpture stands outside the Berkeley Library]]\nThe buildings referred to as the college's BLU ('''B'''erkeley '''L'''ecky '''U'''ssher) Arts library complex consist of the [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] Library in Fellow's Square, built in 1956, the Lecky Library, attached to the Arts building, and the James Ussher Library which, opening officially in 2003, overlooks College Park and houses the Glucksman Map Library. The Glucksman Library contains half a million printed maps, the largest collection of cartographic materials in Ireland. This includes the first Ordnance Surveys of Ireland, conducted in the early 19th century.\n\nThe Library also includes the [[William Rowan Hamilton|William Hamilton]] Science and Engineering Library and the [[John Stearne (physician)|John Stearne]] Medical Library, housed at St James's Hospital.\n\n===Business School===\n{{Main|Trinity Business School}}\nThe ''Trinity College Business School building'' is an \u20ac80 million construction for Trinity's Business School. It was opened on May 23, 2019 by Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. The six-storey building, located on the Pearse Street frontage of the campus, includes an ''Innovation and Entrepreneurial hub'', a 600-seat auditorium, \"smart classrooms\" with digital technology, and an \"executive education centre.\" The near-zero-energy building provides a link between the city and the main University grounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/articles/taoiseach-opens-e80-million-building-for-scaled-up-trinity-business-school/|title=Trinity Business School|website=tcd.ie|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n{{see also|University of Dublin#Organisation}}\nThe college, officially [[body corporate|incorporated]] as ''The Provost, Fellows and Scholars of the College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Queen Elizabeth near Dublin'', is headed by the Provost. Patrick Prendergast has been the Provost since 2011.\n\n===Governance===\n[[File:Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland (Sculpture of George Salmon).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of former provost [[George Salmon]] (by John Hughes) and the [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]], both in Parliament Square]]\nThe [[body corporate]] of the college consists of the provost, [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellows]] and scholars. The college is governed according to its statutes which are, in effect, the College Constitution. Statutes are of two kinds, those which originally could only be amended by Royal Charter or Royal Letters Patent, and which now can only be changed by an Act of the Oireachtas and those which can be changed by the board but only with the consent of the Fellows.  When a change requires parliamentary legislation, the customary procedure is that the Board requests the change by applying for a Private Bill. For this, the consent of the whole Body Corporate is needed, with Scholars voting alongside Fellows. An example of a change that requires parliamentary legislation is an alteration to the composition of the Board. This last happened when the governance of the college and university was revised and restated by an Act of the Oireachtas in 2000.\n\nThe Provost serves a ten-year term and is elected by a body of electors consisting essentially of all full-time academic staff, and a very small number of students. Originally the Provost was appointed for life. While the Provost was elected by the Fellows at the start, the appointment soon became a Crown one, reflecting the growing importance of the college and of the office of provost, which became both prestigious and well paid. However, as time passed it became customary that the appointments were only made after taking soundings of college opinion, which meant mostly the views of the Board. With the establishment of the Free State in 1922, the power of appointment passed to the Government. It was agreed that when a vacancy occurred the college would provide a list of three candidates to the Government, from which the choice would be made. The college was allowed to rank the candidates in order of preference and in practice, the most preferred candidate was always appointed. Now the Provost while still formally appointed by the Government is elected by staff plus student representatives, who gather in an electoral meeting, and vote by exhaustive ballot until a candidate obtains an absolute majority; the process takes a day. The Provost takes precedence over everyone else in the college, acts as the chief executive and accounting officer and chairs the board and council. The provost also enjoys a special status in the University of Dublin.\n\nFellows and scholars are elected by the board. Fellows were once elected for life on the basis of a competitive examination. The number of fellows was fixed and a competition to fill a vacancy would occur on the death or resignation of a fellow. Originally all the teaching was carried out by the Fellows. Fellows are now elected from among current college academics, serve until reaching retirement age, and there is no formal limit on their number. Only a minority of academic staff are fellows.  Election to fellowship is recognition for staff that they have excelled in their field and as such, amounts to a promotion for those receiving it. Any person appointed to a professorship who is not already a fellow, is elected a fellow at the next opportunity.\n\nScholars continue to be selected by competitive examination from the Undergraduate body. The Scholarship examination is now set according to the several undergraduate courses. (So there is a scholarship examination in History, or in Mathematics or Engineering, and so forth).  The Scholarship examination is taken in the second year of a four-year degree course (though, in special circumstances, such as illness, bereavement, or studying abroad during the second year, permission may be given to sit the examination in the third year). In theory, a student can sit the examination in any subject, not just the one they are studying. They hold their Scholarship until they are of \"MA standing\" that is, three years after obtaining the BA degree. (So most are Scholars for a term of five years).\n\nFellows are entitled to residence in the college free of charge; most fellows do not exercise this right in practice, with the legal requirement to provide accommodation to them being fulfilled by providing an office. Scholars are also entitled to residence in the college free of charge, they also receive an allowance, and have the fees paid for courses they are taking within the college. However, due to pressure on college accommodation, Scholars are no longer entitled (as they once were) to free rooms for the full duration of their scholarship should they cease to be students.  Fellows and Scholars are also entitled to one free meal a day, usually in the evening (\"Commons\"). Scholars retain the right to free meals for the full duration of their scholarship even after graduation, and ceasing to be students, should they choose to exercise it.\n\n====The Board====\nAside from the Provost, Fellows and Scholars, Trinity College has a Board (dating from 1637), which carries out general governance. Originally the Board consisted of the Provost and Senior Fellows only. There were seven Senior Fellows, defined as those seven fellows that had served longest, Fellowship at that time being for life, unless resigned. Over the years a representational element was added, for example by having elected representatives of the Junior Fellows and of those Professors who were not Fellows, with the last revision before Irish Independence being made by [[Royal Letters Patent]] in 1911. At that time there were, as well as the Senior Fellows, two elected representatives of those Professors that were not Fellows and elected representatives of the Junior Fellows. Over the years, while formal revision did not take place, partly due to the complexity of the process, a number of additional representatives were added to the Board but as \"observers\" and not full voting members. These included representatives of academic staff who were not Fellows, and representatives of students. In practice all attending Board meetings were treated as equals, with votes while not common, being taken by a show of hands. But it remained the case, that legally only the full members of the Board could have their votes recorded and it was mere convention that they always ratified the decision taken by the show of hands.\n\nThe governance of Trinity College was next formally changed in 2000, by the [[Oireachtas]], in legislation proposed by the Board of the college, and approved by the Body Corporate viz ''The Trinity College, Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Act, 2000''. This was introduced separately from the Universities Act 1997. It states that the Board shall comprise:\n* The Provost, Vice-Provost/Chief Academic Officer, Senior Lecturer, Registrar and Bursar;\n* Six Fellows;\n* Five members of the academic staff who are not Fellows, at least three of whom must be of a rank not higher than senior lecturer;\n* Two members of the academic staff of the rank of professor;\n* Three members of the non-academic staff;\n* Four students of the college, at least one of whom shall be a post-graduate student;\n* One member, not an employee or student of the college, chosen by a Board committee from nominations made by organisations \"representative of such business or professional interest as the Board considers appropriate\";\n* One member nominated by the [[Minister for Education and Skills]] following consultation with the Provost.\n\nThe fellows, non-fellow academic staff as well as non-academic staff are elected to serve for a fixed term. The four student members are the President, Education Officer and Welfare Officer of the Students' Union and the president of the Graduate Students' Union (all ex officio) and are elected annually for one-year terms. The vice-provost/chief academic officer, senior lecturer, registrar and bursar are 'annual officers' appointed for one-year (renewable) terms by the Provost. The two significant changes are that the Senior Fellows are no longer on the Board and that two members of the Board are now drawn from without the college.\n\n====The Council====\nThere is a Council (dating from 1874), which oversees academic matters. All decisions of the Council require the approval of the Board, but if the decision in question does not require a new expenditure, the approval is normally formal, without debate. The Council had a significant number of elected representatives from the start, and was also larger than the Board, which at that time, continued to consist of the Provost and seven Senior Fellows only. The Council is the formal body which makes academic staff appointments, always, in practice on the recommendation of appointments panels, but which have themselves been appointed by the Council. An illustration of the relationship between the Board and the Council, is where a decision is made to create a new professorial chair. As this involves paying a salary, the initial decision to create the chair is made by the Council, but the decision to make provision for the salary is made by the Board, consequently, the Board might overrule, or defer a Council decision on grounds of cost.\n\n====The Senate====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Seal of the University of Dublin.png|Seal of the University Senate|thumb|upright]] -->\nThe University of Dublin was modelled on [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]] in the form of a [[collegiate university]], Trinity College being named by the Queen as the ''mater universitatis'' (\"mother of the university\"). As no other college was ever established, the college is the sole constituent college of the university and so Trinity College and the University of Dublin are for most practical purposes synonymous. However, the actual statutes of the university and the college<ref name=\"gsu.tcd.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gsu.tcd.ie/files/Statutes-Current.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Statutes-Current.doc |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318181124/http://www.gsu.tcd.ie/files/Statutes-Current.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> grant the university separate corporate legal rights to own property and borrow money and employ staff. Moreover, while the board of the college has the sole power to propose amendments to the statutes of the university and college, amendments to the university statutes require the consent of the Senate of the university. Consequently, in theory, the Senate can overrule the Board, but only in very limited and particular circumstances. However, it is also the case that the university cannot act independently of the initiative of the Board of Trinity College. The most common example of when the two bodies must collaborate is when a decision is made to establish a new degree. All matters relating to syllabus, examination and teaching are for the college to determine, but actual clearance for the award of the degree is a matter for the university. In the same way, when an individual is awarded an Honorary Degree, the proposal for the award is made by the Board of Trinity College, but this is subject to agreement by a vote of the Senate of Dublin University. All graduates of the university who have at least a master's degree are eligible to be members of the Senate, but in practice, only a few hundred are, with a large proportion being current members of the staff of Trinity College.\n\n====Visitors====\nThe college also has an oversight structure of two visitors, the chancellor of the university, who is elected by the Senate, and the judicial visitor, who is appointed by the Irish Government from a list of two names submitted by the Senate of the university. The current judicial visitor is the Hon. Dr. Justice Maureen Harding Clark. In the event of a disagreement between the two visitors, the opinion of the chancellor prevails. The visitors act as a final \"court of appeal\" within the college, with their modes of appointment giving them the needed independence from the college administration.\n\n===Academic associations===\n[[File:Trinity-College-Campanile-Front.JPG|thumb|upright|Parliament Square: The [[Campanile (Trinity College, Dublin)|Campanile]]]]\nTrinity College is a [[sister college]] to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] of the [[University of Oxford]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] of the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|date=17 June 2005|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article534008.ece|title=Professor A.

Trinity College has also been associated in the past with a number of other teaching institutions. These include [[St Catherine's College of Education for Home Economics]] (now closed), [[Magee College]] and [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]], which is a music conservatoire, as well as The Lir National Academy of Dramatic Art, which is the national conservatoire for theatre training actors, technicians, playwrights and designers to a professional and industry standard \u2013 the Lir is also advised by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in the UK.\n\n===Parliamentary representation===\n{{main|University of Dublin (constituency)}}\nThe university has been linked to parliamentary representation since 1613, when [[James I of England|James I]] granted it the right to elect two members of parliament (MPs) to the [[Irish House of Commons]]. Since the new [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, graduates of the university have formed a constituency which elects three [[Members of the Seanad \u00c9ireann|Senator]]s to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]]. The current representatives of the university constituency are [[Ivana Bacik]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]] and [[Lynn Ruane]]. Notable representatives have included [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Edward Gibson]], [[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|W. E. H. Lecky]], [[Edward Carson]], [[Noel Browne]], [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] and [[Mary Robinson]]. The franchise was originally restricted to the Provost, Fellows and Scholars of Trinity College. This was expanded in 1832 to include those who had received an M.A. and in 1918 all those who had received a degree from the university.\n\n==Academic profile==\nSince considerable academic restructuring in 2008, the college has three academic faculties:\n* Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Engineering, Mathematics and Sciences\n* Health Sciences\n\nEach faculty is headed by a dean (there is also a Dean of Postgraduate Studies), and faculties are divided into schools, of which there were 24 as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/structure/ |title=Faculties and Schools |publisher=Trinity College, Dublin |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Second-level programmes===\nSince 2014, Trinity College's Science Department has established and operated a scheme for second-level students to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The system, similar to [[Dublin City University|DCU's]] [[Centre for the Talented Youth of Ireland|CTYI]] programme, encourages academically gifted secondary students with a high aptitude for the [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects, was named the Walton Club<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/waltonclub/|title=Trinity Walton Club|website=Tcd.ie}}</ref> in honour of [[Ernest Walton]], Ireland's first and only Nobel laureate for Physics.

First-year students at the undergraduate level are called Junior Freshmen; second years, Senior Freshmen; third years, Junior Sophisters; and fourth years, Senior Sophisters. After a proposal in 2017 by the SU Equality Committee, a three-year process changing the titles of first and second years to Junior and Senior Fresh was approved by the Trinity College Board.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Meehan|first1=Sarah|title=Undergraduate name \"Freshman\" to change to gender-neutral \"Fresh\"|url=http://trinitynews.ie/undergraduate-name-freshman-to-change-to-gender-neutral-fresh/|accessdate=28 November 2017|publisher=Trinity News|date=28 November 2017}}</ref> The Freshman Years usually have a set or minimally flexible basic curriculum with the Sophister years allowing for a much greater degree of course variation, as well as taking a year abroad. The passing of two sets of examinations is a prerequisite for a degree. Junior and Senior Freshmen sit preliminary annual exams in Trinity Term of each year which must be passed so that they \"rise\" to the year above. At the end of the Junior Sophister year, undergraduates sit Part I of the Moderatorship exams, subject to attaining an upper-second,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} allows them to take an Honours degree and sit the Part II (Final) of the Moderatorship exams. Successful candidates receive first-, upper or lower second-, or third-class honours, or simply a \"pass\" without honours if they perform insufficiently in Part I of the Moderatorship.\n\nMost non-professional courses take a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. As a matter of tradition, bachelor's degree graduates are eligible, after nine terms from matriculation and without additional study, to purchase for a fee an upgrade of their bachelor's degree to a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]].\nThe four-year degree structure makes undergraduate teaching at Dublin closer to the North American model than that of other universities in England and Ireland (Scottish universities generally also require four years of study for a bachelor's degree).\n\nDegree titles vary according to the subject of study. The [[Trinity College Dublin Law School|Law School]] awards the [[LL.B.]], the LL.B. (ling. franc.) and the LL.B. (ling. germ.). Other degrees include the BAI (engineering) and BBS (business studies). The BSc degree is not in wide use although it is awarded by the School of Nursing and Midwifery<!-- Removed Pharmacy from this list, new course awards a BPharm and MPharm degree -->; most science and computer science students are awarded a BA.<!-- Most, there is a BSc in Computer Science evening course -->\n\nFrom 2018, Trinity will be offering dual BA programme with Columbia University in New York City. Students of History, English, European Studies or Middle Eastern and European Languages and Culture spend their first two years at Trinity and their last two years at Columbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.columbia.edu/tcd/dual-ba-program|title=Dual BA Program - Trinity College Dublin|website=gs.columbia.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Graduate===\nAt postgraduate level, Trinity offers a range of taught and research degrees in all faculties. About 29% of students are post-graduate level, with 1,440 students reading for a research degree and an additional 3,260 on taught courses (see [[#Research and innovation|Research and Innovation]]).<ref name=\"HigherEducationAuthorityArchiveFullTime\"/><ref name=\"HigherEducationAuthorityArchivePartTime\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Graduate_Studies |title=Graduate Studies \u2013 Trinity College Dublin |publisher=Tcd.ie |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nTrinity College's Strategic Plan sets \"the objective of doubling the number of PhDs across all disciplines by 2013 in order to move towards a knowledge society. In order to achieve this, the college has received some of the largest allocations of Irish Government funding which have become competitively available to date.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege |title=Topuniversities.com |publisher=Topuniversities.com |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527060420/http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege |archivedate = 27 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to [[academic degree]]s, the college offers [[Postgraduate Diploma]] (non-degree) qualifications, either directly, or through associated institutions.\n\n===Academic year===\nThe academic year is divided into three [[Academic term|terms]]. [[Michaelmas term]] lasts from October to December; [[Hilary term]] from January to March; and [[Trinity term]] from April to June, with each term separated by a vacation. Whilst teaching takes place across all three terms in postgraduate courses, for undergraduate programmes, teaching is condensed within the first two terms since 2009, with each term consisting of a twelve-week period of teaching known as the Teaching Term. These are followed by three revision weeks and a four-week exam period during the Trinity Term.<ref>{{cite book|title=Trinity College Academic Calendar|quote=(12 weeks each), followed by three revision weeks and a four-week exam period.}}</ref>\n\nInternally at least, the weeks in the term are often referred to by the time elapsed since the start of teaching Term: thus the first week is called \"1st week\" or \"week 1\" and the last is \"Week 12\"/\"12th week\".\n\nThe first week of Trinity Term (which marks conclusion of lecturing for that year) is known as Trinity Week; normally preceded by a string of balls, it consists of a week of sporting and academic events. This includes the Trinity Ball and the Trinity Regatta (a premier social event on the Irish rowing calendar held since 1898),<ref>{{cite web|title=Trinity Regatta \u2013 Dublin University Boat Club|url=http://www.tcdlife.ie/clubs/boat/regatta.php|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090904/http://www.tcdlife.ie/clubs/boat/regatta.php|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> the election of Scholars and Fellows and a college banquet.\n\n===Admissions===\nThe [[Central Applications Office]] processes applications from Irish, British and European Union applicants for undergraduate courses on behalf of Trinity College. Decisions on admissions to undergraduate courses are made by Trinity College who instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates.

Furthermore, applicants for certain courses may be required to achieve more specific qualifications than those prescribed for minimum matriculation requirements.<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/undergraduate-studies/admission-requirements.pdf |title= Admission Requirements |publisher=Tcd.ie}}</ref>  Eligible applicants must then compete for places based on the results of their [[School leaving qualification|school leaving examinations]], however, applicants can additionally take [[matriculation examination]]s<ref>{{cite web|author=Undergraduate Admissions (Email) |url=https://www.tcd.ie/Admissions/undergraduate/assets/pdf/Matric%20Syllabus.pdf |title= Matriculation Examination Syllabus |publisher=Tcd.ie}}</ref> which are held in the university in April, in which each subject is considered equivalent to that of the [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Irish Leaving Certificate]]. Applications for restricted courses<ref>{{cite web|author=Central Applications Office |url=https://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=restrictedcourses&bb=restrictions |title= Restricted-Application Courses |publisher=cao.ie}}</ref> require further assessment considered in the admissions process, such as the [[Health Professions Admissions Test]] (HPAT) for medicine or [[Educational entrance examination|entrance tests]] for music and drama courses. As applications for most courses far exceeds available places, admission is highly selective, demanding excellent grades in the aforementioned examinations. Through the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]], candidates may list several courses at Trinity College and at other third-level institutions in Ireland in order of preference. Places are awarded in mid-August every year by the [[Central Applications Office|CAO]] after matching the number of places available to the academic attainments of the applicants.

On Trinity Monday (the first day of Trinity Term), the Board of the college sits and elects to the Scholarship all those who achieve First in the examination. Election to become a scholar of Trinity Dublin is widely regarded as \u201cthe most prestigious undergraduate award in the country\u201d.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/2019/04/58-scholars-15-fellows-and-two-honorary-fellows-elected/|title=58 Scholars, 15 Fellows and Two Honorary Fellows Elected|last=|first=|date=|work=The University Times|access-date=}}</ref> Those from EU member countries are entitled to free rooms and Commons (the college's [[Formal (university)|Formal]] Hall), an annual stipend and exemption from fees for the duration of their scholarship, which lasts for fifteen terms. Scholars from non-EU member countries have their fees reduced by the current value of EU member fees. Scholars may add the suffix \"'''SCH.'''\" to their names, have the note \"discip. schol.\" appended to their name at Commencements and are entitled to wear Bachelor's Robes and a velvet mortarboard.\n\nCompetition for Scholarship involves a searching examination and successful candidates must be of exceptional ability. The concept of scholarship is a valued tradition of the college, and many of the college's most distinguished members were elected scholars (including Samuel Beckett and Ernest Walton). The Scholars' dinner, to which 'Scholars of the decade' (those elected in the current year, and every year multiple of a decade previous to it, e.g., 2013, 2003,..) are invited, forms one of the major events in Trinity's calendar. A scholarship at Trinity College is a prestigious undergraduate award; a principal aim of the college is the pursuit of excellence, and one of the most tangible demonstrations of this is the institution of scholarship.\n\nUnder the Foundation Charter (of 1592), Scholars were part of the body corporate (three Scholars were named in the charter \"in the name of many\"). Until 1609 there were about 51 Scholars at any one time. A figure of seventy was permanently fixed in the revising Letters Patent of Charles I in 1637. Trinity Monday was appointed as the day when all future elections to Fellowship and Scholarship would be announced (at this time Trinity Monday was always celebrated on the Monday after the feast of the [[Trinity Sunday|Holy Trinity]]). Up to this point, all undergraduates were Scholars, but soon after 1637 the practice of admitting students other than Scholars commenced.\n\nUntil 1856, only the classical subjects were examined. The questions concerned all the classical authors prescribed for the entrance examination and for the undergraduate course up to the middle of the Junior Sophister year. So candidates had no new material to read, 'but they had to submit to a very searching examination on the fairly lengthy list of classical texts which they were supposed by this time to have mastered'. The close link with the undergraduate syllabus is underlined by the refusal until 1856 to admit Scholars to the Library (a request for admission was rejected by the Board in 1842 on the grounds that Scholars should stick to their prescribed books and not indulge in 'those desultory habits' that admission to an extensive library would encourage). During the second half of the nineteenth century, the content of the examination gradually came to include other disciplines.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, \"Non-Foundation\" Scholarships were introduced. This initially was a device to permit women to be, in effect, elected Scholars, despite the then commonly accepted legal view that the statute revision of 1637 only permitted males to be elected Foundation Scholars. Clearly, when women were not permitted in the college, this had not caused any difficulties, but with the admission of women as full members of the college, an anomaly was created. Non-Foundation Scholarship granted to the women elected to it all the rights of men, but with the exception of voting rights at a meeting of the Body Corporate, a very rare event in any case. As women are now admitted to Foundation Scholarship on exactly the same basis as men Non-Foundation Scholarships are retained as a device to allow for more than seventy persons to be Scholars at any one time provided sufficient meet the qualifying standards. Foundation Scholarships are given to those whose performance is considered particularly exceptional, with the remaining qualifying persons that year being elected as Non-Foundation Scholars. While the number of Foundation Scholars remains fixed at seventy, there is, in theory, no limit on the number of Non-Foundation scholars. Non-Foundation and Foundation Scholars receive the same benefits and therefore the two groups are regarded in equal esteem and usually refer to themselves collectively as the [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|Scholars of Trinity College Dublin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/undergraduate-studies/foundation-and-non-foundation-scholarships.pdf|title=Trinity College Dublin, Calendar, Undergraduate Studies Part II, Part D9, Foundation and Non-Foundation Scholarships|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It is worth noting that when the college had only a few hundred members the Foundation Scholars could easily amount to ten per cent of the whole undergraduate body; now that the college numbers members in thousands even the addition of current numbers of Non Foundation Scholars means that the proportion of students elected Scholars is still lower than it has even been before, and being elected to Scholarship is more competitive than it was.\n\n===Research===\nTrinity College is the most productive internationally recognised research centre in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitydublintrinitycollege Topuniversities.com] \"Interdisciplinarity forms a key element in the College strategy in increasing Trinity's international standing as a research-led university.

[[Trinity College Dublin Students' Union]] funds ''[[The University Times]]''. Since its founding in 2009, the paper has consistently won national and international awards, including the award for best all-around non-daily student newspaper in the world from the US-based [[Society of Professional Journalists]]. Even though it is funded by the union, it is often critical of its activities. In 2019, Provost Patrick Prendergast said that \"The University Times has pursued an independent course in many aspects of College life, and done so fearlessly.\"\n\n''[[Trinity News]]'', meanwhile, is Ireland's oldest student newspaper, having been founded in 1953. Like ''The University Times'', it publishes both an online edition and a print edition every three weeks during the academic year. For the last 10 years the paper has been edited by a full-time student editor, who takes a sabbatical year from their studies, supported by a voluntary part-time staff of 30 student section editors and writers.\n\nStudent magazines currently in publication include the satirical newspaper ''[[The Piranha (newspaper)|The Piranha]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitypublications.info/Our%20Publications.html |title=Trinity Publications |publisher=Trinitypublications.info |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> (formerly ''Piranha!'' magazine but rebranded in 2009), the generalist ''[[T.C.D.

She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nRegarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]].

She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nRegarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]].
