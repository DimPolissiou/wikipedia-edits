However \"White Rock\" was only used as a temporary name during its construction and when work was finished, the name was dropped and the stadium owners began looking for sponsors for the stadium.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/3914539.stm | title= Stadium name puzzle for fans | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=21 July 2004 | date=21 July 2004}}</ref> While sponsors were being searched for, it was called \"New Stadium Swansea\".

He was probably born in [[Lincolnshire]], England, but took up a career at sea at an early age. In 1839 he settled in Wellington New Zealand and remained there for the rest of his life. He brought three of his younger brothers to New Zealand and they co-ordinated their efforts.\n\nA tough man having \"shrewd judgement, unflagging energy and sheer determination\" his frugal ways and his personal engagement in physical labour deferred social acceptance by the new colony's social \u00e9lite. Nevertheless, he used these talents to make himself a rich man and with his three brothers all four became major landowners and pastoralists in the North and in the South Island.\n\nWhen he died in [[Wellington]] he was described as one of the richest people in the country.\n\n==Early life==\nBarnard Rhodes was the eldest of eleven surviving children of William Rhodes, a wealthy [[Tenant farmer#England and Wales|tenant farmer]] born in Yorkshire, and his wife, Theodosia Maria Heaton. He was baptised on 9 May 1807 at [[Epworth, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref name=\"DNZB WB Rhodes\">{{DNZB|Patterson|Brad |1r7|Rhodes, William Barnard|20 January 2016}}</ref>  At the time of his death it was suggested he was rather older than his announced 70 years.<ref>[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WAIST18780214.2.4?query=rhodes%20age ''Wairarapa Standard'', 14 February 1878, Page 2]</ref>\n\nHe was a [[Second mate#The Age of Sail|second officer on a merchant vessel]] by 1826 and by 1831 he had his [[Sea captain|own command]]. After visiting South America, Africa, and [[India]], Rhodes ended up in New South Wales where he was able to make substantial pastoral investments. Rhodes seems to have first visited New Zealand on a whaling expedition commanding the barque Australian for Sydney NSW business, Cooper and Holt later Holt and Roberts. During that time he arranged A B Smith and Co of Sydney to be his (stock and station) agents to look after his entire property in the colony of New South Wales.<ref>[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-RhoWhal-t1-body-d2-d1.html#n45 W B Rhodes, ''The Whaling Journal of Captain W B Rhodes: Barque Australian of Sydney 1836 \u2013 1838'']</ref><ref>[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-RhoWhal-t1-back-d1-d9.html Cooper & Holt, ''Owners' further instructions to Captain (W B) Rhodes'']</ref>\n\n==Major landowner==\nIn late 1839, in partnership with the mercantile firm of Daniel Cooper and James Holt, he went back to New Zealand to acquire land for [[Cattle station|cattle runs]] and set up [[Trading post|trading stations]].

Later, along with his younger brothers, their South Island estates stretched from [[Banks Peninsula]] to [[Otago]].

He was probably born in [[Lincolnshire]], England, but took up a career at sea at an early age. In 1839 he settled in Wellington New Zealand and remained there for the rest of his life. He brought three of his younger brothers to New Zealand and they co-ordinated their efforts.\n\nA tough man having \"shrewd judgement, unflagging energy and sheer determination\" his frugal ways and his personal engagement in physical labour deferred social acceptance by the new colony's social \u00e9lite. Nevertheless, he used these talents to make himself a rich man and with his three brothers all four became major landowners and pastoralists in the North and in the South Island.\n\nWhen he died in [[Wellington]] he was described as one of the richest people in the country.\n\n==Early life==\nBarnard Rhodes was the eldest of eleven surviving children of William Rhodes, a wealthy [[Tenant farmer#England and Wales|tenant farmer]] born in Yorkshire, and his wife, Theodosia Maria Heaton. He was baptised on 9 May 1807 at [[Epworth, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref name=\"DNZB WB Rhodes\">{{DNZB|Patterson|Brad |1r7|Rhodes, William Barnard|20 January 2016}}</ref>  At the time of his death it was suggested he was rather older than his announced 70 years.<ref>[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WAIST18780214.2.4?query=rhodes%20age ''Wairarapa Standard'', 14 February 1878, Page 2]</ref>\n\nHe was a [[Second mate#The Age of Sail|second officer on a merchant vessel]] by 1826 and by 1831 he had his [[Sea captain|own command]]. After visiting South America, Africa, and [[India]], Rhodes ended up in New South Wales where he was able to make substantial pastoral investments. Rhodes seems to have first visited New Zealand on a whaling expedition commanding the barque Australian for Sydney NSW business, Cooper and Holt later Holt and Roberts. During that time he arranged A B Smith and Co of Sydney to be his (stock and station) agents to look after his entire property in the colony of New South Wales.<ref>[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-RhoWhal-t1-body-d2-d1.html#n45 W B Rhodes, ''The Whaling Journal of Captain W B Rhodes: Barque Australian of Sydney 1836 - 1838'']</ref><ref>[http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-RhoWhal-t1-back-d1-d9.html Cooper & Holt, ''Owners' further instructions to Captain (W B) Rhodes'']</ref>\n\n==Major landowner==\nIn late 1839, in partnership with the mercantile firm of Daniel Cooper and James Holt, he went back to New Zealand to acquire land for [[Cattle station|cattle runs]] and set up [[Trading post|trading stations]].

supply their kit for the next six years.\n\n*'''Home:''' The new home kit remained broadly the same as the previous season. The main change related to the trim of the shirt, switching from white and navy stripes to thick navy blue bands on the neck and arms. In addition to this, sky blue shorts were used instead of the traditional white shorts. \n*'''Away:''' The away kit featured a fading pattern, running from navy blue to mid-blue, which were combined with yellow applications. The shorts and socks were navy blue as well.\n*'''Third:''' The third kit was in two shades of purple with a darker shade used on the collar and back of the strip, in line with Nike's new template used by its top teams. The two shades were separated by luminous yellow flashes.\n*'''Keeper:''' Three goalkeeper strips were revealed for the 2014-15 campaign, with the first and second-choice strips being essentially negatives of each other. The primary kit was mainly yellow with a light green band on each arm surrounded by a gradient colour pattern, the secondary kit was mainly green with a yellow band on each arm which was surrounded by a similar fading pattern, and the third kit was mainly black with red bands and the same gradient pattern.\n\n==Non-competitive==\n\n===Pre-season===\n\n====Friendlies====\n<!--\"Friendlies\" refer to any games not considered to be for a pre-season trophy-->\n{{football box collapsible\n|result     = L\n|round      = [[Exhibition game|Friendly]]\n|date       = 13 July 2014\n|time       = 16:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]] ([[UTC+01:00]])\n|team1      = [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] {{flagicon|SCO}}\n|score      = 2\u20130\n|report     = [http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2014/July/Dundee-v-City-match-report Report]\n|team2      = {{flagicon|ENG}} Manchester City\n|goals1     = [[Gary Harkins|Harkins]] {{goal|26}}<br />[[Dedryck Boyata|Boyata]] {{goal|38|o.g.}}\n|goals2     =\n|stadium    = [[Dens Park]]\n|location   = [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]]\n|attendance = 6,859\n|referee    =\n}}\n{{football box collapsible\n|result     = W\n|round      = [[Exhibition game|Friendly]]\n|date       = 18 July 2014\n|time       = 19:30 [[British Summer Time|BST]] ([[UTC+01:00]])\n|team1      = [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] {{flagicon|SCO}}\n|score      = 1\u20132\n|report     = [http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2014/July/Hearts-v-City-match-report Report]\n|team2      = {{flagicon|ENG}} Manchester City\n|goals1     = [[Osman Sow|Sow]] {{goal|56}}\n|goals2     = [[Scott Sinclair|Sinclair]] {{goal|25}}<br />[[Aleksandar Kolarov|Kolarov]] {{goal|80|pen.}}\n|stadium    = [[Tynecastle Stadium]]\n|location   = [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]\n|attendance = \n|referee    =\n}}\n\n====Summer in the Soccer Capital - Champions Shield====\n{{football box collapsible\n|result     = W\n|round      = [[Exhibition game|Friendly]]\n|date       = 23 July 2014\n|time       = 20:15 [[Central Time Zone|CDT]]<br />02:15 [[British Summer Time|BST]]\n|team1      = [[Sporting Kansas City]] {{flagicon|USA}}\n|score      = 1\u20134\n|report     = [http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Match-reports/2014/July/Sporting-KC-v-City Report]\n|team2      = {{flagicon|ENG}} Manchester City\n|goals1     = [[C.J.

years.\n\n*'''Home:''' The new home kit remained broadly the same as the previous season. The main change related to the trim of the shirt, switching from white and navy stripes to thick navy blue bands on the neck and arms. In addition to this, sky blue shorts were used instead of the traditional white shorts. \n*'''Away:''' The away kit featured a fading pattern, running from navy blue to mid-blue, which were combined with yellow applications. The shorts and socks were navy blue as well.\n*'''Third:''' The third kit was in two shades of purple with a darker shade used on the collar and back of the strip, in line with Nike's new template used by its top teams. The two shades were separated by luminous yellow flashes.\n*'''Keeper:''' Three goalkeeper strips were revealed for the 2014-15 campaign, with the first and second-choice strips being essentially negatives of each other. The primary kit was mainly yellow with a light green band on each arm surrounded by a gradient colour pattern, the secondary kit was mainly green with a yellow band on each arm which was surrounded by a similar fading pattern, and the third kit was mainly black with red bands and the same gradient pattern.\n\n==Non-competitive==\n\n===Pre-season===\n\n====Friendlies====\n<!--\"Friendlies\" refer to any games not considered to be for a pre-season trophy-->\n{{football box collapsible\n|result     = L\n|round      = [[Exhibition game|Friendly]]\n|date       = 13 July 2014\n|time       = 16:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]] ([[UTC+01:00]])\n|team1      = [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] {{flagicon|SCO}}\n|score      = 2\u20130\n|report     = [http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2014/July/Dundee-v-City-match-report Report]\n|team2      = {{flagicon|ENG}} Manchester City\n|goals1     = [[Gary Harkins|Harkins]] {{goal|26}}<br />[[Dedryck Boyata|Boyata]] {{goal|38|o.g.}}\n|goals2     =\n|stadium    = [[Dens Park]]\n|location   = [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]]\n|attendance = 6,859\n|referee    =\n}}\n{{football box collapsible\n|result     = W\n|round      = [[Exhibition game|Friendly]]\n|date       = 18 July 2014\n|time       = 19:30 [[British Summer Time|BST]] ([[UTC+01:00]])\n|team1      = [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] {{flagicon|SCO}}\n|score      = 1\u20132\n|report     = [http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2014/July/Hearts-v-City-match-report Report]\n|team2      = {{flagicon|ENG}} Manchester City\n|goals1     = [[Osman Sow|Sow]] {{goal|56}}\n|goals2     = [[Scott Sinclair|Sinclair]] {{goal|25}}<br />[[Aleksandar Kolarov|Kolarov]] {{goal|80|pen.}}\n|stadium    = [[Tynecastle Stadium]]\n|location   = [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]\n|attendance = \n|referee    =\n}}\n\n====Summer in the Soccer Capital - Champions Shield====\n{{football box collapsible\n|result     = W\n|round      = [[Exhibition game|Friendly]]\n|date       = 23 July 2014\n|time       = 20:15 [[Central Time Zone|CDT]]<br />02:15 [[British Summer Time|BST]]\n|team1      = [[Sporting Kansas City]] {{flagicon|USA}}\n|score      = 1\u20134\n|report     = [http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Match-reports/2014/July/Sporting-KC-v-City Report]\n|team2      = {{flagicon|ENG}} Manchester City\n|goals1     = [[C.J.

She was the guard, in [[Tartarus]], of the [[Cyclopes]] and [[Hundred-Handers]], whom [[Cronus]], the ruler of the [[Titans]], had imprisoned there. When it was prophesied to [[Zeus]] that he would be victorious in the [[Titanomachy]]&mdash;the great war against the Titans&mdash;with the help of Campe's prisoners, he killed Campe, freeing the Cyclopes and Hundred-Handers, who then helped Zeus defeat Cronus.<ref>Grimal, p. 87 s.v.

As a common noun ''\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03b7'' is the Greek word for caterpillar or silkworm. It is probably related to the homophone ''\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03ae'' (with the accent on the second syllable) whose first meaning is the winding of a river, and came to mean, more generally, any kind of bend, or curve.<ref>Ogden, p. 86; [[LSJ]], s.vv.

These events were probably also told in the lost epic poem the ''[[Titanomachy (epic poem)|Titanomachy]]'',<ref>West 2002, p. 110.</ref> upon which the mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] perhaps based his account of the war.<ref>Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA68 p. 68], says that Apollodorus' version \"perhaps derived from the lost ''[[Titanomachy (epic poem)|Titanomachia]]'', or from the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] literature\". See also Gantz, p. 45.</ref> According to Apollodorus:\n{{quote|Zeus waged the war against Cronus and the Titans. They fought for ten years, and Earth prophesied victory to Zeus if he should have as allies those who had been hurled down to Tartarus. So he slew their jailoress Campe, and loosed their bonds.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.2.1 1.2.1] = [[Eumelus]] ''Titanomachy'' F6 West 2003, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/eumelus-epic_testimonia_fragments/2003/pb_LCL497.227.xml pp. 226&ndash;229].</ref>}}\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] says that the god [[Dionysus]], while camped beside the Libyan city of Zabirna, encountered and killed \"an earth-born monster called Camp\u00ea\" that was terrorizing the city, killing many of its residents.<ref>Ogden, p. 85; [[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html#72 3.72.2&ndash;3]. Ogden describes Diodorus' account as having \"some sort of loose associations with the Titanomachy.\"</ref>\nNeither Apollodorus nor Diodorus provide any description of Campe, however the Greek poet [[Nonnus]] provides an elaborately detailed one. According to Nonnus, Zeus, with his thunderbolt, destroyed:\n{{quote|highheaded Campe ... for all the many crooked shapes of her whole body. A thousand crawlers from her viperish feet, spitting poison afar, were fanning Enyo to a flame, a mass of misshapen coils. Round her neck flowered fifty various heads of wild beasts : some roared with lion's heads like the grim face of the riddling Sphinx; others were spluttering foam from the tusks of wild boars; her countenance was the very image of Scylla with a marshalled regiment of thronging dog's heads. Doubleshaped, she appeared a woman to the middle of her body, with clusters of poison-spitting serpents for hair. Her giant form, from the chest to the parting-point of the thighs, was covered all over with a bastard shape of hard sea-monsters' scales. The claws of her wide-scattering hands were curved like a crooktalon sickle. From her neck over her terrible shoulders, with tail raised high over her throat, a scorpion with an icy sting sharp-whetted crawled and coiled upon itself. Such was manifoldshaped Campe as she rose writhing, and flew roaming about earth and air and briny deep, and flapping a couple of dusky wings, rousing tempests and arming gales, that blackwinged nymphe of Tartaros: from her eyelids a flickering flame belched out far-travelling sparks. Yet heavenly Zeus ... killed that great monster, and conquered the snaky Enyo Cronos.<ref>[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca02nonnuoft#page/78/mode/2up 18.236&ndash;264].</ref>}}\n\nThus for Nonnus, Campe is woman-like from the upper torso and above, with the scales of a sea-monster from the chest down, with several snaky appendages, along with the parts of several other animals protruding from her body.<ref>Ogden, pp. 85&ndash;86; Fontenrose, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&pg=PA243 pp. 243&ndash;244].</ref> His description of Campe is similar to Hesiod's description of the monster [[Typhon]] (''Theogony'' 820 ff.).<ref>Rouse, [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca02nonnuoft#page/78/mode/2up p. 79 n. ''c'']; Ogden, p. 85.</ref> [[Joseph Eddy Fontenrose]] says that for Nonnus, Campe \"was a female counterpart of his Typhon ... That is, she was Echidna under a different name, as Nonnus indicates, calling her Echidnaean Enyo, identifying her snaky legs with echidnas, and likening her to Sphinx and Skylla\".<ref>Fontenrose, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&pg=PA243 pp.243&ndash;244].

She was the guard, in [[Tartarus]], of the [[Cyclopes]] and [[Hundred-Handers]], whom [[Cronus]], the ruler of the [[Titans]], had imprisoned there. When it was prophesied to [[Zeus]] that he would be victorious in the [[Titanomachy]]&mdash;the great war against the Titans&mdash;with the help of Campe's prisoners, he killed Campe, freeing the Cyclopes and Hundred-Handers, who then helped Zeus defeat Cronus.<ref>Grimal, p. 87 s.v.

As a common noun ''\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03b7'' is the Greek word for caterpillar or silkworm. It is probably related to the homophone ''\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03ae'' (with the accent on the second syllable) whose first meaning is the winding of a river, and came to mean, more generally, any kind of bend, or curve.<ref>Ogden, p. 86; [[LSJ]],  s.vv.

These events were probably also told in the lost epic poem the ''[[Titanomachy (epic poem)|Titanomachy]]'',<ref>West 2002, p. 110.</ref> upon which the mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] perhaps based his account of the war.<ref>Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA68 p. 68], says that Apollodorus' version \"perhaps derived from the lost ''[[Titanomachy (epic poem)|Titanomachia]]'', or from the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] literature\". See also Gantz, p. 45.</ref> According to Apollodorus:\n{{quote|Zeus waged the war against Cronus and the Titans. They fought for ten years, and Earth prophesied victory to Zeus if he should have as allies those who had been hurled down to Tartarus. So he slew their jailoress Campe, and loosed their bonds.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.2.1 1.2.1] = [[Eumelus]] ''Titanomachy'' F6 West 2003, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/eumelus-epic_testimonia_fragments/2003/pb_LCL497.227.xml pp. 226&ndash;229].</ref>}}\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] says that the god [[Dionysus]], while camped beside the Libyan city of Zabirna, encountered and killed \"an earth-born monster called Camp\u00ea\" that was terrorizing the city, killing many of its residents.<ref>Ogden, p. 85; [[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html#72 3.72.2&ndash;3]. Ogden describes Diodorus' account as having \"some sort of loose associations with the Titanomachy.\"</ref>\nNeither Apollodorus nor Diodorus provide any description of Campe, however the Greek poet [[Nonnus]] provides an elaborately detailed one. According to Nonnus, Zeus, with his thunderbolt, destroyed:\n{{quote|highheaded Campe ... for all the many crooked shapes of her whole body. A thousand crawlers from her viperish feet, spitting poison afar, were fanning Enyo to a flame, a mass of misshapen coils. Round her neck flowered fifty various heads of wild beasts : some roared with lion's heads like the grim face of the riddling Sphinx; others were spluttering foam from the tusks of wild boars; her countenance was the very image of Scylla with a marshalled regiment of thronging dog's heads. Doubleshaped, she appeared a woman to the middle of her body, with clusters of poison-spitting serpents for hair. Her giant form, from the chest to the parting-point of the thighs, was covered all over with a bastard shape of hard sea-monsters' scales. The claws of her wide-scattering hands were curved like a crooktalon sickle. From her neck over her terrible shoulders, with tail raised high over her throat, a scorpion with an icy sting sharp-whetted crawled and coiled upon itself. Such was manifoldshaped Campe as she rose writhing, and flew roaming about earth and air and briny deep, and flapping a couple of dusky wings, rousing tempests and arming gales, that blackwinged nymphe of Tartaros: from her eyelids a flickering flame belched out far-travelling sparks. Yet heavenly Zeus ... killed that great monster, and conquered the snaky Enyo Cronos.<ref>[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca02nonnuoft#page/78/mode/2up 18.236&ndash;264].</ref>}}\n\nThus for Nonnus, Campe is woman-like from the upper torso and above, with the scales of a sea-monster from the chest down, with several snaky appendages, along with the parts of several other animals protruding from her body.<ref>Ogden, pp. 85&ndash;86; Fontenrose, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&pg=PA243 pp. 243&ndash;244].</ref> His description of Campe is similar to Hesiod's description of the monster [[Typhon]] (''Theogony'' 820 ff.).<ref>Rouse, [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca02nonnuoft#page/78/mode/2up p. 79 n. ''c'']; Ogden, p. 85.</ref> [[Joseph Eddy Fontenrose]] says that for Nonnus, Campe \"was a female counterpart of his Typhon ... That is, she was Echidna under a different name, as Nonnus indicates, calling her Echidnaean Enyo, identifying her snaky legs with echidnas, and likening her to Sphinx and Skylla\".<ref>Fontenrose, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&pg=PA243 pp.243&ndash;244].  Fontenrose, who also associates Campe with the [[Babylonia]]n sea-monster [[Tiamat]], notes that \"Epicharmos (ap. Hesych. K614) either called Kampe a k\u00eatos or spoke of some kind of sea-beast called kamp\u00ea.

However, social messaging platforms are not designed to communicate on design and [[construction]] projects and hence are not effective. Their use leads to scattered communication and documents in multiple messaging groups and [[Email|emails]]. While managing his design practice, Chetan Singh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tofler.in/chetan-krishan-singh/director/00247712|title=Basic information about CHETAN KRISHAN SINGH as a director in Indian companies|last=www.tofler.in|website=www.tofler.in|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> faced challenges communicating with his team and other project stakeholders using messaging tools and emails. Communication problems delayed projects and also reduced team productivity. To solve these challenges he innovated and launched ArchChat in January 2020.\n\n==Features==\n\nArchChat brings architects, designers, [[Engineering consulting|engineering consultants]], contractors, product sellers, project owners, and their teams together to communicate and collaborate on live projects. Projects are created in ArchChat. Project stakeholders join projects as collaborators and communicate privately or in groups with each other. Being a platform for the global design community, ArchChat helps project stakeholders from varied cultures and geographies [[communicate]] and collaborate in their [[First language|native language]]. Their communication gets tagged to respective designs, [[Drawing|drawings]], products, or documents and saved in related project spaces. With communication and documents sorted for each space, all project stakeholders remain on the same page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/during-covid-19-crisis-archchat-makes-possible-architects-124101452.html|title=During COVID-19 crisis, ArchChat makes it possible for architects and designers to work from home|website=in.news.yahoo.com|language=en-IN|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\nArchChat is a content rich platform. Users publish content on ArchChat Gallery. The content is classified into [[Product|products]], designs, articles, [[Video (disambiguation)|videos]] and service listings. Project collaborators browse content to find new products and designs. When products are added to projects, [[sellers]] get new business opportunities and become collaborators on live projects. Service listings help architects, designers and [[Freelancer|freelancers]] get jobs and business opportunities through collaboration on projects.\n\n==Growth==\n\nCurrently, ArchChat has over 9500 users in [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], [[Singapore]], Malaysia, Thailand and [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200419064611/http://bwdisrupt.businessworld.in/article/ArchChat-Communication-Collaboration-Platform-for-Architecture-Interior-and-Construction-Projects/03-01-2020-181461/|title=ArchChat Communication Collaboration Platform for Architecture Interior and Construction Projects - BW Disrupt|date=2020-04-19|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> 30,000 new architects are expected to join ArchChat in 2020.\n\n==During COVID 19 Lockdown==\n\nAs everyone knows the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] pandemic has swept the world making it necessary for everyone to remain at home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/during-covid19-crisis-archchat-makes-it-possible-for-architects--designers-to-work-from-home/1795716|title=During COVID-19 Crisis, ArchChat Makes it Possible for Architects & Designers to Work from Home|last=|first=|date=|website=outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> ArchChat supports the design community in working from home during the COVID-19 crises.<ref>{{Cite news|last=ANI|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/during-covid-19-crisis-archchat-makes-it-possible-for-architects-and-designers-to-work-from-home-120040801137_1.html|title=During COVID-19 crisis, ArchChat makes it possible for architects and designers to work from home|date=2020-04-08|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> In the absence of a communication platform for the design and construction industry, the design community has been finding it difficult to work remotely.

However, social messaging platforms are not designed to communicate on design and [[construction]] projects and hence are not effective. Their use leads to scattered communication and documents in multiple messaging groups and [[Email|emails]]. While managing his design practice, Chetan Singh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tofler.in/chetan-krishan-singh/director/00247712|title=Basic information about CHETAN KRISHAN SINGH as a director in Indian companies|last=www.tofler.in|website=www.tofler.in|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> faced challenges communicating with his team and other project stakeholders using messaging tools and emails. Communication problems delayed projects and also reduced team productivity. To solve these challenges he innovated and launched ArchChat in January 2020.\n\n==Features==\n\nArchChat brings architects, designers, [[Engineering consulting|engineering consultants]], contractors, product sellers, project owners, and their teams together to communicate and collaborate on live projects. Projects are created in ArchChat. Project stakeholders join projects as collaborators and communicate privately or in groups with each other. Being a platform for the global design community, ArchChat helps project stakeholders from varied cultures and geographies [[communicate]] and collaborate in their [[First language|native language]]. Their communication gets tagged to respective designs, [[Drawing|drawings]], products, or documents and saved in related project spaces. With communication and documents sorted for each space, all project stakeholders remain on the same page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/during-covid-19-crisis-archchat-makes-possible-architects-124101452.html|title=During COVID-19 crisis, ArchChat makes it possible for architects and designers to work from home|website=in.news.yahoo.com|language=en-IN|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\nArchChat is a content rich platform. Users publish content on ArchChat Gallery. The content is classified into [[Product|products]], designs, articles, [[Video (disambiguation)|videos]] and service listings. Project collaborators browse content to find new products and designs. When products are added to projects, [[sellers]] get new business opportunities and become collaborators on live projects. Service listings help architects, designers and [[Freelancer|freelancers]] get jobs and business opportunities through collaboration on projects.\n\n==Growth==\n\nCurrently, ArchChat has over 9500 users in [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], [[Singapore]], Malaysia, Thailand and [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200419064611/http://bwdisrupt.businessworld.in/article/ArchChat-Communication-Collaboration-Platform-for-Architecture-Interior-and-Construction-Projects/03-01-2020-181461/|title=ArchChat Communication Collaboration Platform for Architecture Interior and Construction Projects - BW Disrupt|date=2020-04-19|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> 30,000 new architects are expected to join ArchChat in 2020.\n\n==During COVID 19 Lockdown==\n\nAs everyone knows the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] pandemic has swept the world making it necessary for everyone to remain at home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/during-covid19-crisis-archchat-makes-it-possible-for-architects--designers-to-work-from-home/1795716|title=During COVID-19 Crisis, ArchChat Makes it Possible for Architects & Designers to Work from Home|last=|first=|date=|website=outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> ArchChat supports the design community in working from home during the COVID-19 crises.<ref>{{Cite news|last=ANI|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/during-covid-19-crisis-archchat-makes-it-possible-for-architects-and-designers-to-work-from-home-120040801137_1.html|title=During COVID-19 crisis, ArchChat makes it possible for architects and designers to work from home|date=2020-04-08|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> In the absence of a communication platform for the design and construction industry, the design community has been finding it difficult to work remotely.

(Her mother, following the tragedy, was committed to an asylum.) Miss Lewis (Brenda Bruce), a teacher, takes Janet home and in the absence of Henry Baxter (David Knight), Janet's guardian, they are met by John (George A. Cooper), the chauffeur; Mrs. Gibbs (Irene Richmond), the housekeeper; and Grace Maddox (Moira Redmond), an attractive nurse-companion hired by Henry. Miss Lewis leaves Janet in Grace's care. \n\nThe nightmares continue: a white-shrouded woman (Clytie Jessop) roams the corridors, inviting Janet to burst into her parents' room, where she finds the same woman on the bed with a knife in her chest. When Henry returns, he finds Janet under sedation; her doctors recommend psychiatric care but he refuses and Janet tries to commit suicide. \n\nHenry's wife comes to tea and, because she seems to be the woman in Janet's nightmares, Janet stabs the woman to death and is promptly committed to an institution. The woman in white is revealed to be Grace, disguised with a wig and mask and in cahoots with Henry. They marry, but Grace begins believing that Henry is trying to drive her mad. Under the impression that Janet has escaped from the asylum, Grace stabs Henry to death, expecting Janet to be blamed.
