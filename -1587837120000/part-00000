It was released in Japan in March 2004, and in North America in September 2004. The game resulted from a school project from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory and was developed for less than {{USD}}1 million. In designing ''Katamari Damacy'', the development team led by [[Keita Takahashi]] aimed to maintain three key points: novelty, ease of understanding, and enjoyment.\n\nThe game's plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild the [[star]]s, [[constellation]]s, and [[Moon]], which were inadvertently destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly [[adhesive]] ball called a ''katamari'' around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains until the ball has grown great enough to become a star. ''Katamari Damacy''{{'s}} story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance of realism, though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production.\n\nOverall, ''Katamari Damacy'' was well received in Japan and North America. The game was dubbed a [[sleeper hit]] and won several awards. The success of the game led to the creation of the ''[[Katamari]]'' franchise, and inspired the development of other video games. A high-definition remaster of the game, ''Katamari Damacy Reroll''{{efn|''Katamari Damacy Encore'' in Japan.}}, was released on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] in December 2018. Some critics have called it one of the [[greatest games of all time]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn a drunken stupor, an eccentric, god-like entity called the King of All Cosmos destroys all the stars, Earth's Moon and other such celestial bodies in the universe, save for Earth itself. Despite acknowledging his mistake, the King charges his 5-centimeter-tall son, the Prince, to go to [[Earth]] with a \"katamari\"\u2014a magical ball that allows anything smaller than it to stick to it and make it grow\u2014and collect enough material for him to recreate the stars and the Moon.  The Prince is successful, and the universe is returned to normal.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nA side-story follows the Hoshino family as the Prince works at his tasks.  The father, an [[astronaut]], is unable to go to the moon after it is wiped out by the King, and the daughter, whose name is Michiru, \"senses\" the Prince's work\u2014she can feel when each constellation returns to the sky.  Ultimately, the family, along with their house and town, are rolled up in the katamari that is used to remake the moon.<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Kata27.jpg|left|thumb|The \"Make A Star\" mode in ''Katamari Damacy'' is the primary mode, where the player must grow the ''katamari'' to a specific size (diameter) in a limited amount of time.]]\nThe player controls the Prince as he rolls the katamari around houses, gardens, and towns in order to meet certain parameters set by the King of All Cosmos.  The player uses the two [[analog stick]]s on the [[DualShock]] controller in a manner similar to the classic [[arcade game]] ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' to control the direction the katamari rolls.  Other controls can be triggered by the player to gain a quick burst of speed, flip the Prince to the other side of the katamari and more.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nObjects that are smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to determine if an object will stick to the katamari.  This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>  Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, and they can be rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked.  In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up to the point where the katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nThe typical mission given by the King of All Cosmos is the \"Make a Star\" mode, where the player needs to grow the katamari to a specific size within a given time frame. Other missions have more specific collecting rules, such as collecting as many items (swans, crabs, pairs) as possible within a given time, or collecting the largest item possible (such as a cow or bear).<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/>  The player can attempt a [[score attack]] mode for any level, in which they try to make the largest katamari possible in the time allotted.  Certain levels can unlock an \"eternal mode\" by creating an exceptionally large katamari. In eternal modes, the player can explore the level with no time limit.<ref name=\"1up review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/katamari-damacy_6|title=Katamari Damacy (PS2)|website=[[1UP.com|1UP]]|first=Jeremy|last=Parish|date=2004-09-20|accessdate=2014-09-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721201850/http://www.1up.com/reviews/katamari-damacy_6|archivedate=2015-07-21}}</ref>\n\nEach level features two secret items that can be found. The first item is a ''royal present'' that contains an object that the Prince can wear. Most gifts are non-functional, but one includes a camera that can be used to take in-game screenshots.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>  The other secret item is a cousin of the Prince, which, once rolled up in main gameplay, can be used as a character in the various multiplayer modes. However, cousins can only be found and rolled up after the game is beaten. The game also tracks which objects the player has collected at any time, allowing them to review all the various objects within the game.\n\nIn the two-player mode, a player can choose to play as either the Prince or one of his numerous Cousins.  The screen is [[split screen (computer graphics)|split]] vertically; player one on the left and player two on the right. Players compete simultaneously in a small arena to collect the most objects within three minutes. The playing field is replenished with new objects periodically. Players can ram into each other, knocking items from their opponents' katamaris, and if one player leads by a fair amount, then it is possible to roll up the opponent's katamari.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Keita_Takahashi_-_2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Takahashi in 2005, with a plush version of the Prince from the game]]\n[[Keita Takahashi]] had studied art and entered the [[Musashino Art University]] to study sculpting in 1995.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\">{{cite book | title = Katamari Damacy | first = L.E. | last =Hall | publisher = [[Boss Fight Books]] | date = 2018 | isbn =  978-1-940535-17-3 | chapter = Keita's Mixed Media }}</ref> During his studies, he came to a philosophy that his art needed to combine practical elements along with a bit of whimsy and humor. After graduation, Takahashi no longer had the desire to pursue sculpting as a full-time career, and saw the potential to become involved in video games as a means to continue his art interest in a larger medium.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/> Joining Namco as an artist around 1999, Takahashi worked on a number of smaller projects for the publisher. One of these was called ''Action Drive'', inspired by ''[[Crazy Taxi]]'' but with more spy-based elements atop the driving gameplay. During this, Takahashi came up with the ideas of the characters that would be central to ''Katamari Damacy'': the King, the Queen, and the Prince of all Cosmos. His idea would have been that the queen had been kidnapped by agents on Earth, and the lazy King sends the Prince to rescue her. To do this, the player would use the diminutive Prince's head, shaped like a hammer, to stun humans, after which the Prince would then \"drive\" the humans around by putting a steering wheel on the back of the human's head. Takahashi felt this would lead to interesting and creative gameplay, allowing the player to create havoc as the Prince followed the misguided suggestions from the King, but the project leader rejected the idea. ''Action Drive'' was eventually cancelled.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/>\n\nWhile working on other projects, Takahashi continued to try to think of game ideas, seeking to grow beyond being just an artist for Namco. Takahashi cited two concepts that led to the inspiration of ''Katamari Damacy''. The first was a prototype shown by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] called ''Densen'' (Japanese for \"power line\") that had the player as a young girl traverse floating islands of various homes connected by power lines. The game, though never released, gave Takahashi the idea that the ordinary world could be made interesting with only small changes to perception, and that a game could be fun without the need to cause violence. The second idea was from the game of ''tamakorogashi'' played in Japanese school's ''und\u014dkai'' or [[sports day]]s. In ''tamakorogashi'', students attempt to push a giant ball into a goal.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\">{{cite book | title = Katamari Damacy | first = L.E. | last =Hall | publisher = [[Boss Fight Books]] | date = 2018 | isbn =  978-1-940535-17-3 | chapter = Katamari Takes Shape }}</ref><ref name=\"gamasutra keita\"/> Both those ideas led to him thinking of a game where spinning a ball would roll ordinary stuff into it, making the ball larger and larger over time. The evening he conceived of this idea, he spoke to a friend, one of the game designers in Namco, to see if it made for a good game idea, who agreed it had potential. The next day, he spoke to his former boss, Mitsutoshi Ozaki, about the concept, further adding a way to reuse the King and Prince characters he had previously proposed, who also agreed it would make for a great game.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nHowever, as Takahashi was in Namco's art department and not in game design, there was no easy route for him to propose this idea to Namco's superiors. Ozaki suggested a novel approach for Takahashi through the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory. At the time, Namco had been following in the model that [[Konami]] had used in 1997: Konami established the Konami Computer Entertainment School to help educate new game developers which were eventually hired in Konami, and several of the experimental ideas founded by the School during this time became products within the Konami Games & Music Division (later, [[Bemani]]) that were highly successful, including ''[[Beatmania]]'', ''[[GuitarFreaks]]'', and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/> Namco hoped the Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory would follow a similar path. At the time, [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] was principal of this school, and oversaw one senior thesis class where the students were being trained on 3D modeling towards producing a game prototype with the help of other Namco employees, which could potentially be made into a full game. Ozaki suggested to Takahashi that he could have the students of this class create the 3D objects needed to populate his game world.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/><ref name=\"Ref_2004\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/blog/content/kdpostmort.htm |title=The Singular Design of Katamari Damacy |work=Game Developer Magazine | date=December 2004 |accessdate=2014-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716185305/http://cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/blog/content/kdpostmort.htm |archivedate=2009-07-16}}</ref>\n\nTakahashi took Ozaki's advice, joining the project to help produce the prototype for his game. Alongside about ten students from the Digital Hollywood program, he had been able to gain some visual design artists from Namco to help with the prototype but had difficulty in getting any game development engineers, due to the low priority of the school. He was fortunate to find that some of the engineers from Namco's arcade game division were going to be laid off, and he was able to convince three of them to join his team to retain their jobs within Namco.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nOne initial difficulty faced in developing the prototype was their choice of platform, the [[PlayStation 2]]. At the time the project started, Sony had just announced the specifications for the console, which was built from the ground-up to support 3D graphics via the [[Emotion Engine]], but had not provided any updated [[software development kit]]s, believing that developers would be able to figure out the hardware, but resultantly made the console difficult to develop for at its launch.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> In contrast, [[Nintendo]] had recently announced the [[GameCube]] and that it would provide more developer-friendly features in contrast to the previous [[Nintendo 64]] console. Thus, Takahashi's team decided to develop for the GameCube for their prototype even though the final game was expected to be a PlayStation 2 release.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> In creating the prototype, Takahashi had envisioned that while the ball the player rolled around would grow as they rolled over objects, it would also shrink if they collided with obstacles and lost objects from it. This would have been tied to an interactive music track, which would have started off simple with a small ball and become more complex and full as it got larger. Technically, the team found they could not implement this shrinking mechanic due to memory limitations, and further found that with the interactive music concept, it was not fun to shrink back down and hear the music regress to a simpler form. The shrinking concept as well as the interactive music approach were subsequently dropped.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> The prototype was completed within about six months, in time for the year's [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] for exhibition. Takahashi also presented the game for an internal review, leading Namco to green light the game's full development.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nFull work on ''Katamari Damacy'' began in late 2001. Namco assigned [[Now Production]], based in [[Osaka]], to help bring the game to the PlayStation 2. Takahashi was initially concerned that having to work with an external studio in a different location, but found that the Namco and Now Production teams worked well together. The full team consisted of about twenty members between the two companies, and Namco had allocated a budget of about {{JPY|100 million}} (about {{USD|650,000-800,000}} at the time of production) for the game;<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> this was about the tenth of the cost of budget allocated for Namco's blockbuster titles such as ''[[Ridge Racer (video game)|Ridge Racer]]'' or ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]''.<ref name=\"gamespy iwatani\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/katamari-damashii/504503p1.html|title=Katamari Damashii: The Snowball Effect (PS2)|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|first=Steven|last=Kent|date=2004-04-08|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>  The full game took a year and a half to develop, with eight months of prototyping from the Digital Hollywood version.<ref name=\"gamasutra keita\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/postcard-sheffield.htm|title=Rolling the Dice: The Risks and Rewards of Developing Katamari Damacy|first=Brandon|last=Sheffield|date=2005-03-11 |website=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2008-08-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624031512/http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/postcard-sheffield.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2008-06-24}}</ref>\n\nTakahashi said that the team was aiming for four key points in developing the game: novelty, ease of understanding, enjoyment, and humor.<ref name=\"keita comments\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/595/595110p1.html|title=Keita Takahashi talks Katamari Damacy|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2005-03-10|accessdate=2008-08-13|first=Phil|last=Theobald}}</ref>  Iwatani compared the game to Namco's ''[[Pac-Man]]'', which focused on simplicity and innovation and served as a template for future games from the company.<ref name=\"gamespy iwatani\"/>  At one point during development, Takahashi \"proactively ignored\" advice from Namco to increase the complexity of the game.<ref name=\"keita comments\"/>\n\nThe core gameplay of ''Katamari Damacy'' is the subject of U.S. Patent 7,402,104, \"Game performing method, game apparatus, storage medium, data signal and program\".

The soundtrack was released in Japan as ''[[Music of the Katamari Damacy series#Katamari Damacy|Katamari Fortissimo Damacy]]''. Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music, as well as heavy jazz and samba influences ([[Shibuya-kei]]).  Most of the tracks were composed by [[Yuu Miyake]], and many feature vocals from popular [[J-pop]] singers, such as [[Yui Asaka]] from the ''[[Sukeban Deka 3]]'' TV series, and [[anime]] [[voice actor]]s, including Nobue Matsubara and Ado Mizumori. One track is sung and written by [[Charlie Kosei]], composer of the ''[[Lupin III]]'' soundtrack.\n\n==Release==\nA single-level demonstration of the final version of ''Katamari Damacy'' was exhibited at the 2003 [[Tokyo Game Show]] (TGS). The demo was critically praised by the press, with [[GameSpot]]'s [[Jeff Gerstmann]] describing it as a \"good dose of weird fun\".<ref name=\"Gerstmann2003\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/katamaridamashii/news.html?sid=6075943&mode=all|title=TGS 2003: Katamari Damacy Impressions|website=GameSpot|first=Jeff|last=Gerstmann|date=2003-09-26|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> Sony expressed strong interest in pushing the game's release forward based on the TGS response, offering to handle the game's promotion in exchange.

''Katamari Damacy'' was first shown in the [[United States]] at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop during the March 2004 [[Game Developers Conference]]. A group of Western developers from the [[International Game Developers Association]] had previously brought ''[[Mojib-Ribbon]]'' to the 2003 Experimental Gameplay Workshop after seeing it demonstrated at the 2002 TGS, and had been at the 2003 TGS to look for a similar title to exhibit in 2004. Discovering ''Katamari Damacy'' as an ideal title to exhibit, the group arranged with Namco to have Takahashi come to the United States to present the game. The press reaction to the session was described as \"electric\", but they were disappointed to learn from Takahashi that there were no plans for a Western release.<ref name=\"bfb ch6\"/> Media attention to the game from the Workshop, often called \"Namco's snowball simulator\", led to more pressure on Namco for a Western release. Takahashi was again invited to come present the game at [[E3 2004]].<ref name=\"bfb ch6\"/> Players wanting the game to release in the West also wrote to Namco for a release. By July 2004, Namco officially announced the game's release in North America for September 2004.<ref name=\"Durham2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/07/20/katamari-damacy-official-in-us|title=Katamari Damacy Official in U.S.|website=IGN|first=Jeremy|last=Durham|date=2004-07-19|accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref> The game was never officially released in Europe, though its subsequent sequels would receive European releases.<ref name=\"bfb ch10\">{{cite book | title = Katamari Damacy | first = L.E. | last =Hall | publisher = [[Boss Fight Books]] | date = 2018 | isbn =  978-1-940535-17-3 | chapter = We Sell Katamari }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Japanese language]], {{nihongo|''Katamari''|[[wikt:\u584a|\u584a]]}} means \"clump\" or \"clod\" and ''Damashii'' is the [[rendaku]] form of {{nihongo|''tamashii''|[[wikt:\u9b42|\u9b42]]}} which means \"soul\" or \"spirit\".

Since its release, a number of designers have developed works inspired by ''Katamari'': one example is ''[[The Wonderful End of the World]]''.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Katamari}}\n''Katamari Damacy'' has spawned numerous sequels on the PlayStation 2 and newer game consoles. The game's direct sequel on the PlayStation 2, ''[[We Love Katamari]]'', was released internationally in 2005 and 2006. Its story is [[Self-reference|self-referential]], following on the success of the first game, most of the levels are based on requests from newfound fans of the King and the Prince. Though sharing the same mechanics, ''We Love Katamari'' introduces new gameplay features, such as co-operative play, and new goals, such as collecting the most valuable objects, that would continue through its sequels.\n\nOn July 29, 2012, the game was included in an exhibit at the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]], entitled \"Century of the Child: Growing by Design\". Here, the game was used to demonstrate the change in toys and \"playthings\" over the 20th century, specifically praising the game for its \"quirky manipulations of scale\" that makes it accessible for all ages.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/07/30/katamari-damacy-featured-in-new-york-moma-exhibit.aspx | title = Katamari Damacy Featured In New York MoMA Exhibit | first = Jeff | last = Cork | date = July 30, 2012 | accessdate = 2012-07-31 | work = [[Game Informer]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/centuryofthechild/#/timeline/power-play/katamari-damacy-main-visual | title = Katamari Damacy | publisher = [[New York Museum of Modern Art]] | accessdate = July 31, 2012}}</ref> Vice president of marketing for Namco Bandai Games America, Inc.

It was released in Japan in March 2004, and in North America in September 2004. The game resulted from a school project from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory and was developed for less than {{USD}}1 million. In designing ''Katamari Damacy'', the development team led by [[Keita Takahashi]] aimed to maintain three key points: novelty, ease of understanding, and enjoyment.\n\nThe game's plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild the [[star]]s, [[constellation]]s, and [[Moon]], which were inadvertently destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly [[adhesive]] ball called a ''katamari'' around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains until the ball has grown great enough to become a star. ''Katamari Damacy''{{'s}} story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance of realism, though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production.\n\nOverall, ''Katamari Damacy'' was well received in Japan and North America. The game was dubbed a [[sleeper hit]] and won several awards. The success of the game led to the creation of the ''[[Katamari]]'' franchise, and inspired the development of other video games. A high-definition remaster of the game, ''Katamari Damacy Reroll''{{efn|''Katamari Damacy Encore'' in Japan.}}, was released on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] in December 2018. Some critics have called it one of the [[greatest games of all time]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn a drunken stupor, an eccentric, god-like entity called the King of All Cosmos destroys all the stars, Earth's Moon and other such celestial bodies in the universe, save for Earth itself. Despite acknowledging his mistake, the King charges his 5-centimeter-tall son, the Prince, to go to [[Earth]] with a \"katamari\"\u2014a magical ball that allows anything smaller than it to stick to it and make it grow\u2014and collect enough material for him to recreate the stars and the Moon.  The Prince is successful, and the universe is returned to normal.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nA side-story follows the Hoshino family as the Prince works at his tasks.  The father, an [[astronaut]], is unable to go to the moon after it is wiped out by the King, and the daughter, whose name is Michiru, \"senses\" the Prince's work\u2014she can feel when each constellation returns to the sky.  Ultimately, the family, along with their house and town, are rolled up in the katamari that is used to remake the moon.<ref name=\"gamespot review\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Kata27.jpg|left|thumb|The \"Make A Star\" mode in ''Katamari Damacy'' is the primary mode, where the player must grow the ''katamari'' to a specific size (diameter) in a limited amount of time.]]\nThe player controls the Prince as he rolls the katamari around houses, gardens, and towns in order to meet certain parameters set by the King of All Cosmos.  The player uses the two [[analog stick]]s on the [[DualShock]] controller in a manner similar to the classic [[arcade game]] ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' to control the direction the katamari rolls.  Other controls can be triggered by the player to gain a quick burst of speed, flip the Prince to the other side of the katamari and more.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nObjects that are smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to determine if an object will stick to the katamari.  This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>  Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, and they can be rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked.  In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up to the point where the katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nThe typical mission given by the King of All Cosmos is the \"Make a Star\" mode, where the player needs to grow the katamari to a specific size within a given time frame.

The first item is a ''royal present'' that contains an object that the Prince can wear. Most gifts are non-functional, but one includes a camera that can be used to take in-game screenshots.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>  The other secret item is a cousin of the Prince, which, once rolled up in main gameplay, can be used as a character in the various multiplayer modes. However, cousins can only be found and rolled up after the game is beaten. The game also tracks which objects the player has collected at any time, allowing them to review all the various objects within the game.\n\nIn the two-player mode, a player can choose to play as either the Prince or one of his numerous Cousins.  The screen is [[split screen (computer graphics)|split]] vertically; player one on the left and player two on the right. Players compete simultaneously in a small arena to collect the most objects within three minutes. The playing field is replenished with new objects periodically. Players can ram into each other, knocking items from their opponents' katamaris, and if one player leads by a fair amount, then it is possible to roll up the opponent's katamari.<ref name=\"1up review\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Keita_Takahashi_-_2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Takahashi in 2005, with a plush version of the Prince from the game]]\n[[Keita Takahashi]] had studied art and entered the [[Musashino Art University]] to study sculpting in 1995.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\">{{cite book | title = Katamari Damacy | first = L.E. | last =Hall | publisher = [[Boss Fight Books]] | date = 2018 | isbn =  978-1-940535-17-3 | chapter = Keita's Mixed Media }}</ref> During his studies, he came to a philosophy that his art needed to combine practical elements along with a bit of whimsy and humor. After graduation, Takahashi no longer had the desire to pursue sculpting as a full-time career, and saw the potential to become involved in video games as a means to continue his art interest in a larger medium.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/> Joining Namco as an artist around 1999, Takahashi worked on a number of smaller projects for the publisher. One of these was called ''Action Drive'', inspired by ''[[Crazy Taxi]]'' but with more spy-based elements atop the driving gameplay. During this, Takahashi came up with the ideas of the characters that would be central to ''Katamari Damacy'': the King, the Queen, and the Prince of all Cosmos. His idea would have been that the queen had been kidnapped by agents on Earth, and the lazy King sends the Prince to rescue her. To do this, the player would use the diminutive Prince's head, shaped like a hammer, to stun humans, after which the Prince would then \"drive\" the humans around by putting a steering wheel on the back of the human's head. Takahashi felt this would lead to interesting and creative gameplay, allowing the player to create havoc as the Prince followed the misguided suggestions from the King, but the project leader rejected the idea. ''Action Drive'' was eventually cancelled.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/>\n\nWhile working on other projects, Takahashi continued to try to think of game ideas, seeking to grow beyond being just an artist for Namco. Takahashi cited two concepts that led to the inspiration of ''Katamari Damacy''. The first was a prototype shown by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] called ''Densen'' (Japanese for \"power line\") that had the player as a young girl traverse floating islands of various homes connected by power lines. The game, though never released, gave Takahashi that the ordinary world could be made interesting with only small changes to perception, and that a game could be fun without the need to cause violence. The second idea was from the game of ''tamakorogashi'' played in Japanese school's ''und\u014dkai'' or [[sports day]]s. In ''tamakorogashi'', students attempt to push a giant ball into a goal.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\">{{cite book | title = Katamari Damacy | first = L.E. | last =Hall | publisher = [[Boss Fight Books]] | date = 2018 | isbn =  978-1-940535-17-3 | chapter = Katamari Takes Shape }}</ref><ref name=\"gamasutra keita\"/> Both those ideas led to him thinking of a game where spinning a ball would roll ordinary stuff into it, making the ball larger and larger over time. The evening he conceived of this idea, he spoke to a friend, one of the game designers in Namco, to see if it made for a good game idea, who agreed it had potential. The next day, he spoke to his former boss, Mitsutoshi Ozaki, about the concept, further adding a way to reuse the King and Prince characters he had previously proposed, who also agreed it would make for a great game.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nHowever, as Takahashi was in Namco's art department and not in game design, there was no easy route for him to propose this idea to Namco's superiors. Ozaki suggested a novel approach for Takahashi through the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory. At the time, Namco had been following in the model that [[Konami]] had used in 1997: Konami established the Konami Computer Entertainment School to help educate new game developers which were eventually hired in Konami, and several of the experimental ideas founded by the School during this time became products within the Konami Games & Music Division (later, [[Bemani]]) that were highly successful, including ''[[Beatmania]]'', ''[[GuitarFreaks]]'', and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''.<ref name=\"bfb ch3\"/> Namco hoped the Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory would follow a similar path. At the time, [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] was principal of this school, and oversaw one senior thesis class where the students were being trained on 3D modeling towards producing a game prototype with the help of other Namco employees, which could potentially be made into a full game. Ozaki suggested to Takahashi that he could have the students of this class create the 3D objects needed to populate his game world.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/><ref name=\"Ref_2004\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/blog/content/kdpostmort.htm |title=The Singular Design of Katamari Damacy |work=Game Developer Magazine | date=December 2004 |accessdate=2014-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716185305/http://cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/blog/content/kdpostmort.htm |archivedate=2009-07-16}}</ref>\n\nTakahashi took Ozaki's advice, joining the project to help produce the prototype for his game. Alongside about ten students from the Digital Hollywood program, he had been able to gain some visual design artists from Namco to help with the prototype but had difficulty in getting any game development engineers, due to the low priority of the school. He was fortunate to find that some of the engineers from Namco's arcade game division were going to be laid off, and he was able to convince three of them to join his team to retain their jobs within Namco.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nOne initial difficulty faced in developing the prototype was their choice of platform, the [[PlayStation 2]]. At the time the project started, Sony had just announced the specifications for the console, which was built from the ground-up to support 3D graphics via the [[Emotion Engine]], but had not provided any updated [[software development kit]]s, believing that developers would be able to figure out the hardware, but resultantly made the console difficult to develop for at its launch.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> In contrast, [[Nintendo]] had recently announced the [[GameCube]] and that it would provide more developer-friendly features in contrast to it previous [[Nintendo 64]] console. Thus, Takahashi's team decided to develop for the GameCube for their prototype even though the final game was expected to be a PlayStation 2 release.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> In creating the prototype, Takahashi had envisioned that while the ball the player rolled around would grow as they rolled over objects, it would also shrink if they collided with obstacles and lost objects from it. This would have been tied to an interactive music track, which would have started off simple with a small ball and become more complex and full as it got larger. Technically, the team found they could not implement this shrinking mechanic due to memory limitations, and further found that with the interactive music concept, it was not fun to shrink back down and hear the music regress to a simpler form. The shrinking concept as well as the interactive music approach were subsequently dropped.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> The prototype was completed within about six months, in time for the year's [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] for exhibition. Takahashi also presented the game for an internal review, leading Namco to green light the game's full development.<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/>\n\nFull work on ''Katamari Damacy'' began in late 2001. Namco assigned [[Now Production]], based in [[Osaka]], to help bring the game to the PlayStation 2. Takahashi was initially concerned that having to work with an external studio in a different location, but found that the Namco and Now Production teams worked well together. The full team consisted of about twenty members between the two companies, and Namco had allocated a budget of about {{JPY|100 million}} (about {{USD|650,000-800,000}} at the time of production) for the game;<ref name=\"bfb ch4\"/> this was about the tenth of the cost of budget allocated for Namco's blockbuster titles such as ''[[Ridge Racer (video game)|Ridge Racer]]'' or ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]''.<ref name=\"gamespy iwatani\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/katamari-damashii/504503p1.html|title=Katamari Damashii: The Snowball Effect (PS2)|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|first=Steven|last=Kent|date=2004-04-08|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>  The full game took a year and a half to develop, with eight months of prototyping from the Digital Hollywood version.<ref name=\"gamasutra keita\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/postcard-sheffield.htm|title=Rolling the Dice: The Risks and Rewards of Developing Katamari Damacy|first=Brandon|last=Sheffield|date=2005-03-11 |website=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2008-08-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624031512/http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/postcard-sheffield.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2008-06-24}}</ref>\n\nTakahashi said that the team was aiming for four key points in developing the game: novelty, ease of understanding, enjoyment, and humor.<ref name=\"keita comments\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/595/595110p1.html|title=Keita Takahashi talks Katamari Damacy|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2005-03-10|accessdate=2008-08-13|first=Phil|last=Theobald}}</ref>  Iwatani compared the game to Namco's ''[[Pac-Man]]'', which focused on simplicity and innovation and served as a template for future games from the company.<ref name=\"gamespy iwatani\"/>  At one point during development, Takahashi \"proactively ignored\" advice from Namco to increase the complexity of the game.<ref name=\"keita comments\"/>\n\nThe core gameplay of ''Katamari Damacy'' is the subject of U.S. Patent 7,402,104, \"Game performing method, game apparatus, storage medium, data signal and program\".

The soundtrack was released in Japan as ''[[Music of the Katamari Damacy series#Katamari Damacy|Katamari Fortissimo Damacy]]''. Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music, as well as heavy jazz and samba influences ([[Shibuya-kei]]).

One track is sung and written by [[Charlie Kosei]], composer of the ''[[Lupin III]]'' soundtrack.\n\n==Release==\nA single-level demonstration of the final version of ''Katamari Damacy'' was exhibited at the 2003 [[Tokyo Game Show]] (TGS).

''Katamari Damacy'' was first shown in the [[United States]] at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop during the March 2004 [[Game Developers Conference]]. A group of Western developers from the [[International Game Developers Association]] had previously brought ''[[Mojib-Ribbon]]'' to the 2003 Experimental Gameplay Workshop after seeing it demonstrated at the 2002 TGS, and had been at the 2003 TGS to look for a similar title to exhibit in 2004. Discovering ''Katamari Damacy'' as an ideal title to exhibit, the group arranged with Namco to have Takahashi come to the United States to present the game. The press reaction to the session was described as \"electric\", but were disappointed to learn from Takahashi that there were no plans for a Western release.<ref name=\"bfb ch6\"/> Media attention to the game from the Workshop, often called \"Namco's snowball simulator\", led to more pressure on Namco for a Western release. Takahashi was again invited to come present the game at [[E3 2004]].<ref name=\"bfb ch6\"/> Players wanting the game to release in the West also wrote to Namco for a release.

However, others, such as ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' reviewer Mark McDonald (who gave the game 8.5 out of ten with his EGM staff), argue that the game's limitations are made up for by its strengths: \"Sure, you're basically doing the same thing each mission, but Katamari's elegant controls, killer soundtrack, and wicked humor make it perfectly suited for replay.\"<ref name=EGM>{{cite journal|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/katamari-damacy_3|title=Katamari Damacy|first=Mark|last=McDonald|issue=185|date=November 2004|page=140|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|accessdate=2006-05-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509034310/http://www.1up.com/reviews/katamari-damacy_3|archivedate=2013-05-09}}</ref> As a well-executed, non-traditional game, ''Katamari Damacy'' has been influential in the game development community. Since its release, a number of designers have developed works inspired by ''Katamari'': one example is ''[[The Wonderful End of the World]]''.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Katamari}}\n''Katamari Damacy'' has spawned numerous sequels on the PlayStation 2 and newer game consoles. The game's direct sequel on the PlayStation 2, ''[[We Love Katamari]]'', was released internationally in 2005 and 2006. Its story is [[Self-reference|self-referential]], following on the success of the first game, most of the levels are based on requests from newfound fans of the King and the Prince. Though sharing the same mechanics, ''We Love Katamari'' introduces new gameplay features, such as co-operative play, and new goals, such as collecting the most valuable objects, that would continue through its sequels.\n\nOn July 29, 2012, the game was included in an exhibit at the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]], entitled \"Century of the Child: Growing by Design\". Here, the game was used to demonstrate the change in toys and \"playthings\" over the 20th century, specifically praising the game for its \"quirky manipulations of scale\" that makes it accessible for all ages.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/07/30/katamari-damacy-featured-in-new-york-moma-exhibit.aspx | title = Katamari Damacy Featured In New York MoMA Exhibit | first = Jeff | last = Cork | date = July 30, 2012 | accessdate = 2012-07-31 | work = [[Game Informer]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/centuryofthechild/#/timeline/power-play/katamari-damacy-main-visual | title = Katamari Damacy | publisher = [[New York Museum of Modern Art]] | accessdate = July 31, 2012}}</ref> Vice president of marketing for Namco Bandai Games America, Inc.

Tours with [[Dead Meadow]] (Kirpatrick Thomas filled in for an ailing Jason Simons on guitar during one tour), [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]], and [[The Dandy Warhols]] followed until November 2009 when the band suffered a major lineup change due to tour burnout and financial difficulties.\n\nIt was around this time that Spindrift began performing electro-acoustic shows with a more intimate, stripped down campfire atmosphere under the name of \"Bluniform\" and \"Boy Scout Jamboree\" with Koenig and Thomas taking the lead harmonies and performing tunes written by the likes of the \"singing cowboys\" such as [[Johnny Western]], [[Johnny Bond]], [[Tex Ritter]], [[The Louvin Brothers]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[The Sons of the Pioneers]],  and [[Rex Allen]].

In 2009, Tee Pee Records re-released the soundtrack and the band toured the United States, opening for The Dandy Warhols who under their Beat The World record label released the Spindrift album \"The West\" Nov. 2008.\n\nSpindrift has also contributed to the VBS.tv VICE documentary series ''[[Coffin Joe]]'', and the songs \"Ace Coletrain\" and \"Girlz, Booze, Gunz\" were featured in the HBO Comedy series Eastbound & Down.\"  The band has also scored a restored version of \"Tecumseh's Curse\", a film about the [[Curse of Tippecanoe]] by director [[J.X. Williams]].\n\nIn 2010, Spindrift went on to supply the score to Mike Bruce's next feature \"Treasure of the Black Jaguar\", an action survival story loosely based on [[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)]].\n\nSpindrift has cited the Sergio Leone film [[Once Upon a Time in the West]] and Sam Peckinpah's \"The Wild Bunch\" as cinematic influences on the band's music and overall style.\n\nIn 2011, Spindrift supported the soundtrack of the award-winning skiing documentary film [[All.I.Can]] by Sherpa Cinema with three songs.\n\nThe film, ''Dust Up'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1991034/|title=Dust Up|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2013-07-26}}</ref> starring [[Amber Benson]] also contained a Spindrift score and was released Oct. 2012.\n\nIn Jan 2016, the band contributed to the score and soundtrack of the film \"Diablo\" which was Directed by Lawrence Roeck and starred Scott Eastwood, Danny Glover, and Walton Goggings. As well, early that year, Cherry Red Records released the 5 disc box set title \"Still In A Dream: A History of Shoegaze 1988-1995 which featured Spindrift's first B-Side Single (originally recorded in 1992 and released by Neck Records) called \"Surround Sound\".\n\n==''Classic Soundtracks''==\nIn Spring of 2011, Spindrift released ''Classic Soundtracks Volume 1'' on Xemu Records. The album featured 14 theme songs to various film scores they are set to and up to 8 different directors participated in the project. The film clips, music videos, and movie trailers were all premiered on [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] and featured films by [[Burke Roberts]], [[J. X. Williams]], [[Abigail Bean]], [[Simon Chan (director)|Simon Chan]], and many others. The music crossed genres such as [[Bollywood songs]], Science fiction, Exploitation films, and [[Film noir]]. The album was engineered by Ethan Allen (of [[Gram Rabbit]]) and mastered by [[Howie Weinberg]]. The band went on to tour Europe in the Spring of 2011 for 2 months supporting Black Mountain, Dead Meadow, and [[Kurt Vile]] and did a full U.S. and Canadian tour in the Fall with The Black Angels and Dead Meadow totaling over 100 live shows throughout the year.\n\n==''Spindrift - Ghost of the West'' and the Ghost Town Tour==\nIn 2012, production for the album ''Spindrift - Ghost of the West''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2580492/|title=Ghost of the West|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2013-07-26}}</ref> began. The songs consisted of variations on early golden era [[singing cowboy]] tunes and originals. New styles and instrumentation were brought in such as Henry Evans playing acoustic upright bass, more trumpet, and the ever more present vocal harmonies. During the mixing with engineer Riley Bray, Kirpatrick brought forth the idea that the band should tour [[ghost town]]s, perform the songs, and document the journey. Booking, filming, and performing during the tour was a difficult process as many of the destinations were unreachable and roads and conditions were hazardous. However, the tour brought them to over twenty-one different ghost towns, including [[Bodie, California]], [[Tombstone, Arizona]], and [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], and it was all tracked and filmed. Many landmarks and monuments were also reached, such as [[Cathedral Gorge State Park]] and the [[Sonoran Desert]]. The soundtrack album was released October 22, 2013, on [[Tee Pee Records]] and the feature film companion, directed by [[Burke Roberts]], is set to follow in 2014. Directly following the Ghost Town Tour of October 2012, keyboardist-vocalist [[Michelle Vidal]] replaced Sasha Vallely due to her inability to tour from a recent back surgery. In 2013, the band toured the US with Joshua Tree desert pals [[Gram Rabbit]], toured Europe in the spring, and once again headlined a tour around the United States in the fall in promotion of the soundtrack which included supporting the punk band [[X (American band)|X]] in front of a crowd of 7,500 at Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles, California. Guitarist Thomas Bellier from Paris, France, joined the band officially in January 2014 after guesting on guitar during several tours and independent gigs. Bellier also fronts the heavy surf-middle eastern influenced band [[Blaak Heat (band)|Blaak Heat]] and is label-mates on Tee Pee Records. Spindrift performed and screened ''Spindrift - Ghost of the West'' at [[Slamdance Film Festival]] in Park City, Utah, in January 2014.\n\nIn 2015, even while the lineup lost longtime bass player Henry Evans, the band continued to tour and work on new recordings and soundtrack productions with older members including bass player Joe Baluta and drummer Daniel Allare rejoining the ranks. The band's Engineer, Riley Bray, briefly filled in for Mr. Evans taking over his famed signature custom made Danelectro double neck bass and baritone guitar. After Riley's second rehearsal, the double neck was stolen and a search went out to find the unique instrument. Remarkably, due to some detective work done by Riley and one specific fans relentless internet search, the instrument was recovered in a \"set up and recover\" operation which local authorities helped to set up the sting operation. Highlights from 2015 were performances at Austin's \"Levitation\" Psychedelic Rock Festival and \"Desert Stars\" festival in Yucca Valley, CA. One new member, the young, talented guitarist Becca Davidson also joined the band that year.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{External links|date=July 2013}}\n* [http://www.spindriftwest.com/ Official Website]\n* [http://larecord.com/issues/2007/07/05/vol-2-no-22-spindrift-and-langhorne-slim/ Cover Photo from The LA Record]\n* [http://larecord.com/interviews/2007/07/05/spindrift-just-once-in-the-nuts/ July 2007 Interview] with [[L.A.

In 2013, the band toured the US with Joshua Tree desert pals [[Gram Rabbit]], toured Europe in the spring, and once again headlined a tour around the United States in the fall in promotion of the soundtrack which included supporting the punk band [[X]] in front of a crowd of 7,500 at Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles, California. Guitarist Thomas Bellier from Paris, France, joined the band officially in January 2014 after guesting on guitar during several tours and independent gigs. Bellier also fronts the heavy surf-middle eastern influenced band [[Blaak Heat (band)|Blaak Heat]] and is label-mates on Tee Pee Records. Spindrift performed and screened ''Spindrift - Ghost of the West'' at [[Slamdance Film Festival]] in Park City, Utah, in January 2014.\n\nIn 2015, even while the lineup lost longtime bass player Henry Evans, the band continued to tour and work on new recordings and soundtrack productions with older members including bass player Joe Baluta and drummer Daniel Allare rejoining the ranks. The band's Engineer, Riley Bray, briefly filled in for Mr. Evans taking over his famed signature custom made Danelectro double neck bass and baritone guitar. After Riley's second rehearsal, the double neck was stolen and a search went out to find the unique instrument. Remarkably, due to some detective work done by Riley and one specific fans relentless internet search, the instrument was recovered in a \"set up and recover\" operation which local authorities helped to set up the sting operation. Highlights from 2015 were performances at Austin's \"Levitation\" Psychedelic Rock Festival and \"Desert Stars\" festival in Yucca Valley, CA. One new member, the young, talented guitarist Becca Davidson also joined the band that year.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{External links|date=July 2013}}\n* [http://www.spindriftwest.com/ Official Website]\n* [http://larecord.com/issues/2007/07/05/vol-2-no-22-spindrift-and-langhorne-slim/ Cover Photo from The LA Record]\n* [http://larecord.com/interviews/2007/07/05/spindrift-just-once-in-the-nuts/ July 2007 Interview] with [[L.A.

The region includes the provinces of [[Mersin Province|Mersin]], [[Adana Province|Adana]], [[Osmaniye Province|Osmaniye]] and [[Hatay Province|Hatay]]. Adding the large population centers surrounding Cilicia, more than 10 million people reside within 2-hours drive from the Adana city center.\n\nThroughout the history, Adana were a market town at the Cilicia plain and one of the gateways from Europe to the Middle East, as it provided the only access on the wide Seyhan river. The city turned into a power house of Cilicia with the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkic]] takeover in 1359. The city remained as the capital of the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] until 1608, and then the regional administrative center for the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turkey]], and shortly for the [[Cilicia#French Cilicia|French Cilicia]]. Economically a modest town until 1861 with a population of roughly 15000, the city boomed with the breakdown of the [[American Civil War]], as becoming a new center for supplying cotton and cotton related products to Europe. Traditionally a town populated by Armenians and Turks; influx of [[Armenians]], Turks, [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Alawites]] at this period, made the city one of the most diverse cities of [[Anatolia]]. Economic, social and cultural growth were halted by the [[Adana massacre]], the [[Armenian Genocide]] and the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]],<ref name=\"HrantAdana\">{{cite web|url=https://hrantdink.org/attachments/article/1398/Adana_Raporu_new.pdf|title=Ermeni K\u00fclt\u00fcr Varl\u0131klar\u0131yla Adana|publisher=HDV Yay\u0131nlar\u0131|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref> all devastated the city in the early 20th century. After the eviction of Armenians and Greeks, most of the city's private properties were confiscated in 1923 and were granted to the Muslim/Turks who recently had migrated into the city. After a standstill period, city's economy again boomed in 1950s with the construction of the [[Seyhan Dam]], and the growth continued until 1980s.\n\nAdana in the 21st century, are a center for regional trade, healthcare, public and private services. Agriculture and logistics are significant sectors of the city. Economic decline caused by national policies and de-industrialization since 1990s is reversing, as the city is gaining momentum with the fairs, festivals and entertainment life. Though not competing at the top level, the rivalry between the city's football clubs, [[Adanaspor]] and [[Adana Demirspor]], is getting national attraction as being the [[Adana football derby|only citywide derby]] of [[Turkey]] that is rooted in socio-economic divisions.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Adana1.jpg|thumb|Eskibaraj Dam Lake on [[Seyhan River]].]]\n\nAdana is located at the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, where it serves as the gateway to the Cilicia plain. This large stretch of flat, fertile land lies southeast of the [[Taurus Mountains]].\n\nFrom Adana, crossing the Cilicia westwards, the road from Tarsus enters the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. It goes through the famous [[Cilician Gates]], the rocky pass through which armies have coursed since the dawn of history, and continues to the Anatolian plain.\n\nThe north of the city is surrounded by the Seyhan reservoir. The Seyhan Dam, completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power and to irrigate the lower \u00c7ukurova plain. Two irrigation channels in the city flow to the plain, passing through the city center from east to west. There is another canal for irrigating the Y\u00fcre\u011fir plain to the southeast of the city.\n\nThe [[37th parallel north]] passes through the city.\n\n===Climate===\nAdana has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under both the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] classification, and a dry-hot summer subtropical climate (Csa) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification. Winters are mild and wet. Summers are long, hot, humid and dry. The highest recorded temperature was on 8 July 1978 at {{convert|45.6|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}.

It is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia. A place called ''Adana'' is mentioned by name in a [[Sumer]]ian epic, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], but the geography of this work is too imprecise to identify its location.\n\n===Ancient times===\nFirst known people living in Adana and area were the [[Luwians]]. They controlled the Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia roughly from 3000BC to around 1600BC. [[Hittites]] took over the region which came to be known as [[Kizzuwatna]]. Inhabited by Luwians and [[Hurrians]], Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under the Hittites protection, but they had a brief independent period from 1500s to 1420s. According to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] inscription of [[Kava]], found in [[Hattusa]] ([[Bo\u011fazkale]]), [[Kizzuwatna]] was the kingdom that ruled Adana, under the protection of the Hittites by 1335 BC. At that time, the name of the city was ''Uru Adaniyya'', and the inhabitants were called [[Denyen|Danuna]]. Beginning with the collapse of the [[Hittite Empire]] c. 1191\u20131189 BC, relatively unknown [[Sea Peoples]] took control of the plain until around 900BC. Then after, [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite States]] founded in the region and Adana was the center of [[Quw\u00ea]] state. Quw\u00ea and other states were protected by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], though they had independent periods. After the Greek migration to Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]<ref name=\"Fox-211ff\">Fox, Robin Lane (2009) ''Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer'' Alfred A. Knopf, , New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9k8Frkhiq_MC&pg=PA211 pages 211-224], {{ISBN|978-0-679-44431-2}}</ref> and Adana was established as the capital. Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries founded in [[Mopsuestia]] were written both in Indo-European [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and West Semitic [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. Assyrians took the control of the regions several times until their collapse in 612BC. The region appeared in Assyrian inscriptions as ''Hilikku'', in which the Cilicia name derived from. Cilicians founded the [[Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)|Kingdom of Cilicia]] by the efforts of [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]]. The kingdom were independent until the invasion of [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 549, then after became an autonomous [[satrapy]] of Achaemenids and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]]. After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s death, for a time, Adana fell under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic dominion]], but finally came to the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Seleucids ruled Adana until the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] made Cilicia their vassal state in 83BC.\n\n===Roman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era===\n[[Pompey]] took over entire Cilicia and organized it as a [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]'s influential period, while nearby Tarsus was the [[metropolis]] of the area. During the era of [[Pompey]], the city was used as a prison for the pirates of Cilicia. The [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] on a Roman military road leading to the East. After the permanent split of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, the area became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and was probably developed during the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantation, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important trade centers of the region. \n\nAdana was a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]], but before its listing in a 10th-century ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as an archdiocese.The Bishop Paulinus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Piso was among the [[Arianism]]-inclined bishops at the [[Council of Sardica]] (344) who withdrew and set up their own council at Philippopolis; he later returned to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodoxy]] and signed the profession of [[Nicene Creed|Nicene faith]] at a synod in Antioch in 363. Cyriacus was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Anatolius is mentioned in a letter of Saint [[John Chrysostom]]. Cyrillus was at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 and at a synod in Tarsus in 434. Philippus took part in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451<ref>{{cite book|author1=Richard Price|author2=Michael Gaddis|title=The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&pg=RA2-PA157|volume=Volume 1|year=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-039-7|page=122}}</ref> and was a signatory of the joint letter of the bishops of [[Cilicia Prima]] to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] in 458 protesting at the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]].

In 746, profiting by the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] took control of Adana in 746. [[Abbasid Caliphate]] took over the rule of the region from Byzantine after [[Al-Mansur]]'s inauguration to caliph in 756. With the Abbasid rule, Muslims for the first time started settling in Cilicia. Abandoned for more than 50 years, Adana was garrisoned and re-built from 758 to 760. To form a [[Al-Awasim|Thugh\u016br]] on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonized with the Turkic Say\u0101bija tribe from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. The city had seen rapid economic and cultural growth during the reign of [[Harun al-Rashid]] and [[Al-Amin]].

The city became part of the [[Seleucia (theme)|Seleucia theme]]. After the defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] was removed from reign by a coup. He then gathered a troop to regain his power, though got defeated and had to retreat his troop to Adana. He was forced to surrender by the Garrison in Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety. [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], the founder of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] annexed Adana, in his campaign in 1084. The city remained under Turkish rule until it was captured by the forces of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality of Cilicia]] in 1132, under its king, [[Leo I of Armenia|Leo I]]. It was taken by [[Byzantine]] forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it around 1170. In 1268, a [[1268 Cilicia earthquake|devastating earthquake]] destroyed much of the city, and Adana was rebuilt from ruins. 80 years later in 1348, [[Black Death]] reached the city and caused severe depopulation. Adana remained part of the weakened Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia until 1359, when the city was ceded to the T\u00fcrkmen supported [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] who marched into Cilicia and captured the plain. Most Armenians of the city fled to [[Cyprus]] after the ceding.\n\n===Turkish era=== \n[[File:Adana Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] forces entering the city.

The [[Amir]], Ramazan Beg, designated Adana as the capital, and led the Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks to settle in the city. The emirate which later on known as the [[Ramadanid Emirate]], were ''de facto'' independent throughout the 15th century, by being a [[Al-Awasim#Mamluk\u2013Turkmen frontier|Thugh\u016br]] in the Ottoman-Mamluk relations. In 1517, Selim I incorporated the beylik into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The beys of Ramadanids held the administration of the new Ottoman sanjak of Adana in a hereditary manner until 1608.\n[[File:Adana from the river in 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|River mansions]]\n[[File:Adana Armenian Quarter.jpg|thumb|Armenian Quarter in the late 19th century]]\n[[File:The City of Adana.svg|thumb|left|Adana in 1909]]\n[[File:Survivors_of_the_Adana_Massacre.jpg|thumb|left|Survivors of the [[Adana massacre]] at the ruins of their houses]]\n[[File:Adana Armenian Protestant Church.jpg|thumb|right|Protestant Church founded by American missioanaries (demolished in 1970s)]]\n[[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] ended the Ramadanid administration of Adana sanjak in 1608, and ruled it directly from Constantinople then after.

The Governor ({{lang-tr|Vali}}) was against the deportations, and with the support of [[Djemal Pasha]], could manage to delay the deportations and let the Armenians to sell their movable assets to acquire money for the trip. First convoy of deportees consisting of more than 4000 Armenians left the city on May 20th. The [[Holy See of Cilicia|catholicos of Cilicia]], Sahag Khabayan wrote a letter to Djemal Pasha to prevent further deportations and the chief secretary Kerovpe Papazian met the pasha in [[Lebanon]] in early June and delivered the message of Catholicos. Djemal Pasha immediately sent a telegraph to the Vali to not to deport any more Armenians. With his efforts, Adana Armenians earned an exemption at a summer, when the rest of Cilician Armenians were being deported and hundreds of thousands of Armenian deportees of Western Anatolia were passing through the city. City locals, missionaries and the catholicos helped the exhausted deportees in transit to regain their equilibrium by providing food and shelter. Minister of Internal Affairs, [[Talaat Pasha]], wanted to end the exemption of Adana Armenians and sent his second in command in the Ministry, Ali Munif, to the city in mid-August to resume the deportations. Ali Munif immediately deported 250 families from Adana who were accused of insurrection. Public hangings also began. Before the deportations of the rest, Vali could again manage the deportees to sell their assets. As almost a third of the city residents were selling their goods, the city seemed like a site for massive clearance sale. Deportations of 5000 Armenian families in eight convoys started on 2 September 1915 and continued until the end of October. 1000 craftsmen, state officers and the army personnel were exempted from deportations with their families. Unlike the deportees of other Vilayets, a good portion of Adana Armenians were sent to [[Damascus]] and further south, thus were avoided from the [[Deir ez-Zor Camps|death camps of Aleppo]] by the personal request of Djemal Pasha, then [[Syria Vilayet|Vali of Syria]].<ref name=\"Kevorkian2\">{{cite book| last=Kevorkian| first=Raymond| title=The Armenian Genocide: Complete History |location= London| publisher=I.B.Taurus & Co.Ltd. | year=2011| isbn=978-1848855618}}</ref> The death rate of the roughly 25000 Adana Armenians that were deported through out 1915, were a lot less than the deportees from other places due to three main facts; no reports of direct killings in and around the city, being partially deported safely to Damascus area and having money with them to manage their lives on the way and after arriving to their designated locations.

Factories were shut down and the economy almost came to a standstill in 1915, after the genocide of Armenians who ran most of the businesses in the city. Foundation of the republic, again accelerated the growth of industrialization by re-activation of closed plants and opening of state-owned ones. With the construction of [[Seyhan Dam]] and improvements in agricultural techniques, there was an explosive growth in agricultural production during the 1950s.

The first Turks moved to the city from Central Asia around the 11th century.

The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighborhoods being built. Most of the historical landmarks of Adana were built during this period, thus [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] and [[Seljuqid]] architecture are dominant in Adana's architectural history. [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, and few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule. Adana is home to modern Turkey's historic Armenian architecture, which can be found behind the city's central modern buildings.\n\nThe first traces of settlement in the quarter of [[Tepeba\u011f]], can be traced to the [[neolithic age]]. The quarter is next to the Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc stone bridge, situated on a hill which gave its name Tepeba\u011f (Garden on the hill). The city administration has launched a campaign to preserve the heritage of this area, particularly the Ottoman houses. Atat\u00fcrk stayed in one of these houses on Seyhan Caddesi which now houses the [[Atat\u00fcrk Museum (Adana)|Atat\u00fcrk Museum]].\n\nSeveral bridges cross the Seyhan river within the city, the most notable among them is the [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]], a 2nd-century [[Roman bridge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adanakultur.gov.tr/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFB0ED0AA5232E402F59FCBAD67E463149| title = Adana Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Stone Bridge)| author=| publisher=Governship of Adana Tourism and Culture Department| accessdate=}}</ref> Currently used by pedestrians and cyclists, it was the oldest bridge in the world to be open to motorized vehicles until 2007.

In the 1960s, rapid industrialization brought more men to pavyons not only from the city, but from a wide region including Istanbul and Ankara, thus Adana was named ''Pavyon Capital of Turkey''. Many popular singers took the stage at and owe their fame to the pavyons of Adana.\n\nPavyons led the way to Western-style pubs and night clubs by the late 1980s with the socio-economic changes in Adana. The traditional entertainment district is Sular, near Central Station, but the pubs and clubs nowadays are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs such as Life Legend, Uptown, Casara and Lava host world star singers at their elegant locations, mostly along the river and the lake. There are still two active pavyons, Afrodit and Maksim, but adult entertainment is directed mostly to what is known locally as tele-bars. Tele-bars are licensed as regular pubs, but function as places where bargirls entertain customers and usually hook with them afterwards.

''Yeni Adana'' is the oldest newspaper and dates back to 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yeniadana.net/web/hakkimizda.aspx?pgid%3D11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=30 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523010238/http://www.yeniadana.net/WEB/hakkimizda.aspx?pgid=11 |archivedate=23 May 2009}}</ref> The newspaper played a significant role in the independence movement after the First World War. Most newspapers in Adana serve not only the city but the \u00c7ukurova region. Many national newspapers have their regional publishing centers in Adana. [[H\u00fcrriyet]] publishes a supplement paper, ''H\u00fcrriyet \u00c7ukurova'', the most popular regional newspaper, that has circulation of 48,000. [[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]]'s regional supplement paper, ''G\u00fcney'', is also published in Adana.\n\nKanal A is the longest serving TV broadcaster in Adana, \u00c7ukurova TV, Akdeniz TV, Koza TV and Kent TV are the other major broadcasters. There are numerous local radio channels and [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]]'s \u00c7ukurova Radio can be listened to in the city.\n\n===Shopping===\n\n\u00c7akmak Street is the traditional shopping street that is located in the old town. Several attempts by the city to designate it as a pedestrianised street was unsuccessful because traffic flow could not be diverted to another street. There are several historical bazaars around B\u00fcy\u00fck Saat and Ya\u011f Camii. Covered markets around Saydam street, Kilis and M\u0131s\u0131r bazaars, were once a haven for shopping for quality foreign goods.\n\nZiyapa\u015fa Boulevard is the street of elegance where expensive brands are located. The street runs from D-400 state road to the Central Train Station and the shops are concentrated towards the north end. The streets around Ziyapa\u015fa and the streets of northern Adana, \u00d6zal, Demirel and Evren boulevards also have high-end shops.\n\nThere are four modern shopping malls in the city. Galleria was the first to be built in the early 1990s but did not become popular due to administrative issues. M1 and Carrefour malls were built during the late 1990s at the west end of the city. Recently opened Optimum Outlet is the first mall east of the river and is also the closest to the city center. The mall has a view of the river and the Merkez Park.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:\u0130stiklal High School (Former Greek Mansion).JPG|thumb|left|\u0130stiklal High School (A former Greek mansion)]]\n[[File:Adana American High School for Girls2.JPG|thumb|former [[Adana American College for Girls]]]]\n\nPublic, private and not-for-profit foundation institutions are located in Adana.

Compact urban form due to dominance of high-rise buildings that are closely built, especially in Seyhan and \u00c7ukurova districts, make cycling from any end of the city to the city center to take less than 40 minutes. Despite all the advantages, car-oriented urban planning since the 1950s caused cycling to take a minor part in commuting to work or school. There are no bike lanes, but there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpa\u015fa Boulevard\u2014the latter not used by cyclists at all.

The rise in car ownership not only caused high traffic, but also led to drivers parking their cars on the sidewalks. The city currently has no car-free squares or streets other than a few narrow ones. There are plans to convert both ends of Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc to squares and widen the sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk at the peddler-invaded narrow sidewalks. By far the most [[Walkability|pedestrian friendly]] street of the city is Turgut \u00d6zal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in \u00c7ukurova district are also very convenient for

The region includes the provinces of [[Mersin Province|Mersin]], [[Adana Province|Adana]], [[Osmaniye Province|Osmaniye]] and [[Hatay Province|Hatay]]. Adding the large population centers surrounding Cilicia, more than 10 million people reside within 2-hours drive from the Adana city center.\n\nThroughout the history, Adana were a market town at the Cilicia plain and one of the gateways from Europe to the Middle East, as it provided the only access on the wide Seyhan river. The city turned into a power house of Cilicia with the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkic]] takeover in 1359. The city remained as the capital of the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] until 1608, and then the regional administrative center for the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turkey]], and shortly for the [[Cilicia#French Cilicia|French Cilicia]]. Economically a modest town until 1861 with a population of roughly 15000, the city boomed with the breakdown of the [[American Civil War]], as becoming a new center for supplying cotton and cotton related products to Europe. Traditionally a town populated by Armenians and Turks; influx of [[Armenians]], Turks, [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Alawites]] at this period, made the city one of the most diverse cities of [[Anatolia]]. Economic, social and cultural growth were halted by the [[Adana massacre]], the [[Armenian Genocide]] and the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]],<ref name=\"HrantAdana\">{{cite web|url=https://hrantdink.org/attachments/article/1398/Adana_Raporu_new.pdf|title=Ermeni K\u00fclt\u00fcr Varl\u0131klar\u0131yla Adana|publisher=HDV Yay\u0131nlar\u0131|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref> all devastated the city in the early 20th century. After the eviction of Armenians and Greeks, most of the city's private properties were confiscated in 1923 and were granted to the Muslim/Turks who recently had migrated into the city. After a standstill period, city's economy again boomed in 1950s with the construction of the [[Seyhan Dam]], and the growth continued until 1980s.\n\nAdana in the 21st century, are a center for regional trade, healthcare, public and private services. Agriculture and logistics are significant sectors of the city. Economic decline caused by national policies and de-industrialization since 1990s is reversing, as the city is gaining momentum with the fairs, festivals and entertainment life. Though not competing at the top level, the rivalry between the city's football clubs, [[Adanaspor]] and [[Adana Demirspor]], is getting national attraction as being the [[Adana football derby|only citywide derby]] of [[Turkey]] that is rooted in socio-economic divisions.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Adana1.jpg|thumb|Eskibaraj Dam Lake on [[Seyhan River]].]]\n\nAdana is located at the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, where it serves as the gateway to the Cilicia plain. This large stretch of flat, fertile land lies southeast of the [[Taurus Mountains]].\n\nFrom Adana, crossing the Cilicia westwards, the road from Tarsus enters the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. It goes through the famous [[Cilician Gates]], the rocky pass through which armies have coursed since the dawn of history, and continues to the Anatolian plain.\n\nThe north of the city is surrounded by the Seyhan reservoir. The Seyhan Dam, completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power and to irrigate the lower \u00c7ukurova plain. Two irrigation channels in the city flow to the plain, passing through the city center from east to west. There is another canal for irrigating the Y\u00fcre\u011fir plain to the southeast of the city.\n\nThe [[37th parallel north]] passes through the city.\n\n===Climate===\nAdana has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under both the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] classification, and a dry-hot summer subtropical climate (Csa) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification. Winters are mild and wet. Summers are long, hot, humid and dry. The highest recorded temperature was on 8 July 1978 at {{convert|45.6|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}.

It is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia. A place called ''Adana'' is mentioned by name in a [[Sumer]]ian epic, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], but the geography of this work is too imprecise to identify its location.\n\n===Ancient times===\nFirst known people living in Adana and area were the [[Luwians]]. They controlled the Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia roughly from 3000BC to around 1600BC. [[Hittites]] took over the region which came to be known as [[Kizzuwatna]]. Inhabited by Luwians and [[Hurrians]], Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under the Hittites protection, but they had a brief independent period from 1500s to 1420s. According to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] inscription of [[Kava]], found in [[Hattusa]] ([[Bo\u011fazkale]]), [[Kizzuwatna]] was the kingdom that ruled Adana, under the protection of the Hittites by 1335 BC. At that time, the name of the city was ''Uru Adaniyya'', and the inhabitants were called [[Denyen|Danuna]]. Beginning with the collapse of the [[Hittite Empire]] c. 1191\u20131189 BC, relatively unknown [[Sea Peoples]] took control of the plain until around 900BC. Then after, [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite States]] founded in the region and Adana was the center of [[Quw\u00ea]] state. Quw\u00ea and other states were protected by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], though they had independent periods. After the Greek migration to Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]<ref name=\"Fox-211ff\">Fox, Robin Lane (2009) ''Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer'' Alfred A. Knopf, , New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9k8Frkhiq_MC&pg=PA211 pages 211-224], {{ISBN|978-0-679-44431-2}}</ref> and Adana was established as the capital. Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries founded in [[Mopsuestia]] were written both in Indo-European [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and West Semitic [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. Assyrians took the control of the regions several times until their collapse in 612BC. The region appeared in Assyrian inscriptions as ''Hilikku'', in which the Cilicia name derived from. Cilicians founded the [[Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)|Kingdom of Cilicia]] by the efforts of [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]]. The kingdom were independent until the invasion of [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 549, then after became an autonomous [[satrapy]] of Achaemenids and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]]. After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s death, for a time, Adana fell under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic dominion]], but finally came to the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Seleucids ruled Adana until the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] made Cilicia their vassal state in 83BC.\n\n===Roman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era===\n[[Pompey]] took over entire Cilicia and organized it as a [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]'s influential period, while nearby Tarsus was the [[metropolis]] of the area. During the era of [[Pompey]], the city was used as a prison for the pirates of Cilicia. The [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] on a Roman military road leading to the East. After the permanent split of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, the area became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and was probably developed during the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantation, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important trade centers of the region. \n\nAdana was a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]], but before its listing in a 10th-century ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as an archdiocese.The Bishop Paulinus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Piso was among the [[Arianism]]-inclined bishops at the [[Council of Sardica]] (344) who withdrew and set up their own council at Philippopolis; he later returned to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodoxy]] and signed the profession of [[Nicene Creed|Nicene faith]] at a synod in Antioch in 363. Cyriacus was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Anatolius is mentioned in a letter of Saint [[John Chrysostom]]. Cyrillus was at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 and at a synod in Tarsus in 434. Philippus took part in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451<ref>{{cite book|author1=Richard Price|author2=Michael Gaddis|title=The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&pg=RA2-PA157|volume=Volume 1|year=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-039-7|page=122}}</ref> and was a signatory of the joint letter of the bishops of [[Cilicia Prima]] to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] in 458 protesting at the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]].

[[Abbasid Caliphate]] took over the rule of the region from Byzantine after [[Al-Mansur]]'s inauguration to caliph in 756. With the Abbasid rule, Muslims for the first time started settling in Cilicia. Abandoned for more than 50 years, Adana was garrisoned and re-built from 758 to 760. To form a [[Al-Awasim|Thugh\u016br]] on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonized with the Turkic Say\u0101bija tribe from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].

He then gathered a troop to regain his power, though got defeated and had to retreat his troop to Adana. He was forced to surrender by the Garrison in Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety. [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], the founder of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] annexed Adana, in his campaign in 1084. The city remained under Turkish rule until it was captured by the forces of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality of Cilicia]] in 1132, under its king, [[Leo I of Armenia|Leo I]]. It was taken by [[Byzantine]] forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it around 1170. In 1268, a [[1268 Cilicia earthquake|devastating earthquake]] destroyed much of the city, and Adana was rebuilt from ruins. 80 years later in 1348, [[Black Death]] reached the city and caused severe depopulation. Adana remained part of the weakened Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia until 1359, when the city was ceded to the T\u00fcrkmen supported [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] who marched into Cilicia and captured the plain.

The Governor ({{lang-tr|Vali}}) was against the deportations, and with the support of [[Djemal Pasha]], could manage to delay the deportations and let the Armenians to sell their movable assets to acquire money for the trip. First convoy of deportees consisting of more than 4000 Armenians left the city on May 20th. The [[Holy See of Cilicia|catholicos of Cilicia]], Sahag Khabayan wrote a letter to Djemal Pasha to prevent further deportations and the chief secretary Kerovpe Papazian met the pasha in [[Lebanon]] in early June and delivered the message of Catholicos. Djemal Pasha immediately sent a telegraph to the Vali to not to deport any more Armenians. With his efforts, Adana Armenians earned an exemption at a summer, when the rest of Cilician Armenians were being deported and hundreds of thousands of Armenian deportees of Western Anatolia were passing through the city. City locals, missionaries and the catholicos helped the exhausted deportees in transit to regain their equilibrium by providing food and shelter. Minister of Internal Affairs, [[Talaat Pasha]], wanted to end the exemption of Adana Armenians and sent his second in command in the Ministry, Ali Munif, to the city in mid-August to resume the deportations. Ali Munif immediately deported 250 families from Adana who were accused of insurrection. Public hangings also began. Before the deportations of the rest, Vali could again manage the deportees to sell their assets. As almost a third of the city residents were selling their goods, the city seemed like a site for massive clearance sale. Deportations of 5000 Armenian families in eight convoys started on 2 September 1915 and continued until the end of October. 1000 craftsmen, state officers and the army personnel were exempted from deportations with their families. Unlike the deportees of other Vilayets, a good portion of Adana Armenians were sent to [[Damascus]] and further south, thus were avoided from the [[Deir ez-Zor Camps|death camps of Aleppo]] by the personal request of Djemal Pasha, then [[Syria Vilayet|Vali of Syria]].<ref name=\"Kevorkian2\">{{cite book| last=Kevorkian| first=Raymond| title=The Armenian Genocide: Complete History |location= London| publisher=I.B.Taurus & Co.Ltd. | year=2011| isbn=978-1848855618}}</ref> The death rate of the roughly 25000 Adana Armenians that were deported through out 1915, were a lot less than the deportees from other places due to three main facts; no reports of direct killings in and around the city, being partially deported safely to Damascus area and having money with them to manage their lives on the way and after arriving to their designated locations.

With the completion of [[Seyhan Dam]] in 1956, the city saw explosive growth when then prime minister [[Adnan Menderes]] showed special interest in Adana; he initiated large-scale infrastructure projects like citywide underground sewer systems and rezoning of residential areas into roads and public spaces.

By the start of the 20th century, factories almost all processing cotton, began to operate in the region. Factories were shut down and the economy almost came to a standstill in 1915, after the genocide of Armenians who ran most of the businesses in the city. Foundation of the republic, again accelerated the growth of industrialization by re-activation of closed plants and opening of state-owned ones. With the construction of [[Seyhan Dam]] and improvements in agricultural techniques, there was an explosive growth in agricultural production during the 1950s.

Population growth slowed between 1885 and 1927 because of the [[Adana Massacre]] and the Armenian deportations, with the numbers only being replenished, rather than increased, by refugees brought in from the Balkans as part of the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Population Exchange of 1923]]. The first Turks moved to the city from Central Asia around the 11th century.

Among the people with faith, the majority of the residents adhere to [[Sunni Islam]]. The majority of Turks, most of the Kurds and some of the Arabs are Sunni Muslim. Adana is also a stronghold of [[Alevism]], many Alevis having moved to the city from [[Kahramanmara\u015f]] after the [[Mara\u015f Massacre|incidents in 1978]]. Arabs of Adana are mostly [[Alawites in Turkey|Alawi]], which is often confused with Alevis. Alawi Arabs are locally known as [[Nusayri]] or ''Fellah''. Arabs from [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province]] are Sunni Muslims.

The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighborhoods being built. Most of the historical landmarks of Adana were built during this period, thus [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] and [[Seljuqid]] architecture are dominant in Adana's architectural history. [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, and few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule. Adana is home to modern Turkey's historic Armenian architecture, which can be found behind the city's central modern buildings.\n\nThe first traces of settlement in the quarter of [[Tepeba\u011f]], can be traced to the [[neolithic age]]. The quarter is next to the Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc stone bridge, situated on a hill which gave its name Tepeba\u011f (Garden on the hill). The city administration has launched a campaign to preserve the heritage of this area, particularly the Ottoman houses. Atat\u00fcrk stayed in one of these houses on Seyhan Caddesi which now houses the [[Atat\u00fcrk Museum (Adana)|Atat\u00fcrk Museum]].\n\nSeveral bridges cross the Seyhan river within the city, the most notable among them is the [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]], a 2nd-century [[Roman bridge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adanakultur.gov.tr/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFB0ED0AA5232E402F59FCBAD67E463149| title = Adana Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Stone Bridge)| author=| publisher=Governship of Adana Tourism and Culture Department| accessdate=}}</ref> Currently used by pedestrians and cyclists, it was the oldest bridge in the world to be open to motorized vehicles until 2007.

Similar to other cities in Turkey, the culture in some sections in the city are very distinct from each other.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/CUKUROVA/makaleler/25.php | title = Adana Halk K\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fcne bak\u0131\u015f |author=Erman Artun|publisher=\u00c7ukurova \u00dcniversitesi T\u00fcrkoloji Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar\u0131 Merkezi}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n[[File:Adana kebab.jpg|thumb|[[Adana Kebab]]]]\nAdana cuisine is influenced mainly from Y\u00f6r\u00fck, Arabic and Armenian cuisine and the city has kept up its traditions. Spicy, sour and fatty dishes made of meat (usually [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]) and bulghur are common. Bulghur and flour are found in all \u00c7ukurova kitchens. In almost every home, red pepper, spices, tahini, a chopping block and pastry board can be found. The bulghur used in cooking is specific to Adana, made from dark colored hard wheat species with a preferred flavor.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adanadan.biz/icerik.asp?ICID=73 | title = Adana Mutfa\u011f\u0131(Turkish)|author=|publisher=adanadan.biz| accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n[[Adana Kebab]], called \"Kebap\" locally, is a kebab made from minced meat. Since it can be found at all kebab restaurants in Turkey and at most Turkish restaurants around the world, the Adana name still suggests kebab to many people. Adana Kebab is the most popular dining choice in Adana, although foods from other cultures are becoming increasingly popular. Besides many kebab restaurants, there are also many kebab serving vendors in the older streets of Adana.\n\n[[File:yeni3.jpg|thumb|left|A glass of [[\u015ealgam]]]]\nAdana Kebab is usually served with onion salad, green salad or with well-chopped tomato salad. [[Rak\u0131]] and [[\u015ealgam]] usually accompany it as drinks. There are many varieties of salads typical to the city. Radish salad with tahini is popular and it is found only in the \u00c7ukurova region. [[\u015ealgam]] and pickle juice are the drinks of the winter and a\u015flama ([[licorice]] juice) is the choice of drink in summer.\n\nOne of the famous sweets of Turkey called \"Sweet Sausage\" originated from Adana. It was invented by Sir Duran O. during the First World War, around 1915 [[Seker Sucugu]].\n\nVegetable dishes are also popular in the city. Besides tomato paste, pepper paste is used in almost every dish. The city is also famous for its ''\u015e\u0131rdan'' a kind of home-made sausage stuffed with rice, and eaten with [[cumin]]; ''pa\u00e7a'', boiled sheep's feet; ''bicibici'' (pronounced as bee-jee-bee-jee) made from jellied starch, rose water and sugar is served with crushed ice and consumed especially in summertime. Furthermore, the city has a number of famous desserts, such as ''Halka Tatl\u0131'', a round-shaped dessert, and ''Ta\u015f Kaday\u0131f'', a bow-shaped dessert. Several types of fruit, including the [[apricot]], are native to this area.\n{{clearleft}}\n\n==Arts and entertainment==\n===Performing arts===\n[[File:Sabanc\u0131 Cultural Center.png|thumb|left|[[Sabanc\u0131 Cultural Center]]]]\n\n[[\u00c7ukurova State Symphony Orchestra]] performed its first concert in 1992 and since then, the orchestra performs twice weekly from October to May at the [[Adana Metropolitan Theatre|Metropolitan Theatre Hall]].

In the 1960s, rapid industrialization brought more men to pavyons not only from the city, but from a wide region including Istanbul and Ankara, thus Adana was named ''Pavyon Capital of Turkey''. Many popular singers took the stage at and owe their fame to the pavyons of Adana.\n\nPavyons led the way to Western-style pubs and night clubs by the late 1980s with the socio-economic changes in Adana. The traditional entertainment district is Sular, near Central Station, but the pubs and clubs nowadays are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs such as Life Legend, Uptown, Casara and Lava host world star singers at their elegant locations, mostly along the river and the lake. There are still two active pavyons, Afrodit and Maksim, but adult entertainment is directed mostly to what is known locally as tele-bars. Tele-bars are licensed as regular pubs, but function as places where bargirls entertain customers and usually hook with them afterwards. There are around 20 tele-bars mainly in the city center and around the old dam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=12 | title = Tele-bar Furyas\u0131 (Turkish)|author=\u0130brahim Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi}}</ref>\n\nA hundred-year-long tradition of [[Adana Kebab|kebab]], liver and [[rak\u0131]] in the Kazanc\u0131lar Bazaar, with street music and dances, turned into a festival since 2010, with all-night entertainment.

Traffic runs smoothly throughout the day; driving can take as little as 40 minutes to Mersin and two hours to [[Gaziantep]].\n\n===Local transport===\n[[File:Metro map Adana.png|thumb|left|Map of the [[Adana Metro]]]]\n\nLocal transport in Adana is provided by '''Adana Transit Corporation''' (a division of the Metropolitan Municipality) and by [[dolmu\u015f]] and bus co-operatives. Transit Corporation runs the metro and the municipal buses.\n\n[[Adana Metro]] is a rail [[Rapid Transit|rapid transit]] system that extends {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=off}} from the north-west to the city center and then to Y\u00fcre\u011fir.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.haberler.com/adana-hafif-rayli-tasima-sistemi-devreye-girdi-haberi/ | title = Adana Hafif Rayl\u0131 Ta\u015f\u0131ma Sistemi Devreye Girdi.

Payment is collected by Kentkart Smartcard system. Six Bus Co-operatives (known as Can buses) serve the city with 411 buses. Kentkart and cash are accepted at these buses. 18 [[Dolmu\u015f]] Co-operatives, with a total of 1,086 minibuses, provide service even to secondary streets. The only form of payment is by cash.\n\n===Cycling and walkability===\nThe city of Adana is mostly flat and the warm weather makes it convenient for all year cycling and walking. The square shape of the city, city center's location right at the center of the square and the river running straight north\u2013south in the middle of the city create further advantage for cycling as a means of transportation. Compact urban form due to dominance of high-rise buildings that are closely built, especially in Seyhan and \u00c7ukurova districts, make cycling from any end of the city to the city center to take less than 40 minutes. Despite all the advantages, car-oriented urban planning since the 1950s caused cycling to take a minor part in commuting to work or school. There are no bike lanes, but there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpa\u015fa Boulevard\u2014the latter not used by cyclists at all. Bicycles for commuting are currently only used by residents of low-income neighborhoods. [[Utility cycling|Bicycle use for transportation]] is low all over Turkey,<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.imo.org.tr/resimler/dosya_ekler/613d551d4160a60_ek.pdf?dergi=166 |title=Kenti\u00e7i ula\u015f\u0131mda bisiklet |author=Volkan Emre Uz, Mustafa Kara\u015fahin |journal=T\u00fcrkiye M\u00fchendislik Haberleri |volume=429 2004/1|pages=41\u201346 |year=2004}}</ref> but when compared to cities like \u0130zmir, [[Konya]] and [[Eski\u015fehir]], Adana is less bicycle friendly.\n\nCar-oriented urban planning became even more extreme since the 1980s, pedestrians seeing part of the sidewalks of the city's popular streets being converted into car-parking spots. The rise in car ownership not only caused high traffic, but also led to drivers parking their cars on the sidewalks. The city currently has no car-free squares or streets other than a few narrow ones. There are plans to convert both ends of Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc to squares and widen the sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk at the peddler-invaded narrow sidewalks. By far the most [[Walkability|pedestrian friendly]] street of the city is Turgut \u00d6zal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in \u00c7ukurova district are also very convenient for walking.\n\n==International relations==\nAdana is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\nEurope\n*{{flagicon|ESP}} [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], Spain\n*{{flagicon|NMK}} [[Skopje]], North Macedonia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Livorno]], Italy\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Debrecen]], Hungary<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/adana-ve-debrecen-kardes-sehir-oldu-40929419|title=Adana ve Debrecen karde\u015f \u015fehir oldu|website=H\u00fcrriyet}}</ref>\n|\nAsia\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Beersheba]], Israel<ref name=\"muni-sister\">{{cite web|title=International Relations of the City of Beersheba |url=http://www.beer-sheva.muni.il/ArimTeomot.asp |publisher=Beersheba Municipality |accessdate=6 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209131035/http://www.beer-sheva.muni.il/ArimTeomot.asp |archivedate=9 December 2008 |url-status=dead |language=he}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|KAZ}} [[Shymkent]], Kazakhstan\n*{{flagicon|JPN}} [[Sapporo]], Japan\n*{{flagicon|MNG}} [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia\n|}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 2213.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Side view\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 844.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Entrance to courtyard\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 8573.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Entrance to courtyard's backside\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 3570.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Exterior\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque3636.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Courtyard\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 3638.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Mihrab and minber\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 5720.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Woodwork under balcony\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque3645.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Woodwork under balcony\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7586.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami From west\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7588.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami From east\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7589.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami Interior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4990.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Exterior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4995.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Interior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4993.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Decorative stonework\nFile:Adana Yesil Mescit 4989.jpg|Adana Yesil Mescit Exterior\nFile:Adana Yesil Mescit 4988.jpg|Adana Yesil Mescit Window decoration\nFile:Adana Alidede Mosque 1625.jpg|Adana Alidede Mosque Exterior\nFile:Adana Alidede Mosque 3591.jpg|Adana Alidede Mosque Interior\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Turkey}}\n*[[List of people from Adana]]\n*[[List of twin towns and sister cities in Turkey]]\n*[[List of mayors of Adana]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book|title = The Helsinki Atlas of the Near East in the Neo-Assyrian Period |ISBN=951-45-9050-3|first1=Simo|last= Parpola|author-link1=Simo Parpola |first2= Michael|last2= Porter|author-link2=Michael Porter|publisher=[[Gazetteer]]|location=Helsinki, Finland|year=2001}}\n*{{Cite book|title = The Turks Today|ISBN=1-58567-756-6|first=Andrew |last=Mango|author-link=Andrew Mango|publisher=The Overlook Press|location=New York City|year=2004}}\n*{{Cite book|title = [[Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World]] |ISBN=0-691-03169-X |first=Richard |last=Talbert|author-link=Richard Talbert|publisher=The Overlook Press|location=New York City|year=2004}}\n*{{Cite book|title = \u0531\u057f\u0561\u0576\u0561\u0575\u056b \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0581 \u054a\u0561\u057f\u0574\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576 |trans-title=The History of the Armenians of Adana|first=Puzant |last=Yeghiayan |location= Beirut |publisher=Union of Armenian Compatriots of Adana|year=1970|language=hy}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Adana}}\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [http://adana.gov.tr/ Governorship of Adana]\n* [http://adana.bel.tr Adana Metropolitan Municipality]\n* [http://www.adana-to.org.tr Adana Trade and Industry Chamber]\n\n{{City of Adana |state=collapsed}}\n{{Districts of Turkey|provname=Adana}}\n{{Metropolitan centers in Turkey}}\n{{Syro-Hittite states}}\n{{Largest cities in Turkey}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Adana| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Districts of Adana Province]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Adana Province]]\n[[Category:Populated places along the Silk Road]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in the Mediterranean Region, Turkey]]\n[[Category:Hittite cities]]\n[[Category:Roman sites in Turkey]]\n", "name_user": "Seyhan668", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTurkish era", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana"}

For these reasons, legislation to regulate and standardize low-speed electric vehicles began to be discussed by the Chinese government in 2016, including  battery types (lead-acid versus lithium-ion batteries) and mandatory safety tests and vehicle dimensions.<ref name=Outlook2017/>\n\n;Two-wheelers and three-wheelers\nChina continued to dominate both new registrations and the global stock of [[Electric motorcycles and scooters|electric two-wheelers]] in 2016, with about 26 million units sold.

The club's first competitive match took place on 13 January 1907 against local team Liatroim (who were the first club formed in the county). The match ended Kilcoo 0\u20130 Leitrim 0\u20135. Kilcoo won their first Senior County Championship in 1917 defeating Killyleagh in the final. The club won the championship in 1922, then followed the glorious \"four in a row\" 1925,1926,1927,1928, and success came again in 1932,1933 and 1937.\n\nPatience is a virtue, but Kilcoo had to exercise it for 72 years, finally getting the chance to celebrate a Down senior football championship title again in 2009. This launched an unprecedented period of success winning 8 titles in 10 years including a remarkable six-in-a-row between 2012-2017.\n\n\n== The club today ==\n\nKilcoo GAC is one of the most successful clubs in County Down today. The club has a camogie team, a ladies football team and football teams at Under-8, Under-10, Under-12, Under-14, Under-16, Minor, Seconds, Thirds, Under-21 and Senior Level. The Senior team compete in Division 1 and play in the Down Senior Football Championship. Kilcoo are regularly represented on Down GAA teams. \n\n'''2005'''\n\nIn 2005 three Kilcoo players were on the Down Under 21 football team who reached the All-Ireland Final. \n\n'''2006'''\n\nIn 2006 Kilcoo had a good run in the Down Senior Football Championship reaching the semi-finals. In their first round match they faced Division Two side Downpatrick in Castlewellan. In what would be a tough match Kilcoo prevailed on a scoreline of 1\u201310 to 1\u20137 with corner forward Sean Kelly scoring 0\u20133. Next up was Castlewellan in the quarter-final in Downpatrick. \nThese two teams met at the same stage a year earlier with Castlewellan gaining the victory. This time Kilcoo won by seven points on a scoreline of 1\u201313 to 1\u20136. Conor Laverty came on as a substitute and scored a goal and two points. The semi-final was next and would be against Mayobridge who had won the last two championships. The Kilcoo players knew they were facing the best club team in Down and that they would be up against it. Kilcoo started brightly and scored a goal in the first ten minutes. However Mayobridge's experience more than anything else carried them through for the victory with the score 0\u201313 to 1\u20139. \nIt was a cruel blow for Kilcoo but knew that they pushed the county champions to the limit. In the league Kilcoo finished in first place but were beaten well by Burren in the semi-finals of the Division 1 play-offs. \n\n'''2007'''\n\nIn 2007 Kilcoo played Leitrim in the first round of the Down Senior Football Championship and defeated them after a replay. Kilcoo were beaten in the quarter finals by eventual finalists Longstone. \nThe club reached the All County Division One League Final after defeating Burren after extra time in the semi-final. Kilcoo were defeated in the final by An Riocht on the scoreline of 3\u20137 to 1\u201310. Returning Australian Football League player Martin Clarke scored 2\u20131 for An Riocht in the final.\n\n'''2008'''\n\nThe 2008 season started off against the team that beat Kilcoo in the League Final. This time Kilcoo earned an easy victory. Their next match saw them play Burren where they were defeated. Kilcoo finished second in the league table behind Mayobridge. In the Championship, Kilcoo's opponents were An Riocht again with Kilcoo running out comfortable winners on a scoreline of 3\u201315 to 0\u20133. Next up was Burren. The match was played in slippery conditions and Kilcoo were lucky to escape with a draw on a scoreline of 1\u20136 to 1\u20136. Paul Greenan grabbed the vital goal for Kilcoo. In the replay Kilcoo were well beaten. After the disappointing championship exit Kilcoo were able to focus on the league. After finishing second to Mayobridge, Kilcoo entered the play-offs. In the semi-final Kilcoo were up against Rostrevor under lights at P\u00e1irc Elser. Kilcoo gained a hard earned win with a 1\u20137 to 0\u20137 with Paul Devlin scoring 1\u20134. The final in Newry again was against county champions underdogs as \"The Bridge\" were looking to do the double. In an excellent display of football Kilcoo ran out easy winners in the end with the result 3\u201314 to 1\u20137. Paul Devlin was the star of the show again scoring 0\u20138. Captain Gerard McEvoy accepted the cup and dedicated the win to Arthur Morgan, club president who died the previous week.\n\n'''2009'''\n\nKilcoo started their 2009 Down Senior Football Championship campaign with a tricky tie against local rivals Bryansford. After a hard working display Kilcoo came out on top winning 2\u20139 to 1\u20139. Next up was county champions Mayobridge in a waterlogged Hilltown pitch. Kilcoo went into this match as underdogs and rallied in the last five minutes to come from six points down to win 1\u201310 to 1\u20138. The semi-final against Burren was very tense but Kilcoo prevailed on a scoreline of 0\u201312 to 0\u201310 with goalkeeper Stephen Kane saving a penalty in the first half. Kilcoo had now reached their first senior final since 1948 and had the chance to bridge a 72-year gap when they last won the title in 1937. Only Loughinisland stood in their way. Kilcoo settled in the second half and came out on top leaving Loughinisland scoreless in the second half also. Final score 2\u20139 to 1\u20134. When the final whistle blew the whole Kilcoo crowd invaded the pitch with a sea of black and white in a scene that sparked wild celebrations and that will go down as one of the most memorable moments in the club's history. Captain Gerard McEvoy collected the Frank O'Hare Cup while Anthony Devlin collected the Man of the Match award. The team arrived back home to Kilcoo that evening to a heroes welcome in front of a large crowd who assembled in the village. The team then ventured into their first ever Ulster Championship campaign with a meeting against St. Eunan's of Donegal. After a great team performance Kilcoo came out on top on a scoreline of 0\u201313 to 0\u20139. Their next opponents would be The Loup from Derry. Kilcoo played extremely well but were unable to hold on to the lead and the match ended Loup 1\u201312 Kilcoo 1\u201311. In November 2010, Kilcoo Minors retained their title as they over came Rostevor. Kilcoo were in a commanding position from the start and even late rally from Rostrevor's Caolan Mooney wasn't enough for Rostrevor. In the end Kilcoo running out easy winners, to gain back-to-back titles. Kilcoo won the minor championship for the 3rd year in a row beating Warrenpiont 1\u201312 to 0\u201310 and the senior team also won the League beating Mayobridge 2\u201316 to 1\u201306.\n\n[[image:Kilcoo Teams 10.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Kilcoo Senior Championship winning team 2009]]\n\n'''2012'''\n\nKilcoo won their second Down county title in four years with a triumph over Mayobridge. \nThe final in Newry got off to a dramatic start when Conor Laverty pounced for a goal in the first minute. Kilcoo withstood some late pressure to beat Mayobridge 2-8 to 1-8 and regain the Down Club Championship.\n\n'''2013'''\n\nThree injury-time points helped Kilcoo snatch a 0-9 to 0-7 victory to retain their Down Club title in Newry.\nBurren led by 0-7 to 0-6 as three minutes of stoppage time were signalled and Darragh O'Hanlon converted a huge 50-metre free to draw the sides level. Paul Devlin then landed the decisive free and added an insurance point from play with the last kick of the game.\nBurren captain Dan McCartan was sent-off for a second yellow card offence during a frantic last few minutes. It was Kilcoo's third Down county title in the last five years. <ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24604126</ref>\n\n'''2014'''\n\nKilcoo completed a three-in-a-row of Down SFC titles with an emphatic victory over Burren in Newry.\nGoals in each half by Ryan Johnston and late ones from Conor Laverty and Donal Kane helped Kilcoo ease to an easy win. <ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/gaelic-games/29481799</ref>\n\n'''2015'''\n\nKilcoo won the Down Senior Club Championship title again with a convincing win against Castlewellan with a final score of Castlewellan 0-11 Kilcoo 3-10. <ref>https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/gaa/three-in-row-for-kilcoo-after-easily-seeing-off-down-31600963.html</ref>\n\n'''2016'''\n\nKilcoo completed an historic five in-a-row in Down when they defeated Clonduff 3-11 to 0-9 in the final in Pairc Esler.\n<ref>http://www.hoganstand.com/county/down/article/index/261274\n</ref>\n\n'''2017'''\n\nKilcoo clinched a sixth successive Down Football title as they edged out Burren 0-13 to 0-11 at Newry.\nFour Donal O'Hare points helped Burren lead 0-7 to 0-6 at half-time and the St Mary's club still led 0-9 to 0-8 five minutes into the second half. However, Kilcoo hit five of the last seven points as Dylan Ward and Paul Devlin both finished with four points.\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/gaelic-games/41461480\n</ref>\n\n'''2018'''\n\nBurren prevented Kilcoo from landing a record seventh straight Down SFC title in the 2-12 to 2-9 final defeat at Pairc Esler.\nBurren's victory prevented Kilcoo from bettering the six-in-a-row also achieved by the St Mary's outfit between 1983 and 1988.\n\n'''2019'''\n\nThis has been an unprecedented year for Kilcoo with the senior team winning the Ulster Senior Club Football Championship, Down Senior league, Down championship and the senior sevens.

The club's first competitive match took place on 13 January 1907 against local team Liatroim (who were the first club formed in the county). The match ended Kilcoo 0\u20130 Leitrim 0\u20135. Kilcoo won their first Senior County Championship in 1917 defeating Killyleagh in the final. The club won the championship in 1922, then followed the glorious \"four in a row\" 1925,1926,1927,1928, and success came again in 1932,1933 and 1937.\n\nPatience is a virtue, but Kilcoo had to exercise it for 72 years, finally getting the chance to celebrate a Down senior football championship title again in 2009. This launched an unprecedented period of success winning 8 titles in 10 years including a remarkable six-in-a-row between 2012-2017.\n\n\n== The club today ==\n\nKilcoo GAC is one of the most successful clubs in County Down today. The club has a camogie team, a ladies football team and football teams at Under-8, Under-10, Under-12, Under-14, Under-16, Minor, Seconds, Thirds, Under-21 and Senior Level. The Senior team compete in Division 1 and play in the Down Senior Football Championship. Kilcoo are regularly represented on Down GAA teams. \n\n'''2005'''\n\nIn 2005 three Kilcoo players were on the Down Under 21 football team who reached the All-Ireland Final. \n\n'''2006'''\n\nIn 2006 Kilcoo had a good run in the Down Senior Football Championship reaching the semi-finals. In their first round match they faced Division Two side Downpatrick in Castlewellan. In what would be a tough match Kilcoo prevailed on a scoreline of 1\u201310 to 1\u20137 with corner forward Sean Kelly scoring 0\u20133. Next up was Castlewellan in the quarter-final in Downpatrick. \nThese two teams met at the same stage a year earlier with Castlewellan gaining the victory. This time Kilcoo won by seven points on a scoreline of 1\u201313 to 1\u20136. Conor Laverty came on as a substitute and scored a goal and two points. The semi-final was next and would be against Mayobridge who had won the last two championships. The Kilcoo players knew they were facing the best club team in Down and that they would be up against it. Kilcoo started brightly and scored a goal in the first ten minutes. However Mayobridge's experience more than anything else carried them through for the victory with the score 0\u201313 to 1\u20139. \nIt was a cruel blow for Kilcoo but knew that they pushed the county champions to the limit. In the league Kilcoo finished in first place but were beaten well by Burren in the semi-finals of the Division 1 play-offs. \n\n'''2007'''\n\nIn 2007 Kilcoo played Leitrim in the first round of the Down Senior Football Championship and defeated them after a replay. Kilcoo were beaten in the quarter finals by eventual finalists Longstone. \nThe club reached the All County Division One League Final after defeating Burren after extra time in the semi-final. Kilcoo were defeated in the final by An Riocht on the scoreline of 3\u20137 to 1\u201310. Returning Australian Football League player Martin Clarke scored 2\u20131 for An Riocht in the final.\n\n'''2008'''\n\nThe 2008 season started off against the team that beat Kilcoo in the League Final. This time Kilcoo earned an easy victory. Their next match saw them play Burren where they were defeated. Kilcoo finished second in the league table behind Mayobridge. In the Championship, Kilcoo's opponents were An Riocht again with Kilcoo running out comfortable winners on a scoreline of 3\u201315 to 0\u20133. Next up was Burren. The match was played in slippery conditions and Kilcoo were lucky to escape with a draw on a scoreline of 1\u20136 to 1\u20136. Paul Greenan grabbed the vital goal for Kilcoo. In the replay Kilcoo were well beaten. After the disappointing championship exit Kilcoo were able to focus on the league. After finishing second to Mayobridge, Kilcoo entered the play-offs. In the semi-final Kilcoo were up against Rostrevor under lights at P\u00e1irc Elser. Kilcoo gained a hard earned win with a 1\u20137 to 0\u20137 with Paul Devlin scoring 1\u20134. The final in Newry again was against county champions underdogs as \"The Bridge\" were looking to do the double. In an excellent display of football Kilcoo ran out easy winners in the end with the result 3\u201314 to 1\u20137. Paul Devlin was the star of the show again scoring 0\u20138. Captain Gerard McEvoy accepted the cup and dedicated the win to Arthur Morgan, club president who died the previous week.\n\n'''2009'''\n\nKilcoo started their 2009 Down Senior Football Championship campaign with a tricky tie against local rivals Bryansford. After a hard working display Kilcoo came out on top winning 2\u20139 to 1\u20139. Next up was county champions Mayobridge in a waterlogged Hilltown pitch. Kilcoo went into this match as underdogs and rallied in the last five minutes to come from six points down to win 1\u201310 to 1\u20138. The semi-final against Burren was very tense but Kilcoo prevailed on a scoreline of 0\u201312 to 0\u201310 with goalkeeper Stephen Kane saving a penalty in the first half. Kilcoo had now reached their first senior final since 1948 and had the chance to bridge a 72-year gap when they last won the title in 1937. Only Loughinisland stood in their way. Kilcoo settled in the second half and came out on top leaving Loughinisland scoreless in the second half also. Final score 2\u20139 to 1\u20134. When the final whistle blew the whole Kilcoo crowd invaded the pitch with a sea of black and white in a scene that sparked wild celebrations and that will go down as one of the most memorable moments in the club's history. Captain Gerard McEvoy collected the Frank O'Hare Cup while Anthony Devlin collected the Man of the Match award. The team arrived back home to Kilcoo that evening to a heroes welcome in front of a large crowd who assembled in the village. The team then ventured into their first ever Ulster Championship campaign with a meeting against St. Eunan's of Donegal. After a great team performance Kilcoo came out on top on a scoreline of 0\u201313 to 0\u20139. Their next opponents would be The Loup from Derry. Kilcoo played extremely well but were unable to hold on to the lead and the match ended Loup 1\u201312 Kilcoo 1\u201311. In November 2010, Kilcoo Minors retained their title as they over came Rostevor. Kilcoo were in a commanding position from the start and even late rally from Rostrevor's Caolan Mooney wasn't enough for Rostrevor. In the end Kilcoo running out easy winners, to gain back-to-back titles. Kilcoo won the minor championship for the 3rd year in a row beating Warrenpiont 1\u201312 to 0\u201310 and the senior team also won the League beating Mayobridge 2\u201316 to 1\u201306.\n\n[[image:Kilcoo Teams 10.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Kilcoo Senior Championship winning team 2009]]\n\n'''2012'''\n\nKilcoo won their second Down county title in four years with a triumph over Mayobridge. \nThe final in Newry got off to a dramatic start when Conor Laverty pounced for a goal in the first minute. Kilcoo withstood some late pressure to beat Mayobridge 2-8 to 1-8 and regain the Down Club Championship.\n\n'''2013'''\n\nThree injury-time points helped Kilcoo snatch a 0-9 to 0-7 victory to retain their Down Club title in Newry.\nBurren led by 0-7 to 0-6 as three minutes of stoppage time were signalled and Darragh O'Hanlon converted a huge 50-metre free to draw the sides level. Paul Devlin then landed the decisive free and added an insurance point from play with the last kick of the game.\nBurren captain Dan McCartan was sent-off for a second yellow card offence during a frantic last few minutes.

It is the only theme park in the [[United States]] based entirely on the award-winning [[Educational television|children's educational television]] program ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and includes a variety of rides, shows and water attractions suited to young children. It is also the first theme park in the world to become a certified autism center.\n\nSesame Place is one of the 12 theme parks owned and operated by [[SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment|SeaWorld Entertainment]], which operates the park under an exclusive license from [[Sesame Workshop]], the non-profit owner of ''Sesame Street''. Sesame Workshop itself was the park's original owner; the land was sold to [[Anheuser-Busch]] in 1987.\n\n==Overview==\nSesame Place first opened in 1980 near the [[Oxford Valley Mall]] and initiated the expansion of the commercial complex in the vicinity. It was designed by [[Eric McMillan]], a Canadian designer, [[Sandra Hanna]] of [[Lambertville, New Jersey]] and several other designers. The park is open from early May through Halloween for The Count's Halloween Spooktacular, and mid-November through December for A Very Furry Christmas. The original park was {{convert|3|acre}} and featured play areas and large computer labs where kids could color their favorite Sesame Street characters. Since then, it has expanded to {{convert|14|acre}} with rides and water attractions. The expansions included the construction of Cookie's Monster Land in 2014 - the park's largest renovation to date.\n\nIn 2007, it became the first theme park in Pennsylvania to become completely smoke-free.<ref>{{cite pr|url=http://www.sesameplace.com/sesame/pa/parkinfo_4themedia_2007_pressrelease.aspx?PRID=125 |title=SESAME PLACE \u2013 FIRST THEME PARK IN PENNSYLVANIA TO BE 100 PERCENT SMOKE-FREE |publisher=Sesame Place |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=2009-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609204551/http://www.sesameplace.com/sesame/pa/parkinfo_4themedia_2007_pressrelease.aspx?PRID=125 |archivedate=June 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Related parks==\nSesame Place is one of 12 parks operated by [[SeaWorld Entertainment]].

It is the only theme park in the [[United States]] based entirely on the award-winning [[Educational television|children's educational television]] program ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and includes a variety of rides, shows and water attractions suited to young children. It is also the first theme park in the world to become a certified autism center.\n\nSesame Place is one of the 12 theme parks owned and operated by [[SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment|SeaWorld Entertainment]], which operates the park under an exclusive license from [[Sesame Workshop]], the non-profit owner of ''Sesame Street''. Sesame Workshop itself was the park's original owner; the land was sold to [[Anheuser-Busch]] in 1987.\n\n==Overview==\nSesame Place first opened in 1980 near the [[Oxford Valley Mall]] and initiated the expansion of the commercial complex in the vicinity. It was designed by [[Eric McMillan]], a Canadian designer, [[Sandra Hanna]] of [[Lambertville, New Jersey]] and several other designers. The park is open from early May through Halloween for The Count's Halloween Spooktacular, and mid-November through December for A Very Furry Christmas.

A second [[Irving, Texas|Sesame Place]] park also existed in [[Irving, Texas]] from 1982\u20131984 (a [[Walmart Supercenter]] now sits in its place), closing its doors due to poor attendance and a large number of [[water park]]s competing for its business. A third one in [[Tokyo, Japan]] was open from 1990 until December 31, 2006. In 2017, a third location was announced, to open \"no later than\" mid-2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/press-releases/5474/|title=SeaWorld Entertainment and Sesame Workshop Announce Expanded Partnership to Include New Sesame Place Theme Park - Sesame Workshop|publisher=}}</ref> In 2019, it was announced that [[Aquatica San Diego]] near [[San Diego|San Diego, California]] would be replaced by a new Sesame Place theme park by spring 2021.\n\nIn 1994, a ''[[Sesame Street]]'' themed amusement park called Parque Plaza Sesamo ([[Plaza S\u00e9samo]]) was opened in [[Monterrey, Mexico]].

Ruler of the [[India]]n [[Princely State]] of [[Benares State]] ([[Royal House of Benares]]) [[Prabhu Narayan Singh]] was instrumental in setting up the school and donated requisite land for the school.\n\nIt started as [[High school#India|high school]] (from grade [[Sixth grade|VI]] to [[Tenth grade|X]]). [[Annie Besant]] originally intended to convert this school into a [[Undergraduate education#Indian system|degree college]] and sought approval from Prayag Vishwavidyalaya ([[Allahabad University]]). The school also housed classes for [[Faculty of Arts, Banaras Hindu University]] and ran classes as loner for the [[Banaras Hindu University]].\n\nIn 1914, on request of [[Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya]], Besant handed over the college (then known as Central Hindu College) to [[Banaras Hindu University]] for establishing the university.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uBSEJznCfJkC&pg=RA1-PA479&dq=%22Central+Hindu+College%22#PRA1-PA479,M1 History of Central Hindu College] ''Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Correspondence and Select Documents'', by [[Rajendra Prasad]], Valmiki Choudhary.

[[Banaras Hindu University]] was started on the campus of this school (with class rooms on loan) and functioned there till it relocated to its current location in 1916. In 1914 [[Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya]] requested [[Dr. (title)|Dr.]] [[Annie Besant|Besant]] to hand over the school (then called Central Hindu College) to [[Banaras Hindu University]]. On 27 November 1915, the school was handed over to the university. The school became a constituent college of the [[Banaras Hindu University]] in October 1917 after the Government issued a notification. The [[Sayaji Rao Gaekwad Library, BHU]] was first housed in the Telang Library of the College in 1917.<ref name=\"Sayaji Rao Gaekwad Library\">{{cite news|title=Sayaji Rao Gaekwad Library|publisher=coral.uchicago.edu|accessdate=19 Jul 2015|url=https://coral.uchicago.edu:8443/display/lasa/Banaras+Hindu+University,+Central+Library+%28Varanasi,+India%29}}</ref> Noted theosophist, [[George Arundale]] joined the school as a history teacher in 1917 and later became the head of the school.\n\nTill 1976, [[Banaras Hindu University]] had been conducting [[High school#India|High School]] (grade [[Tenth grade|X]]) of the school. Senior High School (11th standard) was called Pre University Course (PUC) and later the same students could join [[Banaras Hindu University]] directly for their undergraduate courses. In 1976, the school adopted the [[10+2]] education system and got affiliated with [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]].

Ruler of the [[India]]n [[Princely State]] of [[Benares State]] ([[Royal House of Benares]]) [[Prabhu Narayan Singh]] was instrumental in setting up the school and donated requisite land for the school.\n\nIt started as [[High school#India|high school]] (from grade [[Sixth grade|VI]] to [[X]]). [[Annie Besant]] originally intended to convert this school into a [[Undergraduate education#Indian system|degree college]] and sought approval from Prayag Vishwavidyalaya ([[Allahabad University]]). The school also housed classes for [[Faculty of Arts, Banaras Hindu University]] and ran classes as loner for the [[Banaras Hindu University]].\n\nIn 1914, on request of [[Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya]], Besant handed over the college (then known as Central Hindu College) to [[Banaras Hindu University]] for establishing the university.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uBSEJznCfJkC&pg=RA1-PA479&dq=%22Central+Hindu+College%22#PRA1-PA479,M1 History of Central Hindu College] ''Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Correspondence and Select Documents'', by [[Rajendra Prasad]], Valmiki Choudhary.

[[Banaras Hindu University]] was started on the campus of this school (with class rooms on loan) and functioned there till it relocated to its current location in 1916. In 1914 [[Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya]] requested [[Dr. (title)|Dr.]] [[Annie Besant|Besant]] to hand over the school (then called Central Hindu College) to [[Banaras Hindu University]]. On 27 November 1915, the school was handed over to the university. The school became a constituent college of the [[Banaras Hindu University]] in October 1917 after the Government issued a notification. The [[Sayaji Rao Gaekwad Library, BHU]] was first housed in the Telang Library of the College in 1917.<ref name=\"Sayaji Rao Gaekwad Library\">{{cite news|title=Sayaji Rao Gaekwad Library|publisher=coral.uchicago.edu|accessdate=19 Jul 2015|url=https://coral.uchicago.edu:8443/display/lasa/Banaras+Hindu+University,+Central+Library+%28Varanasi,+India%29}}</ref> Noted theosophist, [[George Arundale]] joined the school as a history teacher in 1917 and later became the head of the school.\n\nTill 1976, [[Banaras Hindu University]] had been conducting [[High school#India|High School]] (grade [[Tenth grade|X]]) of the school. Senior High School (11th standard) was called Pre University Course (PUC) and later the same students could join [[Banaras Hindu University]] directly for their undergraduate courses.
