The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then.

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. In November 1995, Anastasio told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' \"When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website.

Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]].

The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then.

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. In November 1995, Anastasio told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' \"When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website.

Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]].

Among the first was ''Analyze Phish'' which was hosted by comedians [[Harris Wittels]] and [[Scott Aukerman]] for the [[Earwolf]] podcast network, and ran for ten episodes posted between 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish 101, episode #1 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/phish-101/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fuego, episode #10 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/fuego/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> The podcast followed Wittels, a devoted fan of the band, in his humorous attempts to get Aukerman to enjoy their music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Harris Wittels: The Parks and Rec Writer Gets to \"Analyze Phish\" (Throwback) |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/harris-wittels-the-parks-and-rec-writer-gets-to-analyze-phish/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=26 February 2015}}</ref> Despite its truncated run, ''Analyze Phish'' inspired Phish lyricist Tom Marshall to start his own Phish podcast, ''Under the Scales'', in 2016.<ref name=\"osiris\">{{cite web |last1=Greenhaus |first1=Mike |title=Interview: Tom Marshall and RJ Bee on New Podcast Network Osiris |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/interview_tom_marshall_and_rj_bee_on_new_podcast_network_osiris/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=22 February 2018}}</ref> In 2018, Marshall co-founded the Osiris Podcasting Network, which hosts ''Under the Scales'' and other music podcasts, many of which are devoted to Phish or other jam bands.<ref name=\"osiris\"/> On 15 September 2019, C13Originals debuted ''Long May They Run'', a music documentary podcast series.
