He spent the majority of his career in Italy. He started his career at [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] before spending seven years at [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]], with whom he won two [[Coppa Italia]] titles, the [[1999 Supercoppa Italiana]], and the [[1999 UEFA Cup Final|1999]] [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. After spells at [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], he transferred (along with manager [[Fabio Capello]]) from Juventus to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 2006, with whom he won consecutive [[La Liga]] titles in 2007 and 2008. After returning to Juventus for one season in 2009\u201310, he joined [[Al-Ahli Dubai|Al-Ahli]] in [[Dubai]], where he retired from football in 2011 after an injury-troubled season.\n\nCannavaro has also achieved success with the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]]. He was part of the Italy team which won consecutive [[UEFA European Under-21 Championship]]s in 1994 and 1996. After earning his first senior [[Cap (sport)|cap]] in 1997, he helped his national team to the final of [[UEFA Euro 2000 Final|UEFA Euro 2000]], being named in the team of the tournament, and became [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in 2002, following [[Paolo Maldini]]'s retirement. Cannavaro led Italy to victory in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, and was given the nickname ''\"Il Muro di Berlino\"'' (\"The Berlin Wall\") by the Italian supporters due to his defensive performances, which saw Italy keep five clean sheets and concede only two goals, neither of which were in open play. He was awarded the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Silver Ball]] after being named the tournament's second-best player. In 2009, Cannavaro overtook Maldini as the most capped player in the country's history. He retired from international football on 25 June 2010 following Italy's failure to qualify for the knockout stages of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], having amassed 136 caps and 2 goals for the senior national team.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/world-cup-2010/story/0,27032,12098_6228121,00.html |title=Cannavaro quits Italy duty |work=[[Sky Sports]] |date=25 June 2010 |access-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628010011/http://www.skysports.com/football/world-cup-2010/story/0,27032,12098_6228121,00.html |archive-date=28 June 2010}}</ref> In total, he has represented Italy at four [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s, two [[UEFA European Championship]]s, the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. He is currently Italy's [[Italy national football team records#Appearances|second all-time appearance holder]], behind [[Gianluigi Buffon]].\n\nCannavaro was named the 2006 [[FIFA World Player of the Year]], and won the [[Ballon d'Or]] award in [[2006 Ballon d'Or|2006]] which made him the only defender to win the award in a decade and only the third of all time after [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Matthias Sammer]].<ref>[http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/cannavaro-discusses-highs-and-lows/66691 \"Cannavaro discusses highs and lows\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216084627/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/cannavaro-discusses-highs-and-lows/66691 |date=16 December 2013 }}.

In November 2014, he was appointed as head coach of Chinese club [[Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C.|Guangzhou Evergrande]]. On 9 June 2016, he signed a contract with second-tier Chinese club [[Tianjin Quanjian F.C.|Tianjin Quanjian]] as manager where he led the team to the [[China League One|league title]].

Napoli|Napoli]], his hometown and favourite childhood team. Cannavaro initially served as the club's [[ball boy]] and would often watch his idols [[Diego Maradona]] and [[Ciro Ferrara]] play. He later joined the club's youth team, initially playing as a [[midfielder]] like his idol [[Marco Tardelli]], before the team's youth coach switched him to the role of centre-back.<ref name=\"story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/10785902/fabio-cannavaro-tells-his-story-from-ball-boy-to-ballon-dor-winner|title=Fabio Cannavaro tells his story: From ball boy to Ballon d'Or winner|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 March 2017|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref> He gained a reputation when, in a training session at Napoli, the young Fabio produced a strong sliding challenge on Maradona, who was then the undisputed star of the club, to dispossess him. The rough challenge angered teammates and staff at Napoli. However, Maradona himself defended the promising player and encouraged him to play the way he wanted, and reportedly congratulated by Cannavaro by giving him his boots as a souvenir after the training session.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/><ref name=\"story\"/><ref name=\"urchin\"/><ref name=\"Pallone d'Oro a Cannavaro\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Sport/2006/11/md271106profilo_cannavaro_PRN.shtml|title=Pallone d'Oro a Cannavaro: \"Lo dedico ai ragazzi di Napoli\"|publisher=Il Sole 24 Ore|author1=Massimo Donaddio|language=Italian|date=27 November 2006|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nCannavaro's progress as a player was such that he soon became a member of the first team alongside some of his childhood idols.

Cannavaro remained at Napoli until 1995, earning nearly 60 total appearances with the club, scoring one goal.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\n===1995\u20132002: Parma===\nCannavaro was sold to Parma in the summer of 1995 and in his first season, he was instantly a regular in the first team, scoring once in 29 appearances in the league. He would go on not only to win trophies with the club, but also achieve several personal accomplishments, being named the team's captain. It was also in Parma that he met [[Gianluigi Buffon]] and [[Lilian Thuram]], who would not only form one of the tightest defensive units of Europe with Cannavaro, but would also become some of his closest friends in football. Further players featuring in this legendary Parma backline were [[Luigi Sartor]], [[Roberto Mussi]], [[Antonio Benarrivo]], [[Luigi Apolloni]] and the Argentine [[N\u00e9stor Sensini]]. Cannavaro began to obtain success during his time at Parma. During his first season, Parma were eliminated in the second round of the [[1995\u201396 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], but finished in sixth place in [[1995\u201396 Serie A|Serie A]] that season, qualifying for the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]]. Parma also reached the quarter-finals of the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|1995\u201396]] [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] that season. Parma finished the [[1996\u201397 Serie A|1996\u201397 Serie A season]] as runners-up to Serie A champions Juventus, allowing them to qualify for the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] the following season. Parma were once again eliminated in the second round of the [[1996\u201397 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and in the first round of the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] that season. In the [[1997\u201398 Serie A|1997\u201398 season]], Parma finished in fifth place in Serie A and reached the [[1997\u201398 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] semi-finals, whilst they were knocked out in the group stage of the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], finishing second in their group to defending champions [[Borussia Dortmund]].<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nIn his [[1998\u201399 Serie A|fourth season]] with the club, Cannavaro won his only European trophy, the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], as well as winning the [[1998\u201399 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]]. Parma finished the Serie A season in fourth place, one point from [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in the third place spot. In the [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|following season]], Fabio's brother Paolo Cannavaro joined the team, and the two Cannavaro brothers were able to play alongside each other for the next two seasons. Fabio won his first [[Supercoppa Italiana]] title against Serie A champions Milan and Parma finished the Serie A season in fourth place, tied with [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] for the final remaining Champions League spot. However, Parma lost 3\u20131 to Inter in the Serie A Champions League playoff match, failing to qualify for the Champions League group stage. They started in the third and final qualifying round of the Champions League and were eliminated by [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. They were knocked out in the round of 16 of both the [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] and the [[1999\u20132000 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] that season.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nIn the [[2000\u201301 Serie A|2000\u201301 season]], Cannavaro aided in leading Parma to another [[2000\u201301 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia Final]], in which they were defeated by Fiorentina. They were eliminated in the third round of the [[2000\u201301 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] that season. Parma also finished the season in fourth place for the third consecutive season, which allowed them to go through to the [[2001\u201302 UEFA Champions League|Champions League qualifying round]], although Parma were ultimately unable to qualify. In his final season with Parma, Cannavaro managed to win his second [[2001\u201302 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] title, over Juventus, whilst Parma were eliminated in the round of 16 of the [[2001\u201302 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], and finished the [[2001\u201302 Serie A|Serie A season]] in tenth place. As from 1997, he began to earn call-ups to the national team's senior squad due to his performances for Parma, and he was consistently one of the best defenders in Serie A. In his time with Parma, Cannavaro made over 250 appearances in all competitions, scoring five goals.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\n===2002\u20132004: Internazionale===\nIn the summer of 2002, Cannavaro joined Internazionale for a reported [[Euro|\u20ac]]23&nbsp;million, on a four-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=29672.html|title=Inter complete Cannavaro swoop|website=UEFA.com|date=7 August 2002|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> At the time, Parma were in financial difficulty, while Inter had just lost a Serie A title in dramatic circumstances to Juventus and were in the process of rebuilding following four barren years and the departure of star striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]. Along with [[Francesco Coco]] and his former Parma teammate [[Hern\u00e1n Crespo]], Cannavaro was supposed to be one of the faces of a new-look Inter led by manager [[H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper]].<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nHowever, during Cannavaro's spell with the club, Inter mostly flattered to deceive. His stint with the club began promisingly, as Inter reached the semi-finals of the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League|2002\u201303 Champions League]] and also finished runners-up in [[2002\u201303 Serie A|Serie A]] to Juventus in his first season with the club. However, his [[2003\u201304 Serie A|second season]] was not as productive, and he missed a large chunk of it through injury. He was also often played out of position. Inter finished fourth in Serie A and reached the semi-finals of the [[2003\u201304 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], losing out to Juventus on penalties. Inter finished third in their [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|Champions League group]], but would go on to reach the quarter-finals of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]]. After two years with the club, he was sold to Juventus in a surprising part-exchange deal, after just over 50 appearances and two goals. After he left Italy, Cannavaro often spoke negatively of his spell at Inter, comparing the club unfavourably with his other Italian clubs, Parma and Juventus.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\n===2004\u20132006: Juventus and ''Calciopoli''===\nAfter a two-year stint with Inter, Cannavaro signed for Juventus on the summer transfer window deadline day.

Juventus went on to win two consecutive ''[[Scudetto|Scudetti]]'' in [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2005]] and [[2005\u201306 Serie A|2006]], although they suffered consecutive quarter final eliminations in the Champions League. In the former season, he was also paired with club icons [[Paolo Montero]] and Ciro Ferrara. Cannavaro also won four ''[[Oscar del Calcio]]'' awards, the Italian Football Oscars, for his exceptional seasons with the Turin giants, winning the 2005 defender of the year, the 2006 defender of the year award, the 2006 Italian player of the year and the 2006 player of the year.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nAfter the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], the ''[[2006 Italian football scandal|Calciopoli]]'' trial verdicts relegated Juventus to [[Serie B]]. Since Juventus were ineligible to qualify for the Champions League, Cannavaro decided to leave. \"Even if I know this may be hard to believe, I would have stayed at Juventus had they remained in Serie A \u2013 even with a 30-point deduction.\" He followed Juve manager [[Fabio Capello]] to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the summer of 2006. In his two-year ''Scudetto''-winning stint with Juventus, Cannavaro made over 100 total appearances in all competitions.

On 19 May 2009, it was confirmed Cannavaro would return to Juventus for the [[2009\u201310 Serie A|2009\u201310 season]] at the conclusion of his contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11827_5336459,00.html |title=Juve confirm Cannavaro deal |publisher=Sky Sports |date=19 May 2009|accessdate=7 June 2010}}</ref> On his final match at the [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]], he was given a standing ovation by the fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttosport.com/calcio/serie_a/juventus/2009/05/24-28536/Il+Bernabeu+in+piedi+per+salutare+Cannavaro|title=Il Bernabeu in piedi per salutare Cannavaro|publisher=Tutto Sport|language=Italian|date=24 May 2009|access-date=23 July 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808172407/http://www.tuttosport.com/calcio/serie_a/juventus/2009/05/24-28536/Il+Bernabeu+in+piedi+per+salutare+Cannavaro|archive-date=8 August 2014}}</ref> In April 2013, Cannavaro was named by ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'' as a member of the \"Best foreign eleven in [[History of Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid's history]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2013/04/11/en/football/real_madrid/1365709938.html|title=The best foreign eleven in Real Madrid's history|publisher=Marca.com|date=11 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2009\u20132010: Return to Juventus===\nThree years after Cannavaro left Juventus, and following the end of his contract with Real Madrid, in the summer of 2009 he decided to return to the club. Cannavaro started the new season very well, forming good defensive partnerships with [[Nicola Legrottaglie]], [[Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres]], [[Zden\u011bk Grygera]], [[Fabio Grosso]] and most notably [[Giorgio Chiellini]], in front of goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. However, from Autumn onwards, Juventus' form took a turn for the worse. Having been injured for a while in late 2009, Cannavaro struggled with his own form both on his comeback and subsequently, and Juventus were knocked out of the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], finishing third in their group.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nIn March 2010, Cannavaro's relationship with the Juventus supporters, already fragile due to a perceived betrayal of the club when he left for Real Madrid, reached an all-time low. In a [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] tie against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], Juventus, who had won the first leg 3\u20131 at home, were leading 1\u20130 at [[Craven Cottage]] in London. Early in the first half, Cannavaro accumulated two bookings for reckless challenges and was sent off. Reduced to ten men, Juventus collapsed to a 4\u20131 loss and were eliminated on aggregate. Cannavaro enraged supporters with the sending-off and its consequent role in the team's elimination. Juventus were also eliminated in the quarter-finals of the [[2009\u201310 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] to eventual champions and treble winners Internazionale.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nThe club finished the [[2009\u201310 Serie A|league season]] in seventh place, with only a [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] spot, its worst Serie A finish for a decade. Juventus subsequently confirmed Cannavaro's contract would not be renewed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2010/05/24/1940254/world-cup-2010-italy-juventus-defender-fabio-cannavaro-i |title=Italy & Juventus Defender Fabio Cannavaro: I Want Napoli, But They Don't Want Me |work=Goal.com |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2010}}</ref> His performances had become unreliable, so much so that his hometown club Napoli made no attempt to sign him, despite Cannavaro expressing his wish to rejoin the club on more than one occasion.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\n===2010\u20132011: Al-Ahli===\nOn 2 June 2010, it was announced Cannavaro would move to [[UAE Arabian Gulf League|UAE League]] side [[Al-Ahli Dubai|Al-Ahli]] on a free transfer after the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].

He subsequently played for his country in the 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010 [[FIFA World Cup]]s, as well as in the 2000 and 2004 [[UEFA European Championship]]s.<ref name=\"Nazionale in cifre: Cannavaro, Fabio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=1145&squadra=1|title=Nazionale in cifre: Cannavaro, Fabio|website=figc.it|publisher=FIGC|language=Italian|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Early senior career and 1998 World Cup===\nCannavaro made his debut with the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] on 22 January 1997, in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] match against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].<ref name=\"treccani.it\"/> The same year, he earned plaudits for his handling of England striker [[Alan Shearer]] in a World Cup qualifying game at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref name=\"treccani.it\"/> Shearer was then considered by the partisan English crowd to be the best striker in the world, and thought he would make fun of the inexperienced Italian defender. Nevertheless, in a display ranking alongside those of the very best Italian defenders [[Claudio Gentile]] and [[Franco Baresi]], Cannavaro managed to keep Shearer quiet for the whole game. Italy won the game 1\u20130 courtesy of a [[Gianfranco Zola]] goal.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"treccani.it\"/><ref name=\"Nazionale in cifre: Cannavaro, Fabio\"/>\n\nCannavaro's first international tournament came at [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] alongside the experienced and capable [[Giuseppe Bergomi]], [[Alessandro Costacurta]] and Paolo Maldini, as well as the emerging Alessandro Nesta. The squad itself being coached by Paolo Maldini's father, Cesare Maldini. Cannavaro made several strong performances throughout the tournament, although Italy eventually went out in the quarter-finals to hosts and eventual champions France, in a match where Cannavaro suffered a cut to his forehead following an elbow by [[St\u00e9phane Guivarc'h]]. The ''Azzurri'' managed a 0\u20130 draw with the match eventually being decided by a penalty shoot-out in favour of the hosts.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/>\n\n===Euro 2000 Final, 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004===\nAt [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], under manager [[Dino Zoff]], Cannavaro had a strong tournament, playing as centre-back alongside either Alessandro Nesta, [[Mark Iuliano]] or Paolo Maldini in [[Formation (association football)#3\u20135\u20132|3\u20135\u20132 formation]]. The Italian defence only conceded two goals ''en route'' to the [[UEFA Euro 2000 Final|final]]: one against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], and one against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], both in the group stage, keeping three clean sheets in total. The ''Azzurri'' reached the final after defeating the Netherlands on penalties following a goalless draw in regulation time. Italy led the then world champions France 1\u20130 going into injury time. However, [[Sylvain Wiltord]] equalised in the final minute of injury time, and an extra-time [[golden goal]] from [[David Trezeguet]] gave France the title. Cannavaro was elected as part of the Team of the Tournament for his performances.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/>\n\nAt the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], under manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], Cannavaro was credited with holding the defence together almost single-handedly after his usual defensive partner Alessandro Nesta was injured against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. This injury, alongside several errors by match officials, dealt a severe blow to Italy's chances of winning the World Cup; the side having relied heavily on the Cannavaro\u2013Nesta partnership in central defence. [[Marco Materazzi]], who deputised for Nesta, put in performances that were below his usual standards. Cannavaro picked up two yellow card during the group stage and was suspended for the round of 16 match, meaning Italy would be left without their two starting centre-backs.<ref name=\"The tragic tale of Byron Moreno\">{{cite web|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/world-cup/the-tragic-tale-of-byron-moreno-the-worst-referee-ever/article19110587/?ref=https://www.theglobeandmail.com&|title=The tragic tale of Byron Moreno, \"the worst referee, ever\"|work=The Globe and Mail|author1=John Doyle|date=10 June 2014|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"25 stunning moments\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/01/world-cup-25-stunning-moments-italy-south-korea|title=World Cup: 25 stunning moments \u2026 No21: Italy lose to South Korea in 2002|work=The Guardian|author1=Paolo Bandini|date=1 June 2014|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> Italy went out controversially in the second round, losing to co-hosts and eventual semi-finalists [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], once again to a golden goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wldcup.com/euro/2004/players_present/393_fabio_cannavaro.html |title=Cannavaro profile |work=Wldcup.com |access-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607115224/http://www.wldcup.com/euro/2004/players_present/393_fabio_cannavaro.html |archive-date=7 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/italia-corea-2002-complotto.html|title=Italia, Corea e Byron Moreno: COMPLOTTO?|trans-title=Italy, Korea and Byron Moreno: CONSPIRACY?|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=Italian|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nCannavaro had a difficult act to follow when he took over as captain from Paolo Maldini after the 2002 World Cup, but he quickly won the team over with his leadership, calming influence and inspirational performances, helping Italy qualify for Euro 2004.<ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/> After Maldini's international retirement, he first captained Italy in a 1\u20130 defeat to [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in [[Trieste]] on 21 August 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11860/2243526/montella-out-of-italian-game-cannavaro-captaincy|title=Montella out of Italian game \u2013 Cannavaro captaincy|publisher=Sky Sports|author1=Graeme Bailey|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/calciomercato2002/trieste/trieste/trieste.html|title=Guerriglia e botte in campo L'Italia \u00e8 ancora piccola|trans-title=Guerilla and punches on the pitch Italy is still weak|work=La Repubblica|language=Italian|date=21 August 2002|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref> He was later officially named Italy's captain for an away [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match]] against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] on 7 September, which Italy won 2\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2002/settembre/08/Italia_vince_senza_riuscire_divertire_co_0_0209085818.shtml|title=L' Italia vince senza riuscire a divertire|trans-title=Italy wins without being able to entertain|language=Italian|author1=Fabio Monti|author2=Giancarlo Padovan|date=8 September 2002|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2004/matches/round=1579/match=69255/postmatch/lineups/index.html|title=Azerbaijan vs. Italy (0-2)|publisher=UEFA|date=7 September 2002|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref> In Italy's qualifier against [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] in Naples, on 12 October, he received a standing ovation on the pitch where he wore the local side's colours, as Italy drew 1\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2004/matches/round=1579/match=69257/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Del Piero denies Yugoslavia|publisher=UEFA|date=13 October 2002|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nCannavaro scored his first international goal on 30 May 2004, in a 4\u20130 win against [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], in Tunis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/e/sezioni/sport/calcio/nazionale/tunita/tunita/tunita.html|title=I debuttanti del gol fanno bella l'Italia|work=La Repubblica|language=Italian|date=30 May 2004|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref> [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], which was hosted by Portugal, turned out to be a disappointment.

He spent the majority of his career in Italy. He started his career at [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] before spending seven years at [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]], with whom he won two [[Coppa Italia]] titles, the [[1999 Supercoppa Italiana]], and the [[1999 UEFA Cup Final|1999]] [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. After spells at [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], he transferred (along with manager [[Fabio Capello]]) from Juventus to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 2006, with whom he won consecutive [[La Liga]] titles in 2007 and 2008. After returning to Juventus for one season in 2009\u201310, he joined [[Al-Ahli Dubai|Al-Ahli]] in [[Dubai]], where he retired from football in 2011 after an injury-troubled season.\n\nCannavaro has also achieved success with the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]]. He was part of the Italy team which won consecutive [[UEFA European Under-21 Championship]]s in 1994 and 1996. After earning his first senior [[Cap (sport)|cap]] in 1997, he helped his national team to the final of [[UEFA Euro 2000 Final|UEFA Euro 2000]], being named in the team of the tournament, and became [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in 2002, following [[Paolo Maldini]]'s retirement. Cannavaro led Italy to victory in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, and was given the nickname ''\"Il Muro di Berlino\"'' (\"The Berlin Wall\") by the Italian supporters due to his defensive performances, which saw Italy keep five clean sheets and concede only two goals, neither of which were in open play. He was awarded the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Silver Ball]] after being named the tournament's second-best player. In 2009, Cannavaro overtook Maldini as the most capped player in the country's history. He retired from international football on 25 June 2010 following Italy's failure to qualify for the knockout stages of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], having amassed 136 caps and 2 goals for the senior national team.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/world-cup-2010/story/0,27032,12098_6228121,00.html |title=Cannavaro quits Italy duty |work=[[Sky Sports]] |date=25 June 2010 |access-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628010011/http://www.skysports.com/football/world-cup-2010/story/0,27032,12098_6228121,00.html |archive-date=28 June 2010}}</ref> In total, he has represented Italy at four [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s, two [[UEFA European Championship]]s, the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. He is currently Italy's [[Italy national football team records#Appearances|second all-time appearance holder]], behind [[Gianluigi Buffon]].\n\nCannavaro was named the 2006 [[FIFA World Player of the Year]], and won the [[Ballon d'Or]] award in [[2006 Ballon d'Or|2006]] which made him the only defender to win the award in a decade and only the third of all time after [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Matthias Sammer]].<ref>[http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/cannavaro-discusses-highs-and-lows/66691 \"Cannavaro discusses highs and lows\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216084627/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/cannavaro-discusses-highs-and-lows/66691 |date=16 December 2013 }}.

In November 2014, he was appointed as head coach of Chinese club [[Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C.|Guangzhou Evergrande]]. On 9 June 2016, he signed a contract with second-tier Chinese club [[Tianjin Quanjian F.C.|Tianjin Quanjian]] as manager where he led the team to the [[China League One|league title]].

Napoli|Napoli]], his hometown and favourite childhood team. Cannavaro initially served as the club's [[ball boy]] and would often watch his idols [[Diego Maradona]] and [[Ciro Ferrara]] play. He later joined the club's youth team, initially playing as a [[midfielder]] like his idol [[Marco Tardelli]], before the team's youth coach switched him to the role of centre-back.<ref name=\"story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/10785902/fabio-cannavaro-tells-his-story-from-ball-boy-to-ballon-dor-winner|title=Fabio Cannavaro tells his story: From ball boy to Ballon d'Or winner|publisher=Sky Sports|date=1 March 2017|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref> He gained a reputation when, in a training session at Napoli, the young Fabio produced a strong sliding challenge on Maradona, who was then the undisputed star of the club, to dispossess him. The rough challenge angered teammates and staff at Napoli. However, Maradona himself defended the promising player and encouraged him to play the way he wanted, and reportedly congratulated by Cannavaro by giving him his boots as a souvenir after the training session.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/><ref name=\"story\"/><ref name=\"urchin\"/><ref name=\"Pallone d'Oro a Cannavaro\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Sport/2006/11/md271106profilo_cannavaro_PRN.shtml|title=Pallone d'Oro a Cannavaro: \"Lo dedico ai ragazzi di Napoli\"|publisher=Il Sole 24 Ore|author1=Massimo Donaddio|language=Italian|date=27 November 2006|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nCannavaro's progress as a player was such that he soon became a member of the first team alongside some of his childhood idols.

Cannavaro remained at Napoli until 1995, earning nearly 60 total appearances with the club, scoring one goal.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\n===1995\u20132002: Parma===\nCannavaro was sold to Parma in the summer of 1995 and in his first season, he was instantly a regular in the first team, scoring once in 29 appearances in the league. He would go on not only to win trophies with the club, but also achieve several personal accomplishments, being named the team's captain. It was also in Parma that he met [[Gianluigi Buffon]] and [[Lilian Thuram]], who would not only form one of the tightest defensive units of Europe with Cannavaro, but would also become some of his closest friends in football. Further players featuring in this legendary Parma backline were [[Luigi Sartor]], [[Roberto Mussi]], [[Antonio Benarrivo]], [[Luigi Apolloni]] and the Argentine [[N\u00e9stor Sensini]]. Cannavaro began to obtain success during his time at Parma. During his first season, Parma were eliminated in the second round of the [[1995\u201396 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], but finished in sixth place in [[1995\u201396 Serie A|Serie A]] that season, qualifying for the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]]. Parma also reached the quarter-finals of the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|1995\u201396]] [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] that season. Parma finished the [[1996\u201397 Serie A|1996\u201397 Serie A season]] as runners-up to Serie A champions Juventus, allowing them to qualify for the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] the following season. Parma were once again eliminated in the second round of the [[1996\u201397 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and in the first round of the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] that season. In the [[1997\u201398 Serie A|1997\u201398 season]], Parma finished in fifth place in Serie A and reached the [[1997\u201398 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] semi-finals, whilst they were knocked out in the group stage of the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], finishing second in their group to defending champions [[Borussia Dortmund]].<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nIn his [[1998\u201399 Serie A|fourth season]] with the club, Cannavaro won his only European trophy, the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], as well as winning the [[1998\u201399 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]]. Parma finished the Serie A season in fourth place, one point from [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in the third place spot. In the [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|following season]], Fabio's brother Paolo Cannavaro joined the team, and the two Cannavaro brothers were able to play alongside each other for the next two seasons. Fabio won his first [[Supercoppa Italiana]] title against Serie A champions Milan and Parma finished the Serie A season in fourth place, tied with [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] for the final remaining Champions League spot. However, Parma lost 3\u20131 to Inter in the Serie A Champions League playoff match, failing to qualify for the Champions League group stage. They started in the third and final qualifying round of the Champions League and were eliminated by [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. They were knocked out in the round of 16 of both the [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] and the [[1999\u20132000 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] that season.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nIn the [[2000\u201301 Serie A|2000\u201301 season]], Cannavaro aided in leading Parma to another [[2000\u201301 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia Final]], in which they were defeated by Fiorentina. They were eliminated in the third round of the [[2000\u201301 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] that season. Parma also finished the season in fourth place for the third consecutive season, which allowed them to go through to the [[2001\u201302 UEFA Champions League|Champions League qualifying round]], although Parma were ultimately unable to qualify. In his final season with Parma, Cannavaro managed to win his second [[2001\u201302 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] title, over Juventus, whilst Parma were eliminated in the round of 16 of the [[2001\u201302 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], and finished the [[2001\u201302 Serie A|Serie A season]] in tenth place. As from 1997, he began to earn call-ups to the national team's senior squad due to his performances for Parma, and he was consistently one of the best defenders in Serie A. In his time with Parma, Cannavaro made over 250 appearances in all competitions, scoring five goals.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\n===2002\u20132004: Internazionale===\nIn the summer of 2002, Cannavaro joined Internazionale for a reported [[Euro|\u20ac]]23&nbsp;million, on a four-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=29672.html|title=Inter complete Cannavaro swoop|website=UEFA.com|date=7 August 2002|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> At the time, Parma were in financial difficulty, while Inter had just lost a Serie A title in dramatic circumstances to Juventus and were in the process of rebuilding following four barren years and the departure of star striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]. Along with [[Francesco Coco]] and his former Parma teammate [[Hern\u00e1n Crespo]], Cannavaro was supposed to be one of the faces of a new-look Inter led by manager [[H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper]].<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nHowever, during Cannavaro's spell with the club, Inter mostly flattered to deceive. His stint with the club began promisingly, as Inter reached the semi-finals of the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League|2002\u201303 Champions League]] and also finished runners-up in [[2002\u201303 Serie A|Serie A]] to Juventus in his first season with the club. However, his [[2003\u201304 Serie A|second season]] was not as productive, and he missed a large chunk of it through injury. He was also often played out of position. Inter finished fourth in Serie A and reached the semi-finals of the [[2003\u201304 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], losing out to Juventus on penalties. Inter finished third in their [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|Champions League group]], but would go on to reach the quarter-finals of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]]. After two years with the club, he was sold to Juventus in a surprising part-exchange deal, after just over 50 appearances and two goals. After he left Italy, Cannavaro often spoke negatively of his spell at Inter, comparing the club unfavourably with his other Italian clubs, Parma and Juventus.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\n===2004\u20132006: Juventus and ''Calciopoli''===\nAfter a two-year stint with Inter, Cannavaro signed for Juventus on the summer transfer window deadline day. The deal also involved the exchange of reserve goalkeeper [[Fabian Carini]], who left for Inter, both players priced \u20ac10&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.juventus.com/site/filesite/finance/comunicatipricesensitive/31_ago_2004_eng_can.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207070045/http://www.juventus.com/site/filesite/finance/comunicatipricesensitive/31_ago_2004_eng_can.pdf|title=Operations concerning players' registration rights|publisher=Juventus Football Club|date=31 August 2004|archive-date=7 December 2008|publication-place=Turin|url-status=dead}}</ref> By moving to Turin, he reunited with his ex-Parma teammates Lilian Thuram and Gianluigi Buffon, and together the threesome formed one of the most feared defences in the Serie A, alongside the likes of [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], [[Gianluca Pessotto]], [[Alessandro Birindelli]], [[Jonathan Zebina]] and [[Federico Balzaretti]]. Juventus went on to win two consecutive ''[[Scudetto|Scudetti]]'' in [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2005]] and [[2005\u201306 Serie A|2006]], although they suffered consecutive quarter final eliminations in the Champions League. In the former season, he was also paired with club icons [[Paolo Montero]] and Ciro Ferrara. Cannavaro also won four ''[[Oscar del Calcio]]'' awards, the Italian Football Oscars, for his exceptional seasons with the Turin giants, winning the 2005 defender of the year, the 2006 defender of the year award, the 2006 Italian player of the year and the 2006 player of the year.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nAfter the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], the ''[[2006 Italian football scandal|Calciopoli]]'' trial verdicts relegated Juventus to [[Serie B]].

Cannavaro started the new season very well, forming good defensive partnerships with [[Nicola Legrottaglie]], [[Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres]], [[Zden\u011bk Grygera]], [[Fabio Grosso]] and most notably [[Giorgio Chiellini]], in front of goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. However, from Autumn onwards, Juventus' form took a turn for the worse. Having been injured for a while in late 2009, Cannavaro struggled with his own form both on his comeback and subsequently, and Juventus were knocked out of the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], finishing third in their group.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nIn March 2010, Cannavaro's relationship with the Juventus supporters, already fragile due to a perceived betrayal of the club when he left for Real Madrid, reached an all-time low. In a [[2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]] tie against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], Juventus, who had won the first leg 3\u20131 at home, were leading 1\u20130 at [[Craven Cottage]] in London. Early in the first half, Cannavaro accumulated two bookings for reckless challenges and was sent off. Reduced to ten men, Juventus collapsed to a 4\u20131 loss and were eliminated on aggregate. Cannavaro enraged supporters with the sending-off and its consequent role in the team's elimination. Juventus were also eliminated in the quarter-finals of the [[2009\u201310 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] to eventual champions and treble winners Internazionale.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/><ref name=\"tuttojuve.com\"/>\n\nThe club finished the [[2009\u201310 Serie A|league season]] in seventh place, with only a [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] spot, its worst Serie A finish for a decade.

He subsequently played for his country in the 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010 [[FIFA World Cup]]s, as well as in the 2000 and 2004 [[UEFA European Championship]]s.<ref name=\"Nazionale in cifre: Cannavaro, Fabio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=1145&squadra=1|title=Nazionale in cifre: Cannavaro, Fabio|website=figc.it|publisher=FIGC|language=Italian|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Early senior career and 1998 World Cup===\nCannavaro made his debut with the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] on 22 January 1997, in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] match against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].<ref name=\"treccani.it\"/> The same year, he earned plaudits for his handling of England striker [[Alan Shearer]] in a World Cup qualifying game at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref name=\"treccani.it\"/> Shearer was then considered by the partisan English crowd to be the best striker in the world, and thought he would make fun of the inexperienced Italian defender. Nevertheless, in a display ranking alongside those of the very best Italian defenders [[Claudio Gentile]] and [[Franco Baresi]], Cannavaro managed to keep Shearer quiet for the whole game. Italy won the game 1\u20130 courtesy of a [[Gianfranco Zola]] goal.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/><ref name=\"treccani.it\"/><ref name=\"Nazionale in cifre: Cannavaro, Fabio\"/>\n\nCannavaro's first international tournament came at [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] alongside the experienced and capable [[Giuseppe Bergomi]], [[Alessandro Costacurta]] and Paolo Maldini, as well as the emerging Alessandro Nesta. The squad itself being coached by Paolo Maldini's father, Cesare Maldini. Cannavaro made several strong performances throughout the tournament, although Italy eventually went out in the quarter-finals to hosts and eventual champions France, in a match where Cannavaro suffered a cut to his forehead following an elbow by [[St\u00e9phane Guivarc'h]]. The ''Azzurri'' managed a 0\u20130 draw with the match eventually being decided by a penalty shoot-out in favour of the hosts.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/>\n\n===Euro 2000 Final, 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004===\nAt [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], under manager [[Dino Zoff]], Cannavaro had a strong tournament, playing as centre-back alongside either Alessandro Nesta, [[Mark Iuliano]] or Paolo Maldini in [[Formation (association football)#3\u20135\u20132|3\u20135\u20132 formation]]. The Italian defence only conceded two goals ''en route'' to the [[UEFA Euro 2000 Final|final]]: one against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], and one against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], both in the group stage, keeping three clean sheets in total. The ''Azzurri'' reached the final after defeating the Netherlands on penalties following a goalless draw in regulation time. Italy led the then world champions France 1\u20130 going into injury time. However, [[Sylvain Wiltord]] equalised in the final minute of injury time, and an extra-time [[golden goal]] from [[David Trezeguet]] gave France the title. Cannavaro was elected as part of the Team of the Tournament for his performances.<ref name=\"Storie di Calcio: Fabio Cannavaro\"/>\n\nAt the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], under manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], Cannavaro was credited with holding the defence together almost single-handedly after his usual defensive partner Alessandro Nesta was injured against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. This injury, alongside several errors by match officials, dealt a severe blow to Italy's chances of winning the World Cup; the side having relied heavily on the Cannavaro\u2013Nesta partnership in central defence. [[Marco Materazzi]], who deputised for Nesta, put in performances that were below his usual standards. Cannavaro picked up two yellow card during the group stage and was suspended for the round of 16 match, meaning Italy would be left without their two starting centre-backs.<ref name=\"The tragic tale of Byron Moreno\">{{cite web|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/world-cup/the-tragic-tale-of-byron-moreno-the-worst-referee-ever/article19110587/?ref=https://www.theglobeandmail.com&|title=The tragic tale of Byron Moreno, \"the worst referee, ever\"|work=The Globe and Mail|author1=John Doyle|date=10 June 2014|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"25 stunning moments\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/01/world-cup-25-stunning-moments-italy-south-korea|title=World Cup: 25 stunning moments \u2026 No21: Italy lose to South Korea in 2002|work=The Guardian|author1=Paolo Bandini|date=1 June 2014|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> Italy went out controversially in the second round, losing to co-hosts and eventual semi-finalists [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], once again to a golden goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wldcup.com/euro/2004/players_present/393_fabio_cannavaro.html |title=Cannavaro profile |work=Wldcup.com |access-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607115224/http://www.wldcup.com/euro/2004/players_present/393_fabio_cannavaro.html |archive-date=7 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/italia-corea-2002-complotto.html|title=Italia, Corea e Byron Moreno: COMPLOTTO?|trans-title=Italy, Korea and Byron Moreno: CONSPIRACY?|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=Italian|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nCannavaro had a difficult act to follow when he took over as captain from Paolo Maldini after the 2002 World Cup, but he quickly won the team over with his leadership, calming influence and inspirational performances, helping Italy qualify for Euro 2004.<ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Fabio CANNAVARO\"/> After Maldini's international retirement, he first captained Italy in a 1\u20130 defeat to [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in [[Trieste]] on 21 August 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11860/2243526/montella-out-of-italian-game-cannavaro-captaincy|title=Montella out of Italian game \u2013 Cannavaro captaincy|publisher=Sky Sports|author1=Graeme Bailey|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/calciomercato2002/trieste/trieste/trieste.html|title=Guerriglia e botte in campo L'Italia \u00e8 ancora piccola|trans-title=Guerilla and punches on the pitch Italy is still weak|work=La Repubblica|language=Italian|date=21 August 2002|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref> He was later officially named Italy's captain for an away [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match]] against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] on 7 September, which Italy won 2\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2002/settembre/08/Italia_vince_senza_riuscire_divertire_co_0_0209085818.shtml|title=L' Italia vince senza riuscire a divertire|trans-title=Italy wins without being able to entertain|language=Italian|author1=Fabio Monti|author2=Giancarlo Padovan|date=8 September 2002|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2004/matches/round=1579/match=69255/postmatch/lineups/index.html|title=Azerbaijan vs. Italy (0-2)|publisher=UEFA|date=7 September 2002|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref> In Italy's qualifier against [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] in Naples, on 12 October, he received a standing ovation on the pitch where he wore the local side's colours, as Italy drew 1\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2004/matches/round=1579/match=69257/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Del Piero denies Yugoslavia|publisher=UEFA|date=13 October 2002|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nCannavaro scored his first international goal on 30 May 2004, in a 4\u20130 win against [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], in Tunis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/e/sezioni/sport/calcio/nazionale/tunita/tunita/tunita.html|title=I debuttanti del gol fanno bella l'Italia|work=La Repubblica|language=Italian|date=30 May 2004|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref> [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], which was hosted by Portugal, turned out to be a disappointment.

Hyperforin is a constituent of Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort) Hyperforin is a phytochemical produced by some of the members of the plant genus Hypericum, notably Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort). The structure of hyperforin was elucidated by a research group from the Shemyakin Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry (USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow) and published in 1975. Hyperforin is a prenylated phloroglucinol derivative. Total synthesis of hyperforin has not yet been accomplished, despite attempts by several research groups. Hyperforin has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antibiotic and anti-depressant functions ({{PMID|17696442}}, 21751836, 12725578, 12018529 )<br />1.

Their traditions\u2014especially [[dairy product|dairy]] consumption during Christian fasts\u2014did not conform to those of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and they were regarded as heretics (''sektanty''). The term ''Molokan'' is an [[exonym]] used by their [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] neighbors; they tend to identify themselves as '''Spiritual Christians''' (\u0434\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0445\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0435 : ''dukhovnye khristiane'').\n\nThere are almost as many different ways among Molokans as there are Molokans. Some built chapels for worship, kept sacraments, and revered saints and icons, while others (like [[Ikonobortsy]], \"icon-wrestlers\") discarded these practices in the pursuit of [[Sola scriptura|individual approaches to scripture]]. In general, they rejected the institutionalized formalism of Orthodoxy and denominations with similar doctrines in favor of more emphasis on [[Origins of Christianity|\"Original Christianity\"]] as spoken by Jesus Christ in the New Testament: \"But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.\u201d\nJohn\u202c \u202d4:23\u202c \u202dESV\u202c\u202c\nhttps://www.bible.com/59/jhn.4.23.esv They emphasized [[spirituality]] and spiritual practice; such sacramental and ritual practices have been permitted only as tangible examples and symbols of more important spiritual truths.\nSimilar to [[Presbyterian]]s among Protestants, and considered heretical by the Orthodox Church, they elect a [[Presbyterian polity|council]] of dominant [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]] who preserve a sort of [[apostolic succession]]. Molokans had some practices similar to the European [[Quakers]] and [[Mennonites]], such as [[pacifism]], communal organization, spiritual meetings, and sub-groupings. But they arose in Russia together with the [[Doukhobors]] and Sabbatarians (also known as [[Subbotniks]]) and similar Spiritual Christian movements of [[Duhovnye Kristyanye]] and Ikonobortsy. They migrated into central Russia and Ukraine around the same time.\n\n==Formation and development==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2015}}\n\n===11th to 14th centuries===\nThere are approximately 200 [[fasting]] days \u2014especially the [[Great Fast]] (Lent)\u2014 when drinking milk was prohibited by Orthodox ecclesiastical authorities.   Milk-drinking practice during these fasts was first sanctioned by the [[Nestorian Church]] in the 11th century in order to accommodate the conversion of some 200,000 Turkic Christians, who lived on meat and milk, to Nestorian Christianity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borbone|first=Pier Giorgio |url=https://pisa.academia.edu/PierGiorgioBorbone/Papers/537579/Some_Aspects_of_Turco-Mongol_Christianity_in_the_Light_of_Literary_and_Epigraphic_Syriac_Sources |title=Some Aspects of Turco-Mongol Christianity in the Light of Literary and Epigraphic Syriac Sources (Pier Giorgio Borbone) - Academia.edu |publisher=Pisa.academia.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}</ref> Arriving in [[All-Russian nation#Background|the Rus' lands]] with the 13th century Tatar invasion<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor = 4202032|title = The Great Tartar Invasion of Europe|journal = The Slavonic Review|volume = 5|issue = 13|pages = 89\u2013105|last1 = Cheshire|first1 = Harold T|year = 1926}}</ref> of [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]], the practice was adopted by other Christians, who had pastoral communities on the Eurasian plains.\n\n===15th to 16th centuries===\nThe [[Judaizers]] preceded the modern day Molokans. Although they are sometimes also called \"Molokans\", they constitute an independent movement. Their leader [[Matvei Dalmatov|Matvei Simyonich Dalmatov (\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0414\u0430\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432)]] became a martyr in a monastery prison by [[breaking wheel|wheeling]].\n\n===17th to 18th centuries===\nThe first recorded use of the term \"Molokan\" appears in the 1670s, in reference to the people who had the practice of drinking milk on the 200 fasting days stipulated by the Orthodox Church. (''Moloko'' means \"milk\" in Russian). Nonetheless, these were \"Spiritual Christians\" not directly related to the group later known as \"Molokans\". \n\nThe \"Molokans\" that are known today by that name split in 1779/80 from the [[Doukhobors]] because they thought that the Doukhobors neglected the Bible in their belief that God had placed the Word directly into their hearts. The Molokans, however, held the written Bible into the highest regard. The founder of the Molokans, [[ Simyon Matveiovich Uklein]] (1733-1809), was a son-in-law of the Doukhobor leader [[Ilarion Poberokhin]] (1720-1792) as explained by O. Beznosova (\"The Perception in the Religious Space\", 2016): \"Soon (approximately in 1779-1780) a group broke away from Pobirohin's disciples.It was led by his son in law Simeon Uklein who did not share the mystical spirit and self-deification of the former leader and defended the need for reliance on the Gospel texts in the organization of church life (Margaritov, 1914). This group (called \"Molokans\") became a \"rational\" direction of. Spiritual Christianity, as opposed to the \"mystics\" - \"christoverchestvo\" adherents, \"Doukhobors\" and \"[[skoptsy]]\".\" (p. 322) \n\nUklein's Molokans from Tambov energetically proselytized in settlements along the [[Volga River]] and Russia's south-eastern frontier, spreading the Molokan faith in [[Orenburg]], [[Saratov]] and [[Astrakhan]] provinces and organizing congregations until his death in 1809.\n\n===19th to 20th centuries===\nFrom the intervention of Count [[Nikolay Alexandrovich Zubov|Nikolay Zubov]] in 1795, Molokans (\u0431\u0435\u0441\u0448\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438) were tolerated under Tsarina Catherine but constrained by strict rules imposed upon them intended to curb community growth.<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/gersub.shtml]</ref> Those who ignored the restrictions were punished in [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] as [[Christian heresy|heretics]].<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/herm.shtml]</ref> Molokan evangelists and missionaries suffered imprisonment, banishment and other forms of punishment. Prohibited from winning converts,<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/problems.shtml]</ref> the Molokans were forced into [[endogamy]]. The government's policy was to send the Molokans away from the center of Russia into the Caucasus (1833), and other outlying areas to prevent their having influence on other peasants; they were sent to [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] (1834), [[Ukraine]] (1830s), central [[Asia]], and [[Siberia]], where many communities have survived into the present.\nIt is said that, in 1900, despite the persecution there could have been about a half-million Spiritual Christians in the Russia empire. These figures appear, however, to be vastly exaggerated. In 1912, there were only 133,935 ''Molokane'' and 4,844 ''Pryguny'' counted in Russia (census of the Department of Spiritual Affairs; see [[Glenn Dynner]]: \"Holy Dissent: Jewish and Christian Mystics in Eastern Europe\", 2011).\nFewer than one thousand ''Molokane'' fled Russia in the early 1900s (mostly 1905-1912), many of whom settled near other non-Orthodox immigrants from Russia in an ethnic [[enclave]] on and near [[Potrero Hill]], [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], where they built a prayer hall in 1929. A second prayer hall was established near [[Sheridan, Placer County, California|Sheridan, California]] to serve those scattered in Northern California. There was never a \"Molokan Church\" in Southern California.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Conovaloff|first1=Andrei|url=http://www.molokane.org/taxonomy/|title=Taxonomy of 3 Spiritual Christian groups: Molokane, Pryguny and Dukh-i-zhizniki \u2014 books, fellowship, holidays, prophets and songs.|publisher=Molokane.org}}</ref> Though some Spiritual Christian faith groups fled Russia in the early 1900s to avoid the military draft, all eligible ''Molokan'' boys registered for the [[Selective Service Act of 1917]], but were disqualified as aliens who did not speak English.

By original ''Molokans'' who either refused to be evangelized by Protestant denominations or insisted that they will retain their faith unchanged by the \"Spiritual Molokan Jumper & Skipper\" revivalist movement in the 1830s. They originally constituted the by far largest segment of Molokanism.\nIn 1833, a [[schism (religion)|schism]] took place within the Molokan faith.

Eugene|title=The Woman Clothed in the Sun: Pacifism and Apocalyptic Discourse among Russian Spiritual Christian Molokan Jumpers & Skippers}}</ref> The old Molokans were termed ''Constants'' (Postoyaniye), and the newly evolved \"Spiritual\" Molokans \"Jumpers\" (''Pryguny'') also called ''Skakuny'' (Skppers). The Molokan ''Jumpers'' believed they were visited by a manifestation of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:7), and this new smaller Molokan sect began a revival with intense zeal, reporting miracles that purportedly rivaled those of Christ's apostles. \n\n=== Seeds of exodus ===\nThe \"Constant\" Molokan sect condemned the new sect to authorities, resulting in betrayals and imprisonment for many of the \"Spiritual\" Molokan Jumpers & Skippers. Some of these \"Spiritual\" Molokans called themselves \"New Israelites\", when their leader [[Maxim Rudometkin]] in Nikitino, Erivan Guberniya  was announced to be the \"King of the Spirits\" in 1853. The group, also known as Maximists\", considered [[Efim Gerasimovic  Klubnikin]] (1842-1915) also in Nikitino, a divinely inspired 12-year-old boy prophet. He prophesied a \"coming time that would be unbearable and that the time to leave Russia was now.\" During the early 20th century under his leadership, about 2,000 ''Pryguny'' emigrated to the [[United States]], first settling on the east side of [[Los Angeles]]. Most seeking rural isolation moved to Baja Mexico, then Arizona, Central California, and some other parts of the West Coast and Canada. Other Jumpers received a land grant from the [[Mexican government]] and settled in the [[Guadalupe, Baja California|Guadalupe Valley]] in [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]].\n\nIn Los Angeles, a small number of the Molokan Jumpers joined the development of the American Revival called \"the [[Pentecostal]] [[Azusa Street Revival]].\" The founder of [[The Full Gospel Business Men's Association]] associates this [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian revival|Revival]] to a child prophet of the Molokan Jumpers, E.G. Klubnikin.\n\n=== Diaspora ===\n[[File: Glendale-The_first_Russian_Molokans_Church-1950.JPG|250px|thumb|The first''' Russian Molokans Church''' (Spiritual Christians) in Glendale, Arizona was built in 1950 and is located at 7402 Griffin Ave. It is listed as historical by the Glendale Arizona Historical Society.]]\nAbout 20,000 people identify as Molokans, at least ethnically, in the former Soviet Union.

The majority live in or near [[Los Angeles]], particularly in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles|Boyle Heights]], and [[Commerce, California|Commerce]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/14/local/me-22608 | title=Laid to Rest Among Their Ancestors| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=1998-09-14| last1=Martin| first1=Hugo}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s other Molokans settled in southern [[Alaska]] and [[Australia]]. Molokans are said to be numerous in [[Australia]]. The majority are in [[South Australia]], with a number of families in [[Western Australia]] and a small group residing in [[Queensland]]. Over 1,000 reside in Canada in the province of [[British Columbia]] and hundreds more in [[Alberta]], keeping their traditional communal lifestyle. A group of Molokan families are also living in [[South America]] in the country of [[Uruguay]].\n\nA small Molokan community was located in the eastern province of [[Kars]], [[Turkey]]. Most of the community returned to Russia years ago; in the 21st century only one family of Molokans is left in Kars.<ref>[http://www.todayszaman.com/national_molokan-community-still-exists-in-kars-despite-decreasing-number_285869.html], ''Today's Zaman''</ref>\n\n==Spiritual practices==\nMolokans adhere to Old Testament laws in the spirit of the Christian [[New Covenant]]. All sects refrain from eating pork, shellfish, or other \"unclean\" foods, as defined in the Bible. Molokans refer to the sabbath on Sunday. Some refuse to serve on juries or file lawsuits against fellow church members. Church services, led by a [[Lector]], are conducted predominantly in the Russian language, but also in [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavonic]], which was common to the Orthodox Church. Men and women sit apart, and services are usually quite active. They do not worship saints, and do not worship symbols or images, such as  icons or crosses. as the Molokans traditionally practice [[endogamy]] and marry within the faith.\n\n== Molokans in the United States ==\n\n=== Naming ===\nMolokans are known for having different spellings of last names within the same immediate family for a few reasons. 1. The names were horribly misspelled when they arrived in the United States, two they were terribly translated and others changed the spelling because they were afraid to be taken back. They also in several cases chose to go with American versions of their names. So \"Vasilli Bukroff\" becomes \"Bill\" or \"William Bukroff\" or \"Ivan Metchikoff\" will become \"John Mitchell\" and \"Dunya Tikunov\" will be \"Julie Tyler\".  They also sometimes use \"first names\" that are not their legal names and are based on nicknames from childhood within the church that stuck with people as adults. For example, \"Hazel Valov\" became known as \"Percy Valov\", for being very \"persistent\".  Another naming practice that can become confusing for those who are unfamiliar is those who settled in the Guadalupe Valley, Mexico.  Many settlers took on the Mexican versions of their names so Rodion Pavlov became \"Rodolfo Pabloff\" and when they had children they also adopted the Mexican format so you will see what would have been a Russian name like \"Ivan Pavilovich Pabloff\" (Ivan son of Pavil (Paul) (Pavlov), whose mother's maiden name is \"Samarin\" become \"Juan Pablo Pabloff de Samarin\" or \"Juan Samarin Pabloff\".  In all these instances, tracing family history can become very difficult \nOtherwise they adhere to the common naming practices. A lot can be learned from a Russian head stone which will commonly go back to use of the Russian naming practices regardless of what they used while alive. If translated correctly you should learn the names of the father and grandfather from a male's headstone. If it is displayed in English at the bottom it most likely will not contain the information.\n\n=== Legal issues ===\nOn June 8, 1917, the ''[[The Arizona Republic|Arizona Republican]]'' reported that the Molokan community in Glendale, Arizona, refused to register under the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|selective service act of 1917]]. The likely result would be the arrest of Molokan persons who refused to sign the order. Molokans claimed that their religious precepts forbade them from signing into such an agreement. The Russians had forced them into the military and that is why they fled Russia for the United States. The Molokans feared that history would repeat itself in America as it had in Russia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84020558/1917-06-08/ed-1/seq-8/|title=Arizona republican.

Their traditions\u2014especially [[dairy product|dairy]] consumption during Christian fasts\u2014did not conform to those of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and they were regarded as heretics (''sektanty''). The term ''Molokan'' is an [[exonym]] used by their [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] neighbors; they tend to identify themselves as '''Spiritual Christians''' (\u0434\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0445\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0435 : ''dukhovnye khristiane'').\n\nThere are almost as many different ways among Molokans as there are Molokans. Some built chapels for worship, kept sacraments, and revered saints and icons, while others (like [[Ikonobortsy]], \"icon-wrestlers\") discarded these practices in the pursuit of [[Sola scriptura|individual approaches to scripture]]. In general, they rejected the institutionalized formalism of Orthodoxy and denominations with similar doctrines in favor of more emphasis on [[Origins of Christianity|\"Original Christianity\"]] as written and spoken by Jesus Christ in the New Testameby: \"But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.\u201d\nJohn\u202c \u202d4:23\u202c \u202dESV\u202c\u202c\nhttps://www.bible.com/59/jhn.4.23.esv They emphasized [[spirituality]] and spiritual practice; such sacramental and ritual practices have been permitted only as tangible examples and symbols of more important spiritual truths.\nSimilar to [[Presbyterian]]s among Protestants, and considered heretical by the Orthodox Church, they elect a [[Presbyterian polity|council]] of dominant [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]] who preserve a sort of [[apostolic succession]]. Molokans had some practices similar to the European [[Quakers]] and [[Mennonites]], such as [[pacifism]], communal organization, spiritual meetings, and sub-groupings. But they arose in Russia together with the [[Doukhobors]] and Sabbatarians (also known as [[Subbotniks]]) and similar Spiritual Christian movements of [[Duhovnye Kristyanye]] and Ikonobortsy. They migrated into central Russia and Ukraine around the same time.\n\n==Formation and development==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2015}}\n\n===11th to 14th centuries===\nThere are approximately 200 [[fasting]] days \u2014especially the [[Great Fast]] (Lent)\u2014 when drinking milk was prohibited by Orthodox ecclesiastical authorities.   Milk-drinking practice during these fasts was first sanctioned by the [[Nestorian Church]] in the 11th century in order to accommodate the conversion of some 200,000 Turkic Christians, who lived on meat and milk, to Nestorian Christianity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borbone|first=Pier Giorgio |url=https://pisa.academia.edu/PierGiorgioBorbone/Papers/537579/Some_Aspects_of_Turco-Mongol_Christianity_in_the_Light_of_Literary_and_Epigraphic_Syriac_Sources |title=Some Aspects of Turco-Mongol Christianity in the Light of Literary and Epigraphic Syriac Sources (Pier Giorgio Borbone) - Academia.edu |publisher=Pisa.academia.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20}}</ref> Arriving in [[All-Russian nation#Background|the Rus' lands]] with the 13th century Tatar invasion<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor = 4202032|title = The Great Tartar Invasion of Europe|journal = The Slavonic Review|volume = 5|issue = 13|pages = 89\u2013105|last1 = Cheshire|first1 = Harold T|year = 1926}}</ref> of [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]], the practice was adopted by other Christians, who had pastoral communities on the Eurasian plains.\n\n===15th to 16th centuries===\nThe [[Judaizers]] preceded the modern day Molokans. Although they are sometimes also called \"Molokans\", they constitute an independent movement. Their leader [[Matvei Dalmatov|Matvei Simyonich Dalmatov (\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0414\u0430\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432)]] became a martyr in a monastery prison by [[breaking wheel|wheeling]].\n\n===17th to 18th centuries===\nThe first recorded use of the term \"Molokan\" appears in the 1670s, in reference to the people who had the practice of drinking milk on the 200 fasting days stipulated by the Orthodox Church. (''Moloko'' means \"milk\" in Russian). Nonetheless, these were \"Spiritual Christians\" not directly related to the group later known as \"Molokans\". \n\nThe \"Molokans\" that are known today by that name split in 1779/80 from the [[Doukhobors]] because they thought that the Doukhobors neglected the Bible in their belief that God had placed the Word directly into their hearts. The Molokans, however, held the written Bible into the highest regard. The founder of the Molokans, [[ Simyon Matveiovich Uklein]] (1733-1809), was a son-in-law of the Doukhobor leader [[Ilarion Poberokhin]] (1720-1792) as explained by O. Beznosova (\"The Perception in the Religious Space\", 2016): \"Soon (approximately in 1779-1780) a group broke away from Pobirohin's disciples.It was led by his son in law Simeon Uklein who did not share the mystical spirit and self-deification of the former leader and defended the need for reliance on the Gospel texts in the organization of church life (Margaritov, 1914). This group (called \"Molokans\") became a \"rational\" direction of. Spiritual Christianity, as opposed to the \"mystics\" - \"christoverchestvo\" adherents, \"Doukhobors\" and \"[[skoptsy]]\".\" (p. 322) \n\nUklein's Molokans from Tambov energetically proselytized in settlements along the [[Volga River]] and Russia's south-eastern frontier, spreading the Molokan faith in [[Orenburg]], [[Saratov]] and [[Astrakhan]] provinces and organizing congregations until his death in 1809.\n\n===19th to 20th centuries===\nFrom the intervention of Count [[Nikolay Alexandrovich Zubov|Nikolay Zubov]] in 1795, Molokans (\u0431\u0435\u0441\u0448\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438) were tolerated under Tsarina Catherine but constrained by strict rules imposed upon them intended to curb community growth.<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/gersub.shtml]</ref> Those who ignored the restrictions were punished in [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] as [[Christian heresy|heretics]].<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/herm.shtml]</ref> Molokan evangelists and missionaries suffered imprisonment, banishment and other forms of punishment. Prohibited from winning converts,<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/problems.shtml]</ref> the Molokans were forced into [[endogamy]]. The government's policy was to send the Molokans away from the center of Russia into the Caucasus (1833), and other outlying areas to prevent their having influence on other peasants; they were sent to [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] (1834), [[Ukraine]] (1830s), central [[Asia]], and [[Siberia]], where many communities have survived into the present.\nIt is said that, in 1900, despite the persecution there could have been about a half-million Spiritual Christians in the Russia empire. These figures appear, however, to be vastly exaggerated. In 1912, there were only 133,935 ''Molokane'' and 4,844 ''Pryguny'' counted in Russia (census of the Department of Spiritual Affairs; see [[Glenn Dynner]]: \"Holy Dissent: Jewish and Christian Mystics in Eastern Europe\", 2011).\nFewer than one thousand ''Molokane'' fled Russia in the early 1900s (mostly 1905-1912), many of whom settled near other non-Orthodox immigrants from Russia in an ethnic [[enclave]] on and near [[Potrero Hill]], [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], where they built a prayer hall in 1929. A second prayer hall was established near [[Sheridan, Placer County, California|Sheridan, California]] to serve those scattered in Northern California.

The Molokan ''Jumpers'' believed they were visited by a manifestation of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:7), and this new smaller Molokan sect began a revival with intense zeal, reporting miracles that purportedly rivaled those of Christ's apostles. \n\n=== Seeds of exodus ===\nThe \"Constant\" Molokan sect condemned the new sect to authorities, resulting in betrayals and imprisonment for many of the \"Spiritual\" Molokan Jumpers & Skippers. Some of these \"Spiritual\" Molokans called themselves \"New Israelites\", when their leader [[Maxim Rudometkin]] in Nikitino, Erivan Guberniya  was announced to be the \"King of the Spirits\" in 1853. The group, also known as Maximists\", considered [[Efim Gerasimovic  Klubnikin]] (1842-1915) also in Nikitino, a divinely inspired 12-year-old boy prophet. He prophesied a \"coming time that would be unbearable and that the time to leave Russia was now.\" During the early 20th century under his leadership, about 2,000 ''Pryguny'' emigrated to the [[United States]], first settling on the east side of [[Los Angeles]]. Most seeking rural isolation moved to Baja Mexico, then Arizona, Central California, and some other parts of the West Coast and Canada. Other Jumpers received a land grant from the [[Mexican government]] and settled in the [[Guadalupe, Baja California|Guadalupe Valley]] in [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]].\n\nIn Los Angeles, a small number of the Molokan Jumpers joined the development of the American Revival called \"the [[Pentecostal]] [[Azusa Street Revival]].\" The founder of [[The Full Gospel Business Men's Association]] associates this [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian revival|Revival]] to a child prophet of the Molokan Jumpers, E.G.
