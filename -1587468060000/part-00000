However, as he grew older, he abandoned this mindset in favour of helping the poor.\n\nBarnardo moved to London in 1866. At that time he was interested in becoming a missionary.<ref name=\"ODNB-30600\" />\n\n== Philanthropy ==\n[[File:Group portrait of children outside a Barnardo home.

Following the closure of its last traditional orphanage in 1989, it took the still simpler name of ''Barnardo's''.\n\n====Controversies====\nThere was controversy early on with Barnardo's work. Specifically, he was accused of kidnapping children without parents' permission and of falsifying photographs of children to make the distinction between the period before they were rescued by Barnardo's and afterwards seem more dramatic. He openly confessed to the former of these charges, describing it as 'philanthropic abduction' and basing his defence on the idea that the end justified the means. In total, he was taken to court on 88 occasions, usually on the charge of kidnapping. However, being a charismatic speaker and popular figure, he rode through these scandals unscathed. Other charges brought against him included presenting staged images of children for Barnardo's 'before and after' cards and neglecting basic hygiene for the children under his care.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/oct/03/advertising.childprotection | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Oliver | title=The echoes of Barnardo's altered imagery | date=3 October 2002}}</ref>\n{{clearleft}}\n\nBarnardo's was implicated in the scandal of forced child migration, in which children from poor social backgrounds were taken to the former colonies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa) by churches and charities, without their parents' consent and even under false claims of death. Although this was a legal scheme, favoured by Government and society, in many cases the children suffered harsh living conditions and many also suffered physical and, in some cases, sexual abuse. This practice went on until the 1970s. This merited a public apology by Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] in 2010.\n\n====Today====\nThe official mascot of Barnardo's is a bear called Barney.

However, as he grew older, he abandoned this mindset in favour of helping the poor.\n\nBarnardo moved to London in 1866. At that time he was interested in becoming a missionary.<ref name=\"ODNB-30600\" />\n\n== Philanthropy ==\n[[File:Group portrait of children outside a Barnardo home.

Following the closure of its last traditional orphanage in 1989, it took the still simpler name of ''Barnardo's''.\n\n====Controversies====\nThere was controversy early on with Barnardo's work. Specifically, he was accused of kidnapping children without parents' permission and of falsifying photographs of children to make the distinction between the period before they were rescued by Barnardo's and afterwards seem more dramatic. He openly confessed to the former of these charges, describing it as 'philanthropic abduction' and basing his defence on the idea that the end justified the means. In total, he was taken to court on 88 occasions, usually on the charge of kidnapping. However, being a charismatic speaker and popular figure, he rode through these scandals unscathed. Other charges brought against him included presenting staged images of children for Barnardo's 'before and after' cards and neglecting basic hygiene for the children under his care.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/oct/03/advertising.childprotection | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Oliver | title=The echoes of Barnardo's altered imagery | date=3 October 2002}}</ref>\n{{clearleft}}\n\nBarnardo's was implicated in the scandal of forced child migration, in which children from poor social backgrounds were taken to the former colonies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa) by churches and charities, without their parents' consent and even under false claims of death. Although this was a legal scheme, favoured by Government and society, in many cases the children suffered harsh living conditions and many also suffered physical and, in some cases, sexual abuse. This practice went on until the 1970s. This merited a public apology by Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] in 2010.\n\n====Today====\nThe official mascot of Barnardo's is a bear called Barney.

Soon after, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) set up the National Lunar Mission Task Force which concluded that ISRO has the technical expertise to carry out an Indian mission to the Moon. In April 2003 over 100 eminent Indian scientists in the fields of planetary and space sciences, [[Earth sciences]], physics, chemistry, astronomy, astrophysics, engineering and communication sciences discussed and approved the Task Force recommendation to launch an Indian probe to the Moon. Six months later, in November, the Indian government gave approval for the mission.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2009-09-24-voa46-68806852/362715.html India's Moon mission: nine years in the landing]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://shiksha.isro.gov.in/pdf/books/1.pdf |title=Chandrayaan-1: India's first scientific mission to the Moon |access-date=17 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802062110/http://shiksha.isro.gov.in/pdf/books/1.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Objectives==\nThe mission had the following stated objectives:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isro.org/chandrayaan/htmls/objective_scientific.htm |title=Objectives |accessdate=22 October 2008 |publisher=ISRO |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026041754/http://www.isro.org/Chandrayaan/htmls/objective_scientific.htm |archivedate=26 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n* to design, develop, launch and orbit a spacecraft around the Moon using an Indian-made launch-vehicle\n* to conduct scientific experiments using instruments on the spacecraft which would yield data:\n** for the preparation of a three-dimensional atlas (with high spatial and altitude resolution of {{convert|5|-|10|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) of both the near and far sides of the Moon\n** for chemical and mineralogical mapping of the entire lunar surface at high spatial resolution, mapping particularly the chemical elements [[magnesium]], aluminium, [[silicon]], [[calcium]], iron, [[titanium]], [[radon]], [[uranium]], and [[thorium]]\n* to increase scientific knowledge\n* to test the impact of a sub-satellite (Moon Impact Probe&nbsp;\u2013 MIP) on the surface of the Moon as a fore-runner for future soft-landing missions\n\n===Goals===\nIn order to reach its objective, the mission defined these goals:\n\n* High-resolution mineralogical and [[chemical imaging]] of the permanently shadowed north- and south-polar regions\n* Searching for surface or sub-surface [[lunar water]]-ice, especially at the lunar poles\n* Identification of chemicals in lunar highland rocks\n* Chemical [[stratigraphy]] of the lunar crust by remote sensing of the central [[Highland (geography)|uplands]] of large lunar craters, and of the South Pole Aitken Region (SPAR), an expected site of interior material\n* Mapping the height variation of features of the lunar surface\n* Observation of [[X-ray]] spectrum greater than 10&nbsp;keV and stereographic coverage of most of the Moon's surface with {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} resolution\n* Providing new insights in understanding the Moon's origin and evolution{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:Chandrayaan-1.svg|thumb|Diagram of the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft]]\n;Mass\n:{{convert|1380|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} at launch, {{convert|675|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} at lunar orbit,<ref name=\"description \">{{cite web |url=http://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan/htmls/spacecraft_description.htm |title=Specifications of Chandrayaan 1 |accessdate=22 October 2008 |date=October 2008 |publisher=Indian Space Research Organisation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023064658/http://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan/htmls/spacecraft_description.htm |archivedate=23 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and {{convert|523|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} after releasing the impactor.\n;Dimensions\n:Cuboid in shape of approximately {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n;Communications\n: [[X band]], {{convert|0.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} diameter dual [[gimbal]]led parabolic antenna for payload data transmission.

The Moamorias were the followers of the Moamaria sattra that was primarily Morans (the mainstay of the Ahom militia), the Sonowal Kacharis (gold-washers), [[Chutia people|Chutia]]s (expert archers and matchlockmen), professional castes such as Hiras (potters), Tantis (weavers), Kaibartas (fishermen) and [[Ahom people|Ahom]] nobles and officers.<ref>{{harvcol|Baruah|1993|p=53}}</ref> The rising popularity of Moamorias sattras has siphoned off the power of orthodox Hindu groups and the other powerful Shakti worship sect which supported the Ahom kings. They provided refuge for those seeking to escape the Paik system under which, any abled bodied person who was not a Brahmin or a noble could be used for labour, services or conscripted into the army. The [[Ahom kingdom]] was entering a crisis, as the [[Paik system]] on which the state was based was unable to adapt to the changing economy and the emerging social classes.  The rise of the sattras was one of the reason for the leakage of manpower from the Paik system, and as a result the Ahom kingdom and the sattras came into increasing conflict.  Moamara sattra, with its adherents from the [[Chutia]] and Moran tribes, were followers of the non-conformist Kala-samhati sect that competed against the royalist sattras belonging to other sects.  The Ahom kingdom watched the growth of this sattra with discomfort and heaped insult and repression on the followers of this sattra. The Moamoria Rebellion started during the reign of [[Swargadeo]] [[Lakshmi Singha]] and ended during the reign of Swargadeo [[Kamaleswar Singha]]. It continued up to 36 years, from 1769 to 1805.\n\nIn the course of time, the Moamoria guru compromised with the Ahom rulers and the rebels drew inspiration from magico-religious cult of night worshipers, a mixture of tribal fertility rites and [[Tantrism]].<ref>{{Harvcol|Guha|1991|pp=124\u2013125}}</ref>\n\n===Sattra-Ahom conflict===\n[[Srimanta Sankardeva]] established the [[Mahapuruxiya Dharma]] in the 16th century, a proselytizing religion that opened itself to all including the Muslims and tribesmen.  The religion provided opportunities for social and economic improvements to common tribesmen, and the sattras provided a safe haven from mandatory labor under the [[Paik system]].\n\nThe Ahom rulers saw a threat and Sankardeva himself had to escape to the [[Koch kingdom]] during the reign of Suklenmung to avoid persecution.  A later king, [[Prataap Singha]], demolished the Kalabari and Kuruabahi sattras and his successors followed a similar policy of oppression.  Jayadhwaj Singha reversed this policy and his successors up to Sulikphaa Lora Roja tried to come to terms with the sattras.  This policy was again reversed during the reign of [[Gadadhar Singha]], who began persecuting the sattras.  His son, [[Rudra Singha]] tried to isolate the more liberal&mdash;and thus most threatening to the Ahom state&mdash;of the non-Brahmin sattras by encouraging the Brahmin sattras.  When he realized this policy was not bearing fruit, he initiated a policy to accord state support to saktism, the historical and theological ''bete noire'' of the Mahapuruxiya dharma, to contain further sattra influence.  This led to more persecutions, the most notable under Bor Roja Phuleshwari Kunwonri during the reign of [[Siba Singha]]. This unresolved conflict finally exploded into the Moamoria rebellion in the 18th century that so weakened the Ahom kingdom that it collapsed in the 19th century.\n\n==First phase==\nOn September 15, 1769, Ragh Neog, a leading disciple of the sattra, was flogged by Ahom officials for not supplying the required number of elephants.  By November, the Mataks led by Ragh Neog, Naharkhora Saikia and his two wives Radha and Rukmini, promised the throne to three Ahom princes (Mohanmala, a brother, and two others, nephews of Lakshmi Singha the king) and with their help liberated the territory north of the Burhidihing river.  On November 21, 1769 the rebels occupied the Ahom capital and placed Ramananda, son of Naharkhora, on the throne.  The Ahom king, [[Lakshmi Singha]], was captured and kept a prisoner.  All high officers were executed and three common Mataks became the three great Gohains.  Ragh Neog became the [[Borbarua]], a ''kanri paik'' became the [[Borphukan]] and two common Ahoms became the Gohains at Sadiya and Marangi.\n\nThe rebels, inexperienced in statecraft, failed to usher in a new order.  Instead, they began imitating the unpopular practices of their erstwhile leaders.  Ragh Neog seized the wives and daughters of many nobles and kept them in his harem.  As some of the rebel officers took on the airs of the old nobility, many rebels were dissatisfied and, led by Govinda Gaoburha, left the capital and reached Sagunmuri.  Taking advantage of this, some of the old nobility killed Ragh on April 14, 1770 with the help of [[Kuranganayani]], an Ahom queen from Manipur, and retook the capital.  In the purge that followed, Ramananda the rebel king, Naharkhora, Radha, Rukmini, Astabhujdev, the Moamara sattradhikar and his son Saptabhuj were all executed.\n\nAfter the capital was recaptured the remaining rebel forces in Sagunmuri under Govinda Gaoburha attempted to overthrow the king again.  This movement too had the signs of a popular uprising.  The main weapons used by the rebels were bamboo staves and clubs, and their slogan was ''praja-oi joroiroa, chekani-oi sopai dhora'' (\"Ye oppressed subjects, hold your stave close\"), and this uprising was called ''chekani kubua ron'' (\"The war of the staves\").  In one of the engagements, the Borpatrogohain and the Dhekial Phukan were killed, and the Borgohain made a hair breath escape.  The rebels advanced toward Rangpur and they were met at Thowra by the forces of the Burhagohain, the new Borpatrogohain, the Borgohain and a detachment cavalry from the Manipur king.  In this battle the rebels were defeated; Govinda Gaoburha was captured and executed,<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|1993|p=72}}</ref>\n\nSome rebels then retreated deep into jungles and continued guerilla warfare under leaders like Lephera, Parmananda and others.  An initial royalist force under the Na-Phukan and the Deka-Phukan was defeated, but a later force under the Borpatrogohain was able to eliminate Lephera and Parmananda.  Subsequently, the Burhagohain began systematically destroying the villages and killing the remaining leaders; in a siege many rebels and their families died of starvation.  The remaining people were then separated and settled at different places.  One of the last holdouts, Nomal, was finally captured and executed.<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|1993|p=73}}</ref>  This ended the first phase of the Moamoria rebellion.\n\n==Second phase==\nIn April 1783 an armed group of rebels attacked [[Rangpur (Ahom capital)|Rangpur]] and [[Garhgaon]].  The rebels were repulsed and a general massacre of Morans followed that continued for a month and a half.\n[[File:Post Medieval Coin, Rupee from Assam (FindID 469667).jpg|thumb|240px|Silver rupee struck during the rebellion.]]\nIn 1786 Harihar Tanti raised an army of Moamarias and Dafla-Bahatiyas.  A contingent of the rebels freed Pitambar, a grandson of the late Moamara sattradhikar, who was in the custody of Auniati sattra.  The rebels encircled Rangpur and on January 19, 1788 the king [[Gaurinath Singha]] and the inhabitants of the capital fled.  The captured region was locally administered with Harihar Tanti in the north bank of the [[Brahmaputra]], Howha ruling [[Majuli]], Sarbananda ruling the Moran tracts from Bengmara (present-day [[Tinsukia]]).  Bharat was made the king.  Coins were struck regularly in Bharat's and Sarbananda's names.  Purnananda Burhagohain tried to regroup but soon gave up, and established himself in Jorhat, the vanguard of the royalist forces.  Other Ahom nobles camped in Darrang and the king in Nagaon where he had to face dissensions and as a result had to move from Nagaon to Guwahati on June 11, 1792.\n\nThe counterattacks began around 1792, when Bharat repulsed an attack from the Manipuri king.  In 1792 Thomas Welsh of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] came to the aid with 550 well trained and well armed troops.  He occupied Guwahati on November 24, 1792 without any resistance and on March 18, 1794, restored Rangpur to Gaurinath Singha.  After they received the prize money, Thomas Welsh returned to Bengal on May 25, 1794.  Gaurinath Singha died in Jorhat in 1794 and was succeeded by [[Kamaleswar Singha]].  The rebels continued to suffer reverses.\n\n==Third phase==\n\nThe third phase of the rebellion was very important because during this time the Moamoriyas attacked the Ahom Kingdom once again.\n\n==End==\nThis experience and the military display by Thomas Welsh and his troops encouraged the Ahoms to create a standing army of mostly paid Hindustani sepoys to replace the ''paik'' based militia.  Phopai, a rebel was killed in 1796 and Bharat, the rebel king in 1799.  Sadiya fell to the royalists in 1800.  Despite many attempts in 1802 and 1806, Sarbananda held out from Bengmara.  He was finally given the title of Barsenapati, and the Matak territory conceded to him.\n\nThe Moamaria rebellion thus ended with the creation of a near-independent Motak tract ruled by a Barsenapati and the near-end of the [[Paik system]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Citation |last=Baruah |first=S.
