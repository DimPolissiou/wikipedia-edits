The highway began construction in 1955, following a southern path eastwards toward Boston from near the New York border, where the new road intersected with [[Massachusetts Route 102]] in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], through [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] and [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and terminating at [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]] at the time of its completion in mid-May 1957.\n\nIn 1960, it was proposed that the highway be extended into [[Boston]]. This proposal was highly controversial because of disputes among landholders, politicians and engineers over the alignment of the proposed Boston Extension. With the economic future of the city on the line, there was enormous pressure from many parties to have the roadway completed.\n\n== Historical overview ==\nAs Boston's place as a center of commerce and manufacturing began to grow in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the need to move goods to the city's ports from growing mills and factories in communities such as [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to warehouses in the city required investments in new methods of transportation. The growth of shipbuilding in the city also required the importation of raw materials from the interior regions. Additionally the newly expanded marketplaces within the city, such as [[Faneuil Hall]], needed ways to bring their products to market. In response to these needs, the city and Commonwealth began a process of expanding transportation access to the city. New infrastructure such as bridges, wharves and ferries were established, often by early public-private corporations chartered by the Commonwealth.<ref name=\"Wood-Karr-3\">{{harvp|Wood|Karr|1997|p=3}}.</ref><ref name=Kennedy>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|pp=46\u201350}}.</ref>\n\nThe rudimentary system of roads that existed in the region at the time was woefully insufficient for the needs of the merchants, being in need of major overhauls and upgrades that were beyond the financial means of the Commonwealth and municipal governments of the time. The poor quality of the early roadways in the state, as well as others in the young nation, would often make the transportation of goods inland from the ports via road economically impractical.<ref name=\"Wood-Karr-3\"/>\n\nWhile the military necessity of transporting men and supplies during the revolution helped improve some of the early highways in the states, many of these were not maintained or upgraded after the war's end. Many roadways lacked bridges and adequate facilities to feed and house travelers on trips that would often take anywhere from a few days to a week to complete. Many communities were also hesitant or unable to provide sufficient capital required to establish or maintain amenities for those who passed through their towns.<ref>{{harvp|Wood|Karr|1997|pp=5\u20136}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:19th century turnpikes Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|Figure 1 \u2013 Map of the turnpikes of Eastern Massachusetts, with the Worcester Turnpike following the roughly same path as the modern Route 9. |alt=Figure 1 \u2013 Map of the turnpikes of Eastern Massachusetts]]\n\nOn March 16, 1805, the Massachusetts legislature chartered a system of private roads, or turnpikes, designed to help facilitate travel and commerce into general laws of the Commonwealth. These turnpikes, named after the system of tollgates used to collect fares from travelers, were based upon a franchises-like system of private operators who would build, maintain and operate the roads using the toll revenue. The turnpikes often operated at a loss and many folded shortly after their opening.<ref>{{harvp|Wood|Karr|1997|pp=8\u201310}}.</ref>\n\nOne such turnpike was designed to run from [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] to Worcester and was chartered as the Worcester Turnpike Corporation on March 7, 1806. The [[Worcester Turnpike]] was designed to be the primary roadway on the western approach to Boston and utilized a part of the old Connecticut Path along Tremont and Huntington streets, into Brookline and continued west to Worcester along roughly the same route as the modern Route 9. However, the costs of maintaining the road began to spiral as needed bridges in Shrewsbury began to deteriorate, and mandates in its charter to run and maintain older and unaffiliated roadways along the route made it difficult for the Corporation to maintain profitability. Like many of its contemporary turnpikes, the Worcester Turnpike eventually succumbed to failure in 1841, had its charter dissolved by the Commonwealth, and the roadway was portioned and control transferred to local municipalities.<ref>{{harvp|Wood|Karr|1997|pp=138\u2013147}}.</ref>\n\nOne of the primary contributors to the demise of the Worcester Turnpike was the ascendancy of the railroad during the 1830s.<ref>{{harvp|Wood|Karr|1997|pp=146\u2013147}}.</ref> Chartered in 1831 by the General Court, the Boston and Worcester Railroad began construction of its line in 1832, and the mainline was completed in July 1835.<ref name=\"HUL\">{{cite web |title = Boston and Albany Collection |publisher = Baker Library Special Collections, Harvard Business School |via = Harvard University Library. |url = http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~bak00034 }}</ref> The newly completed railroad initially utilized the right of way along another failed turnpike, the Central Turnpike, which ran from Boston to Worcester though [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]], [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]], [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]] and other communities along what is now the [[Framingham/Worcester Line|Framingham/Worcester MBTA commuter rail line]].<ref name=HF>{{cite web |title = Boston and Albany Railroad Station |url = http://historicframingham.blogspot.com/search/label/South%20Framingham |date = January 5, 2010 |website = Historic Framingham |accessdate = September 10, 2014 }}</ref> As illustrated in fig. 1, the railway originally ran through the tidal flats of the Back Bay and its impact on the city was only felt along the southern sections of the city.

The proximity of the railway also led to an unforeseen effect, suburban flight. With the new rail lines in close proximity to the entire city, many wealthier citizens began migrating to the cities and towns west of Boston. This migration put financial burdens for municipal services such as water and sewer, fire and police on these communities, and helped lead to drives for them to be annexed by Boston, further expanding the city limits.<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|pp=68\u201371}}.</ref> Despite these issues, by the end of the nineteenth century the western railroad and its contemporaries were helping drive the city's economy by assisting local industries to bring products to Boston's port, helping it become the second busiest port on the eastern seaboard.<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|pp=110\u201311}}.</ref>\n\nTo help accommodate the growth in rail traffic, the Boston and Albany constructed two large rail yards, one in the [[Allston]] section of city and another adjacent to the Lennox Hotel on Huntington St, adjacent to the Back Bay.(See Fig. 3) While the Boston and Albany and its contemporary railroads were constructing new yards, other factors that would foreshadow the decline of the city's fortunes were manifesting themselves through the late nineteenth century and into the early twentieth; traffic to the Port of Boston declined, necessitating the Federal government to dredge the main shipping channels and construct new piers to handle larger vessels; AT&amp;T moved its operations and headquarters from Boston to New York in 1910. The problematic relationship between the city and the business sector under the successive mayoral administrations of [[James Michael Curley]] drove a wedge between these businesses and the municipal government, souring employers on Boston. Adding to these problems, a series of economic recessionary periods culminating with the [[Great Depression]] coupled with a heavy tax burden sent the city's finances into a tailspin. Despite minor uplifts from the mobilization of the two World Wars, by the end of the World War II the city was in dire straits.<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|pp=130\u2013154}}.</ref> Much of the state's infrastructure west of Boston was in a serious state of decay, with the major east-west Routes 2 and 9 in need of significant upgrades.

Its former maritime industries had closed as traffic in the harbor declined, the textile mills that had provided a large portion of the city's wealth had migrated out of the region seeking new locations that would allow them to maximize revenues, and property development had ground to a halt with virtually no new construction of any impact occurring since the beginning of the Great Depression.<ref>{{harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> Boston retail stalwarts such as [[Filenes]] and [[Jordan Marsh]] had decided to focus their energies and growth into the suburbs; Boston's citizens had begun to flee to the same suburban pastures as property taxes in the city skyrocketed.

It was in 1947 that [[Massachusetts Republican Party|Republican]] [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Robert F. Bradford|Robert Bradford]] realized that the Commonwealth needed to implement a standard framework to properly guide the planning and construction of these new roadways. He commissioned a study to produce a new Highway Master Plan for the eastern region, and by 1948 it had been completed. Seeking the political benefits that a major public works project would bring, Bradford sent his plan to the [[Massachusetts Democratic Party|Democratic]]-controlled [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts legislature]] for approval; however the Democrats sat on the project until their candidate, newly elected Democratic Governor [[Paul A. Dever]], took office in January 1949.<ref name=\"BMP\"/>\n\nIt was instead Dever who initiated the program to implement the Highway Master Plan for the city shortly after taking office in 1949. Enjoying a Democratic majority within the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] coupled with a Democratic governor for the first time in the Commonwealth's history, he pushed through a series of highway bills with associated gas tax increases totaling over US$400 million (US$3.97 billion in 2014, adjusted for inflation) between 1949 and 1952.<ref name=BSNR>{{cite news |title = Baystate Notes Spending Record |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = November 5, 1958 }}{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> To oversee this undertaking, Dever brought in the former Commissioner of the [[Massachusetts Highway Department|Massachusetts Department of Public Works]], [[William F. Callahan]], to once again head the agency he had helmed from 1934 to 1939. Known for his strong personality and drive to get projects completed,<ref name=BSNR /> Callahan immediately set out to construct three of the proposed highways, not including what would become [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)#History|the eventual \"outermost\" beltway around Boston, planned from 1947]]: the \"original outer\" circumferential highway which became [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]], the [[Southeast Expressway (Massachusetts)|Southeast Expressway]], and the [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway|Central Artery]] through the heart of the Boston's downtown. These three projects, totaling more than US$92 million (US$913 million in 2014, adjusted for inflation) were seen as being essential to the growth of the city in the future. However, the construction of these roads took such a large portion of funds that the Commonwealth was unable to provide funds for the Western Expressway project. However, before Callahan could oversee the completion of the southern leg of Route 128, he was appointed by Dever to run the newly formed Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.<ref>{{harvp|Tsipis|2003|pp=8\u20139}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=27\u201328}}.</ref>\n\nBecause of the financial strain created by the bond issues used to construct these other highways, the Commonwealth was unable to afford the costs of floating more bonds to fund the expenditures required to construct the Western Expressway along the Western Approach corridor of Boston. Callahan suggested creating a strong, independent, and semi-public transportation authority that could fund the new expressway by floating its own bond issues and financing them through tolls along the highway while having its own powers of [[eminent domain]] to secure the land needed to build it. Utilizing the political goodwill he accrued during his tenure as public works commissioner, primarily through extensive patronage hires,<ref name=BSNR /> Callahan was able to push his idea for the new authority through the Statehouse with ease.<ref>{{harvp|Berkman|1998|pp=180\u2013181}}</ref> The authority was formed in early 1952, and by 1955 it had issued the required bonds needed to construct a {{convert|123|mi|km|abbr=on}} highway from the New York-Massachusetts border to the recently completed Route 128 in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]. Despite being completed in 1957, many within the Commonwealth quickly realized that the local routes used to get into Boston were still insufficient for the automotive traffic burdens placed upon them.<ref>{{harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=27\u201329}}.</ref>\n\nWhile the highway construction boom proved to be fortunate for the suburban communities these new roadways passed through, the economy of Boston was still in a fragile state.<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|p=168}}.</ref> Realizing that Boston still needed to be connected to the Turnpike to help reverse its flagging economy and reputation as a municipal has-been, Callahan was tasked in 1955 by the Legislature to create an extension into the city designed to facilitate a turnaround of the city's fortunes. This new highway would connect the Massachusetts Turnpike to the heart of the city with a 12.3-mile extension of the Interstate. It was his plan to bring the tolled Turnpike from its terminus at Route 128 in West Newton into the city along the path of the Boston and Albany Railroad and connect it to the Southeast Expressway. This plan was in line with the 1948 Master Highway Plan for the city, which had always called for a Western Expressway to be built into the city. However, with the passage of the Interstate Highway Act in 1956, the Federal Government provided sufficient funds to the states to construct new highways with a ninety percent subsidy\u2014rendering the need for a toll road into the city obsolete.<ref name=\"harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=47\u201348\">{{harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=47\u201348}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:NYCRR Headlights Cover 196502XX.png|thumb|300px|[[New York Central Railroad]] ([[Boston and Albany]] parent company) employee magazine Headlights from February 1965 showing an aerial photograph of the completed Boston Extension of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]]]\nComplicating the matter, Callahan's planned extension route was not universally accepted by others within the state, such as newly elected Governor [[John A.

These allegations included charges of financial kickbacks, bid rigging, and other questionable practices. This led to a corruption trial which threw a pall on his reputation that did not help with his drive to construct the Turnpike extension. On top of the legal allegations, a group of three professors from MIT and Harvard made public allegations that the Turnpike Authority had been using inflated numbers to push through its bond issues, thus artificially inflating their values.

While the original design of the roadway called for an eight-lane expressway along the majority of the route, it was only constructed as a four-lane roadway along most of its length until it reached the junction of [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]] in Framingham where the roadway expanded to six lanes. Starting in 1968 the highway from the Interstate 84 interchange in Sturbridge to Route 9 was widened from its original four lanes to six; that widening project was completed around 1971. \nHowever, the mainline right-of-way was constructed to allow future expansion of the roadway, with most bridges over the highway built with the eight-lane roadway in mind, so few bridges had to be rebuilt when it was widened in the late 1960s.\n\n== 1970s through the 1990s ==\n\n=== New highway ===\nWhen designing the Central Artery/Tunnel project in the 1970s and 1980s, the horror stories regarding urban renewal projects such as the construction of the old viaduct in the 1950s weighed heavy on the minds of [[Frederick Salvucci]] and his team. It was realized early on that the Commonwealth could not just lay waste to parts of the city and pave them over; the state would have to ensure that construction would balance the needs of the highways against the livability of the city and neighborhoods the project would pass through.

The highway began construction in 1955, following a southern path eastwards toward Boston from near the New York border, where the new road intersected with [[Massachusetts Route 102]] in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], through [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] and [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and terminating at [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]] at the time of its completion in mid-May 1957.\n\nIn 1960, it was proposed that the highway be extended into [[Boston]]. This proposal was highly controversial because of disputes among landholders, politicians and engineers over the alignment of the proposed Boston Extension. With the economic future of the city on the line, there was enormous pressure from many parties to have the roadway completed.\n\n== Historical overview ==\nAs Boston's place as a center of commerce and manufacturing began to grow in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the need to move goods to the city's ports from growing mills and factories in communities such as [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to warehouses in the city required investments in new methods of transportation. The growth of shipbuilding in the city also required the importation of raw materials from the interior regions. Additionally the newly expanded marketplaces within the city, such as [[Faneuil Hall]], needed ways to bring their products to market. In response to these needs, the city and Commonwealth began a process of expanding transportation access to the city. New infrastructure such as bridges, wharves and ferries were established, often by early public-private corporations chartered by the Commonwealth.<ref name=\"Wood-Karr-3\">{{harvp|Wood|Karr|1997|p=3}}.</ref><ref name=Kennedy>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|pp=46\u201350}}.</ref>\n\nThe rudimentary system of roads that existed in the region at the time was woefully insufficient for the needs of the merchants, being in need of major overhauls and upgrades that were beyond the financial means of the Commonwealth and municipal governments of the time. The poor quality of the early roadways in the state, as well as others in the young nation, would often make the transportation of goods inland from the ports via road economically impractical.<ref name=\"Wood-Karr-3\"/>\n\nWhile the military necessity of transporting men and supplies during the revolution helped improve some of the early highways in the states, many of these were not maintained or upgraded after the war's end. Many roadways lacked bridges and adequate facilities to feed and house travelers on trips that would often take anywhere from a few days to a week to complete. Many communities were also hesitant or unable to provide sufficient capital required to establish or maintain amenities for those who passed through their towns.<ref>{{harvp|Wood|Karr|1997|pp=5\u20136}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:19th century turnpikes Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|Figure 1 \u2013 Map of the turnpikes of Eastern Massachusetts, with the Worcester Turnpike following the roughly same path as the modern Route 9. |alt=Figure 1 \u2013 Map of the turnpikes of Eastern Massachusetts]]\n\nOn March 16, 1805, the Massachusetts legislature chartered a system of private roads, or turnpikes, designed to help facilitate travel and commerce into general laws of the Commonwealth. These turnpikes, named after the system of tollgates used to collect fares from travelers, were based upon a franchises-like system of private operators who would build, maintain and operate the roads using the toll revenue. The turnpikes often operated at a loss and many folded shortly after their opening.<ref>{{harvp|Wood|Karr|1997|pp=8\u201310}}.</ref>\n\nOne such turnpike was designed to run from [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] to Worcester and was chartered as the Worcester Turnpike Corporation on March 7, 1806. The [[Worcester Turnpike]] was designed to be the primary roadway on the western approach to Boston and utilized a part of the old Connecticut Path along Tremont and Huntington streets, into Brookline and continued west to Worcester along roughly the same route as the modern Route 9. However, the costs of maintaining the road began to spiral as needed bridges in Shrewsbury began to deteriorate, and mandates in its charter to run and maintain older and unaffiliated roadways along the route made it difficult for the Corporation to maintain profitability. Like many of its contemporary turnpikes, the Worcester Turnpike eventually succumbed to failure in 1841, had its charter dissolved by the Commonwealth, and the roadway was portioned and control transferred to local municipalities.<ref>{{harvp|Wood|Karr|1997|pp=138\u2013147}}.</ref>\n\nOne of the primary contributors to the demise of the Worcester Turnpike was the ascendancy of the railroad during the 1830s.<ref>{{harvp|Wood|Karr|1997|pp=146\u2013147}}.</ref> Chartered in 1831 by the General Court, the Boston and Worcester Railroad began construction of its line in 1832, and the mainline was completed in July 1835.<ref name=\"HUL\">{{cite web |title = Boston and Albany Collection |publisher = Baker Library Special Collections, Harvard Business School |via = Harvard University Library. |url = http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~bak00034 }}</ref> The newly completed railroad initially utilized the right of way along another failed turnpike, the Central Turnpike, which ran from Boston to Worcester though [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]], [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]], [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]] and other communities along what is now the [[Framingham/Worcester Line|Framingham/Worcester MBTA commuter rail line]].<ref name=HF>{{cite web |title = Boston and Albany Railroad Station |url = http://historicframingham.blogspot.com/search/label/South%20Framingham |date = January 5, 2010 |website = Historic Framingham |accessdate = September 10, 2014 }}</ref> As illustrated in fig. 1, the railway originally ran through the tidal flats of the Back Bay and its impact on the city was only felt along the southern sections of the city. While originally designed as a long haul railway, the proprietors of the B&amp;W, and other railways, eventually found that there was a willing market for commuter services along the routes and by 1845 had established a series of commuter rail facilities along its route.<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|p=46}}.</ref> Through a series of mergers during the next several decades, the [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]] eventually evolved into the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] in 1870, connecting the capitols of Massachusetts and New York state.<ref name=\"HUL\"/>\n\nAs the city slowly began filling in the [[Back Bay]] tidal estuary to establish the South End and Back Bay sections of the city, the rail line went from being a lone causeway in the middle of said tidal estuary to a major transportation cut through the heart of the western sections of the city.(See Fig. 2) Besides being a physical separator, the railroad was a societal and economic barrier as well; while the South End reclamation project was a municipal project that lacked any form of solid planning, the Back Bay reclamation project was a state-run program that established specific ideas of who would reside within the district. The proximity of the railway also led to an unforeseen effect, suburban flight. With the new rail lines in close proximity to the entire city, many wealthier citizens began migrating to the cities and towns west of Boston. This migration put financial burdens for municipal services such as water and sewer, fire and police on these communities, and helped lead to drives for them to be annexed by Boston, further expanding the city limits.<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|pp=68\u201371}}.</ref> Despite these issues, by the end of the nineteenth century the western railroad and its contemporaries were helping drive the city's economy by assisting local industries to bring products to Boston's port, helping it become the second busiest port on the eastern seaboard.<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|pp=110\u201311}}.</ref>\n\nTo help accommodate the growth in rail traffic, the Boston and Albany constructed two large rail yards, one in the [[Allston]] section of city and another adjacent to the Lennox Hotel on Huntington St, adjacent to the Back Bay.(See Fig. 3) While the Boston and Albany and its contemporary railroads were constructing new yards, other factors that would foreshadow the decline of the city's fortunes were manifesting themselves through the late nineteenth century and into the early twentieth; traffic to the Port of Boston declined, necessitating the Federal government to dredge the main shipping channels and construct new piers to handle larger vessels; AT&amp;T moved its operations and headquarters from Boston to New York in 1910. The problematic relationship between the city and the business sector under the successive mayoral administrations of [[James Michael Curley]] drove a wedge between these businesses and the municipal government, souring employers on Boston. Adding to these problems, a series of economic recessionary periods culminating with the [[Great Depression]] coupled with a heavy tax burden sent the city's finances into a tailspin. Despite minor uplifts from the mobilization of the two World Wars, by the end of the World War II the city was in dire straits.<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|pp=130\u2013154}}.</ref> Much of the state's infrastructure west of Boston was in a serious state of decay, with the major east-west Routes 2 and 9 in need of significant upgrades. At the same time, rail traffic in the region was becoming financially untenable to utilize for material transportation for newly emerging technology companies of the era due to the railroads\u2019 outmoded pricing structures and limited geographical reach.<ref name=BMP>{{harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=7\u20138}}.</ref>\n\n== 1950s and 1960s ==\n[[File:Boston, Massachusetts 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|thumb|A map of the proposed highway put forth in the 1948 Massachusetts Highway Master Plan.

Its former maritime industries had closed as traffic in the harbor declined, the textile mills that had provided a large portion of the city's wealth had migrated out of the region seeking new locations that would allow them to maximize revenues, and property development had ground to a halt with virtually no new construction of any impact occurring since the beginning of the Great Depression.<ref>{{harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> Boston retail stalwarts such as [[Filenes]] and [[Jordan Marsh]] had decided to focus their energies and growth into the suburbs; Boston's citizens had begun to flee to the same suburban pastures as property taxes in the city skyrocketed. As ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' stated, Boston was \"dying on the vine\".<ref>{{harvp|Berkman|1998|pp=200}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the war, Massachusetts entered into a period of new highway projects planning that sought to help end the economic malaise the state was suffering from. It was in 1947 that [[Massachusetts Republican Party|Republican]] [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Robert F. Bradford|Robert Bradford]] realized that the Commonwealth needed to implement a standard framework to properly guide the planning and construction of these new roadways. He commissioned a study to produce a new Highway Master Plan for the eastern region, and by 1948 it had been completed. Seeking the political benefits that a major public works project would bring, Bradford sent his plan to the [[Massachusetts Democratic Party|Democratic]]-controlled [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts legislature]] for approval; however the Democrats sat on the project until their candidate, newly elected Democratic Governor [[Paul A. Dever]], took office in January 1949.<ref name=\"BMP\"/>\n\nIt was instead Dever who initiated the program to implement the Highway Master Plan for the city shortly after taking office in 1949. Enjoying a Democratic majority within the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] coupled with a Democratic governor for the first time in the Commonwealth's history, he pushed through a series of highway bills with associated gas tax increases totaling over US$400 million (US$3.97 billion in 2014, adjusted for inflation) between 1949 and 1952.<ref name=BSNR>{{cite news |title = Baystate Notes Spending Record |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = November 5, 1958 }}{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> To oversee this undertaking, Dever brought in the former Commissioner of the [[Massachusetts Highway Department|Massachusetts Department of Public Works]], [[William F. Callahan]], to once again head the agency he had helmed from 1934 to 1939. Known for his strong personality and drive to get projects completed,<ref name=BSNR /> Callahan immediately set out to construct three of the proposed highways, not including what would become [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)#History|the eventual \"outermost\" beltway around Boston, planned from 1947]]: the \"original outer\" circumferential highway which became [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]], the [[Southeast Expressway (Massachusetts)|Southeast Expressway]], and the [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway|Central Artery]] through the heart of the Boston's downtown. These three projects, totaling more than US$92 million (US$913 million in 2014, adjusted for inflation) were seen as being essential to the growth of the city in the future. However, the construction of these roads took such a large portion of funds that the Commonwealth was unable to provide funds for the Western Expressway project. However, before Callahan could oversee the completion of the southern leg of Route 128, he was appointed by Dever to run the newly formed Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.<ref>{{harvp|Tsipis|2003|pp=8\u20139}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=27\u201328}}.</ref>\n\nBecause of the financial strain created by the bond issues used to construct these other highways, the Commonwealth was unable to afford the costs of floating more bonds to fund the expenditures required to construct the Western Expressway along the Western Approach corridor of Boston. Callahan suggested creating a strong, independent, and semi-public transportation authority that could fund the new expressway by floating its own bond issues and financing them through tolls along the highway while having its own powers of [[eminent domain]] to secure the land needed to build it. Utilizing the political goodwill he accrued during his tenure as public works commissioner, primarily through extensive patronage hires,<ref name=BSNR /> Callahan was able to push his idea for the new authority through the Statehouse with ease.<ref>{{harvp|Berkman|1998|pp=180\u2013181}}</ref> The authority was formed in early 1952, and by 1955 it had issued the required bonds needed to construct a {{convert|123|mi|km|abbr=on}} highway from the New York-Massachusetts border to the recently completed Route 128 in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]. Despite being completed in 1957, many within the Commonwealth quickly realized that the local routes used to get into Boston were still insufficient for the automotive traffic burdens placed upon them.<ref>{{harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=27\u201329}}.</ref>\n\nWhile the highway construction boom proved to be fortunate for the suburban communities these new roadways passed through, the economy of Boston was still in a fragile state.<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1994|p=168}}.</ref> Realizing that Boston still needed to be connected to the Turnpike to help reverse its flagging economy and reputation as a municipal has-been, Callahan was tasked in 1955 by the Legislature to create an extension into the city designed to facilitate a turnaround of the city's fortunes. This new highway would connect the Massachusetts Turnpike to the heart of the city with a 12.3-mile extension of the Interstate. It was his plan to bring the tolled Turnpike from its terminus at Route 128 in West Newton into the city along the path of the Boston and Albany Railroad and connect it to the Southeast Expressway. This plan was in line with the 1948 Master Highway Plan for the city, which had always called for a Western Expressway to be built into the city. However, with the passage of the Interstate Highway Act in 1956, the Federal Government provided sufficient funds to the states to construct new highways with a ninety percent subsidy\u2014rendering the need for a toll road into the city obsolete.<ref name=\"harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=47\u201348\">{{harvp|Tsipis|2002|pp=47\u201348}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:NYCRR Headlights Cover 196502XX.png|thumb|300px|[[New York Central Railroad]] ([[Boston and Albany]] parent company) employee magazine Headlights from February 1965 showing an aerial photograph of the completed Boston Extension of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]]]\nComplicating the matter, Callahan's planned extension route was not universally accepted by others within the state, such as newly elected Governor [[John A. Volpe]] and Newton Mayor Donald Gibbs, who sought to construct a freeway that would follow a different route between the Borders of [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] and [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] along the [[Charles River]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 20]] and be constructed using the funds now being provided by the [[Federal Highway Administration]].<ref>Britten{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> Additionally, residents of the city of Newton, who would see significant demolition of neighborhoods within the city along with large portions of its central business district to make way for the Turnpike Extension, were adamantly against the proposed Boston and Albany routing of the road.<ref>{{harvp|Berkman|1998|pp=170\u2013173}}</ref> Newton, through the terms of two mayors, set about fighting the Turnpike proposal through a series of increasingly futile legislative maneuvers in the General Court.

These allegations included charges of financial kickbacks, bid rigging, and other questionable practices. This led to a corruption trial which threw a pall on his reputation that did not help with his drive to construct the Turnpike extension. On top of the legal allegations, a group of three professors from MIT and Harvard made public allegations that the Turnpike Authority had been using inflated numbers to push through its bond issues, thus artificially inflating their values. This led to failed series of bond issues that critics hoped would prevent the Turnpike Authority from raising the needed funds for construction.<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite news |last1 = Lewis |first1 = Anthony |title = Massachusetts Turnpike Chief Criticized in Rising Scandals |work = The New York Times |date = June 20, 1961 |page = 1 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1961/06/20/archives/massachusetts-turnpike-chief-criticized-in-rising-scandals-turnpike.html }}</ref>\n\nIt was in the midst of these many legal problems that in April 1960 Prudential announced that continuation of their building project was contingent on direct highway access via a toll road along the Boston & Albany Rail Road right of way.<ref name=\"Aloisi-CL\" /><ref name=\"Lewis\" /> Additionally, Prudential would lease air rights to the parcels from the Turnpike Authority and purchase a large portion of bonds issued by the Authority. Despite this agreement, Governor Volpe was still trying to nix the Turnpike's plans along the Boston and Albany right of way, filing the city of Newton's request with the ICC to stop the construction of the roadway. It was only after a series of meetings between Volpe, Callahan and Prudential executives that the Governor was finally persuaded to withdraw the ICC filing and reluctantly support the toll road.<ref>{{harvp|Tsipis|2002|p=48}}.</ref> With the new deal in place, a not-guilty finding in the criminal case, and public relations push-back to the allegations of market tampering by the Turnpike Authority, the bond measures were once again seen as a sound investment and investors quickly picked up the $175 million (US$1.4 billion in 2014, adjusted for inflation) bond issuance.<ref name=\"Lewis\" /><ref name=\"harvp|Berkman|1998|pp=188\"/> With the Turnpike-Prudential agreement in place, Logue was able to petition the General Court to once again authorize a land taking deal and tax-deferment bill, which was passed rather quickly and signed by then-Governor [[Foster Furcolo]]. While this new bill was again deemed unconstitutional by the SJC, in its decision the Court provided a framework for the legislature to construct a bill that would pass constitutional muster. The bill also gave Logue's BRA considerable powers over the redevelopment project, allowing him to rapidly move forward with permit approvals and tax issues.<ref name=\"Aloisi-CL\" /><ref name=\"Lewis\" /> The Turnpike-Prudential deal linked with the Logue and the BRA's new powers to move the project forward quickly quieted much of the remaining opposition to the new roadway, and cemented the idea of air right development as an integral part of the Turnpike moving forward.<ref>{{harvp|Berkman|1998|pp=188\u2013189}}</ref> By 1965 the Massachusetts Turnpike had been connected to the Central Artery, and the Prudential Center was on its way to completion; however, Callahan did not live to see this.

While the original design of the roadway called for an eight-lane expressway along the majority of the route, it was only constructed as a four-lane roadway along most of its length until it reached the junction of [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]] in Framingham where the roadway expanded to six lanes. Starting in 1968 the highway from the Interstate 84 interchange in Sturbridge to Route 9 was widened from its original four lanes to six; that widening project was completed around 1971. \nHowever, the mainline right-of-way was constructed to allow future expansion of the roadway, with most bridges over the highway built with the eight-lane roadway in mind, so few bridges had to be rebuilt when it was widened in the late 1960s.\n\n== 1970s through the 1990s ==\n\n=== New highway ===\nWhen designing the Central Artery/Tunnel project in the 1970s and 1980s, the horror stories regarding urban renewal projects such as the construction of the old viaduct in the 1950s weighed heavy on the minds of [[Frederick Salvucci]] and his team. It was realized early on that the Commonwealth could not just lay waste to parts of the city and pave them over; the state would have to ensure that construction would balance the needs of the highways against the livability of the city and neighborhoods the project would pass through. Mitigation efforts would be of utmost importance in moving ahead with the project.<ref>DOT{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Altshuler-95\">Altshuler, p. 95\u201396.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}</ref>\n\nGovernor [[Francis Sargent]] had shut down any ideas of further freeway construction within the MA Route 128 beltway in 1970, thereby cancelling both [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|the I-695 \"inner belt\"]] and the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] freeway projects, placing more emphasis on the already-completed Boston extension of I-90, and the work to eventually [[Big Dig|depress Boston's Central Artery below ground level]] as the only unbuilt freeway-related construction projects \"inside\" of Route 128 that would be allowed to go forward.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/greatprojects/interviews/salvucci_6.html</ref>\n\nThe notions of using existing rights of way or areas where neighborhood displacement would be minimized were applied to the second extension of the Turnpike as part of the CA/T project. Salvucci deliberately planned to bring the East Boston Extension through areas with little or no occupancy or those properties already owned by the Commonwealth. As a result, East Boston saw almost no takings of buildings or homes through eminent domain or the destruction of neighborhoods because construction was relegated to the then-unoccupied areas of the [[Seaport District|South Boston Seaport]] and [[Logan International Airport|Logan Airport]]. Like the first Turnpike extension, the connection of the Turnpike to East Boston was also designed to provide an economic stimulus to the city, this one to revitalize the desolate Seaport district.<ref name=\"Altshuler-95\"/>\n\n=== New interchanges ===\nDuring this time period, two new interchanges on the roadway had opened, one in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]], an interchange with the new [[Interstate 495 in Massachusetts|Interstate 495]], which was designated exit 11A, and the other in [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]], an interchange with the expanding [[Massachusetts Route 146]], which was designated exit 10A.\n\n== 2000s ==\n{{expand section|reason=No mention of the [[Big Dig]] project and subsequent extension to Route 1A at Logan Airport.|date=January 2020}}\nA pair of planned mass transit projects will also continue using the railway right of way to help build out the Turnpike.

French re-established control over the group in 1870, and later incorporated into the territory of [[French Polynesia]]. [[Paul Gauguin]] and other French artists traveled to the Marquesas Islands and other areas of Polynesia in the 19th century to live and work at his art. The islands were regularly visited by whaling and trading ships of various nations.\n\nOf all the major island groups of the [[Pacific]], the Marquesas Islands suffered the greatest population decline as a result of Eurasian endemic diseases carried by European explorers, which resulted in epidemics, particularly of [[smallpox]], to which they had no acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. The estimated 16th-century population of over 100,000 inhabitants, was reduced to about 20,000 by the middle of the nineteenth century, and to just over 2,000 by the beginning of the 1900s. During the course of the twentieth century, the population began to revive, increasing to about 8,500 by 2002, not including the Marquesan community residing on Tahiti.

{"title_page": "History of the Ministry of Defence Police", "text_new": "{{Main|Ministry of Defence Police}}\n\nThe [[Ministry of Defence Police]] (MDP) in the United Kingdom can trace its origins back to 1686, and has gone through a number of evolutions over the centuries to achieve its present-day form. Until late 1965, the [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]] were controlled by separate departments: the [[Board of Admiralty]], the [[Army Board]] and the [[Air Ministry]] respectively, each had its own [[Cabinet Minister]]. In that year it was decided that the three services should be placed under the control of one Minister of State for Defence, and the present [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] was formed.\n\nThe oldest centrally controlled military force in Britain is the Royal Navy; it was in 1686 that [[Samuel Pepys]] instigated a force of civilians to protect the Royal Naval dockyards. Although it wasn't until the early 19th century that Great Britain had an organised civilian police force, in 1834 the Royal Navy Dockyards were given their own uniformed police service.\nAs Britain's armed forces became more centrally organised in the late 19th century, other service establishments were allocated a police presence. The [[First World War]] brought about the formation of separated Army and Naval civilian police forces, to be joined in 1940's by the Air Force Constabulary during the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book |title= The History And Development Of The Ministry Of Defence Police From The 17th Century |publisher= DSDA Graphics Bath/MDP Museum DSDA00319 |year= 1998}}</ref>\n\n==Naval precursors==\n===1686: Porters, rounders, warders and watchmen===\n[[Image:Samuel Pepys.jpg|thumb|alt=Dockyard Police 1904|[[Samuel Pepys]] ordered the formation of a force of civilian warders to protect Naval dockyards in 1686]]\n\nSince medieval times there has always been an Army, until comparatively recent times, it consisted of separate bodies raised on a territorial basis; the formation of the [[Royal Air Force]] occurred only in the 20th century, after the development of [[Aviation history|manned human flight]].\n\nThe Royal Navy, as a department of central government, has existed since 1600 and as early as 1686 records show that the Admiralty was aware of the need for an organisation to prevent crime within its [[shipyard|dockyards]]. At that time, the Secretary for the Affairs of the Admiralty of England ([[Samuel Pepys]]), delivered to the special commissioners of the Navy an instruction which included the following:\n\n<blockquote>\"To enquire<!--see original--> after and make use of all means for preventing the embezzlement of any of our Stores, and to that end... to be frequent in visiting the Workmen at their departure out of our said Yards, keeping a Strict and Severe Eye upon the respective Porters of the same, and to the attendance given at the Gates... and lastly to be as frequent as he may, and the distance of Places will admit, in his nightly rounds in and about each of our said Yards, for discovering any unfaithfulness or neglect that may be found in the Watch, charged with the safety of our Stores during that Season\".</blockquote>\n\nAs a result of Pepys' instructions a force of \"Porters, Rounders, Warders and Watchmen\" was formed to guard the Naval yards.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThe roles performed by the first force of \"Porters, Rounders, Warders and Watchmen\" were as follows: Porters were responsible for identifying visitors and escorting them to the appropriate heads of departments; Rounders patrolled the Yard or, as their name implies, \"did the rounds\"; Warders were responsible for the keys and backed up the Porters at the gates; Watchmen, who were employed at night only, guarded or watched important buildings or areas. The latter were part-timers, being dockyard employees who remained in the Yard, on a roster basis\u2014every fourth night after carrying out their normal work and received an extra shilling for the duty. The Rounders appear to have been the senior branch of the force as they kept an eye on the other three bodies and frequently reported their misdemeanours to the Commissioner in charge of the Dockyard.\n\nApart from this civilian forces, there existed also a military force of [[Royal Marines|Marines]], comprising one [[subaltern]], a number of [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) and 36 [[private soldier|privates]]. Both the civil and military guards were closely linked and an indication of the economy practised in those days exists, in the form of the Daily Orders Book. The front cover of this book indicated that by reading it in a straightforward manner one would find the order applicable to the Military Guard, but by turning the book upside down and starting at the back the orders for the Civil Guard could be found. Both sets of orders were illuminating and often give examples of professional jealousy. The order book was in great demand by the commissioners during the period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a typical order being that issued on 27 January 1793 which read:<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\"A constant look out is to be kept at the gates to prevent admission of two strangers and if the discovery be made of two strangers about 6 feet high, one having a large purple scar upon the right side of his face, both of them speaking English, and appearing to be Englishmen\u2014if within the Gates they are to be stopped and if without some trusty person sent to watch them, and in either case the Commissioner is to be immediately informed thereof\".</blockquote>\n\nIn 1834 this force was disbanded and the first formal Dockyard Police was formed.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThere were constant changes in the organisation during the 18th century, caused mainly by the requirement for the Marine Guard to serve overseas but in 1861 this guard was finally abolished... \"except at Chatham, Portsmouth and such places as [[convicts]] were employed\".\n\nBy comparison with the police arrangements then existing throughout the country, the dockyard system was well organised but its fatal weakness was that the Watchmen and Rounders were still being selected from dockyard workers who performed these tasks in addition to their normal duties and in 1822 the commissioner at Portsmouth reported that:\n\n<blockquote>\"the night Rounders are men of the very best character selected from the Shipwrights of the Yard\" and that \"the Warders now at the Yard Gates are the best we have ever had, and by their strict attention to this part of their duty have become very obnoxious to the people in general\".</blockquote>\n\n===1834: The Dockyard Police===\nWhile the above events were taking place in the dockyards, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel's]] recommendations culminated in the creation of the [[Metropolitan Police]] (the Peelers) in 1829, and although there was no hint of the Admiralty looking upon this method of protection with any favour, on 20 May 1834 they disbanded the Porters, Rounders, Warders and Watchmen and introduced police forces; consisting of [[Special constable#United Kingdom|Special Constables]] for the dockyards and a smaller number of other establishments.\n\nIn forming these police forces they had the benefit of the advice of a superintendent of the newly formed Metropolitan Police whose greatest service was that he ensured they were formed in accordance with \"the new and advanced theories and ideals of police functions and duties which had been conceived and formulated by the Two Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police\" and which \"were quickly copied throughout the entire area of the Country and of the Empire\". Members of the new Dockyard Police forces were sworn in under a form of oath. This gave them full police powers within the limits of the dockyards; at a later stage, powers were given to operate under certain specific circumstances as policemen, in connection with offences committed by employees and naval personnel, within a radius of five miles outside the dockyard.\n\nThe conditions of employment in the new Dockyard Police forces were very good when compared with those of the majority of people during the 19th century. They received good wages, had the incentive of rewards, and could even take their families on overseas service (although \"family\" only included one child). Constables were paid 19 [[shilling]]s per week for a seven-day week and were allowed half pay\u2014up to a maximum of 28 days\u2014when on sick leave. This latter condition was one which did not apply to most employees in the country even one hundred years later. On the 28th day they were required to be fit for duty or, if unfit, were dismissed; if after dismissal they fully regained their health they were given preference for re-entry over all other applicants for employment with the force.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nReference to salaries paid to higher ranks is not made in the Dockyard Police Regulation Book but old dockyard standing orders show that in 1845 the Lieutenant Director was in receipt of \u00a3250 per annum plus fringe benefits\u2014in the form of 15 [[pence]] per night subsistence allowance paid for duties which kept him out of the yard all night\u2014together with expenses incurred in boat or carriage hire. A similar order, dated 6 December 1858 gives details of a pay rise for Serjeants who received \u00a31.4s.6d. for a seven-day week. No mention is made of Inspectors.\n\nAs has already been stated, in addition to normal pay, certain rewards were payable and one such incentive was promulgated in 1859, being a payment of \u00a32.10s.0d to policemen who detected persons embezzling government stores after such persons had been found guilty in a summary court; similar payments were made of up to \u00a310, in cases where offenders were convicted on indictment. No doubt there were cases where unscrupulous policemen made false accusations for financial gain, and this incentive has long since disappeared. Despite the relatively good conditions of service things did not appear to have been going at all well with the Dockyard Police forces, and eventually the Admiralty asked for an independent review of their efficiency. This task was allotted to Superintendent Mallelieu of the Metropolitan Police. He set about this in a thorough manner and his final report made it quite clear that, in general, the Dockyard Police forces were ill-trained and, in some instances, not devoting all their energy towards police duties.\n\nAs a consequence of this report, and despite such recommendations as training the forces along the Metropolitan Police's lines, increasing pay, and introducing a system whereby men frequently transferred from one establishment to another to avoid undue familiarity with employees\u2014many of whom were related to policemen of local origin. It was finally decided that the best answer was to disband the dockyard forces and introduce the Metropolitan Police into the Dockyards. So, after only 26 years, the dockyard police forces ceased to exist and the Admiralty establishments were, for the next 75 years, policed by the Metropolitan force. In fact, the Metropolitan Police already had experience of Dockyard work, having taken over the responsibility for the two yards at Deptford and Woolwich\u2014which were both already within the metropolitan district in 1841 but until 1858 they had been reluctant to accept any commitment outside the Metropolitan Police district.\n\nOn this occasion, however, the Metropolitan Commissioner, Sir [[Richard Mayne]] (KCB), raised no objection, merely stating that the proposals could be carried out \"by an adequate addition to his Force and such alteration to the Law as found necessary\". This latter comment was necessary so that authority might be given for the Metropolitan Police to operate outside both their own metropolitan district and the naval establishments for which they were responsible.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nOne of Superintendent Mallelieu's major recommendations was that the various establishments should \"be grouped together for police purposes\". Much later the Admiralty Constabulary (1943) was so organised, as was the present day MoD Police during the 1970s, and therefore a direct link existed between Supt Mallelieu, Sir Richard Mayne, the Metropolitan Police and the MoD Police.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===1860: The Metropolitan Police===\n[[File:Dockyardpolice1904.jpg|thumb|alt=Dockyard Police 1904|Dockyard Police Division 1904]]\n\nFollowing the necessary Act of Parliament in 1860 \u2013 the [[Metropolitan Police Act 1860]] \u2013 the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] took over policing of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] and [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyards]]. The smaller establishments in the same vicinities and the remaining naval establishments were quickly taken over, creating five devoted [[police division#United Kingdom|divisions]] (identified by numbers rather than by letters as were assigned to normal territorial Metropolitan Police divisions):\n#Woolwich Arsenal\n#Portsmouth\n#Devonport\n#Chatham\n#Pembroke\nA sixth, for [[Rosyth Dockyard]], was added on 1 January 1916.\n\nThere were 128 members of the Metropolitan Police employed at [[Deptford]] and [[Woolwich]]; and approximately 400 in the other Admiralty establishments. Superintendent Mallelieu was placed in overall charge with a rank \"Immediately below that of the Assistant Commissioners\". The Act of Parliament increased the geographical area of their powers to a radius of fifteen miles outside the establishment for which they were responsible, with the proviso that these powers were only to be exercised in respect of property of the Crown or persons subject to naval or military discipline. It was also authorised for the first time, their policing of certain army establishments. Another Act of Parliament \u2013 the [[Admiralty Powers, &c. Act 1865]] \u2013 followed in 1865, which gave considerable assistance to the police in that it made the [[admiral-superintendent]] of each yard a magistrate \u2013 thus giving him the authority to hear cases brought before him by the Metropolitan Police.\n\nCells were built adjacent to the main police offices and offenders were kept in them overnight after being charged and brought before the Admiral the next day. The admiral-superintendent could, if he found them guilty, impose a fine or term of imprisonment.\n\nAs magistrates, the various admirals-superintendent were also able to issue [[search warrant]]s which, again, made life much easier for the police. Many of the traditions of the dockyard police and watchmen before them, were carried on by the Metropolitan Police. They continued to serve in the dual role of policemen and firemen; they carried deputations from [[HM Customs and Excise]] to assist in the prevention of smuggling, and in the early days they were still responsible for seeing that convicts employed in the yard did not loiter or evade work. The Metropolitan Police also formed a Water Police Branch. At Devonport Dockyard the whole of that branch lived on an old hulk which had at one time been commissioned as the [[fifth-rate|fifth-rate warship]] [[HMS Leda (1828)|HMS ''Leda'']]. There was an inspector in charge who was allocated what had been the captain's quarters and the remainder of the men lived in the rest of the ship's accommodation. If they were married their families also lived in this accommodation with them. The main difficulty appeared to be that of cooking facilities, as there was only one galley, which had to be allocated in strict rotation.\n\nOriginally the men were required to row one complete patrol of the harbour during each shift, but as time went on they managed to obtain the use of steam pinnaces or large coal-burning vessels the size of tugs. Their duties must have been arduous as their powers covered the whole of the waters, which comprised the Port of Plymouth and extended as far as the tidal waters flowed. Is some cases the tide flows upriver for twenty miles, so in the days when they used boats propelled by oars an emergency call to distant parts would have fully tested the endurance of all concerned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfoa.co.uk/216/the-met-dockyard-divisions-1860-1934|title=The Met Dockyard Divisions 1860 -1934|accessdate=10 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110212254/http://www.pfoa.co.uk/216/the-met-dockyard-divisions-1860-1934|archive-date=2015-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1922: The Royal Marine Police===\nAfter the [[World War I|First World War]] there was a general call for economy throughout the country which was in a state of economic depression and furthermore the Metropolitan Force were under very great pressure in the London area from the effects of the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike]].\n\nIn [[March 1922 in the United Kingdom|June 1922, the Geddes Committee on National Expenditure]] recommended the withdrawal from the dockyards of the Metropolitan Police and the Admiralty at that time decided to institute a force to be known as the Royal Marine Police to replace the Metropolitan Force.\n\nThe Royal Marine Police was created by an Order in Council and came into being on 13 October 1922. It was administered by the Adjutant General Royal Marines and attached for records, pay, clothing and discipline to the three Royal Marine Divisions at Chatham, Portsmouth and Plymouth (Devonport).\n\nAll the members were sworn in as special constables under the [[Special Constables Act 1923]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} but were, as the name implies, originally serving and retired members of the Corps of Royal Marines{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} and they were all subject to military law under the provisions of the Army Act.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Pensioners from the Royal Navy were subsequently and reluctantly accepted. A chief constable was appointed in 1932 but the replacement of the Metropolitan Police was not completed until 1934 due in part to the Admiralty's desire to proceed cautiously. Initially, members of this new Force were recruited according to their previous ranks in the Armed Forces, ex-NCO's being recruited as Constables in the main and ex-Officers as Chief Inspector and above. This method created a semi-military force as the lower ranks still served under men who had commanded them in the RM or RN. They were subject to Military Law as has already been stated and furthermore during their first two years service they were required to purchase their discharge if they wished to leave the Force. During the first year's service the discharge fee was \u00a320 and during the second year, \u00a310.\n\nThe Royal Marine Police had little time to establish themselves before the Second World War of 1939 was upon them. The restrictive practice of recruiting only RN and RM pensioners showed its weakness with the drying up of the source of supply, men who expected to retire from the Forces being retained for the duration of the War. To counter this the rules were amended to permit ex-servicemen from any branch of the Armed Forces to enlist in a new section of the force known as the Royal   Marine Police Special Reserve. This still failed to achieve its aim and a third force, the Admiralty Civil Police was formed and anyone, regardless of former military service, could join. In fact, many men who did join that Force were allowed to do so as an alternative to joining the Armed Forces.\n\nConsequently, at the end of the War in 1945, the Admiralty found itself with three police forces, each with different conditions of service and discipline, but all under the same Chief Constable. This situation was obviously undesirable and inefficient and in October 1949 the three forces were disbanded and the Admiralty Constabulary was formed.\n\n===1949: The Admiralty Constabulary===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}\nAt the time of its formation the Constabulary comprised some 3500 men policing some 150 separate Naval establishments throughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nTraining in the Royal Marine Police and its associated forces had been limited to a 3-week course in one of the main dock yards where a self-taught instructor would endeavour to initiate recruits after reading various Acts of Parliament and books of Law. Whether the system was efficient or not, the force survived and managed to get good results. With the formation of the [[Admiralty Constabulary]], however, the previous unreliable training methods were recognised and a training School was inaugurated. Volunteers were called to fill posts as instructors and successful applicants were sent on a six-month course of tuition at various local police colleges to ensure they were fitted for the task.\n\n==War Office/Army Department Constabulary==\n[[File:WarOfficeConstabulary 1939.jpg|thumb|alt=War Office Constabulary 1939|A War Office Constabulary post circa 1939]]\n\nAs far as is known, the Army used serving soldiers to guard their establishments in the early days and as the employment of civilians by the Army was minimal, there was little call for a civilian police force, except for places such as the [[Royal Arsenal|Royal Arsenal at Woolwich]]. Consequently, the first records of police in the Army Dept appear circa 1860 when [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] were called upon to police The Royal Arsenal. This was a straightforward arrangement as [[Woolwich]] is in London. In 1925, it was found necessary for the Army to have a civilian police of its own principally for investigation amid a climate of hysteria over an alleged huge German spy network. A force was formed under the auspices of that department which became known later as [[MI5]]. This was soon followed by the inauguration of a dedicated [[War Department (United Kingdom)|War Department]] Constabulary. This force derived its authority from various Acts of Parliament notably the [[Metropolitan Police Act|Metropolitan Police Act 1860]] Which States:\n<blockquote> \"...may be authorised and specially sworn to execute the office of constable within all or any of Her Majesty's Dockyards, victualing yards, steam factory yards and in principle stations of the War Department in England and Wales and within 75 miles of such yards or station...with regard to property of the Crown or of persons subject to Naval, Marine or Military discipline\" </blockquote><ref>{{cite web|url=http://legislation.data.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/23-24/135/data.htm?wrap=true|title=Metropolitan Police Act 1860|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>\nThis Act was later expanded to cover Scotland.\n\nThis Constabulary was responsible for the policing of some 60 stations throughout the UK for the War Office, plus a number of Ministry of Aviation Establishments, and also employed on certain other duties in London. The force was also responsible for security of the [[Royal Mint]]. The initial strength was 2100 but this was later reduced by the transfer of around 300 men to the newly formed [[UK Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary|Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary]] which took over the responsibility of Atomic Stations from the War Department Constabulary in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnc.police.uk/files/cnc_history.pdf|title=Civil Nuclear Constabulary|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nApplicants for the force were required to be Sergeants or above from the Army, or Corporals from the [[Royal Military Police]]. They were required to be of ''Exemplary Character'', if possible to be in possession of the [[Long Service and Good Conduct Medal]] with a 22-year service pension. They were given a four-week training course before joining a station and were on three months\u2019 probation, at the end of which they were required to pass an examination.\n\nPromotion up to Superintendent was from within the ranks of the force.\n\nWhere it was not possible to recruit regular constables, a small number of Auxiliary Police Constables, with lower qualifications on entry, and lower pay were employed.\n\nThe Force was renamed \"[[Army Department Constabulary]]\" in 1964 when the War Office became The Army Department.\n\n==The Air Ministry/Air Force Department Constabulary==\n{{main|Air Force Department Constabulary}}\nPolicing at airports and premises of the [[Air Ministry]] was originally the responsibility of the Metropolitan Police and local constabularies. The Special Constables Act 1923 saw the creation of a permanent '''Air Ministry Constabulary'''. In 1948, responsibility for civilian airports was transferred to the [[Ministry of Civil Aviation (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Civil Aviation]], and a new police force, the [[Ministry of Civil Aviation Constabulary]] was formed, leaving the Air Ministry Constabulary with responsibility for military airfields only.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brevities|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1948/1948%20-%201163.html|accessdate=25 May 2011|newspaper=[[Flight International]]|date=29 July 1948}}</ref> The Air Ministry was re-organised in 1964, and the force was renamed the '''Air Force Department Constabulary'''.\n\n==Ministry of Defence Police==\n===1971: Ministry of Defence Police===\nThe renaming of the Army and Air Force Departments from the War Office and the Air Ministry took place as the result of a decision to combine these departments together with the Admiralty (known now as the Navy Department) under the control of a new unified [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 1965. This was natural evolution based on the experience gained in the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939\u20131945) when the need for combined operations became obvious, and more than just a liaison between the three armed services was essential.\n\nAmalgamation of the three separate departmental police forces into the new \u201cMinistry Of Defence Police (MDP)\u201d followed in October 1971.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s became busy periods for the new style MDP, as after the relatively quiet post World War Two period of the 1950s and 1960s, they now had to deal with the new and serious threat to Military and Defence establishments of [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republican Terrorism]],  from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA). Terrorists scored successes against a number of defence installations from the [[1972 Aldershot Bombing]] to the [[Deal barracks bombing|1989 Deal barracks bombing]]. It was very real threat of Irish Republican terrorism to the Defence Estate and personnel that became the MDPs main effort for 20 years and ensured that the MDP received a healthy budget from Government well into the late 1990s.\n[[File:MDP Greenhamcommon1982.jpg|thumb|alt=MDP RAF Greenham Common 1982|MDP face a protest from [[Peace Women]] at [[USAF Greenham Common]] in 1982]]\n\nDuring the early 1980s the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], a British Anti-nuclear protest movement, which had been dormant since the late 1960s, enjoyed a surge in popularity. Driven by the real public fears of nuclear war between [[Cold War|NATO and the Soviet Union]]. Most notable was the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|peace camp]] and very large protests against the deployment of [[BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile|US Cruise Missiles]] at the [[RAF Greenham Common|USAF (RAF) Greenham Common]] and other UK locations; and regular largescale protests at the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment Aldermaston]].\n\nWhen the MDP left the 1960s the force did little more than man gates, check passes and occasionally patrol fence lines armed with nothing more than a pistol.  During the 1970s-1980s the force had to rapidly adapt to the changing threat of being faced with a professional paramilitary enemy or dealing with large scale public anti-nuclear protests. By the end of the late 1980s the MDP was well equipped, all armed and trained to deal with the threats it faced, and comparable to other UK police forces.\n\nStill, by the mid-1980s the majority of MDP tasking was \u201dbehind the wire\u201d, i.e. within the secure perimeters of the Defence establishments it policed. Increasingly the MDP was required to work outside the wire, to interdict terrorists before they attacked the establishment or securing Defence estate that the public had access to. The threat from the [[Barrack buster|PIRA Improvised Mortar campaign]] of the 1980s was one of the driving factors that forced the issue that the MDP required a formal legislative framework to perform its duties outside the wire; and more extensive police powers, in what later became the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987\n\n===1974: Female police officers===\n[[Image:Female with SA80A2.jpg|thumb|alt=Female MDP Officer on duty with L85A1|Female MDP Officer on duty with [[L85A1|L85A1 Assault Rifle]]]]\nDespite HDPFs having female police officers since 1915,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.met.police.uk/history/women_police.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-05 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081108010707/http://www.met.police.uk/history/women_police.htm |archive-date=2008-11-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> there were no female police officers in the MDP until 1974.<ref name=\"History\"/>\nIn that year two female sergeants transferred into the MDP, one from [[Strathclyde Police]] and one from [[List of defunct law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom|British Airports Police]].\n\nThe first four female MDP recruits started their training on recruit course in January 1975. Skirts and tunics had to be made to measure for them as there was no stock of female uniforms held. They were issued with truncheons, but they found that they had no pockets to put them in.

This was a landmark in the MDP's history as it was the first British police to become an agency.\n\nThe MDP was formally launched as an Agency on 24 April 1996 by the Hon. [[Nicholas Soames]], Minister of State for the Armed Forces. The Agency operated under the Secretary of State for Defence, who has ultimate responsibility for determining the size, policy and resources of the force. These responsibilities were delegated to the Second Permanent Under-Secretary of State who was also Chairman of the MOD Police Committee.\n\nThe Chief Constable has the exclusive statutory authority for the professional direction and control of all MDP officers and also direct access to the Secretary for Defence, to whom he is ultimately responsible. Additionally, the Chief Constable is responsible to Parliament for the propriety and regularity of the agency's expenditure in compliance with Treasury and Departmental rules.\n\nThe MDP Agency provisions were reframed on the formation of the [[Ministry of Defence Police and Guarding Agency]].\n\nIn 1995 the MDP moved its headquarters and training centre to the recently vacated USAF Airbase at [[RAF Wethersfield]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===2000 - 2009:  Extended jurisdiction, Al-Qaeda and enhanced capability===\n[[File:MOD Plod Ship 2007.jpg|thumb|MDP Officers conducting firearms search of a warship 2007]]\n\nUnder the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987, MDP officers had the powers of police constables, but-broadly speaking only on Defence land or in respect of the actions of Defence personnel. In addition they had constabulary powers when requested to act by an officer from a Home Department police force (HDPF) \"in the vicinity\" of Defence land. The problem was that these powers left MDP officers unable to act in an emergency if confronted by serious criminal acts off defence land, and failed to define the term \"in the vicinity\". Or give powers to deal with offences against Defence personnel off Defence land, nor to act under certain sections of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]].\n\nBecause of the rapid evolution of the role of the MDP from purely \"guarding behind the wire\" to more mobile policing of the Defence Estate and Defence interests.  The Chief Constable MDP lobbied for additional powers to give the force a more robust legislative framework. This was agreed in principle by Government; to be included in the [[Armed Forces Act 2001|Armed Forces Bill 2000]], but was eventually dropped because of lack of Parliamentary time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmhaff/886/886we09.htm|title=House of Commons - Home Affairs - Written Evidence|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe requested extra powers were resurrected and put before Parliament in 2001, due (according to ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' newspapers) because of the events of the [[fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests of 2000]], which brought the UK to a standstill in 2000.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/nov/16/ukcrime.september11 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor | title=Terrorism bill gives new powers to MoD police | date=16 November 2001}}</ref> The Labour government under [[Tony Blair|Prime Minister Tony Blair]] planned to use the MDP to aid fuel convoys and police picketed oil refineries, but the government was told that it would be unlawful under the then legislation to do so.<ref>[http://www.spectator.co.uk/spectator/thisweek/8749/part_2/a-national-police-force-is-being-assembled-and-newspapers-are-looking-the-other-way.thtml ]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}</ref>  The additional powers, subsequently known as \u2018Extended Jurisdiction\u2019, were then included in the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001|Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security (ATCS) Act 2001]].\n\nDespite \u2018Extended Jurisdiction\u2019 the MDP still do not, with notable exceptions such as garrison towns, police the public directly.

(This does not include providing specialist MDP Protester Removal Teams).\n\nShortly after Extended Jurisdiction came into force, the US [[September 11 attacks]] completely changed the national security landscape and [[al-Qaeda|al-Qaeda/Islamist terrorism]] became the MDP's principle threat.  The MDP already extensively \u201cworking outside the wire\u201d formed a number of Area Police Teams (APT), which were teams of mobile officers who would undertake mobile armed counter-terrorism patrols and local crime surge operations of the Defence Estate and defence interests. Prior to this, the force had been organised around Operational Command Units (OCU) based on static Defence locations. The APTs were never adequately funded and quickly, due to pressure on the Defence Budget in 2004, by both the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] campaigns, these teams were rationalised to work at Divisional not Area level and became known as Divisional Support Groups (DSG) a role which continues today.\n\n[[Image:MDP exeter 2006.jpg|thumb|Extended Jurisdiction: A MDP officer accompanied by a [[Royal Military Police|RMP]] NCO patrol Exeter city centre on OP Dissuade \u2013 the policing of alcohol-related disorder by off-duty service personnel]]\n\nOn the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] the UK was hit by directly by Islamist terrorism.

Until late 1965, the [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]] were controlled by separate departments: the [[Board of Admiralty]], the [[Army Board]] and the [[Air Ministry]] respectively, each had its own [[Cabinet Minister]]. In that year it was decided that the three services should be placed under the control of one Minister of State for Defence, and the present [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] was formed.\n\nThe oldest centrally controlled military force in Britain is the Royal Navy; it was in 1686 that [[Samuel Pepys]] instigated a force of civilians to protect the Royal Naval dockyards. Although it wasn\u2019t until the early 19th century that Great Britain had an organised civilian police force, in 1834 the Royal Navy Dockyards were given their own uniformed police service.\nAs Britain\u2019s armed forces became more centrally organised in the late 19th century, other service establishments were allocated a police presence. The [[First World War]] brought about the formation of separated Army and Naval civilian police forces, to be joined in 1940's by the Air Force Constabulary during the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book |title= The History And Development Of The Ministry Of Defence Police From The 17th Century |publisher= DSDA Graphics Bath/MDP Museum DSDA00319 |year= 1998}}</ref>\n\n==Naval precursors==\n===1686: Porters, rounders, warders and watchmen===\n[[Image:Samuel Pepys.jpg|thumb|alt=Dockyard Police 1904|[[Samuel Pepys]] ordered the formation of a force of civilian warders to protect Naval dockyards in 1686]]\n\nSince medieval times there has always been an Army, until comparatively recent times, it consisted of separate bodies raised on a territorial basis; the formation of the [[Royal Air Force]] occurred only in the 20th century, after the development of [[Aviation history|manned human flight]].\n\nThe Royal Navy, as a department of central government, has existed since 1600 and as early as 1686 records show that the Admiralty was aware of the need for an organisation to prevent crime within its [[shipyard|dockyards]]. At that time, the Secretary for the Affairs of the Admiralty of England ([[Samuel Pepys]]), delivered to the special commissioners of the Navy an instruction which included the following:\n\n<blockquote>\"To enquire<!--see original--> after and make use of all means for preventing the embezzlement of any of our Stores, and to that end... to be frequent in visiting the Workmen at their departure out of our said Yards, keeping a Strict and Severe Eye upon the respective Porters of the same, and to the attendance given at the Gates... and lastly to be as frequent as he may, and the distance of Places will admit, in his nightly rounds in and about each of our said Yards, for discovering any unfaithfulness or neglect that may be found in the Watch, charged with the safety of our Stores during that Season\".</blockquote>\n\nAs a result of Pepys' instructions a force of \"Porters, Rounders, Warders and Watchmen\" was formed to guard the Naval yards.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThe roles performed by the first force of \"Porters, Rounders, Warders and Watchmen\" were as follows: Porters were responsible for identifying visitors and escorting them to the appropriate heads of departments; Rounders patrolled the Yard or, as their name implies, \"did the rounds\"; Warders were responsible for the keys and backed up the Porters at the gates; Watchmen, who were employed at night only, guarded or watched important buildings or areas. The latter were part-timers, being dockyard employees who remained in the Yard, on a roster basis\u2014every fourth night after carrying out their normal work and received an extra shilling for the duty. The Rounders appear to have been the senior branch of the force as they kept an eye on the other three bodies and frequently reported their misdemeanours to the Commissioner in charge of the Dockyard.\n\nApart from this civilian forces, there existed also a military force of [[Royal Marines|Marines]], comprising one [[subaltern]], a number of [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) and 36 [[private soldier|privates]]. Both the civil and military guards were closely linked and an indication of the economy practised in those days exists, in the form of the Daily Orders Book. The front cover of this book indicated that by reading it in a straightforward manner one would find the order applicable to the Military Guard, but by turning the book upside down and starting at the back the orders for the Civil Guard could be found. Both sets of orders were illuminating and often give examples of professional jealousy. The order book was in great demand by the commissioners during the period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a typical order being that issued on 27 January 1793 which read:<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\"A constant look out is to be kept at the gates to prevent admission of two strangers and if the discovery be made of two strangers about 6 feet high, one having a large purple scar upon the right side of his face, both of them speaking English, and appearing to be Englishmen\u2014if within the Gates they are to be stopped and if without some trusty person sent to watch them, and in either case the Commissioner is to be immediately informed thereof\".</blockquote>\n\nIn 1834 this force was disbanded and the first formal Dockyard Police was formed.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThere were constant changes in the organisation during the 18th century, caused mainly by the requirement for the Marine Guard to serve overseas but in 1861 this guard was finally abolished... \"except at Chatham, Portsmouth and such places as [[convicts]] were employed\".\n\nBy comparison with the police arrangements then existing throughout the country, the dockyard system was well organised but its fatal weakness was that the Watchmen and Rounders were still being selected from dockyard workers who performed these tasks in addition to their normal duties and in 1822 the commissioner at Portsmouth reported that:\n\n<blockquote>\"the night Rounders are men of the very best character selected from the Shipwrights of the Yard\" and that \"the Warders now at the Yard Gates are the best we have ever had, and by their strict attention to this part of their duty have become very obnoxious to the people in general\".</blockquote>\n\n===1834: The Dockyard Police===\nWhile the above events were taking place in the dockyards, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel's]] recommendations culminated in the creation of the [[Metropolitan Police]] (the Peelers) in 1829, and although there was no hint of the Admiralty looking upon this method of protection with any favour, on 20 May 1834 they disbanded the Porters, Rounders, Warders and Watchmen and introduced police forces; consisting of [[Special constable#United Kingdom|Special Constables]] for the dockyards and a smaller number of other establishments.\n\nIn forming these police forces they had the benefit of the advice of a superintendent of the newly formed Metropolitan Police whose greatest service was that he ensured they were formed in accordance with \"the new and advanced theories and ideals of police functions and duties which had been conceived and formulated by the Two Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police\" and which \"were quickly copied throughout the entire area of the Country and of the Empire\". Members of the new Dockyard Police forces were sworn in under a form of oath. This gave them full police powers within the limits of the dockyards; at a later stage, powers were given to operate under certain specific circumstances as policemen, in connection with offences committed by employees and naval personnel, within a radius of five miles outside the dockyard.\n\nThe conditions of employment in the new Dockyard Police forces were very good when compared with those of the majority of people during the 19th century. They received good wages, had the incentive of rewards, and could even take their families on overseas service (although \"family\" only included one child). Constables were paid 19 [[shilling]]s per week for a seven-day week and were allowed half pay\u2014up to a maximum of 28 days\u2014when on sick leave. This latter condition was one which did not apply to most employees in the country even one hundred years later. On the 28th day they were required to be fit for duty or, if unfit, were dismissed; if after dismissal they fully regained their health they were given preference for re-entry over all other applicants for employment with the force.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nReference to salaries paid to higher ranks is not made in the Dockyard Police Regulation Book but old dockyard standing orders show that in 1845 the Lieutenant Director was in receipt of \u00a3250 per annum plus fringe benefits\u2014in the form of 15 [[pence]] per night subsistence allowance paid for duties which kept him out of the yard all night\u2014together with expenses incurred in boat or carriage hire. A similar order, dated 6 December 1858 gives details of a pay rise for Serjeants who received \u00a31.4s.6d. for a seven-day week. No mention is made of Inspectors.\n\nAs has already been stated, in addition to normal pay, certain rewards were payable and one such incentive was promulgated in 1859, being a payment of \u00a32.10s.0d to policemen who detected persons embezzling government stores after such persons had been found guilty in a summary court; similar payments were made of up to \u00a310, in cases where offenders were convicted on indictment. No doubt there were cases where unscrupulous policemen made false accusations for financial gain, and this incentive has long since disappeared. Despite the relatively good conditions of service things did not appear to have been going at all well with the Dockyard Police forces, and eventually the Admiralty asked for an independent review of their efficiency. This task was allotted to Superintendent Mallelieu of the Metropolitan Police. He set about this in a thorough manner and his final report made it quite clear that, in general, the Dockyard Police forces were ill-trained and, in some instances, not devoting all their energy towards police duties.\n\nAs a consequence of this report, and despite such recommendations as training the forces along the Metropolitan Police's lines, increasing pay, and introducing a system whereby men frequently transferred from one establishment to another to avoid undue familiarity with employees\u2014many of whom were related to policemen of local origin. It was finally decided that the best answer was to disband the dockyard forces and introduce the Metropolitan Police into the Dockyards. So, after only 26 years, the dockyard police forces ceased to exist and the Admiralty establishments were, for the next 75 years, policed by the Metropolitan force. In fact, the Metropolitan Police already had experience of Dockyard work, having taken over the responsibility for the two yards at Deptford and Woolwich\u2014which were both already within the metropolitan district in 1841 but until 1858 they had been reluctant to accept any commitment outside the Metropolitan Police district.\n\nOn this occasion, however, the Metropolitan Commissioner, Sir [[Richard Mayne]] (KCB), raised no objection, merely stating that the proposals could be carried out \"by an adequate addition to his Force and such alteration to the Law as found necessary\". This latter comment was necessary so that authority might be given for the Metropolitan Police to operate outside both their own metropolitan district and the naval establishments for which they were responsible.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nOne of Superintendent Mallelieu's major recommendations was that the various establishments should \"be grouped together for police purposes\". Much later the Admiralty Constabulary (1943) was so organised, as was the present day MoD Police during the 1970s, and therefore a direct link existed between Supt Mallelieu, Sir Richard Mayne, the Metropolitan Police and the MoD Police.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===1860: The Metropolitan Police===\n[[File:Dockyardpolice1904.jpg|thumb|alt=Dockyard Police 1904|Dockyard Police Division 1904]]\n\nFollowing the necessary Act of Parliament in 1860 \u2013 the [[Metropolitan Police Act 1860]] \u2013 the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] took over policing of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] and [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyards]]. The smaller establishments in the same vicinities and the remaining naval establishments were quickly taken over, creating five devoted [[police division#United Kingdom|divisions]] (identified by numbers rather than by letters as were assigned to normal territorial Metropolitan Police divisions):\n#Woolwich Arsenal\n#Portsmouth\n#Devonport\n#Chatham\n#Pembroke\nA sixth, for [[Rosyth Dockyard]], was added on 1 January 1916.\n\nThere were 128 members of the Metropolitan Police employed at [[Deptford]] and [[Woolwich]]; and approximately 400 in the other Admiralty establishments. Superintendent Mallelieu was placed in overall charge with a rank \"Immediately below that of the Assistant Commissioners\". The Act of Parliament increased the geographical area of their powers to a radius of fifteen miles outside the establishment for which they were responsible, with the proviso that these powers were only to be exercised in respect of property of the Crown or persons subject to naval or military discipline. It was also authorised for the first time, their policing of certain army establishments. Another Act of Parliament \u2013 the [[Admiralty Powers, &c. Act 1865]] \u2013 followed in 1865, which gave considerable assistance to the police in that it made the [[admiral-superintendent]] of each yard a magistrate \u2013 thus giving him the authority to hear cases brought before him by the Metropolitan Police.\n\nCells were built adjacent to the main police offices and offenders were kept in them overnight after being charged and brought before the Admiral the next day. The admiral-superintendent could, if he found them guilty, impose a fine or term of imprisonment.\n\nAs magistrates, the various admirals-superintendent were also able to issue [[search warrant]]s which, again, made life much easier for the police. Many of the traditions of the dockyard police and watchmen before them, were carried on by the Metropolitan Police. They continued to serve in the dual role of policemen and firemen; they carried deputations from [[HM Customs and Excise]] to assist in the prevention of smuggling, and in the early days they were still responsible for seeing that convicts employed in the yard did not loiter or evade work. The Metropolitan Police also formed a Water Police Branch. At Devonport Dockyard the whole of that branch lived on an old hulk which had at one time been commissioned as the [[fifth-rate|fifth-rate warship]] [[HMS Leda (1828)|HMS ''Leda'']]. There was an inspector in charge who was allocated what had been the captain's quarters and the remainder of the men lived in the rest of the ship's accommodation. If they were married their families also lived in this accommodation with them. The main difficulty appeared to be that of cooking facilities, as there was only one galley, which had to be allocated in strict rotation.\n\nOriginally the men were required to row one complete patrol of the harbour during each shift, but as time went on they managed to obtain the use of steam pinnaces or large coal-burning vessels the size of tugs. Their duties must have been arduous as their powers covered the whole of the waters, which comprised the Port of Plymouth and extended as far as the tidal waters flowed. Is some cases the tide flows upriver for twenty miles, so in the days when they used boats propelled by oars an emergency call to distant parts would have fully tested the endurance of all concerned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfoa.co.uk/216/the-met-dockyard-divisions-1860-1934|title=The Met Dockyard Divisions 1860 -1934|accessdate=10 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110212254/http://www.pfoa.co.uk/216/the-met-dockyard-divisions-1860-1934|archive-date=2015-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1922: The Royal Marine Police===\nAfter the [[World War I|First World War]] there was a general call for economy throughout the country which was in a state of economic depression and furthermore the Metropolitan Force were under very great pressure in the London area from the effects of the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike]].\n\nIn [[March 1922 in the United Kingdom|June 1922, the Geddes Committee on National Expenditure]] recommended the withdrawal from the dockyards of the Metropolitan Police and the Admiralty at that time decided to institute a force to be known as the Royal Marine Police to replace the Metropolitan Force.\n\nThe Royal Marine Police was created by an Order in Council and came into being on 13 October 1922. It was administered by the Adjutant General Royal Marines and attached for records, pay, clothing and discipline to the three Royal Marine Divisions at Chatham, Portsmouth and Plymouth (Devonport).\n\nAll the members were sworn in as special constables under the [[Special Constables Act 1923]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} but were, as the name implies, originally serving and retired members of the Corps of Royal Marines{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} and they were all subject to military law under the provisions of the Army Act.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Pensioners from the Royal Navy were subsequently and reluctantly accepted. A chief constable was appointed in 1932 but the replacement of the Metropolitan Police was not completed until 1934 due in part to the Admiralty's desire to proceed cautiously. Initially, members of this new Force were recruited according to their previous ranks in the Armed Forces, ex-NCO's being recruited as Constables in the main and ex-Officers as Chief Inspector and above. This method created a semi-military force as the lower ranks still served under men who had commanded them in the RM or RN. They were subject to Military Law as has already been stated and furthermore during their first two years service they were required to purchase their discharge if they wished to leave the Force. During the first year's service the discharge fee was \u00a320 and during the second year, \u00a310.\n\nThe Royal Marine Police had little time to establish themselves before the Second World War of 1939 was upon them. The restrictive practice of recruiting only RN and RM pensioners showed its weakness with the drying up of the source of supply, men who expected to retire from the Forces being retained for the duration of the War. To counter this the rules were amended to permit ex-servicemen from any branch of the Armed Forces to enlist in a new section of the force known as the Royal   Marine Police Special Reserve. This still failed to achieve its aim and a third force, the Admiralty Civil Police was formed and anyone, regardless of former military service, could join. In fact, many men who did join that Force were allowed to do so as an alternative to joining the Armed Forces.\n\nConsequently, at the end of the War in 1945, the Admiralty found itself with three police forces, each with different conditions of service and discipline, but all under the same Chief Constable. This situation was obviously undesirable and inefficient and in October 1949 the three forces were disbanded and the Admiralty Constabulary was formed.\n\n===1949: The Admiralty Constabulary===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}\nAt the time of its formation the Constabulary comprised some 3500 men policing some 150 separate Naval establishments throughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nTraining in the Royal Marine Police and its associated forces had been limited to a 3-week course in one of the main dock yards where a self-taught instructor would endeavour to initiate recruits after reading various Acts of Parliament and books of Law. Whether the system was efficient or not, the force survived and managed to get good results. With the formation of the [[Admiralty Constabulary]], however, the previous unreliable training methods were recognised and a training School was inaugurated. Volunteers were called to fill posts as instructors and successful applicants were sent on a six-month course of tuition at various local police colleges to ensure they were fitted for the task.\n\n==War Office/Army Department Constabulary==\n[[File:WarOfficeConstabulary 1939.jpg|thumb|alt=War Office Constabulary 1939|A War Office Constabulary post circa 1939]]\n\nAs far as is known, the Army used serving soldiers to guard their establishments in the early days and as the employment of civilians by the Army was minimal, there was little call for a civilian police force, except for places such as the [[Royal Arsenal|Royal Arsenal at Woolwich]]. Consequently, the first records of police in the Army Dept appear circa 1860 when [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] were called upon to police The Royal Arsenal. This was a straightforward arrangement as [[Woolwich]] is in London. In 1925, it was found necessary for the Army to have a civilian police of its own principally for investigation amid a climate of hysteria over an alleged huge German spy network. A force was formed under the auspices of that department which became known later as [[MI5]]. This was soon followed by the inauguration of a dedicated [[War Department (United Kingdom)|War Department]] Constabulary. This force derived its authority from various Acts of Parliament notably the [[Metropolitan Police Act|Metropolitan Police Act 1860]] Which States:\n<blockquote> \"...may be authorised and specially sworn to execute the office of constable within all or any of Her Majesty's Dockyards, victualing yards, steam factory yards and in principle stations of the War Department in England and Wales and within 75 miles of such yards or station...with regard to property of the Crown or of persons subject to Naval, Marine or Military discipline\" </blockquote><ref>{{cite web|url=http://legislation.data.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/23-24/135/data.htm?wrap=true|title=Metropolitan Police Act 1860|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>\nThis Act was later expanded to cover Scotland.\n\nThis Constabulary was responsible for the policing of some 60 stations throughout the UK for the War Office, plus a number of Ministry of Aviation Establishments, and also employed on certain other duties in London. The force was also responsible for security of the [[Royal Mint]]. The initial strength was 2100 but this was later reduced by the transfer of around 300 men to the newly formed [[UK Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary|Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary]] which took over the responsibility of Atomic Stations from the War Department Constabulary in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnc.police.uk/files/cnc_history.pdf|title=Civil Nuclear Constabulary|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nApplicants for the force were required to be Sergeants or above from the Army, or Corporals from the [[Royal Military Police]]. They were required to be of ''Exemplary Character'', if possible to be in possession of the [[Long Service and Good Conduct Medal]] with a 22-year service pension. They were given a four-week training course before joining a station and were on three months\u2019 probation, at the end of which they were required to pass an examination.\n\nPromotion up to Superintendent was from within the ranks of the force.\n\nWhere it was not possible to recruit regular constables, a small number of Auxiliary Police Constables, with lower qualifications on entry, and lower pay were employed.\n\nThe Force was renamed \"[[Army Department Constabulary]]\" in 1964 when the War Office became The Army Department.\n\n==The Air Ministry/Air Force Department Constabulary==\n{{main|Air Force Department Constabulary}}\nPolicing at airports and premises of the [[Air Ministry]] was originally the responsibility of the Metropolitan Police and local constabularies. The Special Constables Act 1923 saw the creation of a permanent '''Air Ministry Constabulary'''. In 1948, responsibility for civilian airports was transferred to the [[Ministry of Civil Aviation (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Civil Aviation]], and a new police force, the [[Ministry of Civil Aviation Constabulary]] was formed, leaving the Air Ministry Constabulary with responsibility for military airfields only.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brevities|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1948/1948%20-%201163.html|accessdate=25 May 2011|newspaper=[[Flight International]]|date=29 July 1948}}</ref> The Air Ministry was re-organised in 1964, and the force was renamed the '''Air Force Department Constabulary'''.\n\n==Ministry of Defence Police==\n===1971: Ministry of Defence Police===\nThe renaming of the Army and Air Force Departments from the War Office and the Air Ministry took place as the result of a decision to combine these departments together with the Admiralty (known now as the Navy Department) under the control of a new unified [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 1965. This was natural evolution based on the experience gained in the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939\u20131945) when the need for combined operations became obvious, and more than just a liaison between the three armed services was essential.\n\nAmalgamation of the three separate departmental police forces into the new \u201cMinistry Of Defence Police (MDP)\u201d followed in October 1971.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s became busy periods for the new style MDP, as after the relatively quiet post World War Two period of the 1950s and 1960s, they now had to deal with the new and serious threat to Military and Defence establishments of [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republican Terrorism]],  from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA). Terrorists scored successes against a number of defence installations from the [[1972 Aldershot Bombing]] to the [[Deal barracks bombing|1989 Deal barracks bombing]]. It was very real threat of Irish Republican terrorism to the Defence Estate and personnel that became the MDPs main effort for 20 years and ensured that the MDP received a healthy budget from Government well into the late 1990s.\n[[File:MDP Greenhamcommon1982.jpg|thumb|alt=MDP RAF Greenham Common 1982|MDP face a protest from [[Peace Women]] at [[USAF Greenham Common]] in 1982]]\n\nDuring the early 1980s the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], a British Anti-nuclear protest movement, which had been dormant since the late 1960s, enjoyed a surge in popularity. Driven by the real public fears of nuclear war between [[Cold War|NATO and the Soviet Union]]. Most notable was the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|peace camp]] and very large protests against the deployment of [[BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile|US Cruise Missiles]] at the [[RAF Greenham Common|USAF (RAF) Greenham Common]] and other UK locations; and regular largescale protests at the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment Aldermaston]].\n\nWhen the MDP left the 1960s the force did little more than man gates, check passes and occasionally patrol fence lines armed with nothing more than a pistol.  During the 1970s-1980s the force had to rapidly adapt to the changing threat of being faced with a professional paramilitary enemy or dealing with large scale public anti-nuclear protests. By the end of the late 1980s the MDP was well equipped, all armed and trained to deal with the threats it faced, and comparable to other UK police forces.\n\nStill, by the mid-1980s the majority of MDP tasking was \u201dbehind the wire\u201d, i.e. within the secure perimeters of the Defence establishments it policed. Increasingly the MDP was required to work outside the wire, to interdict terrorists before they attacked the establishment or securing Defence estate that the public had access to. The threat from the [[Barrack buster|PIRA Improvised Mortar campaign]] of the 1980s was one of the driving factors that forced the issue that the MDP required a formal legislative framework to perform its duties outside the wire; and more extensive police powers, in what later became the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987\n\n===1974: Female police officers===\n[[Image:Female with SA80A2.jpg|thumb|alt=Female MDP Officer on duty with L85A1|Female MDP Officer on duty with [[L85A1|L85A1 Assault Rifle]]]]\nDespite HDPFs having female police officers since 1915,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.met.police.uk/history/women_police.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-05 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081108010707/http://www.met.police.uk/history/women_police.htm |archive-date=2008-11-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> there were no female police officers in the MDP until 1974.<ref name=\"History\"/>\nIn that year two female sergeants transferred into the MDP, one from [[Strathclyde Police]] and one from [[List of defunct law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom|British Airports Police]].\n\nThe first four female MDP recruits started their training on recruit course in January 1975. Skirts and tunics had to be made to measure for them as there was no stock of female uniforms held. They were issued with truncheons, but they found that they had no pockets to put them in. At this time trousers were not issued to female officers and rent allowance was only paid at half rate.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThe present day force has over 340 female officers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mod.police.uk/Publications%20PDF/MDPGAannrept0910%5B1%5D.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226032745/http://www.mod.police.uk/Publications%20PDF/MDPGAannrept0910%5B1%5D.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===1987: Ministry of Defence Police Act===\nBecause the MDP derived its powers from a growing number of acts and regulations, it was recognised that there was a need for one specific piece of legislation to cover the MDP and its legally unique role in policing the Defence Estate.\n\nAs a result, in 1987, the force was recognised by Parliament as a distinct police force which resulted in an Act of Parliament, the [[Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987]], this drew many of the powers from the old acts and regulations under the umbrella of one piece of legislation, making them clearer to understand and work from.\n\nAll officers within the MDP are now attested as constables as laid down within Section 1 (2) of the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987 and are granted the \"Powers and privileges of Constables\" in any place in the UK with their jurisdiction.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===1996: Agency status===\nOn 1 April 1996 the Ministry of Defence Police became a Defence Agency. This was a landmark in the MDP's history as it was the first British police to become an agency.\n\nThe MDP was formally launched as an Agency on 24 April 1996 by the Hon. [[Nicholas Soames]], Minister of State for the Armed Forces. The Agency operated under the Secretary of State for Defence, who has ultimate responsibility for determining the size, policy and resources of the force. These responsibilities were delegated to the Second Permanent Under-Secretary of State who was also Chairman of the MOD Police Committee.\n\nThe Chief Constable has the exclusive statutory authority for the professional direction and control of all MDP officers and also direct access to the Secretary for Defence, to whom he is ultimately responsible. Additionally, the Chief Constable is responsible to Parliament for the propriety and regularity of the agency\u2019s expenditure in compliance with Treasury and Departmental rules.\n\nThe MDP Agency provisions were reframed on the formation of the [[Ministry of Defence Police and Guarding Agency]].\n\nIn 1995 the MDP moved its headquarters and training centre to the recently vacated USAF Airbase at [[RAF Wethersfield]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===2000 - 2009:  Extended jurisdiction, Al-Qaeda and enhanced capability===\n[[File:MOD Plod Ship 2007.jpg|thumb|MDP Officers conducting firearms search of a warship 2007]]\n\nUnder the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987, MDP officers had the powers of police constables, but-broadly speaking only on Defence land or in respect of the actions of Defence personnel. In addition they had constabulary powers when requested to act by an officer from a Home Department police force (HDPF) \"in the vicinity\" of Defence land. The problem was that these powers left MDP officers unable to act in an emergency if confronted by serious criminal acts off defence land, and failed to define the term \"in the vicinity\". Or give powers to deal with offences against Defence personnel off Defence land, nor to act under certain sections of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]].\n\nBecause of the rapid evolution of the role of the MDP from purely \"guarding behind the wire\" to more mobile policing of the Defence Estate and Defence interests.  The Chief Constable MDP lobbied for additional powers to give the force a more robust legislative framework. This was agreed in principle by Government; to be included in the [[Armed Forces Act 2001|Armed Forces Bill 2000]], but was eventually dropped because of lack of Parliamentary time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmhaff/886/886we09.htm|title=House of Commons - Home Affairs - Written Evidence|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe requested extra powers were resurrected and put before Parliament in 2001, due (according to ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' newspapers) because of the events of the [[fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests of 2000]], which brought the UK to a standstill in 2000.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/nov/16/ukcrime.september11 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor | title=Terrorism bill gives new powers to MoD police | date=16 November 2001}}</ref> The Labour government under [[Tony Blair|Prime Minister Tony Blair]] planned to use the MDP to aid fuel convoys and police picketed oil refineries, but the government was told that it would be unlawful under the then legislation to do so.<ref>[http://www.spectator.co.uk/spectator/thisweek/8749/part_2/a-national-police-force-is-being-assembled-and-newspapers-are-looking-the-other-way.thtml ]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}</ref>  The additional powers, subsequently known as \u2018Extended Jurisdiction\u2019, were then included in the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001|Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security (ATCS) Act 2001]].\n\nDespite \u2018Extended Jurisdiction\u2019 the MDP still do not, with notable exceptions such as garrison towns, police the public directly.

(This does not include providing specialist MDP Protester Removal Teams).\n\nShortly after Extended Jurisdiction came into force, the US [[September 11 attacks]] completely changed the national security landscape and [[al-Qaeda|al-Qaeda/Islamist terrorism]] became the MDP's principle threat.  The MDP already extensively \u201cworking outside the wire\u201d formed a number of Area Police Teams (APT), which were teams of mobile officers who would undertake mobile armed counter-terrorism patrols and local crime surge operations of the Defence Estate and defence interests. Prior to this, the force had been organised around Operational Command Units (OCU) based on static Defence locations. The APTs were never adequately funded and quickly, due to pressure on the Defence Budget in 2004, by both the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] campaigns, these teams were rationalised to work at Divisional not Area level and became known as Divisional Support Groups (DSG) a role which continues today.\n\n[[Image:MDP exeter 2006.jpg|thumb|Extended Jurisdiction: A MDP officer accompanied by a [[Royal Military Police|RMP]] NCO patrol Exeter city centre on OP Dissuade \u2013 the policing of alcohol-related disorder by off-duty service personnel]]\n\nOn the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] the UK was hit by directly by Islamist terrorism.
