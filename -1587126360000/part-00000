Most of them were from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], [[Andalusia]], or the [[Canary Islands]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Empires of the word : a language history of the world|first=Nicholas|last=Ostler|date=2010|publisher=Folio Society|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=335\u2013347|oclc=692307052}}</ref> The last has been the most fundamental influence on modern Venezuelan Spanish, and [[Canarian Spanish|Canarian]] and Venezuelan accents may even be indistinguishable to other Spanish-speakers.\n\n[[Italy|Italian]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] immigrants from the late 19th and the early 20th century have also had an influence. German settlers also left an influence when Venezuela was contracted as a concession by the King of Spain to the German Welser banking family ([[Klein-Venedig]], 1528\u20131546).\n\nThe Spaniards additionally brought [[Africa]]n [[slavery|slave]]s, which is the origin of expressions such as ''ch\u00e9vere'' (\"excellent\"), which comes from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''ch\u00e9 egberi''. Other non-Romance words came from [[indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] languages, such as ''guayoyo'' (a type of [[coffee]]) and ''caraota'' ([[black turtle bean|black bean]]).\n\n==Features==\n* Venezuelan Spanish sometimes shortens words, such as ''para'' (\"for\") to ''pa'''. In addition, {{IPA|/d/}} between vowels is sometimes dropped ([[elision]]): ''helado'' (\"ice cream\") becomes {{IPA|[e\u02c8lao]}}. Originally from southern Spain and the Canary Islands, those traits are common to many other Spanish variations and in the Caribbean.\n* Another common feature is the debuccalization of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}}, whereby ''adi\u00f3s'' (\"goodbye\") becomes {{IPA|[a\u02c8\u00f0joh]}} and ''este'' (\"east\") becomes {{IPA|[\u02c8eht\u032ae]}}. It is common to most coastal areas in America, the [[Canary Islands]], and the southern half of [[Spain]].\n* Syllable-final {{IPA|/n/}} undergoes velarisation, or {{IPA|/n/}} undergoes assimilation: ''ambientaci\u00f3n'' {{IPA|/aNbi\u032feNta\u02c8si\u032foN/}} (\"atmosphere\") becomes {{IPA|[\u00e3\u014bbj\u1ebd\u014bt\u032aa\u02c8sj\u00f5\u014b]}} or {{IPA|[\u00e3mbj\u1ebdn\u032at\u032aa\u02c8sj\u00f5\u014b]}}.\n* Also like most other American versions of Spanish, Venezuelan Spanish has ''[[ye\u00edsmo]]'' (the merger of {{IPAslink|\u028e}} and {{IPAslink|\u029d}}) and ''[[seseo]]'' ({{IPA|/\u03b8/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} are merged). That is, ''call\u00f3'' (\"s/he became silent\") and ''cay\u00f3'' (\"s/he fell\") are homophones, and ''casa'' (\"house\") is homophonous with ''caza'' (\"hunt\"). ''Seseo'' is common to all of America, the Canary Islands, and southern Spain, and ''ye\u00edsmo'' is prevalent in most Spanish dialects.\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/x/}} is realized as glottal {{IPA|[h]}} in the [[Venezuelan Caribbean]], like in El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Colombia, Spanish Caribbean islands, Canary Islands, and southern Spain and sometimes in Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina.\n*A characteristic common to Spanish in Venezuela, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Costa Rica is the use of the [[diminutive]] ''-ico'' and ''-ica'', instead of the standard ''-ito'' and ''-ita'' in words with ''-t'' in the last syllable: ''rata'' (\"rat\") becomes ''ratica'' (\"little rat\"). Another noteworthy diminutive is \"manito,\" instead of the more common \"manita.\"\n* The second-person singular informal pronoun is usually ''t\u00fa'', as in most of the rest of Latin America and in Spain. That is referred to as ''[[tuteo]]''. However, in [[Zulia (state)|Zulia]] and some parts of [[Falc\u00f3n (state)|Falc\u00f3n]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]], it is common to find [[voseo]], the use of ''vos'' instead of ''t\u00fa''. That phenomenon is present in many other Latin American variations (notably [[Central American Spanish]] and [[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]]), but Zulian ''voseo'' is ''diptongado'': conjugation preserves the [[diphthong]]s of the historical ''vos'' conjugation, which have had [[monophthongization]] in Rioplatense. The Zulian forms are thus the same as those in Spain for the second-person plural ''vosotros''): instead of ''t\u00fa eres, t\u00fa est\u00e1s'', Zulian has ''vos sois, vos est\u00e1is'' (compare with the plural forms in Spain ''vosotros sois'', ''vosotros est\u00e1is'', and with Rioplatense forms, ''vos sos'', ''vos est\u00e1s''). Another exception to ''tuteo'' in Venezuela is the use of the second-person singular formal pronoun ''usted'' interchangeably with ''t\u00fa'' in informal speech, unique to the states of [[M\u00e9rida (state)|M\u00e9rida]], [[T\u00e1chira (state)|T\u00e1chira]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]].<ref>Alexandra Alvarez & Ximena Barros, [http://www.linguisticahispanica.org/aam/alvarez_17.htm \"Sistemas en conflicto: las formas de tratamiento en la ciudad de M\u00e9rida, Venezuela\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721094723/http://www.linguisticahispanica.org/aam/alvarez_17.htm |date=2006-07-21 }}, Lengua y Habla (2000), M\u00e9rida, Universidad de Los Andes.</ref> As in most of the rest of the Americas, the only plural form of the second person is ''ustedes''.\n* The word ''vaina'' is used with a variety of meanings (such as \"shame,\" \"thing or topic,\" or \"pity\") and is often interjection or a nonsensical filler.\n* Venezuelan Spanish has a lot of [[List of Spanish words borrowed from Italian|Italianism]]s, [[Gallicism]]s, [[Germanism (linguistics)#Spanish|Germanisms]], and [[Anglicism]]s.\n\n==Regional variations==\nThere are several subdialects of Venezuelan Spanish:\n\n*The [[Andean Spanish|Andean]] dialect, particularly in the state of T\u00e1chira, near the Colombian border, is characterized by a nonaspirated pronunciation of 's', and use of ''usted'' instead of ''t\u00fa'' even in informal contexts. Another variant, in the states of M\u00e9rida and Trujillo, still uses ''usted'' instead of ''t\u00fa'', but has the aspirated pronunciation of {{IPA|/s/}} as a [[voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant]] {{IPA|[s\u033a]}}, also called apico-alveolar or grave, between {{IPAblink|s}} and {{IPAblink|\u0283}}. That phonetic trait, unique in the Americas, is from the large number of northern Spanish settlers in Andean Venezuela.\n*The [[Central Region, Venezuela|Central]] dialect, a characteristic marked accent whose use is very common in cities like [[Caracas]], [[La Guaira]], [[Los Teques]], [[Maracay]] and [[Valencia]]. This dialect is the basis of standard Spanish of Venezuela. \n*The Guaro or [[Lara, Venezuela|Larense]] dialect, spoken initially in [[Barquisimeto]], [[Cabudare]], [[Carora]], [[El Tocuyo]] and [[Qu\u00edbor]], spread throughout the state of Lara and other [[Central-Western Region, Venezuela|Central-Western]] states. In it, the older Spanish verbal inflections ''-ades'', ''-edes'', ''-odes'' have become ''-\u00e1s'', ''-\u00e9s'', and ''-\u00f3s:\" <ref>Lapesa Melgar, Rafael. 1970.

One of its characteristics is a considerable aboriginal lexicon, a product of the fusion of both languages.\n*The [[Insular Region, Venezuela|Margaritan]] dialect ([[Eastern Region, Venezuela|oriental]]), spoken in [[Isla Margarita]] and the northeast of mainland Venezuela. The Margaritan dialect sometimes has an interdental for pre-vowel 's', and uses a strong 'r' instead of 'l' for most words.\nThe Venezuelan dialect influences [[Papiamento]], the language spoken and taught most in [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Cura\u00e7ao]].\n*The [[Zulia]]n {{Interlanguage link|Zulian Spanish|es|Espa\u00f1ol marabino|lt=dialect|WD=}} in the northwest of the country, also called ''maracucho'' or ''marabino'', uses ''voseo''.\n\n==Lexical influences==\n===Native influence===\nVenezuelan Spanish, like that of the rest of Spanish America and Castilian in general, has taken many words from [[Languages of Venezuela#Indigenous languages|indigenous languages]].\n\nSome examples:\n\n* '''[[Arepa]]''' (from [[Cariban languages|cariban]]).\n* '''[[Auyama]]''' (from [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]).\n* '''[[Budare]]''' (from [[Cariban languages|cariban]]).\n* '''[[Casabe]]''' (from [[Cariban languages|cariban]]).\n* '''[[Chinchorro]]''' (from [[Cumanagoto language|chaima]]).\n* '''[[Conuco]]''' (from [[Ta\u00edno language|ta\u00edno]]).\n* '''[[Ocumo]]''' (from [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]).\n* '''[[Onoto]]''' (from ''anoto'', word from [[Tamanaku language|tamanaku]]).\n* '''[[Totuma]]''' (from [[Cumanagoto language|chaima]])\n\n==Common words==\n* '''A mamar que lleg\u00f3 T\u00edo Rico'''. = v.

Most of them were from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], [[Andalusia]], or the [[Canary Islands]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Empires of the word : a language history of the world|first=Nicholas|last=Ostler|date=2010|publisher=Folio Society|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=335\u2013347|oclc=692307052}}</ref> The last has been the most fundamental influence on modern Venezuelan Spanish, and [[Canarian Spanish|Canarian]] and Venezuelan accents may even be indistinguishable to other Spanish-speakers.\n\n[[Italy|Italian]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] immigrants from the late 19th and the early 20th century have also had an influence. German settlers also left an influence when Venezuela was contracted as a concession by the King of Spain to the German Welser banking family ([[Klein-Venedig]], 1528\u20131546).\n\nThe Spaniards additionally brought [[Africa]]n [[slavery|slave]]s, which is the origin of expressions such as ''ch\u00e9vere'' (\"excellent\"), which comes from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''ch\u00e9 egberi''. Other non-Romance words came from [[indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] languages, such as ''guayoyo'' (a type of [[coffee]]) and ''caraota'' ([[black turtle bean|black bean]]).\n\n==Features==\n* Venezuelan Spanish sometimes shortens words, such as ''para'' (\"for\") to ''pa'''. In addition, {{IPA|/d/}} between vowels is sometimes dropped ([[elision]]): ''helado'' (\"ice cream\") becomes {{IPA|[e\u02c8lao]}}. Originally from southern Spain and the Canary Islands, those traits are common to many other Spanish variations and in the Caribbean.\n* Another common feature is the debuccalization of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}}, whereby ''adi\u00f3s'' (\"goodbye\") becomes {{IPA|[a\u02c8\u00f0joh]}} and ''este'' (\"east\") becomes {{IPA|[\u02c8eht\u032ae]}}. It is common to most coastal areas in America, the [[Canary Islands]], and the southern half of [[Spain]].\n* Syllable-final {{IPA|/n/}} undergoes velarisation, or {{IPA|/n/}} undergoes assimilation: ''ambientaci\u00f3n'' {{IPA|/aNbi\u032feNta\u02c8si\u032foN/}} (\"atmosphere\") becomes {{IPA|[\u00e3\u014bbj\u1ebd\u014bt\u032aa\u02c8sj\u00f5\u014b]}} or {{IPA|[\u00e3mbj\u1ebdn\u032at\u032aa\u02c8sj\u00f5\u014b]}}.\n* Also like most other American versions of Spanish, Venezuelan Spanish has ''[[ye\u00edsmo]]'' (the merger of {{IPAslink|\u028e}} and {{IPAslink|\u029d}}) and ''[[seseo]]'' ({{IPA|/\u03b8/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} are merged). That is, ''call\u00f3'' (\"s/he became silent\") and ''cay\u00f3'' (\"s/he fell\") are homophones, and ''casa'' (\"house\") is homophonous with ''caza'' (\"hunt\"). ''Seseo'' is common to all of America, the Canary Islands, and southern Spain, and ''ye\u00edsmo'' is prevalent in most Spanish dialects.\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/x/}} is realized as glottal {{IPA|[h]}} in the [[Venezuelan Caribbean]], like in El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Colombia, Spanish Caribbean islands, Canary Islands, and southern Spain and sometimes in Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina.\n*A characteristic common to Spanish in Venezuela, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Costa Rica is the use of the [[diminutive]] ''-ico'' and ''-ica'', instead of the standard ''-ito'' and ''-ita'' in words with ''-t'' in the last syllable: ''rata'' (\"rat\") becomes ''ratica'' (\"little rat\"). Another noteworthy diminutive is \"manito,\" instead of the more common \"manita.\"\n* The second-person singular informal pronoun is usually ''t\u00fa'', as in most of the rest of Latin America and in Spain. That is referred to as ''[[tuteo]]''. However, in [[Zulia (state)|Zulia]] and some parts of [[Falc\u00f3n (state)|Falc\u00f3n]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]], it is common to find [[voseo]], the use of ''vos'' instead of ''t\u00fa''. That phenomenon is present in many other Latin American variations (notably [[Central American Spanish]] and [[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]]), but Zulian ''voseo'' is ''diptongado'': conjugation preserves the [[diphthong]]s of the historical ''vos'' conjugation, which have had [[monophthongization]] in Rioplatense. The Zulian forms are thus the same as those in Spain for the second-person plural ''vosotros''): instead of ''t\u00fa eres, t\u00fa est\u00e1s'', Zulian has ''vos sois, vos est\u00e1is'' (compare with the plural forms in Spain ''vosotros sois'', ''vosotros est\u00e1is'', and with Rioplatense forms, ''vos sos'', ''vos est\u00e1s''). Another exception to ''tuteo'' in Venezuela is the use of the second-person singular formal pronoun ''usted'' interchangeably with ''t\u00fa'' in informal speech, unique to the states of [[M\u00e9rida (state)|M\u00e9rida]], [[T\u00e1chira (state)|T\u00e1chira]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]].<ref>Alexandra Alvarez & Ximena Barros, [http://www.linguisticahispanica.org/aam/alvarez_17.htm \"Sistemas en conflicto: las formas de tratamiento en la ciudad de M\u00e9rida, Venezuela\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721094723/http://www.linguisticahispanica.org/aam/alvarez_17.htm |date=2006-07-21 }}, Lengua y Habla (2000), M\u00e9rida, Universidad de Los Andes.</ref> As in most of the rest of the Americas, the only plural form of the second person is ''ustedes''.\n* The word ''vaina'' is used with a variety of meanings (such as \"shame,\" \"thing or topic,\" or \"pity\") and is often interjection or a nonsensical filler.\n* Venezuelan Spanish has a lot of [[List of Spanish words borrowed from Italian|Italianism]]s, [[Gallicism]]s, [[Germanism (linguistics)#Spanish|Germanisms]], and [[Anglicism]]s.\n\n==Regional variations==\nThere are several subdialects of Venezuelan Spanish:\n\n*The [[Andean Spanish|Andean]] dialect, particularly in the state of T\u00e1chira, near the Colombian border, is characterized by a nonaspirated pronunciation of 's', and use of ''usted'' instead of ''t\u00fa'' even in informal contexts. Another variant, in the states of M\u00e9rida and Trujillo, still uses ''usted'' instead of ''t\u00fa'', but has the aspirated pronunciation of {{IPA|/s/}} as a [[voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant]] {{IPA|[s\u033a]}}, also called apico-alveolar or grave, between {{IPAblink|s}} and {{IPAblink|\u0283}}. That phonetic trait, unique in the Americas, is from the large number of northern Spanish settlers in Andean Venezuela.\n*The [[Central Region, Venezuela|Central]] dialect, a characteristic marked accent whose use is very common in cities like [[Caracas]], [[La Guaira]], [[Los Teques]], [[Maracay]] and [[Valencia]]. This dialect is the basis of standard Spanish of Venezuela. \n*The Guaro or [[Lara, Venezuela|Larense]] dialect, spoken initially in [[Barquisimeto]], [[Cabudare]], [[Carora]], [[El Tocuyo]] and [[Qu\u00edbor]], spread throughout the state of Lara and other [[Central-Western Region, Venezuela|Central-Western]] states. In it, the older Spanish verbal inflections ''-ades'', ''-edes'', ''-odes'' have become ''-\u00e1s'', ''-\u00e9s'', and ''-\u00f3s:\" <ref>Lapesa Melgar, Rafael. 1970.

One of its characteristics is a considerable aboriginal lexicon, a product of the fusion of both languages.\n*The [[Insular Region, Venezuela|Margaritan]] dialect ([[Eastern Region, Venezuela|oriental]]), spoken in [[Isla Margarita]] and the northeast of mainland Venezuela. The Margaritan dialect sometimes has an interdental for pre-vowel 's', and uses a strong 'r' instead of 'l' for most words.\nThe Venezuelan dialect influences [[Papiamento]], the language spoken and taught most in [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Cura\u00e7ao]].\n*The [[Zulia]]n {{Interlanguage link|Zulian Spanish|es|Espa\u00f1ol marabino|lt=dialect|WD=}} in the northwest of the country, also called ''maracucho'' or ''marabino'', uses ''voseo''.\n\n==Lexical influences==\n===Native influence===\nVenezuelan Spanish, like that of the rest of Spanish America and Castilian in general, has taken many words from [[Languages of Venezuela#Indigenous languages|indigenous languages]].\n\nSome examples:\n\n* '''[[Arepa]]''' (from [[Cariban languages|cariban]]).\n* '''[[Auyama]]''' (from [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]).\n* '''[[Budare]]''' (from [[Cariban languages|cariban]]).\n* '''[[Casabe]]''' (from [[Cariban languages|cariban]]).\n* '''[[Chinchorro]]''' (from [[Cumanagoto language|chaima]]).\n* '''[[Conuco]]''' (from [[Ta\u00edno language|ta\u00edno]]).\n* '''[[Ocumo]]''' (from [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]).\n* '''[[Onoto]]''' (from ''anoto'', word from [[Tamanaku language|tamanaku]]).\n* '''[[Totuma]]''' (from [[Cumanagoto language|chaima]])\n\n==Common words==\n* '''A mamar que lleg\u00f3 T\u00edo Rico'''. = v.

It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the [[Internet]] and other [[packet-switched]] networks. IPv4 was the first version deployed for production in the [[ARPANET]] in 1983. It still routes most Internet traffic today,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html |title=BGP Analysis Reports |accessdate=2013-01-09}}</ref> despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, [[IPv6]]. IPv4 is described in [[IETF]] publication RFC 791 (September 1981), replacing an earlier definition (RFC 760, January 1980).\n\nIPv4 uses a 32-bit address space which provides 4,294,967,296 (2<sup>32</sup>) unique addresses, but large blocks are reserved for special networking methods.\n\n==Purpose==\nThe Internet Protocol is the protocol that defines and enables [[internetwork]]ing at the [[internet layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. In essence it forms the Internet. It uses a logical addressing system and performs ''routing'', which is the forwarding of packets from a source host to the next router that is one hop closer to the intended destination host on another network.\n\nIPv4 is a [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]] protocol, and operates on a [[best effort delivery]] model, in that it does not guarantee delivery, nor does it assure proper sequencing or avoidance of duplicate delivery. These aspects, including data integrity, are addressed by an [[upper layer protocol|upper layer]] transport protocol, such as the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP).\n\n==Addressing==<!--redirect from [[IPv4 address]]-->\n[[File:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of the quad-dotted IPv4 address representation to its [[Binary numeral system|binary]] value]]\nIPv4 uses 32-bit addresses which limits the [[address space]] to {{gaps|4|294|967|296}} (2<sup>32</sup>) addresses.\n\nIPv4 reserves special address blocks for [[private network]]s (~18 million addresses) and [[multicast]] addresses (~270 million addresses).\n\n===Address representations===\nIPv4 addresses may be represented in any notation expressing a 32-bit integer value. They are most often written in [[dot-decimal notation]], which consists of four [[Octet (computing)|octet]]s of the address expressed individually in [[decimal]] numbers and separated by [[Full stop|periods]].\n\nFor example, the quad-dotted IP address ''192.0.2.235'' represents the 32-bit [[decimal]] number 3221226219, which in [[hexadecimal]] format is 0xC00002EB. This may also be expressed in dotted hex format as 0xC0.0x00.0x02.0xEB, or with octal byte values as 0300.0000.0002.0353.\n\n[[CIDR notation]] combines the address with its routing prefix in a compact format, in which the address is followed by a slash character (/) and the count of consecutive ''1'' bits in the routing prefix (subnet mask).\n\nOther address representations were in common use when [[classful network]]ing was practiced. For example, the loopback address ''127.0.0.1'' is commonly written as ''127.1'', given that it belongs to a class-A network with eight bits for the network mask and 24 bits for the host number. When fewer than four numbers are specified in the address in dotted notation, the last value is treated as an integer of as many bytes as are required to fill out the address to four octets. Thus, the address ''127.65530'' is equivalent to ''127.0.255.250''.\n\n===Allocation===\nIn the original design of IPv4, an IP address was divided into two parts: the network identifier was the most significant octet of the address, and the host identifier was the rest of the address. The latter was also called the ''rest field''. This structure permitted a maximum of 256 network identifiers, which was quickly found to be inadequate.\n\nTo overcome this limit, the most-significant address octet was redefined in 1981 to create ''network classes'', in a system which later became known as [[classful network]]ing. The revised system defined five classes. Classes A, B, and C had different bit lengths for network identification. The rest of the address was used as previously to identify a host within a network. Because of the different sizes of fields in different classes, each network class had a different capacity for addressing hosts. In addition to the three classes for addressing hosts, Class D was defined for [[multicast]] addressing and Class E was reserved for future applications.\n\nDividing existing classful networks into subnets began in 1985 with the publication of {{IETF RFC|950}}. This division was made more flexible with the introduction of variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) in {{IETF RFC|1109}} in 1987. In 1993, based on this work, {{IETF RFC|1517}} introduced [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3com.com/other/pdfs/infra/corpinfo/en_US/501302.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010616012053/http://www.3com.com/other/pdfs/infra/corpinfo/en_US/501302.pdf |archive-date=June 16, 2001 |title=Understanding IP Addressing: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know |publisher=3Com |url-status=dead}}</ref>  which expressed the number of bits (from the [[Most significant bit|most significant]]) as, for instance, /24, and the class-based scheme was dubbed ''classful'', by contrast. CIDR was designed to permit repartitioning of any address space so that smaller or larger blocks of addresses could be allocated to users. The hierarchical structure created by CIDR is managed by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) and the [[Regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs). Each RIR maintains a publicly searchable [[WHOIS]] database that provides information about IP address assignments.\n\n===Special-use addresses===\nThe [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) and the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) have restricted from general use various [[reserved IP addresses]] for special purposes. Notably these addresses are used for [[multicast]] traffic and to provide addressing space for unrestricted uses on private networks.\n<section begin=IPv4-special-address-blocks/><!-- This table is transcluded to other pages, such as [[Reserved IP addresses]].

Packets addresses in these ranges are not routable in the public Internet; they are ignored by all public routers. Therefore, private hosts cannot directly communicate with public networks, but require [[network address translation]] at a routing gateway for this purpose.\n\n<section begin=IPv4-private-networks/><!-- This table is transcluded to other pages, such as [[Blackhole server]].

Additionally, encapsulated packets may be encrypted for transmission across public networks to secure the data.\n\n===Link-local addressing===\nRFC 3927 defines the special address block 169.254.0.0/16 for link-local addressing. These addresses are only valid on the link (such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection) directly connected to a host that uses them. These addresses are not routable. Like private addresses, these addresses cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the internet. These addresses are primarily used for address autoconfiguration ([[Zeroconf]]) when a host cannot obtain an IP address from a DHCP server or other internal configuration methods.\n\nWhen the address block was reserved, no standards existed for address autoconfiguration. [[Microsoft]] created an implementation called [[Automatic Private IP Addressing]] (APIPA), which was deployed on millions of machines and became a [[de facto standard]]. Many years later, in May 2005, the [[IETF]] defined a formal standard in RFC 3927, entitled ''Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses''.\n\n===Loopback===\n{{Main|Localhost}}\nThe class A network 127.0.0.0 (classless network 127.0.0.0/8) is reserved for [[loopback]]. IP packets whose source addresses belong to this network should never appear outside a host. Packets received on a non-loopback interface with a loopback source or destination address must be dropped.\n\n===Addresses ending in 0 or 255===\n{{See also|IPv4 subnetting reference}}\nThe first address in a subnet is used to identify the subnet itself. The last address is used as a local [[broadcast address]] for all devices on the subnet.\n\nFor example, in the subnet 192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0 (192.168.5.0/24) the identifier 192.168.5.0 commonly is used to refer to the entire subnet. To avoid ambiguity in representation, the address ending in the octet ''0'' is reserved.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc923 |title=RFC 923  |date=June 1984 |website=IETF  |access-date=15 November 2019 |quote=Special Addresses:  In certain contexts, it is useful to have fixed addresses with functional significance rather than as identifiers of specific  hosts.  When such usage is called for, the address zero is to be interpreted as meaning \"this\", as in \"this network\".}}</ref>\n\nA broadcast address<ref name=\":0\" /> is an address that allows information to be sent to all interfaces in a given subnet, rather than a specific machine. The broadcast address is the last address in the address range of the subnet. For example, the broadcast address for the network 192.168.5.0 is 192.168.5.255. For networks of size /24 or larger, the broadcast address always ends in 255.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:left;\"\n! !! Binary form !!

One can use the following addresses for hosts, even though they end with 255: 192.168.1.255, 192.168.2.255, etc. Also, 192.168.0.0 is the network identifier and must not be assigned to an interface.<ref>{{cite web\n|url       = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-31\n|title     = Requirements for Internet Hosts&nbsp;\u2013 Communication Layers\n|author     = [[Robert Braden]]\n|date=October 1989\n|publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n|page      = 31\n|rfc       = 1122\n}}</ref> The addresses 192.168.1.0, 192.168.2.0, etc., may be assigned, despite ending with 0.\n\nIn the past, conflict between network addresses and broadcast addresses arose because some software used non-standard broadcast addresses with zeros instead of ones.<ref>{{cite web\n|url       = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-66\n|title     = Requirements for Internet Hosts&nbsp;\u2013 Communication Layers\n|author     = [[Robert Braden]]\n|date=October 1989\n|publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n|page      = 66\n|rfc       = 1122\n}}</ref>\n\nIn networks smaller than /24, broadcast addresses do not necessarily end with 255.

The use of domain names requires translating, called ''resolving'', them to addresses and vice versa. This is analogous to looking up a phone number in a phone book using the recipient's name.\n\nThe translation between addresses and domain names is performed by the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), a hierarchical, distributed naming system that allows for the subdelegation of [[namespace]]s to other DNS servers.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Address space exhaustion==\n{{Main|IPv4 address exhaustion}}\nSince the 1980s, it was apparent that the pool of available IPv4 addresses was depleting at a rate that was not initially anticipated in the original design of the network.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = World 'running out of Internet addresses'\n |url         = http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20110121-315808/World-running-out-of-Internet-addresses\n |access-date  = 2011-01-23\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110125195711/http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20110121-315808/World-running-out-of-Internet-addresses\n |archive-date = 2011-01-25\n |df          = \n}}</ref> The main market forces that accelerated address depletion included the rapidly growing number of Internet users, who increasingly used mobile computing devices, such as [[laptop computers]], [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), and [[smart phone]]s with IP data services.

The threat of exhaustion motivated the introduction of a number of remedial technologies, such as [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) methods by the mid 1990s, pervasive use of [[network address translation]] (NAT) in network access provider systems, and strict usage-based allocation policies at the regional and local Internet registries.\n\nThe primary address pool of the Internet, maintained by [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]], was exhausted on 3 February 2011, when the last five blocks were allocated to the five RIRs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nro.net/news/ipv4-free-pool-depleted|title=Free Pool of IPv4 Address Space Depleted|last=Smith|first=Lucie|author2=Lipner, Ian|date=3 February 2011|publisher=[[Number Resource Organization]]|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2011-February/032107.html |title=Five /8s allocated to RIRs&nbsp;\u2013 no unallocated IPv4 unicast /8s remain | author=ICANN,nanog mailing list}}</ref> [[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre|APNIC]] was the first RIR to exhaust its regional pool on 15 April 2011, except for a small amount of address space reserved for the transition technologies to IPv6, which is to be allocated under a restricted policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=APNIC IPv4 Address Pool Reaches Final /8|url=http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8|access-date=15 April 2011|author=Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre|date=15 April 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807162057/http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8|archive-date=7 August 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe long-term solution to the impending address exhaustion was the 1998 specification of a new version of the Internet Protocol, [[IPv6]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2460.html|title=Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> which increased the address size to 128 bits.

The fields in the header are packed with the most significant byte first ([[Endianness|big endian]]), and for the diagram and discussion, the most significant bits are considered to come first ([[MSB0|MSB 0 bit numbering]]). The most significant bit is numbered 0, so the version field is actually found in the four most significant bits of the first byte, for example.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;\"\n|+ IPv4 Header Format\n|-\n!

Errors in the data field must be handled by the encapsulated protocol.

The list of options may be terminated with an EOL ([[End of Options List]], 0x00) option; this is only necessary if the end of the options would not otherwise coincide with the end of the header.

The design accommodates networks of diverse physical nature; it is independent of the underlying transmission technology used in the link layer. Networks with different hardware usually vary not only in transmission speed, but also in the [[MTU (networking)|maximum transmission unit]] (MTU). When one network wants to transmit datagrams to a network with a smaller MTU, it may [[IP fragmentation|fragment]] its datagrams. In IPv4, this function was placed at the [[Internet Layer]], and is performed in IPv4 routers, which thus require no implementation of any higher layers for the function of routing IP packets.\n\nIn contrast, [[IPv6]], the next generation of the Internet Protocol, does not allow routers to perform fragmentation; hosts must determine the path MTU before sending datagrams.\n\n===Fragmentation===\nWhen a router receives a packet, it examines the destination address and determines the outgoing interface to use and that interface's MTU.  If the packet size is bigger than the MTU, and the Do not Fragment (DF) bit in the packet's header is set to 0, then the router may fragment the packet.\n\nThe router divides the packet into fragments. The max size of each fragment is the MTU minus the IP header size (20 bytes minimum; 60 bytes maximum). The router puts each fragment into its own packet, each fragment packet having following changes:\n* The ''total length'' field is the fragment size.\n* The ''more fragments'' (MF) flag is set for all fragments except the last one, which is set to 0.\n* The ''fragment offset'' field is set, based on the offset of the fragment in the original data payload. This is measured in units of eight-byte blocks.\n* The ''header checksum'' field is recomputed.\n\nFor example, for an MTU of 1,500 bytes and a header size of 20 bytes, the fragment offsets would be multiples of\n<math>\\frac{1500-20}{8} = 185</math>.\nThese multiples are 0, 185, 370, 555, 740, ...\n\nIt is possible that a packet is fragmented at one router, and that the fragments are further fragmented at another router. For example, a packet of 4,520 bytes, including the 20 bytes of the IP header (without options) is fragmented to two packets on a link with an MTU of 2,500 bytes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!|Fragment\n!|Size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Header size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Data size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Flag<br/>''More fragments''\n!|Fragment offset<br/><small>(8-byte blocks)</small>\n|-\n|1\n|2500\n|20\n|2480\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|2\n|2040\n|20\n|2020\n|0\n|310\n|}\n\nThe total data size is preserved: 2480 bytes + 2020 bytes = 4500 bytes.\nThe offsets are\n<math>0</math>\nand\n<math>\\frac{0 + 2480}{8} = 310</math>.\n\nOn a link with an MTU of 1,500 bytes,  each fragment results in two fragments:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!|Fragment\n!|Size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Header size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Data size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Flag<br/>''More fragments''\n!|Fragment offset<br/><small>(8-byte blocks)</small>\n|-\n|1\n|1500\n|20\n|1480\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|2\n|1020\n|20\n|1000\n|1\n|185\n|-\n|3\n|1500\n|20\n|1480\n|1\n|310\n|-\n|4\n|560\n|20\n|540\n|0\n|495\n|}\n\nAgain, the data size is preserved: 1480 + 1000 = 2480, and 1480 + 540 = 2020.\n\nAlso in this case, the ''More Fragments'' bit remains 1 for all the fragments that came with 1 in them and for the last fragment that arrives, it works as usual, that is the MF bit is set to 0 only in the last one. And of course, the Identification field continues to have the same value in all re-fragmented fragments. This way, even if fragments are re-fragmented, the receiver knows they have initially all started from the same packet.\n\nThe last offset and last data size are used to calculate the total data size:\n<math>495 \\times 8 + 540 = 3960 + 540 = 4500</math>.\n\n===Reassembly===\nA receiver knows that a packet is a fragment, if at least one of the following conditions is true:\n* The flag \"more fragments\" is set, which is true for all fragments except the last.\n* The field \"fragment offset\" is nonzero, which is true for all fragments except the first.\n\nThe receiver identifies matching fragments using the foreign and local address, the protocol ID, and the identification field. The receiver reassembles the data from fragments with the same ID using both the fragment offset and the more fragments flag. When the receiver receives the last fragment, which has the \"more fragments\" flag set to 0, it can calculate the size of the original data payload, by multiplying the last fragment's offset by eight, and adding the last fragment's data size. In the given example, this calculation was 495*8 + 540 = 4500 bytes.\n\nWhen the receiver has all fragments, they can be reassembled in the correct sequence according to the offsets, to form the original datagram.\n\n==Assistive protocols==\nIP addresses are not tied in any permanent manner to hardware identifications and, indeed, a network interface can have multiple IP addresses in modern operating systems. Hosts and routers need additional mechanisms to identify the relationship between device interfaces and IP addresses, in order to properly deliver an IP packet to the destination host on a link. The [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) performs this IP-address-to-hardware-address translation for IPv4. (A hardware address is also called a [[MAC address]].) In addition, the reverse correlation is often necessary. For example, when an IP host is booted or connected to a network it needs to determine its IP address, unless an address is preconfigured by an administrator. Protocols for such inverse correlations exist in the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. Currently used methods are [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP), [[Bootstrap Protocol]] (BOOTP) and, infrequently, [[RARP|reverse ARP]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the Internet]]\n* [[List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks]]\n* [[List of IP protocol numbers]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=note/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiversity | IPv4}}\n* [https://www.iana.org Internet Assigned Numbers Authority] \u2014 Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\n* [http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/ip.htm IP, Internet Protocol] \u2014 IP Header Breakdown, including specific options\n* RFC 3344 \u2014 IPv4 Mobility\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100608114541/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060710-tech-argument-ipv6-nat.html IPv6 vs. carrier-grade NAT/squeezing more out of IPv4]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110109025511/http://www.ripe.net/rs/news/ipv4-ncc-20031030.html RIPE report on address consumption as of October 2003]\n* [https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space Official current state of IPv4 /8 allocations, as maintained by IANA]\n* [https://onlinecareer360.com Dynamically generated graphs of IPv4 address consumption with predictions of exhaustion dates\u2014Geoff Huston]\n* [https://www.apnic.net/community/ecosystem/igf/articles/ip-addressing-in-china-2004 IP addressing in China and the myth of address shortage]\n* [http://www.inetcore.com/project/ipv4ec/index_en.html Countdown of remaining IPv4 available addresses] (estimated)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Internet Standards]]\n[[Category:Internet layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Network layer protocols]]\n[[Category:IPv4| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox networking protocol\n|       title = Internet Protocol version 4\n|        logo = \n|    logo alt = \n|       image = [[File:IPv4 Packet -en.svg|250px]]\n|   image alt = \n|     caption = IPv4 packet\n|    is stack =yes \n|     purpose = [[internetworking]] protocol\n|   developer = [[DARPA]]\n|        date = 1981\n|    based on = \n|  influenced = \n|    osilayer = [[Network layer]]\n|       ports = \n|        rfcs = RFC 791\n|    hardware = \n}}\n{{IPstack}}\n\n'''Internet Protocol version 4''' ('''IPv4''') is the fourth version of the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the [[Internet]] and other [[packet-switched]] networks. IPv4 was the first version deployed for production in the [[ARPANET]] in 1983. It still routes most Internet traffic today,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html |title=BGP Analysis Reports |accessdate=2013-01-09}}</ref> despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, [[IPv6]]. IPv4 is described in [[IETF]] publication RFC 791 (September 1981), replacing an earlier definition (RFC 760, January 1980).\n\nIPv4 uses a 32-bit address space which provides 4,294,967,296 (2<sup>32</sup>) unique addresses, but large blocks are reserved for special networking methods.\n\n==Purpose==\nThe Internet Protocol is the protocol that defines and enables [[internetwork]]ing at the [[internet layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. In essence it forms the Internet. It uses a logical addressing system and performs ''routing'', which is the forwarding of packets from a source host to the next router that is one hop closer to the intended destination host on another network.\n\nIPv4 is a [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]] protocol, and operates on a [[best effort delivery]] model, in that it does not guarantee delivery, nor does it assure proper sequencing or avoidance of duplicate delivery. These aspects, including data integrity, are addressed by an [[upper layer protocol|upper layer]] transport protocol, such as the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP).\n\n==Addressing==<!--redirect from [[IPv4 address]]-->\n[[File:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of the quad-dotted IPv4 address representation to its [[Binary numeral system|binary]] value]]\nIPv4 uses 32-bit addresses which limits the [[address space]] to {{gaps|4|294|967|296}} (2<sup>32</sup>) addresses.\n\nIPv4 reserves special address blocks for [[private network]]s (~18 million addresses) and [[multicast]] addresses (~270 million addresses).\n\n===Address representations===\nIPv4 addresses may be represented in any notation expressing a 32-bit integer value. They are most often written in [[dot-decimal notation]], which consists of four [[Octet (computing)|octet]]s of the address expressed individually in [[decimal]] numbers and separated by [[Full stop|periods]].\n\nFor example, the quad-dotted IP address ''192.0.2.235'' represents the 32-bit [[decimal]] number 3221226219, which in [[hexadecimal]] format is 0xC00002EB. This may also be expressed in dotted hex format as 0xC0.0x00.0x02.0xEB, or with octal byte values as 0300.0000.0002.0353.\n\n[[CIDR notation]] combines the address with its routing prefix in a compact format, in which the address is followed by a slash character (/) and the count of consecutive ''1'' bits in the routing prefix (subnet mask).\n\nOther address representations were in common use when [[classful network]]ing was practiced. For example, the loopback address ''127.0.0.1'' is commonly written as ''127.1'', given that it belongs to a class-A network with eight bits for the network mask and 24 bits for the host number. When fewer than four numbers are specified in the address in dotted notation, the last value is treated as an integer of as many bytes as are required to fill out the address to four octets. Thus, the address ''127.65530'' is equivalent to ''127.0.255.250''.\n\n===Allocation===\nIn the original design of IPv4, an IP address was divided into two parts: the network identifier was the most significant octet of the address, and the host identifier was the rest of the address. The latter was also called the ''rest field''. This structure permitted a maximum of 256 network identifiers, which was quickly found to be inadequate.\n\nTo overcome this limit, the most-significant address octet was redefined in 1981 to create ''network classes'', in a system which later became known as [[classful network]]ing. The revised system defined five classes. Classes A, B, and C had different bit lengths for network identification. The rest of the address was used as previously to identify a host within a network. Because of the different sizes of fields in different classes, each network class had a different capacity for addressing hosts. In addition to the three classes for addressing hosts, Class D was defined for [[multicast]] addressing and Class E was reserved for future applications.\n\nDividing existing classful networks into subnets began in 1985 with the publication of {{IETF RFC|950}}. This division was made more flexible with the introduction of variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) in {{IETF RFC|1109}} in 1987. In 1993, based on this work, {{IETF RFC|1517}} introduced [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3com.com/other/pdfs/infra/corpinfo/en_US/501302.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010616012053/http://www.3com.com/other/pdfs/infra/corpinfo/en_US/501302.pdf |archive-date=June 16, 2001 |title=Understanding IP Addressing: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know |publisher=3Com |url-status=dead}}</ref>  which expressed the number of bits (from the [[Most significant bit|most significant]]) as, for instance, /24, and the class-based scheme was dubbed ''classful'', by contrast. CIDR was designed to permit repartitioning of any address space so that smaller or larger blocks of addresses could be allocated to users. The hierarchical structure created by CIDR is managed by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) and the [[Regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs). Each RIR maintains a publicly searchable [[WHOIS]] database that provides information about IP address assignments.\n\n===Special-use addresses===\nThe [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) and the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) have restricted from general use various [[reserved IP addresses]] for special purposes. Notably these addresses are used for [[multicast]] traffic and to provide addressing space for unrestricted uses on private networks.\n<section begin=IPv4-special-address-blocks/><!-- This table is transcluded to other pages, such as [[Reserved IP addresses]].

Packets addresses in these ranges are not routable in the public Internet; they are ignored by all public routers. Therefore, private hosts cannot directly communicate with public networks, but require [[network address translation]] at a routing gateway for this purpose.\n\n<section begin=IPv4-private-networks/><!-- This table is transcluded to other pages, such as [[Blackhole server]].

Additionally, encapsulated packets may be encrypted for transmission across public networks to secure the data.\n\n===Link-local addressing===\nRFC 3927 defines the special address block 169.254.0.0/16 for link-local addressing. These addresses are only valid on the link (such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection) directly connected to a host that uses them. These addresses are not routable. Like private addresses, these addresses cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the internet. These addresses are primarily used for address autoconfiguration ([[Zeroconf]]) when a host cannot obtain an IP address from a DHCP server or other internal configuration methods.\n\nWhen the address block was reserved, no standards existed for address autoconfiguration. [[Microsoft]] created an implementation called [[Automatic Private IP Addressing]] (APIPA), which was deployed on millions of machines and became a [[de facto standard]]. Many years later, in May 2005, the [[IETF]] defined a formal standard in RFC 3927, entitled ''Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses''.\n\n===Loopback===\n{{Main|Localhost}}\nThe class A network 127.0.0.0 (classless network 127.0.0.0/8) is reserved for [[loopback]]. IP packets whose source addresses belong to this network should never appear outside a host. Packets received on a non-loopback interface with a loopback source or destination address must be dropped.\n\n===Addresses ending in 0 or 255===\n{{See also|IPv4 subnetting reference}}\nThe first address in a subnet is used to identify the subnet itself. The last address is used as a local [[broadcast address]] for all devices on the subnet.\n\nFor example, in the subnet 192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0 (192.168.5.0/24) the identifier 192.168.5.0 commonly is used to refer to the entire subnet. To avoid ambiguity in representation, the address ending in the octet ''0'' is reserved.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc923 |title=RFC 923  |date=June 1984 |website=IETF  |access-date=15 November 2019 |quote=Special Addresses:  In certain contexts, it is useful to have fixed addresses with functional significance rather than as identifiers of specific  hosts.  When such usage is called for, the address zero is to be interpreted as meaning \"this\", as in \"this network\".}}</ref>\n\nA broadcast address<ref name=\":0\" /> is an address that allows information to be sent to all interfaces in a given subnet, rather than a specific machine. The broadcast address is the last address in the address range of the subnet. For example, the broadcast address for the network 192.168.5.0 is 192.168.5.255. For networks of size /24 or larger, the broadcast address always ends in 255.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:left;\"\n! !! Binary form !!

One can use the following addresses for hosts, even though they end with 255: 192.168.1.255, 192.168.2.255, etc. Also, 192.168.0.0 is the network identifier and must not be assigned to an interface.<ref>{{cite web\n|url       = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-31\n|title     = Requirements for Internet Hosts&nbsp;\u2013 Communication Layers\n|author     = [[Robert Braden]]\n|date=October 1989\n|publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n|page      = 31\n|rfc       = 1122\n}}</ref> The addresses 192.168.1.0, 192.168.2.0, etc., may be assigned, despite ending with 0.\n\nIn the past, conflict between network addresses and broadcast addresses arose because some software used non-standard broadcast addresses with zeros instead of ones.<ref>{{cite web\n|url       = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-66\n|title     = Requirements for Internet Hosts&nbsp;\u2013 Communication Layers\n|author     = [[Robert Braden]]\n|date=October 1989\n|publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n|page      = 66\n|rfc       = 1122\n}}</ref>\n\nIn networks smaller than /24, broadcast addresses do not necessarily end with 255.

The use of domain names requires translating, called ''resolving'', them to addresses and vice versa. This is analogous to looking up a phone number in a phone book using the recipient's name.\n\nThe translation between addresses and domain names is performed by the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), a hierarchical, distributed naming system that allows for the subdelegation of [[namespace]]s to other DNS servers.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Address space exhaustion==\n{{Main|IPv4 address exhaustion}}\nSince the 1980s, it was apparent that the pool of available IPv4 addresses was depleting at a rate that was not initially anticipated in the original design of the network.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = World 'running out of Internet addresses'\n |url         = http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20110121-315808/World-running-out-of-Internet-addresses\n |access-date  = 2011-01-23\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110125195711/http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20110121-315808/World-running-out-of-Internet-addresses\n |archive-date = 2011-01-25\n |df          = \n}}</ref> The main market forces that accelerated address depletion included the rapidly growing number of Internet users, who increasingly used mobile computing devices, such as [[laptop computers]], [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), and [[smart phone]]s with IP data services.

The threat of exhaustion motivated the introduction of a number of remedial technologies, such as [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) methods by the mid 1990s, pervasive use of [[network address translation]] (NAT) in network access provider systems, and strict usage-based allocation policies at the regional and local Internet registries.\n\nThe primary address pool of the Internet, maintained by [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]], was exhausted on 3 February 2011, when the last five blocks were allocated to the five RIRs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nro.net/news/ipv4-free-pool-depleted|title=Free Pool of IPv4 Address Space Depleted|last=Smith|first=Lucie|author2=Lipner, Ian|date=3 February 2011|publisher=[[Number Resource Organization]]|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2011-February/032107.html |title=Five /8s allocated to RIRs&nbsp;\u2013 no unallocated IPv4 unicast /8s remain | author=ICANN,nanog mailing list}}</ref> [[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre|APNIC]] was the first RIR to exhaust its regional pool on 15 April 2011, except for a small amount of address space reserved for the transition technologies to IPv6, which is to be allocated under a restricted policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=APNIC IPv4 Address Pool Reaches Final /8|url=http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8|access-date=15 April 2011|author=Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre|date=15 April 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807162057/http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8|archive-date=7 August 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe long-term solution to the impending address exhaustion was the 1998 specification of a new version of the Internet Protocol, [[IPv6]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2460.html|title=Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> which increased the address size to 128 bits.

The most significant bit is numbered 0, so the version field is actually found in the four most significant bits of the first byte, for example.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;\"\n|+ IPv4 Header Format\n|-\n!

The design accommodates networks of diverse physical nature; it is independent of the underlying transmission technology used in the link layer. Networks with different hardware usually vary not only in transmission speed, but also in the [[MTU (networking)|maximum transmission unit]] (MTU). When one network wants to transmit datagrams to a network with a smaller MTU, it may [[IP fragmentation|fragment]] its datagrams. In IPv4, this function was placed at the [[Internet Layer]], and is performed in IPv4 routers, which thus require no implementation of any higher layers for the function of routing IP packets.\n\nIn contrast, [[IPv6]], the next generation of the Internet Protocol, does not allow routers to perform fragmentation; hosts must determine the path MTU before sending datagrams.\n\n===Fragmentation===\nWhen a router receives a packet, it examines the destination address and determines the outgoing interface to use and that interface's MTU.  If the packet size is bigger than the MTU, and the Do not Fragment (DF) bit in the packet's header is set to 0, then the router may fragment the packet.\n\nThe router divides the packet into fragments. The max size of each fragment is the MTU minus the IP header size (20 bytes minimum; 60 bytes maximum). The router puts each fragment into its own packet, each fragment packet having following changes:\n* The ''total length'' field is the fragment size.\n* The ''more fragments'' (MF) flag is set for all fragments except the last one, which is set to 0.\n* The ''fragment offset'' field is set, based on the offset of the fragment in the original data payload. This is measured in units of eight-byte blocks.\n* The ''header checksum'' field is recomputed.\n\nFor example, for an MTU of 1,500 bytes and a header size of 20 bytes, the fragment offsets would be multiples of\n<math>\\frac{1500-20}{8} = 185</math>.\nThese multiples are 0, 185, 370, 555, 740, ...\n\nIt is possible that a packet is fragmented at one router, and that the fragments are further fragmented at another router. For example, a packet of 4,520 bytes, including the 20 bytes of the IP header (without options) is fragmented to two packets on a link with an MTU of 2,500 bytes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!|Fragment\n!|Size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Header size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Data size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Flag<br/>''More fragments''\n!|Fragment offset<br/><small>(8-byte blocks)</small>\n|-\n|1\n|2500\n|20\n|2480\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|2\n|2040\n|20\n|2020\n|0\n|310\n|}\n\nThe total data size is preserved: 2480 bytes + 2020 bytes = 4500 bytes.\nThe offsets are\n<math>0</math>\nand\n<math>\\frac{0 + 2480}{8} = 310</math>.\n\nOn a link with an MTU of 1,500 bytes,  each fragment results in two fragments:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!|Fragment\n!|Size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Header size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Data size<br/><small>(bytes)</small>\n!|Flag<br/>''More fragments''\n!|Fragment offset<br/><small>(8-byte blocks)</small>\n|-\n|1\n|1500\n|20\n|1480\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|2\n|1020\n|20\n|1000\n|1\n|185\n|-\n|3\n|1500\n|20\n|1480\n|1\n|310\n|-\n|4\n|560\n|20\n|540\n|0\n|495\n|}\n\nAgain, the data size is preserved: 1480 + 1000 = 2480, and 1480 + 540 = 2020.\n\nAlso in this case, the ''More Fragments'' bit remains 1 for all the fragments that came with 1 in them and for the last fragment that arrives, it works as usual, that is the MF bit is set to 0 only in the last one. And of course, the Identification field continues to have the same value in all re-fragmented fragments. This way, even if fragments are re-fragmented, the receiver knows they have initially all started from the same packet.\n\nThe last offset and last data size are used to calculate the total data size:\n<math>495 \\times 8 + 540 = 3960 + 540 = 4500</math>.\n\n===Reassembly===\nA receiver knows that a packet is a fragment, if at least one of the following conditions is true:\n* The flag \"more fragments\" is set, which is true for all fragments except the last.\n* The field \"fragment offset\" is nonzero, which is true for all fragments except the first.\n\nThe receiver identifies matching fragments using the foreign and local address, the protocol ID, and the identification field. The receiver reassembles the data from fragments with the same ID using both the fragment offset and the more fragments flag. When the receiver receives the last fragment, which has the \"more fragments\" flag set to 0, it can calculate the size of the original data payload, by multiplying the last fragment's offset by eight, and adding the last fragment's data size. In the given example, this calculation was 495*8 + 540 = 4500 bytes.\n\nWhen the receiver has all fragments, they can be reassembled in the correct sequence according to the offsets, to form the original datagram.\n\n==Assistive protocols==\nIP addresses are not tied in any permanent manner to hardware identifications and, indeed, a network interface can have multiple IP addresses in modern operating systems. Hosts and routers need additional mechanisms to identify the relationship between device interfaces and IP addresses, in order to properly deliver an IP packet to the destination host on a link. The [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) performs this IP-address-to-hardware-address translation for IPv4. (A hardware address is also called a [[MAC address]].) In addition, the reverse correlation is often necessary. For example, when an IP host is booted or connected to a network it needs to determine its IP address, unless an address is preconfigured by an administrator. Protocols for such inverse correlations exist in the [[Internet Protocol Suite]].

The towns which comprised the Boroughs varied slightly over this long period, but primarily consisted of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Lampeter]] and [[Adpar]], the latter now a suburb of [[Newcastle Emlyn]] across the [[River Teifi|Teifi]], in [[Carmarthenshire]].\n\nThe county constituency (a distinction from borough class remains, namely as to type of returning officer and permissible electoral expenses) was merged in 1983 with part of [[Pembrokeshire]], making a new constituency named [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]].

The county was given one member, who was to be elected by each person who owned property of a sufficient value. In addition the inhabitants of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Adpar]] and [[Lampeter]] were given the right to elect one MP between them, with the vote restricted to the [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]]. The [[1715 British general election|general election of 1715]] saw the return of [[Lewis Pryse]], who was expelled from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the following year for refusing to attend the House to take oaths of loyalty to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] after the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rising]], with which he sympathised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/expulsions.html|title=Members expelled from the House of Commons since the Restoration|work=demon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Reformed elections ===\nFrom 1832 the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] changed the electoral system so that householders of homes worth over \u00a310 were enfranchised in the boroughs. The Borough constituency was still dominated by the [[Pryse baronets|Loveden-Pryse]] family based in [[Gogerddan]] who were supporters of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]; Pryse Pryse held the seat unopposed from 1818 until his death in 1849, except for the 1841 election when he narrowly retained the seat after a controversial contest. The Cardiganshire county constituency, however, was dominated by the Powell family of [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]] who were [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. [[William Edward Powell]] held the seat from 1816 until shortly before his death in 1854. By agreement between the followers of Gogerddan and Nanteos, neither challenged the others' nomination and as a result there were no contested elections in the county until 1859.\n\nFollowing Powell's retirement, the representation fell to [[Ernest Vaughan, 4th Earl of Lisburne|Ernest Vaughan]] of Trawscoed, whose politics were Conservative.\n\nThe county saw its first contest in the [[1859 United Kingdom general election|1859 general election]] when Colonel [[William Thomas Rowland Powell|W.T.R. Powell]] of Nanteos sought to re-establish the family's claim to the county seat. He was opposed by Arthur Saunders-Davies of Pentre but prevailed by a narrow margin. Both candidates held conservative views but Powell sat as a Liberal-Conservative.\n\nHowever, the era where Nanteos could claim the seat were numbered, and [[Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Lloyd]] of Bronwydd was mooted as a potential Liberal candidate at the 1854 by-election,<ref name=\"W edit 17-2-54\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4348090/4348092/19|accessdate=24 January 2019 |newspaper=Welshman |date=17 February 1854 |page=2}}</ref> and again at the General Elections of 1857<ref name=\"W edit 27-3-57\">{{cite news|title=Editorial [untitled]|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4349354/4349357/7|accessdate=6 February 2019|newspaper=Welshman|date=27 March 1857|page=3}}</ref> and 1859.<ref name=\"W 22-4-59 edit\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4350326/4350331/40 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |newspaper=Welshman |date=22 April 1859 |page=5}}</ref>\n\nBy the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|1865 general election]], Powell had indicated some twelve months prior to the election that he would retire and Lloyd of Bronwydd was selected as the Liberal candidate. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. The result was that both [[Henry Richard]] and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]] offered themselves as candidates. A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell announced his retirement. Lloyd now stated that he would now fight the seat after all and Richard withdrew in his favour. David Davies, however, did not withdraw and came within 361 votes of victory.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=16}}\n\nLloyd transferred to the borough in the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 election]] when the seat was captured by Swansea industrialist, [[Evan Mathew Richards|E.M. Richards]]. This election is often regarded as a landmark when tenant farmers allegedly refused to follow patterns of age-old deference and vote in line with the wishes of their landlords. Following this election there were claims of intimidation by Conservative landlords and a national fund was set up to support those purportedly evicted from their farms. In reality, however, Richards' victory owed much to the support of the powerful Pryse family of [[Pryse baronets|Gogerddan]].\n\nIn 1874, the Conservative candidate [[Thomas Edward Lloyd]] of Coedmore captured the seat for the Conservatives, defeating Richards by 215 votes. The result was greeted with disbelief in Liberal ranks, particularly since the introduction of the secret ballot was expected to have favoured the Liberals.<ref name=\"CN edit 13-2-74\">{{cite news|title=Liberal Defeat in Cardiganshire (editorial).|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3343745/3343751/58|accessdate=18 January 2018|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=13 February 1874|page=6}}</ref> However, the Conservatives had chosen a candidate who was popular in his locality and not been involved in conflicts with his tenants.

This brought into the county seat the more radical politics of urban voters in the boroughs of [[Aberystwyth]], [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Lampeter]] and Adpar. More significantly, the further widening of the franchise in 1884 added between five and six thousand new voters to the register by extending the pattern of household suffrage to the counties. The majority of these voters would have been tenant farmers, the more prosperous agricultural labourers, and householders in small towns or large villages such as Tregaron, Aberaeron, New Quay, Aberporth, Tal-y-bont and Borth, which had not been part of the old Cardigan Boroughs constituency. The impact of the widening of the franchise and boundary changes was to increase the electorate from 5,026 in 1883 to 12,308 by 1886.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=313}}</ref> It was assumed that these changes would make the county a reasonably safe bet for the Liberal Party and that supporters of Gladstone would be comfortably returned at every election. These structural changes to the political arrangements of the county were also taking place against wider social and economic developments which affected all aspects of Cardiganshire life. Traditional industries were in decline, agriculture was increasingly in crisis and it was becoming increasingly difficult for a still-increasing population to earn a living within their native parishes and communities. As a result, there were two major consequences. Firstly there was a significant population shift as a result of emigration, in the majority of cases to the south Wales valleys. Secondly, the great landed estates of the county, which had for so long dominated the politics of the county, were in many cases heavily in debt. This second factor contributed to the loss of landowner influence in the politics of the county, a trend that became very apparent at the first elections to the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|Cardiganshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=314\u201318; 319\u201320}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the predictions that Gladstonian Liberals would dominate county politics were realised, in 1885, [[David Davies (Liberal politician)|David Davies]] was elected to represent the constituency with a majority of 2,323 (24.2%) on a turnout of 78%, heavily defeating the Conservative, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]]. Although David Davies was no public speaker, he drew substantial support in Cardiganshire as a generous benefactor of the new university college at Aberystwyth and also through his links with Calvinistic Methodism, which had over 13,000 members in the county. Allied to this was a particularly effective Liberal association which paid close attention to the registration of voters.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=322\u20133}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|David Davies (industrialist)}}\n\nIn 1886, however, Davies broke with Gladstone over home rule for Ireland in 1886 and a number of his associates such as [[Robert J. Davies, Cwrtmawr]] followed him into the [[Liberal Unionist]] camp.<ref name=\"AO 18860626\">{{cite news|title=Meeting in support of Mr D.

This election split the Liberal Party in Cardiganshire and the election was hotly contested with almost all the landowners, including those previously regarded as having Liberal sympathies, supporting Davies. He also received the support of several prominent Liberals, especially from his own Methodist denomination.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=323\u20134}}</ref> The result of the election was largely attributed to the influence of nonconformist ministers over their congregations, although the more effective canvassing of supporters by the Liberal Association was also identified as an important factor.<ref name=\"AO 18870717\">{{cite news|title=Cardiganshire Election and its lessons (editorial)|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3301611/3301615/39|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=17 July 1886}}</ref>\n\nEven though Bowen Rowlands's victory was by the closest of margins it was a decisive moment in the political history of Cardiganshire. It proved that a Gladstonian Liberal candidate, even an Anglican with strong Irish Nationalist sympathies, could triumph in Cardiganshire even against the resources and religious connections of a candidate such as David Davies. Although Liberal Unionism continued to be championed by a relatively small group, led by the journalist Henry Tobit Evans, who published a newspaper, ''Y Brython'', at Lampeter, most of the leading Liberals who had defected to Davies eventually returned to the fold, in some cases to contest the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|1889 County Council]] elections. The demise of Liberal Unionism was confirmed at the 1892 general election when, William Jones, a self-made Birmingham draper who had a small estate in Cardiganshire and was a member of the [[Cardiganshire County Council]] ran with the support of Joseph Chamberlain. Chamberlain had sponsored a number of Nonconformist unionist candidates in Wales in the hope of capitalising upon perceived antipathy towards Irish Nationalism. Despite spending heavily and producing a farmer evicted at the 1868 Election on his platform, Jones was heavily defeated by Bowen Rowlands.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=324\u20135}}</ref> Rowlands served until 1895.\n\nOnce Rowlands's intention not to stand again was known, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]] of [[Tan-y-Bwlch, Aberystwyth|Tan-y-Bwlch]], who had been the Conservative candidate in the seat in 1885, but who had subsequently joined the Liberal Party, emerged as a contender for the nomination and was eventually chosen by a delegate conference, defeating [[John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids|Wynford Phillips]] by 160 votes to 111.<ref name=\"AO 4-7-95 LibCand\">{{cite news|title=Representation of Cardiganshire.

His closest electoral call came in the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|'Khaki election' of 1900]] when he had a majority of 781 (9.4%) over [[J.C. Harford]] of Falcondale. Thereafter, Vaughan Davies was comfortably returned at each election but the vitality of the Liberal Association was in serious decline. During this time the ''Cambrian News'' had tempered its opposition to him and grudgingly admitted that Vaughan-Davies had won friends and supporteres by his adherence to Liberal policies.<ref name=\"CN 27-10-00 edit\">{{cite news|title=The Two Cardiganshire Candidates (editorial)|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3317276/ART27|accessdate=27 October 2014|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=5 October 1900}}</ref>\n\nBy 1914 the Liberal Association was heavily dependent on Vaughan Davies's role as treasurer to keep it going. In the meantime, Vaughan Davies remained on poor terms with prominent Liberals, including [[John Gibson (editor and journalist)|John Gibson]], editor of the ''Cambrian News'' until his death in 1915.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=328\u20139}}</ref>\n\nLike most Welsh Liberals, he supported [[David Lloyd George]] in the split in the Liberal Party, and not [[H. H. Asquith]], and was therefore returned unopposed as a Coalition Liberal in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]].\n\n===Liberal infighting (1921\u20131950)===\nIn many ways the Liberals had become the new elite in Cardiganshire by the time of the First World War. This was demonstrated in 1919 when [[John Humphreys Davies]], the nonconformist squire of Cwrtmawr, was appointed Principal of the University College, Aberystwyth, at the expense of [[Thomas Jones (T. J.)|Thomas Jones]], who was championed by Lord Davies of Llandinam, grandson of [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|page=330}}</ref>\n\nWith Vaughan Davies known to be a supporter of Lloyd George, it was natural that Lloyd George looked to him to boost his support in the [[House of Lords]] and awarded him a peerage in the New Years' Honours list in 1921. Although he would have preferred to be called 'Lord Ceredigion', the Garter King of Arms refused this as an inappropriate title for a Baron, and so Vaughan Davies took his title from the [[River Ystwyth]] which ran past his home. The peerage created a vacancy in a historically Liberal seat and the Asquithites decided to take the Lloyd Georgeites on in their 'backyard' in what became a memorable [[1921 Cardiganshire by-election|by-election]].\n\n[[Ernest Evans (politician)|Ernest Evans]], who asserted on his election posters that he was 'THE Liberal candidate', was a Barrister from Aberystwyth and had been Private Secretary to Lloyd George himself, and therefore had the blessing of the Coalition and official support from the Conservatives. A number of possible Asquithian Liberal candidates were approached to contest the seat against Evans and eventually the choice fell upon [[W. Llewelyn Williams]] who was sponsored by the Asquithite 'Welsh Liberal Federation'. No other candidate stood and in the straight fight, Evans won with a majority of 3,590 (14.6%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=332\u20135}}</ref>\n\nEvans held on as a 'National Liberal' (as Lloyd George's supporters called themselves) in the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] but with a slim majority of 515 votes (2.0%) over [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]].\n\nThe sudden shotgun merger of the two factions in the Liberal Party led to Evans getting the official approval of the unified party for the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]]. However, the Conservatives decided to fight and this deprived him of their votes. Hopkin Morris decided to fight again as an unofficial Liberal and won with a 5,078 vote majority. Hopkin Morris was lucky to survive the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]], a disaster for the Liberals, by being returned unopposed.\n\nThe first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate stood against [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]] at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] and polled 24% of the vote in a straight fight against Morris, who had a 13,752 (52.0%) majority.\n\nIn 1932, Morris left Parliament temporarily (he was later to return as MP for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]]) when he was appointed as a Metropolitan Police magistrate. The byelection on 22 September 1932 saw the first three-way fight between the parties, but was won by [[Owen Evans (politician)|Owen Evans]] for the Liberals. Like many of the Liberal MPs he had been a barrister. Evans died shortly before the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], but the seat was easily held by his successor [[Roderic Bowen]]. Unusually the Labour vote actually fell in percentage terms compared with the previous election despite the Labour landslide in the country at large.\n\n===Labour challenge (1950\u20131972)===\nLabour established itself as the main challenger to the Liberals at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] in a three-way contest, and the Conservatives opted out of the contest thereafter until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. This was partly a move to keep the seat from going Labour. [[Plaid Cymru]] first fought the seat in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] and kept their deposit (just, with 12.8% of the vote).\n\nWith a four-way contest involving the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru at the 1964 general election, and a national swing to Labour, Roderic Bowen suffered a precipitate decline in his share of the vote to only 38.4%; he was re-elected with a majority of 2,219 (7.4%) over Labour. After the death of the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] in 1965, Bowen accepted the offer to become a Deputy Speaker, which prevented him from speaking on behalf of his constituency. For the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 election]], Labour selected [[Elystan Morgan]] who had been a member of Plaid Cymru until 1964; with a further national swing and Morgan making a credible bid for the Welsh-speaking vote, Labour won the seat by 523 votes.\n\n===1974 onwards===\nIn boundary changes in 1983, the constituency was merged with a northern area of [[Pembrokeshire]] and also took a Welsh version of its name, becoming known as [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]].\n\nCeredigion was recreated for the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]] as it reverted to its former borders, having lost the part of North Pembrokeshire in boundary changes.\n\nMark Williams, first elected in 2005, was the first non-Welsh speaking Member of Parliament elected to represent the constituency since Bowen Rowlands (MP from 1886 until 1892, who declared at a meeting in Aberystwyth when adopted as candidate that he could not speak Welsh).<ref>{{cite news|title=The County Election|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3301595/ART95|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=3 July 1886}}</ref> At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], he received a massive increase in his vote, polling over 50% of the votes cast and raising his majority from 219 to 8,324 over the Plaid Cymru candidate, Penri James.\n\nIn [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], Williams suffered a decline of over 14% in his vote share, in common with other Liberal Democrat incumbents across the UK. However, after a campaign which made national headlines due to prior controversial comments by both the Plaid Cymru<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32227229|title=Election 2015: 'Baptism of fire' for Plaid candidate|date=9 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and Labour<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32249455|title=Election 2015: Candidate suggested cars be damaged|date=10 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> candidates, Plaid Cymru were unable to capitalise as their vote share went down slightly. The Conservative vote also declined, while UKIP, Labour and the Greens all improved on their 2010 performance. Williams retained the seat to become the only Liberal Democrat MP in Wales, and one of only eight across the UK.\n\nIn [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]], Williams lost his seat to [[Ben Lake]] by 104 votes (0.2%). Labour moved from fifth to third in the seat and were roughly 3,000 votes behind Williams and Lake, their best result in Ceredigion since 1997, and the Tories fell to fourth but increased their vote by more than 3,000. The 29.2% won by Plaid Cymru in 2017 was the lowest winning vote share of the election and the only seat won with less than 30% of the vote. At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]] Lake substantially increased both his majority and vote share, with the Liberal Democrats falling to third place.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===MPs 1541\u20131640===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!Member\n|-\n|1541\u20131543|| [[Morgan ap Rice ap Philip]]\n|-\n|1543\u20131544|| [[Thomas Gynns]]\n|-\n|1545\u20131547|| [[David ap Llewellin Lloid of Llan Dissill]]\n|-\n|1547|| [[William Devereux (MP)|William Devereux]]\n|-\n|1553 (Mar)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1553 (Oct)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Apr)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Nov)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1555|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1558|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1563|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1571|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1572|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1584|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1586|| [[Griffith Lloyd]]\n|-\n|1588|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1593|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1597|| [[Thomas Pryse]]\n|-\n|1601|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1604\u20131611|| [[John Lewis (of Abernant)|Sir John Lewis]]\n|-\n|1614\u20131622|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Sir Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1625\u20131629|| [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n|-\n|1629\u20131640|| ''No Parliaments summoned''\n|}\n\n===MPs after 1640===\n\n'''[[Short Parliament]]'''\n*1640: [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n\n'''[[Long Parliament]]'''\n* 1640\u20131644: [[Walter Lloyd]] ([[Cavalier|Royalist]]) \u2013 ''disabled to sit, 5 February 1644''\n* 1646\u20131648: [[Sir Richard Pryse, 1st Baronet]] \u2013 ''excluded in [[Pride's Purge]], December 1648''\n\n''Cardiganshire was unrepresented in the [[Barebones Parliament]]''\n\n'''[[First Protectorate Parliament]]'''\n*1654\u20131655: [[James Philipps|Col.

Created in 1536, the franchise expanded in the late 19th century and on the enfranchisement of women. Its boundaries remained virtually unchanged until 1983. From 1536 until 1885 the area had two seats (electing MPs): a [[county constituency]] (Cardiganshire) comprising the rural areas, the other the borough constituency known as the [[Cardigan Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardigan District of Boroughs]] comprising a few separate towns; in 1885 the latter was abolished, its towns and electors incorporated into the former, reduced to one MP. The towns which comprised the Boroughs varied slightly over this long period, but primarily consisted of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Lampeter]] and [[Adpar]], the latter now a suburb of [[Newcastle Emlyn]] across the [[River Teifi|Teifi]], in [[Carmarthenshire]].\n\nThe county constituency (a distinction from borough class remains, namely as to type of returning officer and permissible electoral expenses) was merged in 1983 with part of [[Pembrokeshire]], making a new constituency named [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]]. In 1997 it was recreated and its non-Anglicised name became its formal name, ''Ceredigion''.\n\nThe [[Ceredigion (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Ceredigion Welsh Assembly constituency]] was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe boundaries of this constituency mirror almost exactly those of the county of [[Ceredigion]].\n\n=== Proposed constituency changes ===\nUnder proposed constituency boundary changes announced in September 2016, ahead of the next general election, the seat's boundaries will be extended. The seat, which has the proposed name of Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire, includes all of the current Ceredigion constituency, the northern part of the current [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]] constituency, a small part of [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]] around the village of [[Dre-fach Felindre]], as well the south-western part of [[Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] around [[Llanidloes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ceredigion could return to south constituency boundary|work=Cambrian News|date=19 September 2016|url=http://cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108475&headline=Ceredigion%20could%20return%20to%20south%20constituency%20boundary&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920131235/http://www.cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108475&headline=Ceredigion%20could%20return%20to%20south%20constituency%20boundary&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 September 2016|access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|title=2018 Review of Parliamentary Constituencies \u2014 Initial Proposals Report|publisher=Boundary Commission for Wales|date=September 2016|section=Ceredigion a Gogledd Sir Benfro (Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire)|page=80|access-date=<!--30 October 2016-->}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Ceredigion]], formerly known by the anglicised version of its name as ''Cardiganshire'', was first enfranchised in 1536 when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] incorporated [[Wales]] within England. The county was given one member, who was to be elected by each person who owned property of a sufficient value. In addition the inhabitants of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Adpar]] and [[Lampeter]] were given the right to elect one MP between them, with the vote restricted to the [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]]. The [[1715 British general election|general election of 1715]] saw the return of [[Lewis Pryse]], who was expelled from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the following year for refusing to attend the House to take oaths of loyalty to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] after the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rising]], with which he sympathised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/expulsions.html|title=Members expelled from the House of Commons since the Restoration|work=demon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Reformed elections ===\nFrom 1832 the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] changed the electoral system so that householders of homes worth over \u00a310 were enfranchised in the boroughs. The Borough constituency was still dominated by the [[Pryse baronets|Loveden-Pryse]] family based in [[Gogerddan]] who were supporters of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]; Pryse Pryse held the seat unopposed from 1818 until his death in 1849, except for the 1841 election when he narrowly retained the seat after a controversial contest. The Cardiganshire county constituency, however, was dominated by the Powell family of [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]] who were [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. [[William Edward Powell]] held the seat from 1816 until shortly before his death in 1854. By agreement between the followers of Gogerddan and Nanteos, neither challenged the others' nomination and as a result there were no contested elections in the county until 1859.\n\nFollowing Powell's retirement, the representation fell to [[Ernest Vaughan, 4th Earl of Lisburne|Ernest Vaughan]] of Trawscoed, whose politics were Conservative.\n\nThe county saw its first contest in the [[1859 United Kingdom general election|1859 general election]] when Colonel [[William Thomas Rowland Powell|W.T.R. Powell]] of Nanteos sought to re-establish the family's claim to the county seat. He was opposed by Arthur Saunders-Davies of Pentre but prevailed by a narrow margin. Both candidates held conservative views but Powell sat as a Liberal-Conservative.\n\nHowever, the era where Nanteos could claim the seat were numbered, and [[Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Lloyd]] of Bronwydd was mooted as a potential Liberal candidate at the 1854 by-election,<ref name=\"W edit 17-2-54\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4348090/4348092/19|accessdate=24 January 2019 |newspaper=Welshman |date=17 February 1854 |page=2}}</ref> and again at the General Elections of 1857<ref name=\"W edit 27-3-57\">{{cite news|title=Editorial [untitled]|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4349354/4349357/7|accessdate=6 February 2019|newspaper=Welshman|date=27 March 1857|page=3}}</ref> and 1859.<ref name=\"W 22-4-59 edit\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4350326/4350331/40 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |newspaper=Welshman |date=22 April 1859 |page=5}}</ref>\n\nBy the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|1865 general election]], Powell had indicated some twelve months prior to the election that he would retire and Lloyd of Bronwydd was selected as the Liberal candidate. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. The result was that both [[Henry Richard]] and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]] offered themselves as candidates. A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell announced his retirement. Lloyd now stated that he would now fight the seat after all and Richard withdrew in his favour. David Davies, however, did not withdraw and came within 361 votes of victory.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=16}}\n\nLloyd transferred to the borough in the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 election]] when the seat was captured by Swansea industrialist, [[Evan Mathew Richards|E.M. Richards]]. This election is often regarded as a landmark when tenant farmers allegedly refused to follow patterns of age-old deference and vote in line with the wishes of their landlords. Following this election there were claims of intimidation by Conservative landlords and a national fund was set up to support those purportedly evicted from their farms. In reality, however, Richards' victory owed much to the support of the powerful Pryse family of [[Pryse baronets|Gogerddan]].\n\nIn 1874, the Conservative candidate [[Thomas Edward Lloyd]] of Coedmore captured the seat for the Conservatives, defeating Richards by 215 votes. The result was greeted with disbelief in Liberal ranks, particularly since the introduction of the secret ballot was expected to have favoured the Liberals.<ref name=\"CN edit 13-2-74\">{{cite news|title=Liberal Defeat in Cardiganshire (editorial).|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3343745/3343751/58|accessdate=18 January 2018|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=13 February 1874|page=6}}</ref> However, the Conservatives had chosen a candidate who was popular in his locality and not been involved in conflicts with his tenants. The Liberals were also caught unprepared for the contest, with Lloyd's candidature kept secret until nomination day.<ref name=\"SWDN edit 5-2-74\">{{cite news|title=The Cardiganshire Election (editorial)|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3499558/3499560/24|accessdate=19 January 2018|newspaper=South Wales Daily News|date=5 February 1874|page=2}}</ref> Much capital was also made of the fact that Lloyd was a Cardiganshire man, in contrast to Richards, a Swansea industrialist.<ref name=\"AO edit 14-2-74\">{{cite news|title=The Conservative Victory in Cardiganshire (editorial).|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3040206/3040210/27|accessdate=20 January 2018|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=14 February 1874|page=2}}</ref> The result was reversed in 1880 although there were close contests for the county thereafter, on a slightly widened franchise.\n\n===Single constituency===\nIn a redistribution of seats for the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]], the borough constituency was abolished and absorbed into the county. This brought into the county seat the more radical politics of urban voters in the boroughs of [[Aberystwyth]], [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Lampeter]] and Adpar. More significantly, the further widening of the franchise in 1884 added between five and six thousand new voters to the register by extending the pattern of household suffrage to the counties. The majority of these voters would have been tenant farmers, the more prosperous agricultural labourers, and householders in small towns or large villages such as Tregaron, Aberaeron, New Quay, Aberporth, Tal-y-bont and Borth, which had not been part of the old Cardigan Boroughs constituency. The impact of the widening of the franchise and boundary changes was to increase the electorate from 5,026 in 1883 to 12,308 by 1886.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=313}}</ref> It was assumed that these changes would make the county a reasonably safe bet for the Liberal Party and that supporters of Gladstone would be comfortably returned at every election. These structural changes to the political arrangements of the county were also taking place against wider social and economic developments which affected all aspects of Cardiganshire life. Traditional industries were in decline, agriculture was increasingly in crisis and it was becoming increasingly difficult for a still-increasing population to earn a living within their native parishes and communities. As a result, there were two major consequences. Firstly there was a significant population shift as a result of emigration, in the majority of cases to the south Wales valleys. Secondly, the great landed estates of the county, which had for so long dominated the politics of the county, were in many cases heavily in debt. This second factor contributed to the loss of landowner influence in the politics of the county, a trend that became very apparent at the first elections to the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|Cardiganshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=314\u201318; 319\u201320}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the predictions that Gladstonian Liberals would dominate county politics were realised, in 1885, [[David Davies (Liberal politician)|David Davies]] was elected to represent the constituency with a majority of 2,323 (24.2%) on a turnout of 78%, heavily defeating the Conservative, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]]. Although David Davies was no public speaker, he drew substantial support in Cardiganshire as a generous benefactor of the new university college at Aberystwyth and also through his links with Calvinistic Methodism, which had over 13,000 members in the county. Allied to this was a particularly effective Liberal association which paid close attention to the registration of voters.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=322\u20133}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|David Davies (industrialist)}}\n\nIn 1886, however, Davies broke with Gladstone over home rule for Ireland in 1886 and a number of his associates such as [[Robert J. Davies, Cwrtmawr]] followed him into the [[Liberal Unionist]] camp.<ref name=\"AO 18860626\">{{cite news|title=Meeting in support of Mr D.

This election split the Liberal Party in Cardiganshire and the election was hotly contested with almost all the landowners, including those previously regarded as having Liberal sympathies, supporting Davies. He also received the support of several prominent Liberals, especially from his own Methodist denomination.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=323\u20134}}</ref> The result of the election was largely attributed to the influence of nonconformist ministers over their congregations, although the more effective canvassing of supporters by the Liberal Association was also identified as an important factor.<ref name=\"AO 18870717\">{{cite news|title=Cardiganshire Election and its lessons (editorial)|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3301611/3301615/39|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=17 July 1886}}</ref>\n\nEven though Bowen Rowlands's victory was by the closest of margins it was a decisive moment in the political history of Cardiganshire. It proved that a Gladstonian Liberal candidate, even an Anglican with strong Irish Nationalist sympathies, could triumph in Cardiganshire even against the resources and religious connections of a candidate such as David Davies. Although Liberal Unionism continued to be championed by a relatively small group, led by the journalist Henry Tobit Evans, who published a newspaper, ''Y Brython'', at Lampeter, most of the leading Liberals who had defected to Davies eventually returned to the fold, in some cases to contest the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|1889 County Council]] elections. The demise of Liberal Unionism was confirmed at the 1892 general election when, William Jones, a self-made Birmingham draper who had a small estate in Cardiganshire and was a member of the [[Cardiganshire County Council]] ran with the support of Joseph Chamberlain. Chamberlain had sponsored a number of Nonconformist unionist candidates in Wales in the hope of capitalising upon perceived antipathy towards Irish Nationalism. Despite spending heavily and producing a farmer evicted at the 1868 Election on his platform, Jones was heavily defeated by Bowen Rowlands.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=324\u20135}}</ref> Rowlands served until 1895.\n\nOnce Rowlands's intention not to stand again was known, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]] of [[Tan-y-Bwlch, Aberystwyth|Tan-y-Bwlch]], who had been the Conservative candidate in the seat in 1885, but who had subsequently joined the Liberal Party, emerged as a contender for the nomination and was eventually chosen by a delegate conference, defeating [[John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids|Wynford Phillips]] by 160 votes to 111.<ref name=\"AO 4-7-95 LibCand\">{{cite news|title=Representation of Cardiganshire.

His closest electoral call came in the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|'Khaki election' of 1900]] when he had a majority of 781 (9.4%) over [[J.C. Harford]] of Falcondale. Thereafter, Vaughan Davies was comfortably returned at each election but the vitality of the Liberal Association was in serious decline. During this time the ''Cambrian News'' had tempered its opposition to him and grudgingly admitted that Vaughan-Davies had won friends and supporteres by his adherence to Liberal policies.<ref name=\"CN 27-10-00 edit\">{{cite news|title=The Two Cardiganshire Candidates (editorial)|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3317276/ART27|accessdate=27 October 2014|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=5 October 1900}}</ref>\n\nBy 1914 the Liberal Association was heavily dependent on Vaughan Davies's role as treasurer to keep it going. In the meantime, Vaughan Davies remained on poor terms with prominent Liberals, including [[John Gibson (editor and journalist)|John Gibson]], editor of the ''Cambrian News'' until his death in 1915.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=328\u20139}}</ref>\n\nLike most Welsh Liberals, he supported [[David Lloyd George]] in the split in the Liberal Party, and not [[H. H. Asquith]], and was therefore returned unopposed as a Coalition Liberal in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]].\n\n===Liberal infighting (1921\u20131950)===\nIn many ways the Liberals had become the new elite in Cardiganshire by the time of the First World War. This was demonstrated in 1919 when [[John Humphreys Davies]], the nonconformist squire of Cwrtmawr, was appointed Principal of the University College, Aberystwyth, at the expense of [[Thomas Jones (T. J.)|Thomas Jones]], who was championed by Lord Davies of Llandinam, grandson of [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|page=330}}</ref>\n\nWith Vaughan Davies known to be a supporter of Lloyd George, it was natural that Lloyd George looked to him to boost his support in the [[House of Lords]] and awarded him a peerage in the New Years' Honours list in 1921. Although he would have preferred to be called 'Lord Ceredigion', the Garter King of Arms refused this as an inappropriate title for a Baron, and so Vaughan Davies took his title from the [[River Ystwyth]] which ran past his home. The peerage created a vacancy in a historically Liberal seat and the Asquithites decided to take the Lloyd Georgeites on in their 'backyard' in what became a memorable [[1921 Cardiganshire by-election|by-election]].\n\n[[Ernest Evans (politician)|Ernest Evans]], who asserted on his election posters that he was 'THE Liberal candidate', was a Barrister from Aberystwyth and had been Private Secretary to Lloyd George himself, and therefore had the blessing of the Coalition and official support from the Conservatives. A number of possible Asquithian Liberal candidates were approached to contest the seat against Evans and eventually the choice fell upon [[W. Llewelyn Williams]] who was sponsored by the Asquithite 'Welsh Liberal Federation'. No other candidate stood and in the straight fight, Evans won with a majority of 3,590 (14.6%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=332\u20135}}</ref>\n\nEvans held on as a 'National Liberal' (as Lloyd George's supporters called themselves) in the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] but with a slim majority of 515 votes (2.0%) over [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]].\n\nThe sudden shotgun merger of the two factions in the Liberal Party led to Evans getting the official approval of the unified party for the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]]. However, the Conservatives decided to fight and this deprived him of their votes. Hopkin Morris decided to fight again as an unofficial Liberal and won with a 5,078 vote majority. Hopkin Morris was lucky to survive the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]], a disaster for the Liberals, by being returned unopposed.\n\nThe first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate stood against [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]] at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] and polled 24% of the vote in a straight fight against Morris, who had a 13,752 (52.0%) majority.\n\nIn 1932, Morris left Parliament temporarily (he was later to return as MP for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]]) when he was appointed as a Metropolitan Police magistrate. The byelection on 22 September 1932 saw the first three-way fight between the parties, but was won by [[Owen Evans (politician)|Owen Evans]] for the Liberals. Like many of the Liberal MPs he had been a barrister. Evans died shortly before the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], but the seat was easily held by his successor [[Roderic Bowen]]. Unusually the Labour vote actually fell in percentage terms compared with the previous election despite the Labour landslide in the country at large.\n\n===Labour challenge (1950\u20131972)===\nLabour established itself as the main challenger to the Liberals at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] in a three-way contest, and the Conservatives opted out of the contest thereafter until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. This was partly a move to keep the seat from going Labour. [[Plaid Cymru]] first fought the seat in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] and kept their deposit (just, with 12.8% of the vote).\n\nWith a four-way contest involving the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru at the 1964 general election, and a national swing to Labour, Roderic Bowen suffered a precipitate decline in his share of the vote to only 38.4%; he was re-elected with a majority of 2,219 (7.4%) over Labour. After the death of the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] in 1965, Bowen accepted the offer to become a Deputy Speaker, which prevented him from speaking on behalf of his constituency. For the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 election]], Labour selected [[Elystan Morgan]] who had been a member of Plaid Cymru until 1964; with a further national swing and Morgan making a credible bid for the Welsh-speaking vote, Labour won the seat by 523 votes.\n\n===1974 onwards===\nIn boundary changes in 1983, the constituency was merged with a northern area of [[Pembrokeshire]] and also took a Welsh version of its name, becoming known as [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]].\n\nCeredigion was recreated for the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]] as it reverted to its former borders, having lost the part of North Pembrokeshire in boundary changes.\n\nMark Williams, first elected in 2005, was the first non-Welsh speaking Member of Parliament elected to represent the constituency since Bowen Rowlands (MP from 1886 until 1892, who declared at a meeting in Aberystwyth when adopted as candidate that he could not speak Welsh).<ref>{{cite news|title=The County Election|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3301595/ART95|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=3 July 1886}}</ref> At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], he received a massive increase in his vote, polling over 50% of the votes cast and raising his majority from 219 to 8,324 over the Plaid Cymru candidate, Penri James.\n\nIn [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], Williams suffered a decline of over 14% in his vote share, in common with other Liberal Democrat incumbents across the UK. However, after a campaign which made national headlines due to prior controversial comments by both the Plaid Cymru<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32227229|title=Election 2015: 'Baptism of fire' for Plaid candidate|date=9 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and Labour<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32249455|title=Election 2015: Candidate suggested cars be damaged|date=10 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> candidates, Plaid Cymru were unable to capitalise as their vote share went down slightly. The Conservative vote also declined, while UKIP, Labour and the Greens all improved on their 2010 performance. Williams retained the seat to become the only Liberal Democrat MP in Wales, and one of only eight across the UK.\n\nIn [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]], Williams lost his seat to [[Ben Lake]] by 104 votes (0.2%). Labour moved from fifth to third in the seat and were roughly 3,000 votes behind Williams and Lake, their best result in Ceredigion since 1997, and the Tories fell to fourth but increased their vote by more than 3,000. The 29.2% won by Plaid Cymru in 2017 was the lowest winning vote share of the election and the only seat won with less than 30% of the vote. At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]] Lake substantially increased both his majority and vote share, with the Liberal Democrats falling to third place.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===MPs 1541\u20131640===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!Member\n|-\n|1541\u20131543|| [[Morgan ap Rice ap Philip]]\n|-\n|1543\u20131544|| [[Thomas Gynns]]\n|-\n|1545\u20131547|| [[David ap Llewellin Lloid of Llan Dissill]]\n|-\n|1547|| [[William Devereux (MP)|William Devereux]]\n|-\n|1553 (Mar)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1553 (Oct)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Apr)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Nov)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1555|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1558|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1563|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1571|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1572|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1584|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1586|| [[Griffith Lloyd]]\n|-\n|1588|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1593|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1597|| [[Thomas Pryse]]\n|-\n|1601|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1604\u20131611|| [[John Lewis (of Abernant)|Sir John Lewis]]\n|-\n|1614\u20131622|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Sir Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1625\u20131629|| [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n|-\n|1629\u20131640|| ''No Parliaments summoned''\n|}\n\n===MPs after 1640===\n\n'''[[Short Parliament]]'''\n*1640: [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n\n'''[[Long Parliament]]'''\n* 1640\u20131644: [[Walter Lloyd]] ([[Cavalier|Royalist]]) \u2013 ''disabled to sit, 5 February 1644''\n* 1646\u20131648: [[Sir Richard Pryse, 1st Baronet]] \u2013 ''excluded in [[Pride's Purge]], December 1648''\n\n''Cardiganshire was unrepresented in the [[Barebones Parliament]]''\n\n'''[[First Protectorate Parliament]]'''\n*1654\u20131655: [[James Philipps|Col.
