{"title_page": "SPARCstation 2", "text_new": "The '''SPARCstation 2''', or SS2 (code named ''Calvin'', Sun 4/75) is a [[SPARC]] [[workstation]] computer sold by [[Sun Microsystems]]. It is based on the [[sun4c]] architecture, and is implemented in a [[pizza box form factor]].\n\n==Specifications==\n\n===CPU===\n40MHz [[Cypress Semiconductor|Cypress]] CY7C601 CPU - 28.5 MIPS, [[Texas Instruments|TI]] TMS390C601A FPU - 4.2 MFLOPS.<ref>http://www.obsolyte.com/sun_ss2/</ref> The only known CPU upgrade option was the [[Weitek]] 80MHz \"SPARC POWER \u03bcP\" (power-up).\n\n=== Memory ===\nThe SPARCstation 2 can be configured with up to 128 MB of memory in total:  64 MB on the motherboard, and an additional 64 MB using a special 32 MB SBus memory card with another 32 MB piggy-backed daughterboard. The 16 RAM slots on the motherboard can be populated with either 1 MB [[SIMM]]s for a total of 16 MB, or with 4 MB [[SIMM]]s for a total of 64 MB. Standard 30 pin SIMMs can be used as long as they use [[parity bit|parity error detection]] and are rated 80 ns or faster.\n\n===Disk drives===\nThe SPARCstation 2 uses a standard 50-pin [[SCSI]] interface and can house two 3 1/2\" full-height [[disk drive]]s. The SS2 also comes with a special auto-ejecting 1.44 MB [[floppy disk]] drive.\n\nModern 80-pin [[Single Connector Attachment]] (SCA) SCSI drives can be used internally with an adapter, but the plastic drive sled used with 50-pin drives must be cut to allow clearance for the adapter board. SCA drives may run hotter than original SCSI drives and cause heating issues, especially if two drives are installed. \n\n=== Network ===\nThere is an [[Ethernet]] [[Attachment Unit Interface|AUI]] port on board, which can be supplemented by add-on [[SBus]] cards. Onboard Ethernet is provided by an [[AMD Lance Am7990]] Ethernet controller. External AUI transceivers are required for connection to [[10Base5]], [[10Base2]], [[10baseT]], or other Ethernet [[physical layer]] media. The OpenBoot ROM is able to boot from network, using RARP and TFTP<ref>https://www.netbsd.org/docs/network/netboot/intro.sun.html</ref>.\n\n== NVRAM ==\nThe SPARCstation 2 uses an M48T02 battery-backed [[real-time clock|RTC]] with RAM chip which handles the real time clock and boot parameter storage. The only problem with this chip is that the battery is internal, which means the entire chip must be replaced when its battery runs out. As all sun4c machines are now older than the battery life of this chip, a substantial number of these systems now refuse to boot.  Additionally, the sun4c design used the reserved bits in the M48T02's NVRAM in a non-standard way; since later revisions of the M48T02 chip exert stricter control over these bits, a current M48T02 will store the NVRAM data, but the RTC will not function correctly and the system may fail to auto-boot.\n\nDue to incompatibilities with modern M48T02s, it is common to modify failed NVRAMs by cutting into the encapsulation and patching in a new battery. <ref>http://www.menet.umn.edu/~bob/FAQ/sun-nvram-hostid.faq</ref> It is also possible to replace the entire encapsulation, which also contains a 32.768 KHz clock crystal. <ref>https://www.vintage-radio.net/forum/showthread.php?t=71241</ref>\n\n==Operating systems==\n{{update-section|date=June 2019}}\nThe following operating systems will run on a SPARCstation 2:\n*[[SunOS]] 4.1.1 onwards\n*[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 2.0 to Solaris 7 (sun4c dropped in Solaris 8)\n*[[Linux]] - Some, but not all, distributions supported this sparc32 sub-architecture; it had support in [[Debian]] from Debian 2.1 (March 1999) through Debian 4.0 (etch), last updated in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.debian.org/PortsSparc |title=Debian on Sparc |accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100522 |title=Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 updated |publisher=[[Software in the Public Interest]] |date=2010-05-22 |accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref>\n*[[NetBSD]]/sparc32 since 1.0\n*[[OpenBSD]]/sparc32 - All versions up to 5.9 (OpenBSD 5.9 was the last release to support SPARC32<ref>https://www.openbsd.org/sparc.html</ref>)\n\n==See also==\n*[[SPARCstation]]\n*[[SPARCstation IPX]], an architecturally similar machine in a lunchbox form factor\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sparcstation 002}}\n[[Category:Sun workstations]]\n[[Category:SPARC microprocessor products]]\n\n\n{{Compu-hardware-stub}}\n", "text_old": "The '''SPARCstation 2''', or SS2 (code named ''Calvin'', Sun 4/75) is a [[SPARC]] [[workstation]] computer sold by [[Sun Microsystems]].

Later that year, he transferred to Danish club AC [[AC Horsens|Horsens]]. In 2010, he moved on to AGF Aarhus. He won the [[Danish 1st Division]] championship with both clubs, in [[2009\u201310 Danish 1st Division|2009\u201310]] and then in [[2010\u201311 Danish 1st Division|2010\u201311]]. \n\nIn 2014, he moved to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]], and helped the club to win the [[Scottish Championship]] in 2014\u201315. He spent a brief time at [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in 2015, before joining Canadian side [[FC Edmonton]] in January 2016. He returned to Scotland 12 months later to play for [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]], helping the club to the Scottish Championship title at the end of the 2017\u201318 season. After a spell on loan with [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]], Eckersley joined [[Airdrieonians F.C.|Airdrieonians]] in May 2019.

The club also won the champions in 2003 and 2004 season and was promoted to [[J2 League]] from 2005. From 2005, although his opportunity to play decreased, he played many matches. However he could hardly play in the match in 2009. In September 2009, he moved to JFL club [[Giravanz Kitakyushu|New Wave Kitakyushu]] (later ''Giravanz Kitakyushu''). He played many matches and the club was promoted to J2 from 2010. Although he played many matches as regular player in 2010, his opportunity to play decreased from 2011 and he retired end of 2012 season.\n\n==Club statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | League Cup\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!

His first draft of ''American Psycho'' left out all the grisly scenes, which were to be added in later. In 2010, in conversation with journalist Jeff Baker, Ellis commented: {{quote|[Bateman] was crazy the same way [I was]. He did not come out of me sitting down and wanting to write a grand sweeping indictment of [[yuppie]] culture. It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a [[consumerism|consumerist]] kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself. That is where the tension of ''American Psycho'' came from. It wasn't that I was going to make up this serial killer on Wall Street. [[High concept]]. Fantastic. It came from a much more personal place, and that's something that I've only been admitting in the last year or so. I was so on the defensive because of the reaction to that book that I wasn't able to talk about it on that level.<ref name=oregonlive>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2010/07/qa_bret_easton_ellis_talks_abo.html|title=Q&A: Bret Easton Ellis talks about writing novels, making movies|last=Baker|first=Jeff|work=OregonLive|accessdate=2010-07-09|date=July 2010}}</ref> |Bret Easton Ellis}}\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[Manhattan]] during the [[Wall Street]] boom of the late 1980s, ''American Psycho'' follows the life of wealthy young [[investment banker]] Patrick Bateman. Bateman, in his mid-20s when the story begins, narrates his everyday activities, from his recreational life among the Wall Street elite of [[New York City|New York]] to his forays into murder by night. Through [[present tense]] [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] narrative, Bateman describes his daily life, ranging from a series of Friday nights spent at nightclubs with his colleagues\u2014where they snort [[cocaine]], critique fellow club-goers' clothing, trade fashion advice, and question one another on proper [[etiquette]]\u2014to his loveless engagement to fellow yuppie Evelyn and his contentious relationship with his brother and senile mother. Bateman's stream of consciousness is occasionally broken up by chapters in which he directly addresses the reader in order to critique the work of 1980s [[pop music]] artists. The novel maintains a high level of ambiguity through mistaken identity and contradictions that introduce the possibility that Bateman is an [[unreliable narrator]]. Characters are consistently introduced as people other than themselves, and people argue over the identities of others they can see in restaurants or at parties. Deeply concerned with his [[vanity|personal appearance]], Bateman gives extensive descriptions of his daily aesthetics regimen.\n\nAfter killing Paul <!--DO NOT CHANGE TO ALLEN; ALLEN IS MOVIE NAME, OWEN IS BOOK NAME! -->Owen, one of his colleagues, Bateman appropriates Owen's apartment as a place to host and kill more victims. Bateman's control over his violent urges deteriorates. His murders become increasingly [[sadomasochism|sadistic]] and complex, progressing from simple stabbings to drawn-out sequences of [[rape]], [[torture]], [[mutilation]], [[cannibalism]], and [[necrophilia]], and his grasp on sanity begins to slip. He introduces stories about serial killers into casual conversations and on several occasions openly confesses his murderous activities to his coworkers, who never take him seriously, do not hear what he says, or misunderstand him completely\u2014for example, hearing the words \"murders and executions\" as \"mergers and acquisitions.\" These incidents culminate in a shooting spree during which he kills several random people in the street, resulting in a [[SWAT]] team being dispatched in a helicopter. This narrative episode sees the first-person perspective shift to third-person and the subsequent events are, although not for the first time in the novel, described in terms pertaining to cinematic portrayal. Bateman flees on foot and hides in his office, where he phones his attorney, Harold Carnes, and confesses all his crimes to an answering machine.\n\nLater, Bateman revisits Paul Owen's apartment, where he had earlier killed and mutilated two sex workers, carrying a surgical mask in anticipation of the decomposing bodies he expects to encounter. He enters the perfectly clean, refurbished apartment, however, filled with strong-smelling flowers meant, perhaps, to conceal a bad odor. The real estate agent, who sees his surgical mask, fools him into stating he was attending the apartment viewing because he \"saw an ad in the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]''\" (when in fact there was no such advertisement). She tells him to leave and never return.\n\nBateman's mental state continues to deteriorate and he begins to experience bizarre hallucinations such as seeing a [[Cheerios|Cheerio]] interviewed on a talk show, being [[stalking|stalked]] by an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] park bench, and finding a bone in his [[Dove Bar]]. At the end of the story, Bateman confronts Carnes about the message he left on his machine, only to find the attorney amused at what he considers a hilarious joke. Mistaking Bateman for another colleague, Carnes claims that the Patrick Bateman he knows is too much of a coward to have committed such acts. In the dialogue-laden climax, Carnes stands up to a defiant Bateman and tells him his claim of having murdered Owen is impossible, because he had dinner with him twice in [[London]] just a few days prior.\n\nThe book ends as it began, with Bateman and his colleagues at a new club on a Friday night, engaging in banal conversation. The sign seen at the end of the book simply reads \"This is not an exit.\"\n\n==Themes==\nAccording to literary critic Jeffrey W. Hunter, ''American Psycho ''is largely a critique of the \"shallow and vicious aspects of [[capitalism]]\".<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Jeffrey W. Hunter (ed.). ''Vol. 229''. Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2007, pp. 228\u2013294. From ''Literature Criticism Online.''</ref> The characters are predominantly concerned with material gain and superficial appearances, traits indicative of a [[postmodern]] world in which the 'surface' reigns supreme. This leads Patrick Bateman to act as if \"everything is a [[commodity]], including people\",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''.</ref> an attitude that is further evident in the rampant objectification and brutalization of women that occurs in the novel. This distancing allows Bateman to rationalize his actions;<ref>Brock, Leigh. \"Distancing in Bret Easton Ellis' ''American Psycho''. ''Notes on Contemporary Literature'' 24, no. 1 (January 1994): 6\u20138.</ref> in one [[Cannibalism|anthropophagic]] scene, Bateman remarks \"though it does sporadically penetrate how unacceptable some of what I'm doing actually is, I just remind myself that this thing, this girl, this meat, is nothing&nbsp;...\"<ref>Ellis, Bret Easton. ''American Psycho''. New York: Vintage Books, 1991. Page 345</ref>\n\nPatrick Bateman's consumption of what he views as nothing more than a piece of meat is an almost parodically literal interpretation of a monster created by consumer culture. This, combined with sex, violence, drugs, and other desires of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], is how Bateman enacts his sociopathic violence in a superficial world.<ref>Heyler, Ruth. \"Parodied to Death: The Postmodern Gothic of ''American Psycho''\". ''Modern Fiction Studies'' 46, no. 3 (fall 2000): 725\u2013746.</ref>\n\nBateman's episodes of schizophrenia also shows clear signs on how he copes being an affluent person living in a superficial world, fashioned on [[consumerism]]. As described by the critic Jennifer Krause in her intertextual analysis of the novel, which relies on the work of postmodern theorist [[Fredric Jameson]], Jameson \"blames the schizophrenic\u2019s ills on the incoherence of postmodern media and capitalistic consumption\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polan|first=Dana|last2=Foster|first2=Hal|date=1984|title=The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture|journal=New German Critique|issue=33|pages=264\u2013269|doi=10.2307/488367|issn=0094-033X|jstor=488367}}</ref>\n\nJameson's critique is expanded by Krause, who writes, \"We can see a distinctly popular culture [[schizophrenia]] arise, a disease spread by the postmodern culture industry, which ruptures personality and isolates the fractured self. Though Jameson does not specifically reference two different types of schizophrenia in his writings, he implies an artistic schizophrenia versus a more popular form\u2014one more or less accepted, and the other anathema. This raises questions about how popular culture might act as a potential cure for madness.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krause|first=Jennifer|date=2016-02-16|title=The Killing Cure: Popular Culture and Postmodern Madness inOnde andar\u00e1 Dulce Veiga?andAmerican Psycho|journal=Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction|volume=57|issue=2|pages=166\u2013177|doi=10.1080/00111619.2015.1019409|issn=0011-1619}}</ref> On the one hand is a rich Wall Street banker, Bateman, concerned and very self-conscious about every detail of his physical appearance, expensive possessions, and control of the people and the world around him. On the other hand is the inner self of Patrick Bateman, the aboriginal-self, who copes and relinquishes his outer complications and \"fake\" identity, created by [[consumerism]], through violence on other human beings, who he finds consumable, and expresses absolute control of his desires and true self through his violent fantasies. His consumer, artificial self, proceeding in society as a wealthy consumer would live and spend his income, versus his natural self, who, instead of spending money, would hunt and prey on the weak and vulnerable, usually women, whom he deems expendable. Bateman treats the people around him just like any other consumer product, because of the void he still battles with and wishes to fulfill from within, hence, having dual personas, having the dull artificial identity, compared to his free limitless persona of his mind.\n\nObserving another side of potential behavior coming from the affluent American society of consumerism is explained through C. Serpell saying, \"Though serialized violence in ''American Psycho'' is an extension of the deadening effects of serialized consumer exchanges in an economy where commodities and bodies become interchangeable and indistinguishable, this point largely escaped the notice of the novel's harshest critics.\"<ref name=\"Serpell 47\u201373\">{{Cite journal|last=Serpell|first=C.

Serpell bringing to light the patterns and trends Ellis expresses through Bateman, what the consequences of how \"serialized consumer exchanges in an economy where commodities and bodies become interchangeable and indistinguishable,\"<ref name=\"Serpell 47\u201373\"/> could affect society, and the way affluent people view others whether they are higher, lower, or the same in wealth or social status. The critic Thomas Heise states, \"the uncertainty about the reality of Patrick\u2019s violence has become the chief critical debate on American Psycho, and it serves as a convenient introduction to the entanglement of epistemology and ethics in the novel.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heise|first=Thomas|date=2011|title=''American Psycho'': Neoliberal Fantasies and the Death of Downtown|journal=Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory|volume=67|issue=1|pages=135\u2013160|doi=10.1353/arq.2011.0001|issn=1558-9595}}</ref> Bateman's character and traits, according to Heise, challenge what readers understand as the social norms for the way the elite upper class think and react to society on a normal basis. Bateman's epistemology and ethics in regards to his actions and way of thinking throughout the novel is a reflection, through his violence, which raises the questions of the moral and ethical understanding of all individuals in Bateman's position and status, and how they might act and think similar or completely identical in a consumer world built on [[capitalism]] as we see in today's American society.\n\nCiting the many bodies that are never found, [[Henry Bean]] wonders \"is it possible that the murders themselves never occurred?\" He continues:{{r|bean19910317}}\n\n{{quote|The novel subtly and relentlessly undercuts its own authority, and because Bateman, unlike, say, [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]'s unreliable narrators, does not hint at a \"truth\" beyond his own delusions, \"American Psycho\" becomes a wonderfully unstable account.

In 2010, in conversation with journalist Jeff Baker, Ellis commented: {{quote|[Bateman] was crazy the same way [I was]. He did not come out of me sitting down and wanting to write a grand sweeping indictment of [[yuppie]] culture. It initiated because of my own isolation and alienation at a point in my life. I was living like Patrick Bateman. I was slipping into a [[consumerism|consumerist]] kind of void that was supposed to give me confidence and make me feel good about myself but just made me feel worse and worse and worse about myself. That is where the tension of ''American Psycho'' came from. It wasn't that I was going to make up this serial killer on Wall Street. [[High concept]]. Fantastic. It came from a much more personal place, and that's something that I've only been admitting in the last year or so. I was so on the defensive because of the reaction to that book that I wasn't able to talk about it on that level.<ref name=oregonlive>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2010/07/qa_bret_easton_ellis_talks_abo.html|title=Q&A: Bret Easton Ellis talks about writing novels, making movies|last=Baker|first=Jeff|work=OregonLive|accessdate=2010-07-09|date=July 2010}}</ref> |Bret Easton Ellis}}\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[Manhattan]] during the [[Wall Street]] boom of the late 1980s, ''American Psycho'' follows the life of wealthy young [[investment banker]] Patrick Bateman. Bateman, in his mid-20s when the story begins, narrates his everyday activities, from his recreational life among the Wall Street elite of [[New York City|New York]] to his forays into murder by night. Through [[present tense]] [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] narrative, Bateman describes his daily life, ranging from a series of Friday nights spent at nightclubs with his colleagues\u2014where they snort [[cocaine]], critique fellow club-goers' clothing, trade fashion advice, and question one another on proper [[etiquette]]\u2014to his loveless engagement to fellow yuppie Evelyn and his contentious relationship with his brother and senile mother. Bateman's stream of consciousness is occasionally broken up by chapters in which he directly addresses the reader in order to critique the work of 1980s [[pop music]] artists. The novel maintains a high level of ambiguity through mistaken identity and contradictions that introduce the possibility that Bateman is an [[unreliable narrator]]. Characters are consistently introduced as people other than themselves, and people argue over the identities of others they can see in restaurants or at parties. Deeply concerned with his [[vanity|personal appearance]], Bateman gives extensive descriptions of his daily aesthetics regimen.\n\nAfter killing Paul <!--DO NOT CHANGE TO ALLEN; ALLEN IS MOVIE NAME, OWEN IS BOOK NAME! -->Owen, one of his colleagues, Bateman appropriates his apartment as a place to host and kill more victims. Bateman's control over his violent urges deteriorates. His murders become increasingly [[sadomasochism|sadistic]] and complex, progressing from simple stabbings to drawn-out sequences of [[rape]], [[torture]], [[mutilation]], [[cannibalism]], and [[necrophilia]], and his grasp on sanity begins to slip. He introduces stories about serial killers into casual conversations and on several occasions openly confesses his murderous activities to his coworkers, who never take him seriously, do not hear what he says, or misunderstand him completely\u2014for example, hearing the words \"murders and executions\" as \"mergers and acquisitions.\" These incidents culminate in a shooting spree during which he kills several random people in the street, resulting in a [[SWAT]] team being dispatched in a helicopter. This narrative episode sees the first-person perspective shift to third-person and the subsequent events are, although not for the first time in the novel, described in terms pertaining to cinematic portrayal. Bateman flees on foot and hides in his office, where he phones his attorney, Harold Carnes, and confesses all his crimes to an answering machine.\n\nLater, Bateman revisits Paul Owen's apartment, where he had earlier killed and mutilated two sex workers, carrying a surgical mask in anticipation of the decomposing bodies he expects to encounter. He enters the perfectly clean, refurbished apartment, however, filled with strong-smelling flowers meant, perhaps, to conceal a bad odor. The real estate agent, who sees his surgical mask, fools him into stating he was attending the apartment viewing because he \"saw an ad in the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]''\" (when in fact there was no such advertisement). She tells him to leave and never return.\n\nBateman's mental state continues to deteriorate and he begins to experience bizarre hallucinations such as seeing a [[Cheerios|Cheerio]] interviewed on a talk show, being [[stalking|stalked]] by an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] park bench, and finding a bone in his [[Dove Bar]]. At the end of the story, Bateman confronts Carnes about the message he left on his machine, only to find the attorney amused at what he considers a hilarious joke. Mistaking Bateman for another colleague, Carnes claims that the Patrick Bateman he knows is too much of a coward to have committed such acts. In the dialogue-laden climax, Carnes stands up to a defiant Bateman and tells him his claim of having murdered Owen is impossible, because he had dinner with him twice in [[London]] just a few days prior.\n\nThe book ends as it began, with Bateman and his colleagues at a new club on a Friday night, engaging in banal conversation. The sign seen at the end of the book simply reads \"This is not an exit.\"\n\n==Themes==\nAccording to literary critic Jeffrey W. Hunter, ''American Psycho ''is largely a critique of the \"shallow and vicious aspects of [[capitalism]]\".<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Jeffrey W. Hunter (ed.). ''Vol. 229''. Detroit: Thomson Gale, 2007, pp. 228\u2013294. From ''Literature Criticism Online.''</ref> The characters are predominantly concerned with material gain and superficial appearances, traits indicative of a [[postmodern]] world in which the 'surface' reigns supreme. This leads Patrick Bateman to act as if \"everything is a [[commodity]], including people\",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''.</ref> an attitude that is further evident in the rampant objectification and brutalization of women that occurs in the novel. This distancing allows Bateman to rationalize his actions;<ref>Brock, Leigh. \"Distancing in Bret Easton Ellis' ''American Psycho''. ''Notes on Contemporary Literature'' 24, no. 1 (January 1994): 6\u20138.</ref> in one [[Cannibalism|anthropophagic]] scene, Bateman remarks \"though it does sporadically penetrate how unacceptable some of what I'm doing actually is, I just remind myself that this thing, this girl, this meat, is nothing&nbsp;...\"<ref>Ellis, Bret Easton. ''American Psycho''. New York: Vintage Books, 1991. Page 345</ref>\n\nPatrick Bateman's consumption of what he views as nothing more than a piece of meat is an almost parodically literal interpretation of a monster created by consumer culture. This, combined with sex, violence, drugs, and other desires of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], is how Bateman enacts his sociopathic violence in a superficial world.<ref>Heyler, Ruth. \"Parodied to Death: The Postmodern Gothic of ''American Psycho''\". ''Modern Fiction Studies'' 46, no. 3 (fall 2000): 725\u2013746.</ref>\n\nBateman's episodes of schizophrenia also shows clear signs on how he copes being an affluent person living in a superficial world, fashioned on [[consumerism]]. As described by the critic Jennifer Krause in her intertextual analysis of the novel, which relies on the work of postmodern theorist [[Fredric Jameson]], Jameson \"blames the schizophrenic\u2019s ills on the incoherence of postmodern media and capitalistic consumption\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polan|first=Dana|last2=Foster|first2=Hal|date=1984|title=The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture|journal=New German Critique|issue=33|pages=264\u2013269|doi=10.2307/488367|issn=0094-033X|jstor=488367}}</ref>\n\nJameson's critique is expanded by Krause, who writes, \"We can see a distinctly popular culture [[schizophrenia]] arise, a disease spread by the postmodern culture industry, which ruptures personality and isolates the fractured self. Though Jameson does not specifically reference two different types of schizophrenia in his writings, he implies an artistic schizophrenia versus a more popular form\u2014one more or less accepted, and the other anathema.

On the other hand is the inner self of Patrick Bateman, the aboriginal-self, who copes and relinquishes his outer complications and \"fake\" identity, created by [[consumerism]], through violence on other human beings, who he finds consumable, and expresses absolute control of his desires and true self through his violent fantasies. His consumer, artificial self, proceeding in society as a wealthy consumer would live and spend his income, versus his natural self, who, instead of spending money, would hunt and prey on the weak and vulnerable, usually women, whom he deems expendable. Bateman treats the people around him just like any other consumer product, because of the void he still battles with and wishes to fulfill from within, hence, having dual personas, having the dull artificial identity, compared to his free limitless persona of his mind.\n\nObserving another side of potential behavior coming from the affluent American society of consumerism is explained through C. Serpell saying, \"Though serialized violence in ''American Psycho'' is an extension of the deadening effects of serialized consumer exchanges in an economy where commodities and bodies become interchangeable and indistinguishable, this point largely escaped the notice of the novel's harshest critics.\"<ref name=\"Serpell 47\u201373\">{{Cite journal|last=Serpell|first=C.

Bateman's epistemology and ethics in regards to his actions and way of thinking throughout the novel is a reflection, through his violence, which raises the questions of the moral and ethical understanding of all individuals in Bateman's position and status, and how they might act and think similar or completely identical in a consumer world built on [[capitalism]] as we see in today's American society.\n\nCiting the many bodies that are never found, [[Henry Bean]] wonders \"is it possible that the murders themselves never occurred?\" He continues:{{r|bean19910317}}\n\n{{quote|The novel subtly and relentlessly undercuts its own authority, and because Bateman, unlike, say, [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]'s unreliable narrators, does not hint at a \"truth\" beyond his own delusions, \"American Psycho\" becomes a wonderfully unstable account.

These claim that the Earth was visited in prehistoric times by extraterrestrial beings.\n\n==Science fiction==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nXenoarchaeological themes are common in science fiction. Works about the exploration of enigmatic extraterrestrial artifacts have been satirically categorized as [[Big Dumb Object]] stories.\n\nSome of the more prominent examples of xenoarchaeological fiction include Arthur C. Clarke's novel ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'', H. Beam Piper's short story ''[[Omnilingual]]'', and Charles Sheffield's [[Heritage Universe]] series.\n\n[[Jack McDevitt]]'s science fiction novels often revolve around human or alien historical and archaeological mysteries.\n\nThe plot of the video game ''[[Mass Effect]]'' revolves around technologies in the form of structures, transportation, buildings and machines left behind by an extinct alien race. \n\nThe primary setting of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' takes place on a massive structure created by an ancient, extinct alien super race. These structures feature prominently in the sequels ''[[Halo 2]]'', ''[[Halo 3]]'', and ''[[Halo 4]]''.\n\nIn the video game \"[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]\", and its sequel \"[[Borderlands 2]]\", the Atlas corporation started mining the planet Pandora after finding evidence of an ancient material called Eridium. This material was supposedly created by extraterrestrial creatures or is a natural product of long-term planetary production.\n\nIn the video game \"[[Stellaris (video game)|Stellaris]]\", players can often find extraterrestrial artifacts from an extinct civilization before actually encountering native spaceborne creatures or other present-day extraterrestrial civilizations.\n\n===Novels===\n* ''[[Gateway (novel)|Gateway]]'' by [[Fred Pohl]]\n* ''[[Noon Universe]]'' by [[Strugatsky]] brothers.\n* ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' by [[Arthur C.
