It had a large five-story ''[[tenshu]]'', or castle keep, which was moved to Aizu Castle when Kato was transferred there in 1627. The next lord, Tadachika Gamoh, died in 1635, shortly after completing the ''ninomaru''. After Tadachika, Matsudaira Sadayuki became the new lord. He completed a new castle keep in 1642. His heirs continued to rule the castle after his death. However, on New Years Day, 1784, this keep was struck by lightning and burned down. The current, three-story keep was built between 1820 and 1854.\n\n[[Tsuyama Castle]] and [[Himeji Castle]] were also built in the ''hirayama'' (\u5e73\u5c71\u57ce flat hilltop castle) style around the same time period. \n\nThe castle survived the [[Meiji restoration]], but parts of it deteriorated over time. Since 1966, the city of Matsuyama has been working to restore the castle.\n\n== Today ==\nIn Matsuyama, the ''tenshu'' can be seen from nearly all places in the city.

S. Army Corps of Engineers]].\n\nThe borough is located on the main line of the [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] (formerly Pennsylvania) Railway, in an agricultural and outdoor recreational region with extensive forests and scattered deposits of [[Ganister|ganister rock]], coal, [[fire clay]], and limestone. Historically, the region surrounding Huntingdon was dotted with iron furnaces and forges, consuming limestone, iron ore and wood (for charcoal production) throughout the 19th century. Dairy farms dominate the local agriculture. The town is a regular stop for the [[Amtrak]] passenger service which connects Harrisburg with [[Pittsburgh]].\n\nHuntingdon is home to [[Juniata College]], a private liberal arts college founded by members of the [[Church of the Brethren]] in 1876.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nIn 1768, Rev. Dr. [[William Smith (Episcopal priest)|William Smith]] began selling lots on the Standing Stone Tract along the Juniata, land he had recently acquired. The tract's two prior owners had not attempted to lay out a town, so Dr. Smith is considered the founder. Huntingdon (the name by which he eventually called his town) sits at the site of corn fields that had been cultivated at a date now unknown, next to where [[Standing Stone Creek]] flows into the Juniata River. The 100th anniversary of its incorporation was marked by the erection of a \"Standing Stone Monument\" on Third Street, modeled on a tall, narrow shaft known to have existed before 1750, whose purpose is unclear but may have served as a trail marker. It may be significant that natural sandstone formations (popularly called Pulpit Rocks), which \"stand erect\", are on a nearby ridge. A story surfaced during the early 19th century that Smith had renamed Standing Stone Settlement to honor an Englishwoman, [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]]. Smith's descendants vehemently denied the story, and there exists no evidence to support it, despite a wide circulation in published sources. More likely, the Anglican cleric named it after the town of the same name in England; doing so had become a pattern for naming Pennsylvania settlements, [[Bedford, Pennsylvania|Bedford]], [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]] and [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] being nearby examples of the trend. In 1796, the little village was incorporated as a borough.\n\nHuntingdon long served as the junction of the [[Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad]] with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], and as an important port on the [[Main Line of Public Works]] of the [[Pennsylvania Canal]]. In past years, Huntingdon boasted of manufacturers of flour, heavy machinery, radiators, furniture, stationery, woolen goods, shirts, shoes, electronic components, finished lumber, fiberglass yarn, matting and underground storage tanks. In the 19th century, J. C. Blair, a native of [[Shade Gap, Pennsylvania|Shade Gap]] and a stationer and businessman, popularized the writing tablet and began marketing it nationwide. His factory in downtown Huntingdon was later relocated to nearby [[Alexandria, Pennsylvania|Alexandria]].\n\nThe vicinity (but not much of the town proper) has been the subject of repeated flooding, in 1889, in 1936, and again in 1972. More recently in 2004, [[Hurricane Ivan]] resulted in major flooding close to Huntingdon, the worst since the remnants of [[Hurricane Agnes]] stalled over the region in July 1972.\n\nThe [[Huntingdon Borough Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1986.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200>\nSt Johns

S. Army Corps of Engineers]].\n\nThe borough is located on the main line of the [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] (formerly Pennsylvania) Railway, in an agricultural and outdoor recreational region with extensive forests and scattered deposits of [[Ganister|ganister rock]], coal, [[fire clay]], and limestone. Historically, the region surrounding Huntingdon was dotted with iron furnaces and forges, consuming limestone, iron ore and wood (for charcoal production) throughout the 19th century. Dairy farms dominate the local agriculture. The town is a regular stop for the [[Amtrak]] passenger service which connects Harrisburg with [[Pittsburgh]].\n\nHuntingdon is home to [[Juniata College]], a private liberal arts college founded by members of the [[Church of the Brethren]] in 1876.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nIn 1768, Rev. Dr. [[William Smith (Episcopal priest)|William Smith]] began selling lots on the Standing Stone Tract along the Juniata, land he had recently acquired. The tract's two prior owners had not attempted to lay out a town, so Dr. Smith is considered the founder. Huntingdon (the name by which he eventually called his town) sits at the site of corn fields that had been cultivated at a date now unknown, next to where [[Standing Stone Creek]] flows into the Juniata River. The 100th anniversary of its incorporation was marked by the erection of a \"Standing Stone Monument\" on Third Street, modeled on a tall, narrow shaft known to have existed before 1750, whose purpose is unclear but may have served as a trail marker. It may be significant that natural sandstone formations (popularly called Pulpit Rocks), which \"stand erect\", are on a nearby ridge. A story surfaced during the early 19th century that Smith had renamed Standing Stone Settlement to honor an Englishwoman, [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]]. Smith's descendants vehemently denied the story, and there exists no evidence to support it, despite a wide circulation in published sources. More likely, the Anglican cleric named it after the town of the same name in England; doing so had become a pattern for naming Pennsylvania settlements, [[Bedford, Pennsylvania|Bedford]], [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]] and [[York, Pennsylvania|York]] being nearby examples of the trend. In 1796, the little village was incorporated as a borough.\n\nHuntingdon long served as the junction of the [[Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad]] with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], and as an important port on the [[Main Line of Public Works]] of the [[Pennsylvania Canal]]. In past years, Huntingdon boasted of manufacturers of flour, heavy machinery, radiators, furniture, stationery, woolen goods, shirts, shoes, electronic components, finished lumber, fiberglass yarn, matting and underground storage tanks. In the 19th century, J. C. Blair, a native of [[Shade Gap, Pennsylvania|Shade Gap]] and a stationer and businessman, popularized the writing tablet and began marketing it nationwide. His factory in downtown Huntingdon was later relocated to nearby [[Alexandria, Pennsylvania|Alexandria]].\n\nThe vicinity (but not much of the town proper) has been the subject of repeated flooding, in 1889, in 1936, and again in 1972. More recently in 2004, [[Hurricane Ivan]] resulted in major flooding close to Huntingdon, the worst since the remnants of [[Hurricane Agnes]] stalled over the region in July 1972.\n\nThe [[Huntingdon Borough Historic District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1986.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200>\nSt Johns

For example, the [[Poodle]] is a frequent breed used in creation of designer crossbreeds, due to its non-shedding coat, but that trait does not always breed true when it is part of a designer cross.<ref name=\"about\" />  Also, because breeders of crossbred animals may be less careful about genetic testing and weeding out undesirable traits,<ref name=\"idcba\" /> certain deleterious [[Dominant gene|dominant genes]] may still be passed on to a crossbreed offspring.  In an F2 cross, recessive genetic traits may also return if the parent animals were both carriers of an undesired trait.\n\n== Crossbreeds in specific animals ==\n=== Cats ===\nThe many newly developed and recognized [[List of cat breeds|breeds of domestic cat]] are crossbreeds between existing, well-established breeds (sometimes with limited [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] with some wild species), to either combine selected traits from the [[foundation stock]], or propagate a rare [[mutation]] without excessive [[inbreeding]].  However, some nascent breeds such as the [[Aegean cat]] are developed entirely from a local [[landrace]] population.  Most [[List of experimental cat breeds|experimental cat breeds]] are crossbreeds.\n\n=== Cattle ===\nIn cattle, there are systems of crossbreeding. In many crossbreeds, one animal is larger than the other. One is used when the purebred females are particularly adapted to a specific environment, and are crossed with purebred bulls from another environment to produce a generation having traits of both parents.<ref>[http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/beef/2243.html Cross breeding systems for beef cattle larger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608174409/http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/beef/2243.html |date=2008-06-08 }} Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, Queensland</ref>\n\n=== Sheep ===\nThe large number of breeds of sheep, which vary greatly, creates an opportunity for crossbreeding to be used to tailor production of lambs to the goal of the individual stockman.<ref>[http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/ansc442/Semprojs/2003/crossbrd/ansc442.htm Crossbreeding In Sheep, by Angie Bailey, Jason Canup and Jorge Lucena] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20080524060408/http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/ansc442/Semprojs/2003/crossbrd/ansc442.htm |date=2008-05-24 }} Purdue University, US</ref>\n\n=== Llamas ===\nResults of crossbreeding classic and woolly breeds of llama are unpredictable.

One type of modern crossbreeding in horses is used to create many of the [[warmblood]] breeds.  Warmbloods are a type of horse used in the [[sport horse]] disciplines, usually registered in an [[open stud book]] by a [[studbook selection]] procedure that evaluates conformation, pedigree and, in some animals, a training or performance standard.  Most warmblood breeds began as a cross of [[draft horse]] breeds on [[Thoroughbred]]s, but have, in some cases, developed over the past century to the point where they are considered to be a true-breeding population and have a [[closed stud book]].  Other types of recognized crossbreeding include that within the [[American Quarter Horse]], which will register horses with one Thoroughbred parent and one registered Quarter Horse parent in the \"Appendix\" registry, and allow such animals full breed registration status as Quarter Horses if they meet a certain performance standard.   Another well-known crossbred horse is the [[Anglo-Arabian]], which may be produced by a purebred [[Arabian horse]] crossed on a Thoroughbred, or by various crosses of Anglo-Arabians with other Anglo-Arabians, as long as the ensuing animal never has more than 75% or less than 25% of each breed represented in its pedigree.\n\n== Hybrid animals ==\n{{Main|Hybrid (biology)}}\nA [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] animal is one with parentage of two separate species, differentiating it from crossbred animals, which have parentage of the same species.

Other crosses include the [[tigon]] (between a male tiger and female lion) and [[yakalo]] (between a yak and [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]]). The Incas recognized that hybrids of ''Lama glama'' (llama) and ''Vicugna pacos'' (alpaca) resulted in a hybrid with none of the advantages of either parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alpacasincanada.com/history.html|title=An Ancient Livestock, by Barbara Lang|website=alpacasincanada.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082756/http://alpacasincanada.com/history.html|archivedate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt one time it was thought that dogs and wolves were separate species, and the [[Wolf-dog hybrid|crosses between dogs and wolves]] were called wolf hybrids.

A dog of unknown parentage is often called a [[mixed-breed dog]], \"mutt\" or \"mongrel.\" A cat of unknown parentage is often referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]] generically, and in some dialects is often called a \"moggy\".

For example, the [[Poodle]] is a frequent breed used in creation of designer crossbreeds, due to its non-shedding coat, but that trait does not always breed true when it is part of a designer cross.<ref name=\"about\" />  Also, because breeders of crossbred animals may be less careful about genetic testing and weeding out undesirable traits,<ref name=\"idcba\" /> certain deleterious [[Dominant gene|dominant genes]] may still be passed on to a crossbreed offspring.  In an F2 cross, recessive genetic traits may also return if the parent animals were both carriers of an undesired trait.\n\n== Crossbreeds in specific animals ==\n=== Cats ===\nThe many newly developed and recognized [[List of cat breeds|breeds of domestic cat]] are crossbreeds between existing, well-established breeds (sometimes with limited [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] with some wild species), to either combine selected traits from the [[foundation stock]], or propagate a rare [[mutation]] without excessive [[inbreeding]].  However, some nascent breeds such as the [[Aegean cat]] are developed entirely from a local [[landrace]] population.  Most [[List of experimental cat breeds|experimental cat breeds]] are crossbreeds.\n\n=== Cattle ===\nIn cattle, there are systems of crossbreeding. In many crossbreeds, one animal is larger than the other. One is used when the purebred females are particularly adapted to a specific environment, and are crossed with purebred bulls from another environment to produce a generation having traits of both parents.<ref>[http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/beef/2243.html Cross breeding systems for beef cattle larger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608174409/http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/beef/2243.html |date=2008-06-08 }} Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, Queensland</ref>\n\n=== Sheep ===\nThe large number of breeds of sheep, which vary greatly, creates an opportunity for crossbreeding to be used to tailor production of lambs to the goal of the individual stockman.<ref>[http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/ansc442/Semprojs/2003/crossbrd/ansc442.htm Crossbreeding In Sheep, by Angie Bailey, Jason Canup and Jorge Lucena] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20080524060408/http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/ansc442/Semprojs/2003/crossbrd/ansc442.htm |date=2008-05-24 }} Purdue University, USA</ref>\n\n=== Llamas ===\nResults of crossbreeding classic and woolly breeds of llama are unpredictable. The resulting offspring displays physical characteristics of either parent, or a mix of characteristics from both, periodically producing a fleeced llama. \nThe results are increasingly unpredictable when both parents are crossbreeds, with possibility of the offspring displaying characteristics of a grandparent, not obvious in either parent. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://lostcreekllamas.com/classic.htm|title=classic llamas|website=lostcreekllamas.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824171648/http://lostcreekllamas.com/classic.htm|archivedate=24 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Dogs ===\n{{Main|Dog crossbreed}}\n\nA ''crossbred'' dog is a cross between two (sometimes more) known breeds, and is usually distinguished from a ''[[mixed-breed dog]]'', which has ancestry from many sources, some of which may not be known.  Crossbreeds are popular, due to the belief that they have [[Hybrid vigor|increased vigor]] without loss of attractiveness of the dog.  Certain planned crossbreeding between purebred dogs of different breeds are now widely known as \"designer dogs\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/meet-18-designer-dog-breeds|title=Meet 18 Designer Dog Breeds|website=vetstreet.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209002955/http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/meet-18-designer-dog-breeds|archivedate=9 February 2018}}</ref> can produce puppies worth more than their purebred parents, due to a high demand.\n\n===Horses===\n[[File:National Show Horse.jpg|thumb|The [[National Show Horse]] was developed from crossbreeding programs in the 1970s and 1980s that blended [[Arabian horse]] and [[American Saddlebred]] bloodlines]]\nCrossbreeding in horses is often done with the intent of ultimately creating a new breed of horse. One type of modern crossbreeding in horses is used to create many of the [[warmblood]] breeds.  Warmbloods are a type of horse used in the [[sport horse]] disciplines, usually registered in an [[open stud book]] by a [[studbook selection]] procedure that evaluates conformation, pedigree and, in some animals, a training or performance standard.  Most warmblood breeds began as a cross of [[draft horse]] breeds on [[Thoroughbred]]s, but have, in some cases, developed over the past century to the point where they are considered to be a true-breeding population and have a [[closed stud book]].  Other types of recognized crossbreeding include that within the [[American Quarter Horse]], which will register horses with one Thoroughbred parent and one registered Quarter Horse parent in the \"Appendix\" registry, and allow such animals full breed registration status as Quarter Horses if they meet a certain performance standard.   Another well-known crossbred horse is the [[Anglo-Arabian]], which may be produced by a purebred [[Arabian horse]] crossed on a Thoroughbred, or by various crosses of Anglo-Arabians with other Anglo-Arabians, as long as the ensuing animal never has more than 75% or less than 25% of each breed represented in its pedigree.\n\n== Hybrid animals ==\n{{Main|Hybrid (biology)}}\nA [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] animal is one with parentage of two separate species, differentiating it from crossbred animals, which have parentage of the same species. Hybrids are usually, but not always, sterile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Why-Hybrids-Are-Sterile-42118.shtml|title=Why Are Hybrids Sterile ?|first=Stefan|last=Anitei|website=softpedia.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101114415/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Why-Hybrids-Are-Sterile-42118.shtml|archivedate=1 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most ancient types of hybrid animal is the [[mule]], a cross between a female [[horse]] and a male [[donkey]]. The [[liger]] is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cross between a male [[lion]] and female [[tiger]]. The [[yattle]] is a cross between a [[cow]] and a [[yak]]. Other crosses include the [[tigon]] (between a male tiger and female lion) and [[yakalo]] (between a yak and [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]]). The Incas recognized that hybrids of ''Lama glama'' (llama) and ''Vicugna pacos'' (alpaca) resulted in a hybrid with none of the advantages of either parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alpacasincanada.com/history.html|title=An Ancient Livestock, by Barbara Lang|website=alpacasincanada.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082756/http://alpacasincanada.com/history.html|archivedate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt one time it was thought that dogs and wolves were separate species, and the [[Wolf-dog hybrid|crosses between dogs and wolves]] were called wolf hybrids. Today wolves and dogs are both recognized as ''[[Canis lupus]]'', but the old term \"wolf hybrid\" is still used.\n\n== Mixed breeds ==\n{{Main|Mixed breed}}\nA mixed-breed animal is defined as having undocumented or unknown parentage, while a crossbreed generally has known, usually [[purebred]] parents of two distinct breeds or varieties. A dog of unknown parentage is often called a [[mixed-breed dog]], \"mutt\" or \"mongrel.\" A cat of unknown parentage is often referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]] generically, and in some dialects is often called a \"moggy\". A horse of unknown bloodlines is a [[grade horse]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artificial selection]]\n* [[Canid hybrid]]\n* [[Heterosis]]\n* [[Introgression]]\n* [[Selective breeding]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Breed}}\n[[Category:Animal breeding]]\n[[Category:Breeding]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbreed"}

Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=2|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Cotroneo|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''3''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Francesco Modesto]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\">Ceduto durante la sessione invernale di calciomercato.</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=4|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=5|nat=ITA|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=6|nat=ITA|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=7|nat=ITA|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=8|nat=ITA|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=9|nat=ITA|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=10|nat=ITA|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=11|nat=ITA|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=12|nat=ITA|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=13|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''14''|nat=CMR|name=''[[Frank Oliver Ongfiang]]''<ref>Ceduto a stagione iniziata.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=14|nat=ITA|name=Rocco D'Aiello|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=16|nat=ITA|name=Pietro Balistreri|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=17|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''18''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Franco Brienza]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=18|nat=ITA|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\">Acquistato durante la sessione invernale di calciomercato</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=19|nat=ITA|name=Daniele Zito|pos=DF}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=20|nat=ITA|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''21''|nat=ROU|name=''[[Paul Codrea]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=21|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=22|nat=ITA|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=''23''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Ighli Vannucchi]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=23|nat=ITA|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=24|nat=NGA|name=John Olufemi|pos=A}}\n{{fs player|no=25|nat=SLE|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=26|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=27|nat=ITA|name=Michele Trionfante|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=29|nat=ROU|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=30|nat=BRA|name=[[Jeda]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=A}}\n{{fs player|no=32|nat=ITA|name=Marco Fina|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=46|nat=ITA|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=51|nat=ITA|name=Vincenzo Giannusa|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=79|nat=ITA|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=81|nat=ITA|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=82|nat=ITA|name=Nicola Milano|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=84|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Comi|pos=P}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n===Transfers===\n\n====Winter====\n;'''In'''\n{|\n{{Football squad player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|other=from [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]]}}\n{{Football squad player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|other=from [[U.C.

The ''rosanero'' ended the season in first place, being crowned Serie B champions and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Summary==\nAmbitious Palermo failed to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] in the previous season following a 3-0 away defeat in the final match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], which were promoted at Palermo's place<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914131104/http://www.ilpalermocalcio.it/it/0304/numeri.jsp|title= Season 2002-30 Palermo |publisher=ilpalermocalcio.it|language=Italian}}</ref>. That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=2|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Cotroneo|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''3''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Francesco Modesto]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\">Ceduto durante la sessione invernale di calciomercato.</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=4|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=5|nat=ITA|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=6|nat=ITA|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=7|nat=ITA|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=8|nat=ITA|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=9|nat=ITA|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=10|nat=ITA|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=11|nat=ITA|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=12|nat=ITA|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=13|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''14''|nat=CMR|name=''[[Frank Oliver Ongfiang]]''<ref>Ceduto a stagione iniziata.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=14|nat=ITA|name=Rocco D'Aiello|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=16|nat=ITA|name=Pietro Balistreri|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=17|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''18''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Franco Brienza]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=18|nat=ITA|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\">Acquistato durante la sessione invernale di calciomercato</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=19|nat=ITA|name=Daniele Zito|pos=DF}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=20|nat=ITA|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''21''|nat=ROU|name=''[[Paul Codrea]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=21|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=22|nat=ITA|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=''23''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Ighli Vannucchi]]''<ref name=\"Cessione inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=23|nat=ITA|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=24|nat=NGA|name=John Olufemi|pos=A}}\n{{fs player|no=25|nat=SLE|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=26|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=27|nat=ITA|name=Michele Trionfante|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=29|nat=ROU|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=30|nat=BRA|name=[[Jeda]]<ref name=\"Acquisto inverno\"/>|pos=A}}\n{{fs player|no=32|nat=ITA|name=Marco Fina|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=46|nat=ITA|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=51|nat=ITA|name=Vincenzo Giannusa|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=79|nat=ITA|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=81|nat=ITA|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=D}}\n{{fs player|no=82|nat=ITA|name=Nicola Milano|pos=C}}\n{{fs player|no=84|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Comi|pos=P}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n===Transfers===\n|-\n|colspan=\"10\"|''Players sold or loaned out during the January transfer market:''\n{{Efs player|no=3|nat=Italy|name=[[Francesco Modesto]]|pos=DF|1|0|5|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Franco Brienza]]|pos=MF|18|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Romania|name=[[Paul Codrea]]|pos=MF|8|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Ighli Vannucchi]]|pos=MF|8|0|3|2}}\n|}\n\n====Winter====\n;'''In'''\n{|\n{{Football squad player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|other=from [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]]}}\n{{Football squad player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|other=from [[U.C.

{"title_page": "Abortion in New Jersey", "text_new": "'''Abortion in New Jersey''' is legal.   Abortion related laws were drafted by the legislature by the end of the 1900s.\u00a0 These laws would be addressed in court during the 1800s as they related to application in prosecutions of women for having abortions. During the 1940s, hospitals created committees to approve abortion requests with the goal of trying to reduce the number of abortions performed at them.\n\nThe state has an abortion rights activist community, with women participating in the #StoptheBans movement in May 2019.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{Main|Abortion}}{{See also|Definitions of abortion}}The abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"[[induced abortion]]\" of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense.<ref group=\"note\">According to the Supreme Court's decision in ''Roe v. Wade'':<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgement of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgement, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>Likewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Katie|date=20 Dec 2019|title=Why We Should Stop Using the Term \"Elective Abortion\"|url=https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/why-we-should-stop-using-term-elective-abortion/2018-12|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics|doi=10.1001/amajethics.2018.1175|accessdate=17 May 2019|pmid=30585581|volume=20|pages=E1175-1180|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAnti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Pam|last2=Hardisty|first2=Jean|year=2007|title=The Importance of the Political 'Framing' of Abortion|url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v14n1/ReproPatriarch-07.html|journal=The Public Eye Magazine|volume=14|issue=1}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/weekinreview/05greenhouse.html?scp=1&sq=infanticide \"The Roberts Court Takes on Abortion\".] ''New York Times.''

Wade'':<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgement of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgement, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>Likewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one.
