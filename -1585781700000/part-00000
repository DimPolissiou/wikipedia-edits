Guilherme's eviction against Gizelly and Pyong on week 6 reached the mark of 416.649.126 million votes, surpassing the old mark of 202.406.432 million votes casted on the [[Big Brother Brasil 19|previous season]]. Pyong's eviction against [[Babu Santana|Babu]] and Rafa on week 8, broke the record of simultaneous voting with 1.479.000 million votes casted per minute, with 385 million votes counted. Then, on week 10, a new record breaking number of 1.532.944.337 billion votes resulted in Felipe's eviction against [[Manu Gavassi|Manu]] and [[P\u00e2nico na Band|Mari]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gshow.globo.com/realities/bbb/bbb20/urgente/noticia/bbb20-bate-marca-historica-com-mais-de-1-bilhao-de-votos-em-um-unico-paredao.ghtml|title=BBB20 bate marca hist\u00f3rica com mais de 1 bilh\u00e3o de votos em um \u00fanico Pared\u00e3o}}</ref>\n\n== The game ==\n=== #FeedBBB ===\nThis season, each housemate will be able to use a cellphone to capture moments in the house during a time determined by production. The cell phone will only allow them to post photos and videos to #FeedBBB and see what other housemates are saying about each other. It will not allow contact with the outside world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gshow.globo.com/realities/bbb/bbb20/noticia/spoiler-bbb20-tudo-o-que-ja-se-sabe-sobre-a-edicao-historica.ghtml|title=Spoiler BBB20: tudo o que j\u00e1 se sabe sobre a edi\u00e7\u00e3o hist\u00f3rica}}</ref>\n\n=== Super HoH ===\nAlong with its regular powers, this season the HoH will also be tasked with splitting their housemates into Haves and Have-Nots as well as choosing what and how much each group will be eating. This HoH will also be awarded their own private party at the end of their HoH reign. \n\n=== The Wall ===\nOn Day 1, 18 housemates entered the Big Brother house, divided by a wall with Celebrities on one side and Civilians on the other. The two groups were not able to see each other until the end of night 2, after the wall fell. Twist introduced in ''[[Big Brother Brasil 9]]''.\n\n=== Power of Veto ===\nIn some weeks, the nominated housemates (excluding the HoH's nominee) compete against each other for one last chance to save themselves from eviction. Housemates nominated by the HoH are not eligible to compete and are sent straight to the public vote.

Twist introduced in ''[[Big Brother Brasil 9]]'', re-used in ''[[Big Brother Brasil 11]]'' (featuring the first five evicted housemates from that season) and ''[[Big Brother Brasil 13]]''.\n\n=== White Room ===\nOn Day 46, three housemates (Felipe, Gizelly and Manu) were chosen to enter the White Room, where they would stay until the live nominations on Day 48, unless one of them pressed the red button, thus becoming the first nominee of the week. A re-worked version of a twist introduced in ''[[Big Brother Brasil 9]]'', re-used in ''[[Big Brother Brasil 10]]''.\n\n=== Big Phone ===\nOnce in a while, the Big Phone rings, unleashing good or bad consequences on the nomination process for those who decide to answer it.

Lesbianism has been a theme in [[erotic art]] since at least the time of [[Culture of ancient Rome|ancient Rome]], and many regard depictions of lesbianism (as for sexuality in general) to be [[eroticism|erotic]].\n\nFor much of the history of cinema and television, lesbianism was considered [[taboo]], though since the [[The 60's|1960]]s it has increasingly become a genre in its own right. First found in [[softcore pornography|softcore]] movies and [[erotic thriller]]s, depictions of lesbianism entered mainstream cinema in the 1980s. In [[pornography]], depictions of lesbian sex form a popular [[subgenre]], directed toward male heterosexual audiences, lesbian audiences, and bisexual audiences of any gender.\n\n==Cultural background==\nSexual relations between women have been illustrated as well as narrated, but much of the written material from the early modern period has been destroyed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mour\u00e3o|first=Manuela|year=1999|title=The Representation of Female Desire in Early Modern Pornographic Texts, 1660-1745|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=24|issue=3|pages=573\u2013602|doi=10.1086/495366|pmid=22315732|jstor=3175319|url=http://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=english_fac_pubs}}</ref> What seems clear from the historical record is that much of the lesbian material in pornographic texts was intended for a male readership.<ref>{{cite book|last=Faderman|first=Lillian|title=Surpassing the Love of Men: Romantic Friendship and Love between Women from the Renaissance to the Present |url=https://archive.org/details/surpassingloveof00fade|url-access=registration|year=1981|publisher=William Morrow|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/surpassingloveof00fade/page/38 38\u201346]}}</ref>\n\n==Visual arts==\n\n===Classic and classical depictions===\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Boucher - La Nymphe Callisto, s\u00e9duite par Jupiter sous les traits de Diane (1759).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Boucher, ''The nymph Callisto, seduced by Jupiter in the shape of Diana'' (1759).]]\nDepictions of lesbianism are found among the [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|erotic frescoes of Pompeii]]. Having all but disappeared during the Middle Ages, they made a comeback after the [[Renaissance]]. [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] and [[J. M. W.

Like other painters (such as [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]]), Boucher found inspiration in classical mythology. He was one of many artists to use various myths surrounding the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], including the often-depicted story of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], Diana's nymph who was seduced by Jupiter, with the god taking Diana's form since Callisto had vowed chastity.<ref name=kosinski/>\n\n===19th-century developments===\nIn the 19th century, lesbianism became more openly discussed and found its way into many fields of art.

Even scenes suggestive of lesbianism were controversial, such as the presentation of women dancing together in ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'' (1932). ''Pandora's Box'' is notable for its lesbian subplot with the Countess ([[Alice Roberts (actress)|Alice Roberts]]) being defined by her masculine look and because she wears a tuxedo. Lesbian themes were found in European films such as ''[[M\u00e4dchen in Uniform (1931 film)|M\u00e4dchen in Uniform]]'' (1931). By the mid-1930s, the [[Hays Code]] banned any homosexual themes in Hollywood-made films and several pre-Code films had to be cut to be re-released. For example, ''The Sign of the Cross'' originally included the erotic \"Dance of the Naked Moon\",{{sfn|Vieira|1999|pp=106\u2013109}} but the dance was considered a \"lesbian dance\" and was [[Re-edited film|cut]] for a 1938 reissue. Even suggestions of a romantic attraction between women were rare, and the \"L-word\" was taboo. Lesbianism was not treated in American cinema until the 1962 release of ''[[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|Walk on the Wild Side]]'' in which there is a subtly implied lesbian relationship between Jo and Hallie. Depictions of lovemaking between women first appeared in several films of the late 1960s \u2013 ''[[The Fox (1967 film)|The Fox]]'' (1967), ''[[The Killing of Sister George (film)|The Killing of Sister George]]'' (1968), and ''[[Therese and Isabelle]]'' (1968).\n\nDuring the 1970s, depictions of sex between women were largely restricted to semi-pornographic softcore and [[sexploitation]] films, such as ''[[Cherry, Harry & Raquel!]]'' (1970), ''[[Score (1974 film)|Score]]'' (1974), ''[[Emmanuelle]]'' (1974), and ''[[Bilitis (film)|Bilitis]]'' (1977). Although semi-explicit heterosexual sex scenes had been part of mainstream cinema since the late 1960s, equivalent depictions of women having sex only began making their appearance in mainstream film during the 1980s. These were typically in the context of a film that was specifically lesbian-themed, such as ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1982), ''[[Lianna]]'' (1983), and ''[[Desert Hearts]]'' (1985). The vampire film ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'' (1983) also contained a seduction and sex scene between [[Catherine Deneuve]] and [[Susan Sarandon]]. Jacques Saurel's film \"Joy et Joan\" (1985) also belongs to this new more-than-softcore film performance.\n\n''[[Henry and June]]'' (1990) had several lesbian scenes, including one that was considered explicit enough to give the film an [[NC-17]] rating. (There was some controversy as to whether the [[MPAA]] had given the film a more restrictive rating than it normally would have because of the lesbian nature of the scene in question.) ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992) contained mild lesbian content, but established lesbianism as a theme in the [[erotic thriller]] genre. Later, in the 1990s, erotic thrillers such as ''[[Wild Side (1995 film)|Wild Side]]'' (1995) and ''[[Bound (1996 film)|Bound]]'' (1996) explored lesbian relationships and contained explicit lesbian sex scenes.<ref name=sexincinema>[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms.html \"Sex in Cinema: The Greatest and Most Influential Erotic/Sexual Films and Scenes\"] by Tim Dirks, ''The Best Films of All Time: A Primer of Cinematic History'' (website), 1996\u20132007. Retrieved October 19, 2006.</ref>\n\nFrom the 1990s, depictions of sex between women became fairly common in mainstream cinema. Females kissing has increasingly been shown in films and on television, often as a way to include a sexually arousing element in a film without actually having the film gain a more restrictive rating by depicting sex or nudity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n''[[The L Word]]'' was an American television drama series originally shown on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] from 2004 to 2009 and explored lesbian, [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] relationships, and contained numerous explicit lesbian sex scenes.\n\n{{anchor|Lesbian pornography}}\n==Pornography==\n<!-- The redirect Lesbian pornography links here.

However, in [[Japanese adult video]], lesbianism is considered a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] and is only occasionally included in heterosexual videos.

Adams, Lester W. Wright, Jr., and Bethany A. Lohr, published in the ''[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]]'', found that heterosexual men have the highest genital and subjective arousal to pornography depicting heterosexual activity, rather than lesbian activity.<ref name=\"Adams 1996\"/> Another study indicated that heterosexual men are more aroused by depictions involving lesbian sex than they are by depictions of heterosexual activity, while heterosexual and lesbian women were aroused by a wide range of sexual stimuli.<ref name=\"Chivers 2004\"/> On-screen lesbian sex (in both Western and Japanese pornography), while typically aimed at a male audience, has developed a small lesbian audience as well, but still contrasts with [[gay pornography|gay male pornography]], which is considered a genre of its own.\n\nDeborah Swedberg, in an analysis published in the ''[[Feminist Formations|NWSA Journal]]'' in 1989, argues that it is possible for lesbian viewers to reappropriate lesbian porn. Swedberg notes that, typically, all-women films differ from mixed porn (with men and women) in, among other things, the settings (less anonymous and more intimate) and the very acts performed (more realistic and emotionally involved, and with a focus on the whole body rather than just the genitals): \"the subject of the heterosexually produced all-women videos is female pleasure\". She argues (against [[Laura Mulvey]]'s [[Feminist film theory#The gaze and the female spectator|\"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cineman\"]] and [[Susanne Kappeler]]'s ''Pornography and Representation'', for example) that such movies allow for female subjectivity since the women are more than just objects of exchange.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Swedberg|first=Deborah|year=1989|title=What Do We See When We See Woman/Woman Sex in Pornographic Movies|journal=[[Feminist Formations|NWSA Journal]]|volume=1|issue=4|pages=602\u201316|jstor=4315957}}</ref> Appropriation by women of male-made lesbian erotica (such as by David Hamilton) was signaled also by [[Tee Corinne]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=Alice|year=1983|title=Interview [with Tee Corinne]: Images of Lesbian Sexuality|journal=[[Off Our Backs]]|volume=13|issue=4|pages=10\u201312|jstor=25774959}}</ref>\n\nSome pornography is made by lesbians, such as the defunct lesbian erotic magazine ''[[On Our Backs]]''; videos by Fatale Media, SIR Video, Pink and White Productions, and BLEU Productions; and web sites such as the CyberDyke Network.\n\n=== Mainstream inauthenticity ===\nMainstream lesbian pornography is criticized by some members of the lesbian community for its inauthenticity.<ref name=Webber>{{cite journal|last=Webber|first=Valerie|year=2012|title=Shades of gay: Performance of girl-on-girl pornography and mobile authenticities|journal=Sexualities|url=http://sexualities.sagepub.com/content/16/1-2/217.abstract|doi=10.1177/1363460712471119|volume=16|issue=1\u20132|pages=217\u2013235|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141208173823/http://sexualities.sagepub.com/content/16/1-2/217.abstract|archivedate=December 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> According to author Elizabeth Whitney, \"lesbianism is not acknowledged as legitimate\" in lesbian porn due to the prevalence of \"heteronormatively feminine women\", the experimental nature, and the constant catering to the male gaze, all of which counter real life lesbianism.<ref name=Webber/>\n\nA study conducted by Valerie Webber found that most actors in lesbian porn consider their own pornographic sex somewhere on a spectrum between real and fake sex, depending on several factors.<ref name=Webber/> They were more likely to consider it authentic if there was a real attraction between themselves and the other actor(s) in the scene,<ref name=Webber/> and if they felt mutual respect between themselves and the producers.<ref name=Webber/>\n\nAuthenticity in porn is disputed because some assert that the only authentic sex has no motive other than sex itself.<ref name=Webber/> Porn sex, being shot for a camera, automatically has other motives than sex itself.<ref name=Webber/> On the other side, some assert that all porn sex is authentic since the sex is an occurrence that took place, and that is all that is needed to classify it as authentic.<ref name=Webber/>\n\nWith regard to the authenticity of their performance, some lesbian porn actors describe their performance as an exaggerated, altered version of their real personality, providing some authenticity to the performance.<ref name=Webber/> Authenticity depends on real life experiences, so some lesbian porn actors feel the need to create an entirely different persona in order to feel safe.<ref name=Webber/> Webber writes of Agatha, a queer actor in lesbian porn who \"prefers that the activity and ambiance of her performances be very inauthentic, because otherwise it feels 'too close to home{{'\"}}, referring to the oppression and verbal abuse she is subject to by homophobic men in her daily life.<ref name=Webber/>\n\n=== Penetration ===\nLike in straight and gay male porn, there is an emphasis on penetration in lesbian porn.<ref name=Webber/> Even though studies have found that [[dildo]]s have minimal use in real life lesbian sexual activity,<ref name=Webber/><ref name=\"Greenberg\">{{cite book|author1=Jerrold S.

Lesbianism has been a theme in [[erotic art]] since at least the time of [[Culture of ancient Rome|ancient Rome]], and many regard depictions of lesbianism (as for sexuality in general) to be [[eroticism|erotic]].\n\nFor much of the history of cinema and television, lesbianism was considered [[taboo]], though since the [[The 60's|1960]]s it has increasingly become a genre in its own right.

In [[pornography]], depictions of lesbian sex form a popular [[subgenre]], directed toward male heterosexual audiences, lesbian audiences, and bisexual audiences of any gender.\n\n==Cultural background==\nSexual relations between women have been illustrated as well as narrated, but much of the written material from the early modern period has been destroyed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mour\u00e3o|first=Manuela|year=1999|title=The Representation of Female Desire in Early Modern Pornographic Texts, 1660-1745|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=24|issue=3|pages=573\u2013602|doi=10.1086/495366|pmid=22315732|jstor=3175319|url=http://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=english_fac_pubs}}</ref> What seems clear from the historical record is that much of the lesbian material in pornographic texts was intended for a male readership.<ref>{{cite book|last=Faderman|first=Lillian|title=Surpassing the Love of Men: Romantic Friendship and Love between Women from the Renaissance to the Present |url=https://archive.org/details/surpassingloveof00fade|url-access=registration|year=1981|publisher=William Morrow|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/surpassingloveof00fade/page/38 38\u201346]}}</ref>\n\n==Visual arts==\n\n===Classic and classical depictions===\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Boucher - La Nymphe Callisto, s\u00e9duite par Jupiter sous les traits de Diane (1759).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Boucher, ''The nymph Callisto, seduced by Jupiter in the shape of Diana'' (1759).]]\nDepictions of lesbianism are found among the [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|erotic frescoes of Pompeii]].

Like other painters (such as [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]]), Boucher found inspiration in classical mythology. He was one of many artists to use various myths surrounding the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], including the often-depicted story of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], Diana's nymph who was seduced by Jupiter, with the god taking Diana's form since Callisto had vowed chastity.<ref name=kosinski/>\n\n===19th-century developments===\nIn the 19th century, lesbianism became more openly discussed and found its way into many fields of art.

Even scenes suggestive of lesbianism were controversial, such as the presentation of women dancing together in ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'' (1932). ''Pandora's Box'' is notable for its lesbian subplot with the Countess ([[Alice Roberts (actress)|Alice Roberts]]) being defined by her masculine look and because she wears a tuxedo. Lesbian themes were found in European films such as ''[[M\u00e4dchen in Uniform (1931 film)|M\u00e4dchen in Uniform]]'' (1931). By the mid-1930s, the [[Hays Code]] banned any homosexual themes in Hollywood-made films and several pre-Code films had to be cut to be re-released. For example, ''The Sign of the Cross'' originally included the erotic \"Dance of the Naked Moon\",{{sfn|Vieira|1999|pp=106\u2013109}} but the dance was considered a \"lesbian dance\" and was [[Re-edited film|cut]] for a 1938 reissue. Even suggestions of a romantic attraction between women were rare, and the \"L-word\" was taboo. Lesbianism was not treated in American cinema until the 1962 release of ''[[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|Walk on the Wild Side]]'' in which there is a subtly implied lesbian relationship between Jo and Hallie. Depictions of lovemaking between women first appeared in several films of the late 1960s \u2013 ''[[The Fox (1967 film)|The Fox]]'' (1967), ''[[The Killing of Sister George (film)|The Killing of Sister George]]'' (1968), and ''[[Therese and Isabelle]]'' (1968).\n\nDuring the 1970s, depictions of sex between women were largely restricted to semi-pornographic softcore and [[sexploitation]] films, such as ''[[Cherry, Harry & Raquel!]]'' (1970), ''[[Score (1974 film)|Score]]'' (1974), ''[[Emmanuelle]]'' (1974), and ''[[Bilitis (film)|Bilitis]]'' (1977). Although semi-explicit heterosexual sex scenes had been part of mainstream cinema since the late 1960s, equivalent depictions of women having sex only began making their appearance in mainstream film during the 1980s. These were typically in the context of a film that was specifically lesbian-themed, such as ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1982), ''[[Lianna]]'' (1983), and ''[[Desert Hearts]]'' (1985). The vampire film ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'' (1983) also contained a seduction and sex scene between [[Catherine Deneuve]] and [[Susan Sarandon]]. Jacques Saurel's film \"Joy et Joan\" (1985) also belongs to this new more-than-softcore film performance.\n\n''[[Henry and June]]'' (1990) had several lesbian scenes, including one that was considered explicit enough to give the film an [[NC-17]] rating. (There was some controversy as to whether the [[MPAA]] had given the film a more restrictive rating than it normally would have because of the lesbian nature of the scene in question.) ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992) contained mild lesbian content, but established lesbianism as a theme in the [[erotic thriller]] genre. Later, in the 1990s, erotic thrillers such as ''[[Wild Side (1995 film)|Wild Side]]'' (1995) and ''[[Bound (1996 film)|Bound]]'' (1996) explored lesbian relationships and contained explicit lesbian sex scenes.<ref name=sexincinema>[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms.html \"Sex in Cinema: The Greatest and Most Influential Erotic/Sexual Films and Scenes\"] by Tim Dirks, ''The Best Films of All Time: A Primer of Cinematic History'' (website), 1996\u20132007. Retrieved October 19, 2006.</ref>\n\nFrom the 1990s, depictions of sex between women became fairly common in mainstream cinema. Females kissing has increasingly been shown in films and on television, often as a way to include a sexually arousing element in a film without actually having the film gain a more restrictive rating by depicting sex or nudity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n''[[The L Word]]'' was an American television drama series originally shown on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] from 2004 to 2009 and explored lesbian, [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] relationships, and contained numerous explicit lesbian sex scenes.\n\n{{anchor|Lesbian pornography}}\n==Pornography==\n<!-- The redirect Lesbian pornography links here.

Adams, Lester W. Wright, Jr., and Bethany A. Lohr, published in the ''[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]]'', found that heterosexual men have the highest genital and subjective arousal to pornography depicting heterosexual activity, rather than lesbian activity.<ref name=\"Adams 1996\"/> Another study indicated that heterosexual men are more aroused by depictions involving lesbian sex than they are by depictions of heterosexual activity, while heterosexual and lesbian women were aroused by a wide range of sexual stimuli.<ref name=\"Chivers 2004\"/> On-screen lesbian sex (in both Western and Japanese pornography), while typically aimed at a male audience, has developed a small lesbian audience as well, but still contrasts with [[gay pornography|gay male pornography]], which is considered a genre of its own.\n\nDeborah Swedberg, in an analysis published in the ''[[Feminist Formations|NWSA Journal]]'' in 1989, argues that it is possible for lesbian viewers to reappropriate lesbian porn. Swedberg notes that, typically, all-women films differ from mixed porn (with men and women) in, among other things, the settings (less anonymous and more intimate) and the very acts performed (more realistic and emotionally involved, and with a focus on the whole body rather than just the genitals): \"the subject of the heterosexually produced all-women videos is female pleasure\".

Historically, women have been less involved in the production and consumption of erotica in general and visual pornography in particular than have men. Since the late 1960s, [[radical feminist]] objections to pornography and the [[sexual objectification]] of women have influenced the lesbian community, with some feminists objecting to all pornography. However, since the end of the 1980s' \"[[Feminist Sex Wars]]\" and the beginning of the \"[[women's erotica]]\" movement, feminist views on pornography, both lesbian and heterosexual, have shifted.<ref name=EoH>{{Cite book\n|title=Encyclopedia of Homosexuality\n|url=http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Encyclopedia_of_Homosexuality\n|quote=A development of  the 1980s is the birth of  a true women's pornographic movement, in which women create  and market  erotic materials  for female consumption, both homosexual and heterosexual\n|chapter=Pornography\n|chapterurl=http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Pornography.pdf\n|last=Eisenberg|first=Daniel\n|editor-last=Dynes|editor-first=Wayne R|editor-link=Wayne R.
