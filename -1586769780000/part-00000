The borders that the British formed had the Kurds between central Iraq (Baghdad) and the Ottoman lands of the north.\n\nThe Kurdish people of Iraq lived in the mountainous and terrain of the [[Mosul Vilayet]]. It was a difficult region to control from the British perspective because of the terrain and tribal loyalties of the Kurds. There was much conflict after the Great War, between the Ottoman government and British on how the borders should be established. The Ottomans were unhappy with the outcome of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], which allowed the Great War victors control over much of the former Ottoman lands, through the distribution [[San Remo Conference|of formerly Ottoman territory]] as [[League of Nations mandates]].\n\nIn particular, the Turks felt that the Mosul Vilayet was theirs because the British had illegally conquered it after the [[Mudros Armistice]], which had ended hostilities in the war.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oltoman Empire |title=The Mosul Vilayet |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nevin_Cosar/publication/27568543_THE_MOSUL_QUESTION_AND_THE_TURKISH_REPUBLIC_BEFORE_AND_AFTER_THE_FRONTlER_TREATY_1926/links/55d4dcd208aef1574e975c42/THE-MOSUL-QUESTION-AND-THE-TURKISH-REPUBLIC-BEFORE-AND-AFTER-THE-FRONTlER-TREATY-1926.pdf |website=www.researchgate.net}}</ref> With the discovery of oil in northern Iraq, the British were unwilling to relinquish the Mosul Vilayet.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hale |first1=William M. |title=Turkish Foreign Policy, 1774-2000 |date=2000 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9780714650715 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_xLgtpBsovwC&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%27A+Tedious+and+Perilous+Controversy%27:+Britain+and+the+Settlement+of+the+Mosul+Dispute,+1918-1926&source=bl&ots=DXKIQ_1h8h&sig=CuO-ApWqAwVx2mN46eYYE7XB9nc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6nbnzhvPcAhXsIDQIHYdXCHQQ6AEwBHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q='A%20Tedious%20and%20Perilous%20Controversy'%3A%20Britain%20and%20the%20Settlement%20of%20the%20Mosul%20Dispute%2C%201918-1926&f=false |language=en}}</ref> Also, it was to the British advantage to have the Kurds play a buffer role between themselves and the Ottoman Empire. All that led to the importance of Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji.\n\nThe British promised the Kurds during the Great War that they would receive their own land to form a Kurdish state. However, the British did not keep their promise, which was the first of many instances the British manipulated the Kurds and lied to them.<ref>{{cite web |last1=World WAR I |title=BRITISH LIES  IN THE WORLD WAR I |url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/Reports/Imperialism/britainlies.html |website=www.worldfuturefund.org}}</ref>\n\nThere was mistrust on the part of the Kurds, who were left with a bad taste in their mouth. In 1919, uneasiness began to evolve in the Kurdish regions because they were unhappy with the situation the British forced upon them. The Kurds [[Ko\u00e7kiri Rebellion|revolted]] a year later.\n\nThe British tried to establish a puppet government in the region and so appointed a popular leader of the region,<ref>{{cite web |last1=\u0130ki H\u00fck\u00fcmet Bir Te\u015fkilat |title=History |url=http://www.historystudies.net/dergi/tar201512901a7.pdf |website=www.historystudies.net}}</ref> which was how Mahmud became governor of southern Kurdistan.\n\n==Power and revolts==\n\n[[File:Mahmud Barzanji Kurdish leader.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|Mahmud Barzanji]]\n{{main|Mahmud Barzanji revolts}}\nMahmud was a very ambitious Kurdish national leader and promoted the idea of Kurds to control their own state and gain independence from the British. As [[Charles R. H. Tripp|Charles Tripp]] relates, the British appointed him governor of Sulaimaniah in southern Kurdistan as a way of gaining an indirect rule in this region. The British wanted this indirect rule with the popular Mahmud at the helm, which they believed would give them a face and a leader to control and calm the region. However, with a little taste of power, Mahmud had ambitions for more for himself and for the Kurdish people. He was declared \"King of Kurdistan\" and claimed to be the ruler of all Kurds, but the opinion of Mahmud among Kurds was mixed because he was becoming too powerful and ambitious for some.<ref name=\"Tripp2007p33-34\" />\n\nMahmud hoped to create Kurdistan and initially, the British allowed Mahmud to pursue has ambitions because he was bringing the region and people together for the British to control. However, by 1920, Mahmud, to British displeasure, was using his power against the British by capturing British officials in the Kurd region and starting uprisings against the British.<ref name=\"Lortz2005p10-11\" /> As historian [[Kevin McKierman]] writes, \"The rebellion lasted until Mahmud was wounded in combat, which occurred on the road between [[Kirkuk]] and Sulaimaniah. Captured by British forces, he was sentenced to death but later imprisoned in a British fort in India.\"<ref name=\"McKierman2006p31\" /> Sheikh remained in India until 1922.\n\n==Return and second revolt==\n[[File:Barzanji.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Mahmud Barzanji]]\nWith the exile of Sheikh in India, [[Turkish nationalist]]s in the crumbling Ottoman Empire were causing a great deal of trouble in the Kurdish regions of Iraq. The Turkish nationalists, led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]], were riding high in the early 1920s after their victory against [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] and were looking to take that momentum into Iraq and take back [[Mosul]]. With the British in direct control of northern Iraq after the exile of Sheikh Mahmud, the area was becoming increasingly hostile for the British officials due to the threat from Turkey. The region was led by the Sheikh's brother, Sheikh Qadir, who was not capable of handling the situation and was seen by the British as an unstable and unreliable leader.\n\nSir [[Percy Cox]], a British military official and administrator to the Middle East especially Iraq, and [[Winston Churchill]], a British politician, were at odds on whether to release the Sheikh from his exile and bring him back to reign in northern Iraq. That would allow the British to have better control over the hostile but important region. Cox argued that the British could gain authority in a region they recently evacuated, and the Sheikh was the only hope of gaining back a stable region.<ref name=\"Olson1989\" /> Cox was aware of the dangers of bringing back the Sheikh, but he was also aware that one of the main reasons for the unrest in the region was the growing perception that the earlier promises of autonomy would be abandoned and the British would bring the Kurdish people under direct rule of the Arab government in Baghdad. The Kurdish dream of an independent state was growing less likely which caused conflict in the region.<ref name=\"Tripp2007p53\" /> Bringing the Sheikh back was their only chance of a peaceful Iraqi state in the region and against Turkey.\n\nCox agreed to bring back Sheikh and name him governor of southern Kurdistan. On December 20, 1922, Cox also agreed on a joint Anglo-Iraqi declaration that would allow a Kurdish government if they were able to form a constitution and agree on boundaries. Cox knew with the instability in the region and the fact that there were many Kurdish groups it would be nearly impossible for them to come to a solution.<ref name=\"McKierman2006p32\" /> Upon his return, Mahmud proceeded to pronounce himself King of the Kingdom of Kurdistan. Sheikh rejected the deal with the British and began working in alliance with the Turks against the British. Cox realized the situation and in 1923, he denied the Kurds any say in the government and withdrew his offer of their own independent state.

He was [[sheikh]] of a [[Qadiriyah]] [[Sufi]] family of the [[Barzanji Kurds|Barzanji clan]] from the city of [[Sulaymaniyah]], which is now in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. He was named King of Kurdistan during several of these uprisings.\n\n==Background==\nAfter [[World War I]], the British and other Western powers occupied parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Plans made with the French in the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] designated Britain as the mandate power.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fromkin |first1=David | authorlink = David Fromkin |title=[[A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East]] |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |language=en |date=1 September 2001}}</ref> The British were able to form their own borders to their pleasure to gain an advantage in this region.<ref>{{cite news |last1=BBC |title=Iraqi Kurdistan profile |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28147263 |work=BBC News |date=25 April 2018}}</ref> The British had firm control of [[Baghdad]] and [[Basra]] and the regions around these cities, mostly consisted of [[Shiite]] and [[Sunni]] Arabs.\n\nIn 1921, the British appointed Faisal I the King of Iraq. It was an interesting choice because Faisal had no local connections, as he was part of the [[Hashemite]] family in Western [[Arabia]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hashemites Family |title=Hashemites |url=http://www.alhussein.jo/ar/%D8%B4%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86 |website=www.alhussein.jo}}</ref> As events were unfolding in the southern part of Iraq, the British were also developing new policies in northern Iraq which was primarily inhabited by Kurds, known as Greater Kurdistan in the Paris (Versailles) Peace Conference held in 1919. The borders that the British formed had the Kurds between central Iraq (Baghdad) and the Ottoman lands of the north.\n\nThe Kurdish people of Iraq lived in the mountainous and terrain of the [[Mosul Vilayet]]. It was a difficult region to control from the British perspective because of the terrain and tribal loyalties of the Kurds. There was much conflict after the Great War, between the Ottoman government and British on how the borders should be established. The Ottomans were unhappy with the outcome of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], which allowed the Great War victors control over much of the former Ottoman lands, through the distribution [[San Remo Conference|of formerly Ottoman territory]] as [[League of Nations mandates]].\n\nIn particular, the Turks felt that the Mosul Vilayet was theirs because the British had illegally conquered it after the [[Mudros Armistice]], which had ended hostilities in the war.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oltoman Empire |title=The Mosul Vilayet |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nevin_Cosar/publication/27568543_THE_MOSUL_QUESTION_AND_THE_TURKISH_REPUBLIC_BEFORE_AND_AFTER_THE_FRONTlER_TREATY_1926/links/55d4dcd208aef1574e975c42/THE-MOSUL-QUESTION-AND-THE-TURKISH-REPUBLIC-BEFORE-AND-AFTER-THE-FRONTlER-TREATY-1926.pdf |website=www.researchgate.net}}</ref> With the discovery of oil in northern Iraq, the British were unwilling to relinquish the Mosul Vilayet.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hale |first1=William M. |title=Turkish Foreign Policy, 1774-2000 |date=2000 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9780714650715 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_xLgtpBsovwC&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%27A+Tedious+and+Perilous+Controversy%27:+Britain+and+the+Settlement+of+the+Mosul+Dispute,+1918-1926&source=bl&ots=DXKIQ_1h8h&sig=CuO-ApWqAwVx2mN46eYYE7XB9nc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi6nbnzhvPcAhXsIDQIHYdXCHQQ6AEwBHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q='A%20Tedious%20and%20Perilous%20Controversy'%3A%20Britain%20and%20the%20Settlement%20of%20the%20Mosul%20Dispute%2C%201918-1926&f=false |language=en}}</ref> Also, it was to the British advantage to have the Kurds play a buffer role between themselves and the Ottoman Empire. All that led to the importance of Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji.\n\nThe British promised the Kurds during the Great War that they would receive their own land to form a Kurdish state. However, the British did not keep their promise, which was the first of many instances the British manipulated the Kurds and lied to them.<ref>{{cite web |last1=World WAR I |title=BRITISH LIES  IN THE WORLD WAR I |url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/Reports/Imperialism/britainlies.html |website=www.worldfuturefund.org}}</ref>\n\nThere was mistrust on the part of the Kurds, who were left with a bad taste in their mouth. In 1919, uneasiness began to evolve in the Kurdish regions because they were unhappy with the situation the British forced upon them. The Kurds [[Ko\u00e7kiri Rebellion|revolted]] a year later.\n\nThe British tried to establish a puppet government in the region and so appointed a popular leader of the region,<ref>{{cite web |last1=\u0130ki H\u00fck\u00fcmet Bir Te\u015fkilat |title=History |url=http://www.historystudies.net/dergi/tar201512901a7.pdf |website=www.historystudies.net}}</ref> which was how Mahmud became governor of southern Kurdistan.\n\n==Power and revolts==\n\n[[File:Mahmud Barzanji Kurdish leader.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|Mahmud Barzanji]]\n{{main|Mahmud Barzanji revolts}}\nMahmud was a very ambitious Kurdish national leader and promoted the idea of Kurds to control their own state and gain independence from the British. As [[Charles R. H. Tripp|Charles Tripp]] relates, the British appointed him governor of Sulaimaniah in southern Kurdistan as a way of gaining an indirect rule in this region. The British wanted this indirect rule with the popular Mahmud at the helm, which they believed would give them a face and a leader to control and calm the region. However, with a little taste of power, Mahmud had ambitions for more for himself and for the Kurdish people. He was declared \"King of Kurdistan\" and claimed to be the ruler of all Kurds, but the opinion of Mahmud among Kurds was mixed because he was becoming too powerful and ambitious for some.<ref name=\"Tripp2007p33-34\" />\n\nMahmud hoped to create Kurdistan and initially, the British allowed Mahmud to pursue has ambitions because he was bringing the region and people together for the British to control. However, by 1920, Mahmud, to British displeasure, was using his power against the British by capturing British officials in the Kurd region and starting uprisings against the British.<ref name=\"Lortz2005p10-11\" /> As historian [[Kevin McKierman]] writes, \"The rebellion lasted until Mahmud was wounded in combat, which occurred on the road between [[Kirkuk]] and Sulaimaniah. Captured by British forces, he was sentenced to death but later imprisoned in a British fort in India.\"<ref name=\"McKierman2006p31\" /> Sheikh remained in India until 1922.\n\n==Return and second revolt==\n[[File:Barzanji.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Mahmud Barzanji]]\nWith the exile of Sheikh in India, [[Turkish nationalist]]s in the crumbling Ottoman Empire were causing a great deal of trouble in the Kurdish regions of Iraq. The Turkish nationalists, led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]], were riding high in the early 1920s after their victory against [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] and were looking to take that momentum into Iraq and take back [[Mosul]]. With the British in direct control of northern Iraq after the exile of Sheikh Mahmud, the area was becoming increasingly hostile for the British officials due to the threat from Turkey. The region was led by the Sheikh's brother, Sheikh Qadir, who was not capable of handling the situation and was seen by the British as an unstable and unreliable leader.\n\nSir [[Percy Cox]], a British military official and administrator to the Middle East especially Iraq, and [[Winston Churchill]], a British politician, were at odds on whether to release the Sheikh from his exile and bring him back to reign in northern Iraq. That would allow the British to have better control over the hostile but important region. Cox argued that the British could gain authority in a region they recently evacuated, and the Sheikh was the only hope of gaining back a stable region.<ref name=\"Olson1989\" /> Cox was aware of the dangers of bringing back the Sheikh, but he was also aware that one of the main reasons for the unrest in the region was the growing perception that the earlier promises of autonomy would be abandoned and the British would bring the Kurdish people under direct rule of the Arab government in Baghdad. The Kurdish dream of an independent state was growing less likely which caused conflict in the region.<ref name=\"Tripp2007p53\" /> Bringing the Sheikh back was their only chance of a peaceful Iraqi state in the region and against Turkey.\n\nCox agreed to bring back Sheikh and name him governor of southern Kurdistan. On December 20, 1922, Cox also agreed on a joint Anglo-Iraqi declaration that would allow a Kurdish government if they were able to form a constitution and agree on boundaries. Cox knew with the instability in the region and the fact that there were many Kurdish groups it would be nearly impossible for them to come to a solution.<ref name=\"McKierman2006p32\" /> Upon his return, Mahmud proceeded to pronounce himself King of the Kingdom of Kurdistan. Sheikh rejected the deal with the British and began working in alliance with the Turks against the British. Cox realized the situation and in 1923, he denied the Kurds any say in the government and withdrew his offer of their own independent state. The Sheikh was the king until 1924 and was involved in uprisings against the British until 1932, when the [[Royal Air Force]] and British-trained Iraqis were able to capture the Sheikh again and exile him to southern Iraq.<ref name=\"McKierman2006p32\" />\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nSheikh sued for peace and was exiled in southern Iraq in May 1932 and was able to return to his family village in 1941 where he remained the rest of his years.<ref name=\"Tripp2007p66\" /> He ultimately died in 1956 with his family.

It lies 347&nbsp;km (215 miles) north of [[Kolkata]], the capital of [[West Bengal]]. [[Mango]], [[jute]] and [[silk]] are the most notable products of this district. The special variety of mango, [[Fazli (mango)|Fazli]], produced in this region is popularly known by the name of the district and is exported across the world and internationally acclaimed. The folk culture of [[gombhira]] is a feature of the district, being a unique way of representation of joy and sorrow of daily life of the common people, as well as the unique medium of presentation on national and international matters.  According to the [[National Investigation Agency]] Malda is believed to be a hub of a fake currency racket.<ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Malda-gateway-of-fake-currencies/articleshow/48950199.cms</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/821401/malda-indias-fake-currency-capital-is-feeling-the-demonetisation-pinch|title=Malda, India's fake currency capital, is feeling the demonetisation pinch}}</ref><ref>http://www.oneindia.com/india/why-does-fake-currency-come-from-west-bengal-1788096.html</ref> It is reported that 90 per cent of the fake currency that enters India originates in Malda.<ref>http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/malda-violence-was-bsf-vs-people-claims-mamata-banerjee-1263898</ref><ref>http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/fake-currency-seized-from-malda/1/497978.html</ref>\n\nDistrict headquarters is [[English Bazar]], also known as ''[[English Bazar|Malda]]'', which was once the capital of Bengal. The district maintains the traditions of the past in culture and education. [[Old Malda]], the town which lies just east of the confluence of the [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]] and Kalindi rivers, is part of the English Bazar metropolitan city. The town rose to prominence as the river port of the old capital of [[Pandua, Malda|Pandua]]. During the 18th century it was the seat of prosperous cotton and silk industries. It remains an important distributing centre for rice, [[jute]], and wheat. The area between the historical monument of Jame Masjid (1566) and the landmark of Nimasarai tower across the river Mahananda, constituted a municipality in 1867. Rice, jute, [[legumes]], and [[oilseed]] are the chief crops in the surrounding area. Malda is the largest producer of excellent quality of jute in India. [[Mulberry]] plantations and mango orchards occupy large areas; mango trade and silk manufacture are the main economic activities. The Independence Day of Malda is 17 August 1947.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Gour Era===\n[[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] mentioned a city named ''Gourpura'', which by strong reason may be identified as the city of ''Gouda'', ruins of which are situated in this district. Examples are legion of the relics of a predecessor kingdom being used in the monuments of the successor kingdoms.\n\nIt had been within the limits of ancient ''Gour'' and  ''Pandua'' ([[Pundrabardhana]]). These two cities had been the capital of Bengal in ancient and medieval ages and are equidistant, north and south, from [[English Bazar]] town (once known as Engelzavad established by the British rulers).\n\nThe boundary of Gour was changed in different ages since the 5th century BC, and its name can be found in [[Purana|Puranic]] texts. [[Pundranagara]] was the provincial capital of the [[Maurya Empire]]. Gour and [[Pundravardhana]] formed parts of the Mourya empire as is evinced from the [[inscription]]s, [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]] script on a seal discovered from the ruins of [[Mahasthangarh]] in the [[Bogra District]] of [[Bangladesh]]. [[Xuanzang]]  saw many [[Ashoka]]n [[stupa]]s at [[Pundravardhana]].\n\nThe inscriptions discovered in the district of undivided [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]] and other parts of North Bengal, along with the [[Allahabad]] pillar inscriptions of [[Samudragupta]], clearly indicate that the whole of [[North Bengal]] as far east as [[Kamrup region|Kamrup]] formed a part of the [[Gupta Empire]].\n\nAfter the Guptas in the beginning of 7th century AD [[Sasanka]], the king of Karnasubarna as well as the king of [[Gau\u1e0da region|Gauda]] ruled independently for more than three decades. From the middle of the 8th century to the end of the 11th century the Pala dynasty ruled Bengal, the kings were devoted to [[Buddhism]]. It was during their reign that the Jagadalla Vihara (monastery) in Barindri flourished paralleling with [[Nalanda]], Vikramshila and Devikot.<ref name=\"HANDBOOK\"/>\n\n===Gour Era===\nThe [[Pala empire]] yielded to the emergence of [[Sen Dynasty]], the Sen rulers were orthodox Hindus, and in the habit of moving from place to place within their kingdom. During this time, Buddhism went on the defensive. It eventually disappeared from the demographic map of Bengal. At the time of Lakshman Sen Goud was known as Lakshmanabati. The Sen kings ruled Bengal till [[Muhammad Khilji|Bakhtiyar Khalji]] conquered Bengal in 1204 AD.\n\nThereafter the [[Muslim]] rule started. The name Mal Daha was coined (Mal= riches, Daha= lake). Sultan [[Ilyas Shah]], [[Ilyas Shahi dynasty|Firuz Shah]], [[Sikandar Shah]], [[Raja Ganesha]], [[Alauddin Hussain Shah]] and [[Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah]] are the notable rulers of medieval age. Afghan warrior [[Sher Shah Suri]] invaded [[Gau\u1e0da (city)|Gour]] and was repelled by [[Mughal emperor]] [[Humayun]]. [[Humayun]], loving the [[mango]] of Gour, named the place as Jannatabad (garden of heaven). [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]], [[Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah|Ghiyasuddin]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] army invaded [[Gaur|Gour]] to suppress rebellion several time.  Relics of Muslim structures are present as [[Gaur|Firuz minar]], [[Adina Mosque]] (the largest [[mosque]] of [[South Asia]] then), Qutwali gate etc. During the Mughal rule, the capital was removed to [[Dhaka]] due to a course change of the river [[Ganges]]. [[Muslim]] rule ended in 1757. [[Koch dynasty|Koch]] army invasion increased during the downfall of Gour.<ref name=\"HANDBOOK\"/>\n\n===Post-Gour Era===\n[[File:Jungleterry District Map.jpg|thumb|200px|right|1779 map of the [[Jungle Terry]] District.]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Plassey|war of Palassy]], the [[East India Company|British]] rule started in 1757. The English traders settled in the southern bank of the river [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]]. Some indigo plant chambers, trade centre and offices were established. [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] worked here. But the glorious days were gone.\n[[Image:1907-bengal-sikkim3.jpg|right|thumb|1907 Map of Bengal with Sikkim]]\nThis district was formed out of some portions of outlying areas of [[Purnia]], [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]] and [[Rajshahi District|Rajshahi]] districts in 1813. At the time of Dr. B. Hamilton (1808&ndash;09), the present thanas of [[Gazole Town|Gazole]], Malda, Bamongola, and part of [[Habibpur]] were included in the district of Dinajpur and the thanas of Harischandrapur, Kharba, Ratua, Manikchak, and Kaliachak were included in the district of Purnia. In 1813, in consequence of the prevalence of serious crimes in the Kaliachak and Sahebganj thanas and also on the rivers, a Joint Magistrate and Deputy Collector was appointed at English Bazar, with jurisdiction over a number of police stations centering that place and taken from the two districts. Thus the district of Malda was born. The year 1832 saw the establishment of separate treasury and the year 1859 the posting of a full-fledged magistrate and collector.\n\nUp to 1876, this district formed part of [[Rajshahi Division]] and between 1876 and 1905, it formed part of [[Bhagalpur Division]]. In 1905, it was again transferred to Rajshahi Division and until 1947, Malda remained in this division. During the first [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]] of 1905, this district was attached with the newly created province of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]]. Malda has a history of Indigo movement led by Rafique Mondal. The santhals got insurgent and captured historic [[Adina Mosque]] in support of Jeetu.  Again in August 1947 this district was affected by partition.  Between 12&ndash;15 August 1947, the fate of the district as to which side it should go, to Pakistan or to India, was undecided because the announcement of the partition award of Sir Radcliffe did not make this point clear. During these few days the district was under a Magistrate of [[East Pakistan]]. When the details of the [[Radcliffe Award]] were published, the district came over to [[West Bengal]] on 17 August 1947. However, the sub-division of [[Nawabganj District|Nawabganj]] was severed from Malda and was given to [[East Pakistan]] as a sub-division of the [[Rajshahi]] district.<ref name=\"HANDBOOK\">{{cite book|title=HISTORY AND SCOPE OF THE DISTRICT CENSUS HANDBOOK|page=7|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/19/1906_PART_A_DCHB_MALDAH.pdf|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[latitude]] range is 24\u00b040\u201920\" N to 25\u00b032\u201908\" N, and the [[longitude]] range is 87\u00b045\u201950\" E to 88\u00b028\u201910\" E. The district covers an area of {{convert|3733.66|km2|sqmi|1}}. The total population (as of 2001 Census) was recorded as 3,290,160.\n\nMalda is called the gateway of North [[Bengal]]. It was once the capital of Gour-Banga with its {{convert|3733|km2|sqmi|0}} lay of the land classified into Tal, Diara, and Barind.\n\nTo the south is [[Murshidabad district]], to the north are [[North Dinajpur| North Dinajpur district]] and [[South Dinajpur|South Dinajpur district]].

To the west is [[Santhal Parganas]] of [[Jharkhand]] and [[Purnea]] of [[Bihar]].\n\n===Malda City===\n{{Main|Malda City}}\n\n'''Malda''', the district headquarters which lends its name to the district, during its early days grew up only near the side of the river Mahananda, and now the place is known as Phulbari. Some of the oldest houses can be found here. The city started to grow since 1925-1930. Now nearly a half-million people live in this city, and it is one of the biggest cities of West Bengal. It is a part of the former Gour. The city is recognised as the English Bazaar municipality. Its notable railway station is named as [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]].\n\n===Mahadipur international border crossing===\n'''Mahadipur international border crossing''' on Malda-[[Rajshahi]] route is at Mahadipur town in Malda district of West Bengal in India.\n\n==Local Newspapers==\nThe first monthly periodicals published from Malda was 'Kusum', edited by Radhesh Chandra Seth, a noted personality of the then Malda. Though the exact date of its first publications is not known, it has been assumed by the informed sources that Kusum was first published in 1890s. In 1896, Radhesh Chandra published two weekly newspapers Gourdoot and Gourbarta.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sarkar|first1=Ashim|title=Changing Profile of Bengal District:Malda 1932-1950|date=2008|publisher=Classique Books|location=9, Radhanath Mallik Lane, Kolkata|isbn=81-87616-34-2|pages=10&ndash;12|edition=First}}</ref> In 1897 Maldaha Samachar edited by Kaliprasanna Chakrabarty began to be published. Maulavi Abdul Ganikhan published 'Malda Akhbar' in 1914. In the same year another periodical Gambhira' edited by Krishna Charan Sarkar was published. Damru, Adina and Minar\u2014three weekly newspaper were published in 1941. The editors were Nanda Gopal Chowdhury, Akbar Munshi and Abdur Rahaman respectively.\n\nThe most important among them was 'Gourdoot' which was first published on 1896 by Radhesh Chandra Seth. But within a short period the publication of the newspaper came to an end as the editor faced a serious financial loss. The 'Gourdoot' again began to be published from 1912 under the editorship of Lalbihari Majumdar. Majumdar was a great scholar and his literary sense was appreciated by Benoy Kumar Sarkar and Radhesh Chandra Seth. In this endeavor the editor was greatly supported by the and financed by Sarat Chandra Roy Chowdhury, Maharaja of Chancal. The Gourdoot was used to be published on Thursday of each week. The paper contained 6 pages and the price is one anna in 1944. The political outlook of the newspaper is pro-congress. Moreover, Lalbihari Majumdar, its editor took a pioneering role in organizing the congress movement in Malda. He has for a long time been the vice-president of the district Congress. The periodical had an implied antipathy towards Gandhian ideology.\n\nIn modern times there was also some local newspapers published in Malda, the most prominent among them are 'Rupantorer Pothe', 'Songbad Smoyiki', Aamader Malda' etc. 'Rupantorere Pothe' is published in every Sunday in each week.\n\n==Popular Movements in Malda==\nThe most important among the popular movement is the one led by Jitu Santhal in 1932. Historians like Tanika Sarkar observes, Jitu's movement was rooted in the rich tradition of tribal struggle in Malda. The early form of santhal resistance was migration, which Professor Ashim Sarkar thinks amounted to a kind of passive resistance. Active struggle between the santhals and their landlords began about 1910.\n\nAs the barind(barindra) area began to be transformed into a developed agricultural zone, the zamindars of barind began to enhance the rent and curb the rights so far enjoyed by the santhal from 1910 onwards. M.O Carter mentions cases were commonly found in which the lands cultivated by the adhiars, which were previously their occupancy holdings but had been sold up in rent or mortgage sales. This caused friction among zamindars and santhals. The friction took an alarming proportion as early as 1910 when a zamindar of Bulbulchandi tried to enhance the rent. The santhal tenants rose into protest. The gravity of the situation compelled Mr. Vas, the District Magistrate, to interfere and fix the rent. It was in this backdrop of oppression, exploitation and injustice. Jitu santhal of Kochakandahar village of Habibpur began to mobilise the santhals for a widespread movement. During 1926 Jitu became the leader of the santhals by converting them into Hinduism. In the same year 'Jitu's Sanyasi Dal' defied police order to perform a Kali puja to assert its new Hindu status. In September 1928 santhals under Jitu's leadership looted the autumn crop of Sikharpur which had recently been taken away from them in barind region. The District Magistrate and the Superintendent of the Police rushed to the spot with armed police. After much skirmishes, Jitu along with his sixty followers arrested at the hand of the police.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sarkar|first1=Ashim Kumar|title=Changing Profile of a Bengal District Malda:19|date=2008|publisher=Classique Books|location=9, Radhanath Mallik Lane, Kolkata-12|isbn=81-87616-34-2|page=35|edition=First}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2006 the [[Ministry of Panchayati Raj]] named Malda one of the country's 283 [[Poverty in India|most backward districts]] (out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]]).<ref name=brgf/> It is one of the eleven districts in West Bengal currently receiving funds from the [[Backward Regions Grant Fund|Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme]] (BRGF).\nNo notable industry is made here.

{{IPA-bn|mald\u0254\u0266o|}}; is a district in [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. It lies 347&nbsp;km (215 miles) north of [[Kolkata]], the capital of [[West Bengal]]. [[Mango]], [[jute]] and [[silk]] are the most notable products of this district. The special variety of mango, [[Fazli (mango)|Fazli]], produced in this region is popularly known by the name of the district and is exported across the world and internationally acclaimed. The folk culture of [[gombhira]] is a feature of the district, being a unique way of representation of joy and sorrow of daily life of the common people, as well as the unique medium of presentation on national and international matters.  According to the [[National Investigation Agency]] Malda is believed to be a hub of a fake currency racket.<ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Malda-gateway-of-fake-currencies/articleshow/48950199.cms</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/821401/malda-indias-fake-currency-capital-is-feeling-the-demonetisation-pinch|title=Malda, India's fake currency capital, is feeling the demonetisation pinch}}</ref><ref>http://www.oneindia.com/india/why-does-fake-currency-come-from-west-bengal-1788096.html</ref> It is reported that 90 per cent of the fake currency that enters India originates in Malda.<ref>http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/malda-violence-was-bsf-vs-people-claims-mamata-banerjee-1263898</ref><ref>http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/fake-currency-seized-from-malda/1/497978.html</ref>\n\nDistrict headquarters is [[English Bazar]], also known as ''[[English Bazar|Malda]]'', which was once the capital of Bengal. The district maintains the traditions of the past in culture and education. [[Old Malda]], the town which lies just east of the confluence of the [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]] and Kalindi rivers, is part of the English Bazar metropolitan city. The town rose to prominence as the river port of the old capital of [[Pandua, Malda|Pandua]]. During the 18th century it was the seat of prosperous cotton and silk industries. It remains an important distributing centre for rice, [[jute]], and wheat. The area between the historical monument of Jame Masjid (1566) and the landmark of Nimasarai tower across the river Mahananda, constituted a municipality in 1867. Rice, jute, [[legumes]], and [[oilseed]] are the chief crops in the surrounding area. Malda is the largest producer of excellent quality of jute in India. [[Mulberry]] plantations and mango orchards occupy large areas; mango trade and silk manufacture are the main economic activities. The Independence Day of Malda is 17 August 1947.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Gour Era===\n[[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] mentioned a city named ''Gourpura'', which by strong reason may be identified as the city of ''Gouda'', ruins of which are situated in this district. Examples are legion of the relics of a predecessor kingdom being used in the monuments of the successor kingdoms.\n\nIt had been within the limits of ancient ''Gour'' and  ''Pandua'' ([[Pundrabardhana]]). These two cities had been the capital of Bengal in ancient and medieval ages and are equidistant, north and south, from [[English Bazar]] town (once known as Engelzavad established by the British rulers).\n\nThe boundary of Gour was changed in different ages since the 5th century BC, and its name can be found in [[Purana|Puranic]] texts. [[Pundranagara]] was the provincial capital of the [[Maurya Empire]]. Gour and [[Pundravardhana]] formed parts of the Mourya empire as is evinced from the [[inscription]]s, [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]] script on a seal discovered from the ruins of [[Mahasthangarh]] in the [[Bogra District]] of [[Bangladesh]]. [[Xuanzang]]  saw many [[Ashoka]]n [[stupa]]s at [[Pundravardhana]].\n\nThe inscriptions discovered in the district of undivided [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]] and other parts of North Bengal, along with the [[Allahabad]] pillar inscriptions of [[Samudragupta]], clearly indicate that the whole of [[North Bengal]] as far east as [[Kamrup region|Kamrup]] formed a part of the [[Gupta Empire]].\n\nAfter the Guptas in the beginning of 7th century AD [[Sasanka]], the king of Karnasubarna as well as the king of [[Gau\u1e0da region|Gauda]] ruled independently for more than three decades. From the middle of the 8th century to the end of the 11th century the Pala dynasty ruled Bengal, the kings were devoted to [[Buddhism]]. It was during their reign that the Jagadalla Vihara (monastery) in Barindri flourished paralleling with [[Nalanda]], Vikramshila and Devikot.<ref name=\"HANDBOOK\"/>\n\n===Gour Era===\nThe [[Pala empire]] yielded to the emergence of [[Sen Dynasty]], the Sen rulers were orthodox Hindus, and in the habit of moving from place to place within their kingdom. During this time, Buddhism went on the defensive. It eventually disappeared from the demographic map of Bengal. At the time of Lakshman Sen Goud was known as Lakshmanabati. The Sen kings ruled Bengal till [[Muhammad Khilji|Bakhtiyar Khalji]] conquered Bengal in 1204 AD.\n\nThereafter the [[Muslim]] rule started. The name Mal Daha was coined (Mal= riches, Daha= lake). Sultan [[Ilyas Shah]], [[Ilyas Shahi dynasty|Firuz Shah]], [[Sikandar Shah]], [[Raja Ganesha]], [[Alauddin Hussain Shah]] and [[Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah]] are the notable rulers of medieval age. Afghan warrior [[Sher Shah Suri]] invaded [[Gau\u1e0da (city)|Gour]] and was repelled by [[Mughal emperor]] [[Humayun]]. [[Humayun]], loving the [[mango]] of Gour, named the place as Jannatabad (garden of heaven). [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]], [[Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah|Ghiyasuddin]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] army invaded [[Gaur|Gour]] to suppress rebellion several time.  Relics of Muslim structures are present as [[Gaur|Firuz minar]], [[Adina Mosque]] (the largest [[mosque]] of [[South Asia]] then), Qutwali gate etc. During the Mughal rule, the capital was removed to [[Dhaka]] due to a course change of the river [[Ganges]]. [[Muslim]] rule ended in 1757. [[Koch dynasty|Koch]] army invasion increased during the downfall of Gour.<ref name=\"HANDBOOK\"/>\n\n===Post-Gour Era===\n[[File:Jungleterry District Map.jpg|thumb|200px|right|1779 map of the [[Jungle Terry]] District.]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Plassey|war of Palassy]], the [[East India Company|British]] rule started in 1757. The English traders settled in the southern bank of the river [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]]. Some indigo plant chambers, trade centre and offices were established. [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] worked here. But the glorious days were gone.\n[[Image:1907-bengal-sikkim3.jpg|right|thumb|1907 Map of Bengal with Sikkim]]\nThis district was formed out of some portions of outlying areas of [[Purnia]], [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]] and [[Rajshahi District|Rajshahi]] districts in 1813. At the time of Dr. B. Hamilton (1808&ndash;09), the present thanas of [[Gazole Town|Gazole]], Malda, Bamongola, and part of [[Habibpur]] were included in the district of Dinajpur and the thanas of Harischandrapur, Kharba, Ratua, Manikchak, and Kaliachak were included in the district of Purnia. In 1813, in consequence of the prevalence of serious crimes in the Kaliachak and Sahebganj thanas and also on the rivers, a Joint Magistrate and Deputy Collector was appointed at English Bazar, with jurisdiction over a number of police stations centering that place and taken from the two districts. Thus the district of Malda was born. The year 1832 saw the establishment of separate treasury and the year 1859 the posting of a full-fledged magistrate and collector.\n\nUp to 1876, this district formed part of [[Rajshahi Division]] and between 1876 and 1905, it formed part of [[Bhagalpur Division]]. In 1905, it was again transferred to Rajshahi Division and until 1947, Malda remained in this division. During the first [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]] of 1905, this district was attached with the newly created province of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]]. Malda has a history of Indigo movement led by Rafique Mondal. The santhals got insurgent and captured historic [[Adina Mosque]] in support of Jeetu.  Again in August 1947 this district was affected by partition.  Between 12&ndash;15 August 1947, the fate of the district as to which side it should go, to Pakistan or to India, was undecided because the announcement of the partition award of Sir Radcliffe did not make this point clear. During these few days the district was under a Magistrate of [[East Pakistan]]. When the details of the [[Radcliffe Award]] were published, the district came over to [[West Bengal]] on 17 August 1947. However, the sub-division of [[Nawabganj District|Nawabganj]] was severed from Malda and was given to [[East Pakistan]] as a sub-division of the [[Rajshahi]] district.<ref name=\"HANDBOOK\">{{cite book|title=HISTORY AND SCOPE OF THE DISTRICT CENSUS HANDBOOK|page=7|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/19/1906_PART_A_DCHB_MALDAH.pdf|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[latitude]] range is 24\u00b040\u201920\" N to 25\u00b032\u201908\" N, and the [[longitude]] range is 87\u00b045\u201950\" E to 88\u00b028\u201910\" E. The district covers an area of {{convert|3733.66|km2|sqmi|1}}. The total population (as of 2001 Census) was recorded as 3,290,160.\n\nMalda is called the gateway of North [[Bengal]]. It was once the capital of Gour-Banga with its {{convert|3733|km2|sqmi|0}} lay of the land classified into Tal, Diara, and Barind.\n\nTo the south is [[Murshidabad district]], to the north are [[North Dinajpur| North Dinajpur district]] and [[South Dinajpur|South Dinajpur district]]. To the east is the international border with [[Bangladesh]]. To the west is [[Santhal Parganas]] of [[Jharkhand]] and [[Purnea]] of [[Bihar]].\n\n===Malda City===\n{{Main|Malda City}}\n\n'''Malda''', the district headquarters which lends its name to the district, during its early days grew up only near the side of the river Mahananda, and now the place is known as Phulbari. Some of the oldest houses can be found here. The city started to grow since 1925-1930. Now nearly a half-million people live in this city, and it is one of the biggest cities of West Bengal. It is a part of the former Gour. The city is recognised as the English Bazaar municipality. Its notable railway station is named as [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]].\n\n===Mahadipur international border crossing===\n'''Mahadipur international border crossing''' on Malda-[[Rajshahi]] route is at Mahadipur town in Malda district of West Bengal in India.\n\n==Local Newspapers==\nThe first monthly periodicals published from Malda was 'Kusum', edited by Radhesh Chandra Seth, a noted personality of the then Malda. Though the exact date of its first publications is not known, it has been assumed by the informed sources that Kusum was first published in 1890s. In 1896, Radhesh Chandra published two weekly newspapers Gourdoot and Gourbarta.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sarkar|first1=Ashim|title=Changing Profile of Bengal District:Malda 1932-1950|date=2008|publisher=Classique Books|location=9, Radhanath Mallik Lane, Kolkata|isbn=81-87616-34-2|pages=10&ndash;12|edition=First}}</ref> In 1897 Maldaha Samachar edited by Kaliprasanna Chakrabarty began to be published. Maulavi Abdul Ganikhan published 'Malda Akhbar' in 1914. In the same year another periodical Gambhira' edited by Krishna Charan Sarkar was published. Damru, Adina and Minar\u2014three weekly newspaper were published in 1941. The editors were Nanda Gopal Chowdhury, Akbar Munshi and Abdur Rahaman respectively.\n\nThe most important among them was 'Gourdoot' which was first published on 1896 by Radhesh Chandra Seth. But within a short period the publication of the newspaper came to an end as the editor faced a serious financial loss. The 'Gourdoot' again began to be published from 1912 under the editorship of Lalbihari Majumdar. Majumdar was a great scholar and his literary sense was appreciated by Benoy Kumar Sarkar and Radhesh Chandra Seth. In this endeavor the editor was greatly supported by the and financed by Sarat Chandra Roy Chowdhury, Maharaja of Chancal. The Gourdoot was used to be published on Thursday of each week. The paper contained 6 pages and the price is one anna in 1944. The political outlook of the newspaper is pro-congress. Moreover, Lalbihari Majumdar, its editor took a pioneering role in organizing the congress movement in Malda. He has for a long time been the vice-president of the district Congress. The periodical had an implied antipathy towards Gandhian ideology.\n\nIn modern times there was also some local newspapers published in Malda, the most prominent among them are 'Rupantorer Pothe', 'Songbad Smoyiki', Aamader Malda' etc. 'Rupantorere Pothe' is published in every Sunday in each week.\n\n==Popular Movements in Malda==\nThe most important among the popular movement is the one led by Jitu Santhal in 1932. Historians like Tanika Sarkar observes, Jitu's movement was rooted in the rich tradition of tribal struggle in Malda. The early form of santhal resistance was migration, which Professor Ashim Sarkar thinks amounted to a kind of passive resistance. Active struggle between the santhals and their landlords began about 1910.\n\nAs the barind(barindra) area began to be transformed into a developed agricultural zone, the zamindars of barind began to enhance the rent and curb the rights so far enjoyed by the santhal from 1910 onwards. M.O Carter mentions cases were commonly found in which the lands cultivated by the adhiars, which were previously their occupancy holdings but had been sold up in rent or mortgage sales. This caused friction among zamindars and santhals. The friction took an alarming proportion as early as 1910 when a zamindar of Bulbulchandi tried to enhance the rent. The santhal tenants rose into protest. The gravity of the situation compelled Mr. Vas, the District Magistrate, to interfere and fix the rent. It was in this backdrop of oppression, exploitation and injustice. Jitu santhal of Kochakandahar village of Habibpur began to mobilise the santhals for a widespread movement. During 1926 Jitu became the leader of the santhals by converting them into Hinduism. In the same year 'Jitu's Sanyasi Dal' defied police order to perform a Kali puja to assert its new Hindu status. In September 1928 santhals under Jitu's leadership looted the autumn crop of Sikharpur which had recently been taken away from them in barind region. The District Magistrate and the Superintendent of the Police rushed to the spot with armed police. After much skirmishes, Jitu along with his sixty followers arrested at the hand of the police.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sarkar|first1=Ashim Kumar|title=Changing Profile of a Bengal District Malda:19|date=2008|publisher=Classique Books|location=9, Radhanath Mallik Lane, Kolkata-12|isbn=81-87616-34-2|page=35|edition=First}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2006 the [[Ministry of Panchayati Raj]] named Malda one of the country's 283 [[Poverty in India|most backward districts]] (out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]]).<ref name=brgf/> It is one of the eleven districts in West Bengal currently receiving funds from the [[Backward Regions Grant Fund|Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme]] (BRGF).\nNo notable industry is made here.
