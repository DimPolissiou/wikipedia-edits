They also can customize and upgrade their weapons and tools as they level up.\n\nThe Engineer uses a shotgun as his primary weapon and a grenade launcher as his secondary weapon by default. These can later be replaced with an electrical [[submachine gun]] and a mining tool that fires plasma beams respectively. The Engineer uses a platform gun that fires walkable platforms as his utility tool, and a sentry turret as his deployable.\n\nIn most use cases, the Engineer serves to aid the navigation of his teammates with his platform gun and forms up a defense during Glyphid assaults with his sentry turret.\n\nThe Gunner uses a [[minigun]] as his primary weapon and high-caliber [[revolver]] as his secondary weapon. Which can later be replaced with high-caliber cannons and burst-fire [[submachine gun]] respectively. The Gunner uses a zipline gun that fires anchored ziplines as his utility tool, and a shield generator that generates a protective shield bubble as his deployable.\n\nIn most use cases, the Gunner contributes a significant amount of firepower to the team, able to kill enemies before they do significant harm on his teammates. His zipline gun makes up for his lack of mobility and allows the team to traverse difficult terrains such as chasms and cliffs. His shield generator provides protection for his team during Glyphid assaults.\n\nThe Driller uses a [[flamethrower]] as his primary weapon and semi-automatic [[pistol]] as his secondary weapon. These can later be replaced with freeze cannon and plasma pistol respectively. The Driller uses handheld power drills to dig through terrain much faster than the regular pickaxe does as his utility tool, and a [[satchel charge]] that carves out a large portion of terrain, or kills enemies in its blast as his deployable.\n\nIn most use cases, the Driller allows the team to navigate through blocked paths with ease, or forms shortcuts with the help of his power drills, which is especially useful when returning to escape pod in time. However, the Driller has limited capabilities of self-defense, even more so at long range, so care should be exercised in his protection, especially during Glyphid assaults or escape.\n\nThe Scout uses an assault rifle as his primary weapon and double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun as his secondary weapon. Which can later be replaced with semi-automatic rifle based on [[M1 Garand]] and dual-wield [[machine pistol]]s respectively. The Scout uses grappling gun to navigate around much faster as his utility tool, and flare gun to fire bright, long-lasting flares anchored to the terrain as his deployable.\n\nIn most use cases, the Scout moves ahead of the team with ease with his grappling gun for reconnaissance and aids his team by greatly illuminating the terrain with his flare gun, uncovering hidden ore veins and dangers. The Scout is also able to mine difficult-to-reach ores or items with ease and safety, especially with Engineer's platform. However, the Scout needs to be careful to not overextend due to his limited self-defense capabilities. His weapons heavily favors a hit-and-run tactic by kiting around and hitting enemies without them being able to retaliate.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Early Access version of ''Deep Rock Galactic'' was well received by critics, who praised the game's atmosphere and challenging levels.

Set in 1980s [[Zimbabwe]], the story follows white teenager Robert Jacklin at a prestigious boarding school as he confronts bullying, anti-black racism, his own accountability as well as the political instability of the time. The novel received favourable reviews and won the 2010 [[Costa Book Award]] for Children's Book, the 2011 [[Branford Boase Award]] and the 2011 [[UKLA Book Award]].

He is the son of a British intellectual attached to the British Embassy. Robert befriends Nelson Ndube, one of the few black pupils at the school, but eventually turns to the white elite of the school instead in an effort to find safety and acceptances. Many of the white students, particularly Ivan Hascott, are racist bullies who are still angered that the country's white minority lost power to the its black majority after the recent civil war. Robert wrestles with his conscience while becoming drawn into their ideology and practices. Ivan's family has suffered during [[Robert Mugabe]]'s rise to power, and Ivan pressures Robert into joining his quest for revenge on black Africans.

It was also shortlisted for the 2010 [[Booktrust Teenage Prize]] and the 2011 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn 1983, thirteen-year-old Robert Jacklin arrives from England at Haven School, an elite boys' boarding school in Zimbabwe. He is the son of a British intellectual attached to the British Embassy. Robert befriends Nelson Ndube, one of the few black pupils at the school, but eventually turns to the white elite of the school instead in an effort to find safety and acceptances. Many of the white students, particularly Ivan Hascott, are racist bullies who are still angered that the country's white minority lost power to the its black majority after the recent civil war. Robert wrestles with his conscience while becoming drawn into their ideology and practices. Ivan's family has suffered during [[Robert Mugabe]]'s rise to power, and pressures Robert into joining his quest for revenge on black Africans. Robert becomes disturbed by Ivan's increasingly violent behavior.\n\n==Publication==\n''Out of Shadows'' was first published in paperback format in the United Kingdom by [[Andersen Press]] on 28 January 2010.<ref name=\"Penguin\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/108/1086142/out-of-shadows/9781849390484.html |title=Out of Shadows |website=[[Penguin Books UK]] |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn a starred review, ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called the novel a \"first-rate, surprisingly believable thriller\" and praised Wallace's \"mastery\" in portraying race relations in post-war Zimbabwe.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jason-wallace/out-shadows/ |title=Out of Shadows by Jason Wallace |date=7 April 2011 |website=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' gave the novel a favourable review, writing, \"Racial conflict, corruption, and the cycle of abuse are conveyed with authenticity in this uncomfortable, unvarnished story.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8234-2342-2 |title=Children's Book Review: Out Of Shadows by Jason Wallace |date=13 June 2011 |website=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* 2010 [[Costa Book Award]] for Children's Book, winner<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/debut-writer-jason-wallace-wins-costa-book-award-for-robert-mugabe-novel-2175750.html |title=Debut writer Jason Wallace wins Costa book award for Robert Mugabe novel |last=Noah |first=Sherna |date=4 January 2011 |website=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/04/costa-book-awards |title=Edmund de Waal leads Costa book awards finalists |last=Brown |first=Mark |date=4 January 2011 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8239564/Costa-Book-Awards-2010-the-winning-books.html |title=Costa Book Awards 2010: the winning books |date=5 January 2011 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n* 2011 [[Branford Boase Award]], winner<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/jason-wallace-wins-branford-boase |title=Jason Wallace wins Branford Boase |last=Horn |first=Caroline |date=7 July 2011 |website=[[The Bookseller]] |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n* 2011 [[UKLA Book Award]], winner<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ukla.org/resources/details/ukla-book-award-winners-2011 |title=UKLA Book Award 2011 Winners |website=[[United Kingdom Literacy Association]] |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n* 2010 [[Booktrust Teenage Prize]], shortlist<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.foyles.co.uk/news/unhooking-the-moon-wins-booktrust-teenage-prize |title=Unhooking the Moon wins Booktrust Teenage Prize |date=2 November 2010 |website=[[Foyles Bookstore|Foyles]] |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n* 2011 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]], shortlist<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/23/patrick-ness-carnegie-medal-libraries |title=Patrick Ness accepts Carnegie medal with fierce defence of libraries |last=Pauli |first=Michelle |date=23 June 2011 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2010 British novels]]\n[[Category:2010 children's books]]\n[[Category:2010 debut novels]]\n[[Category:Andersen Press books]]\n[[Category:British children's novels]]\n[[Category:British historical novels]]\n[[Category:British young adult novels]]\n[[Category:Children's historical novels]]\n[[Category:Costa Book Award-winning works]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1983]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Zimbabwe]]\n[[Category:Novels about bullying]]\n[[Category:Novels about race and ethnicity]]\n[[Category:Novels about racism]]\n[[Category:Novels set in schools]]\n[[Category:Novels set in the 1980s]]\n\n{{1980s-child-hist-novel-stub}}\n", "name_user": "I grieve in stereo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSynopsis", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Shadows"}

The company retains a focus on China in its news broadcasts, and frequently covers topics that are censored in Mainland China. Its mission is to \"promote uncensored information on China; to restore and promote traditional Chinese culture; and to facilitate mutual understanding between the East and West\".<ref>https://ntdtv.org/en/aboutus.html</ref>\n\n==History==\nNTD was founded in 2001 by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners, with its mission being to offer \"uncensored news\" about China that [[state-controlled media]] would not cover. The station has a regular focus on the promotion of traditional [[Chinese culture]], and devotes extensive news coverage to alleged [[Chinese human rights issues]]. It takes a critical stance on what it considers to be abuses of power by the [[Communist Party of China]].<ref>[http://english.ntdtv.com NTD]</ref>\n\nSince its founding, NTD has expanded to include English, Spanish, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], French, Russian, [[Persian language|Farsi]], [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] and several other language editions. Its content offerings include news and analysis, arts and culture, travel, entertainment news, health and lifestyle, and children's programming.<ref>[http://english.ntdtv.com NTD]</ref>\n\nThe station's critical reporting on the [[Communist Party of China]] has prompted censorship by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]. NTD also alleged that the Chinese government interfered with their reporting and business operations.\n\nNTD began broadcasting via satellite in North America in February 2002. At present, the station's satellite coverage reaches Asia, Europe, and Australia in several languages.\n\nNTD, along with ''[[The Epoch Times]]'' and [[Sound of Hope]], was founded by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners who had emigrated to the West. Many of its staff are Falun Gong adherents who volunteer their time and services. In an interview with the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', president Zhong Lee stated that the company's original purpose was to speak out against the Chinese government's [[persecution of Falun Gong]], but that it \"can also play a big role pushing [[democracy in China]].\"<ref name=WSJ-11-15-2007>Chen, Kathy [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119508926438693540 Chinese Dissidents Take On Beijing Via Media Empire] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' November 15, 2007</ref> The station covers several issues that are taboo in Mainland China, such as official corruption and public health scares, and also provides a platform for Chinese human rights and pro-democracy activists.<ref name=WSJ-11-15-2007/>\n\nThe station's broadcasts are capable of reaching 200 million viewers globally, including 50 million in mainland China, according to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref name=wsj>{{cite news |work=Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111101769524481719 |date=March 17, 2005 |title= Not a Pretty Dish }}</ref>\n\nNew Tang Dynasty's revenues in 2017 were $18 million, more than double its $7.4 million revenues in 2016, according to reports from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/223850071|title=Universal Communications Network Inc - Nonprofit Explorer|last=ProPublica|first=Mike Tigas, Sisi Wei, Ken Schwencke, Brandon Roberts, Alec Glassford|website=ProPublica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-qanon-impending-judgment-day-behind-facebook-fueled-rise-epoch-n1044121|title=Trump, QAnon and an impending judgment day: Behind the Facebook-fueled rise of The Epoch Times|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n===Television===\n[[File:NTDTV in Stockholm.JPG|thumb|NTDTV journalist broadcasting from the Royal Swedish Academy in Stockholm, Sweden, at the announcement of [[Mo Yan]] as 2012 Nobel laureate in literature]]\nNTD broadcasts 24/7, and offers a variety of original and syndicated programming, including news, arts and culture shows, travel, entertainment news, health and lifestyle, and children's programing.<ref>[http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&sl=zh-TW&u=http://www.ntdtv.com/xtr/b5/prog300new.html&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dntdtv%26hl%3Den%26prmd%3Divns&rurl=translate.google.com&twu=1&usg=ALkJrhh4QaQxV3aUa4dnTrjchg3ZAK6eaw NTD]</ref>\n\nThe station is best known for its news and analysis segments, which typically contain criticism of the Chinese government, particularly over human rights abuses, including the persecution of [[Falun Gong]].\n\nThe ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that the station broke news of [[SARS]] in 2003, three weeks before the Chinese government admitted publicly that there was an epidemic.

At present, the station's satellite coverage reaches Asia, Europe, and Australia in several languages.\n\nNTD, along with ''[[The Epoch Times]]'' and [[Sound of Hope]], was founded by [[Falun Gong]] practitioners who had emigrated to the West. Many of its staff are Falun Gong adherents who volunteer their time and services.

Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

Darwin was well prepared to compare this to [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]]'s \"warring of the species\" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the \"final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes\", so that \"One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones.\"<ref name=JvW /><ref name=\"134e\">{{cite web | title = Darwin transmutation notebook D pp. 134e\u2013135e | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&pageseq=112 | accessdate = 4 June 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120718105154/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&pageseq=112 | archivedate = 18 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> This would result in the formation of new species.<ref name=JvW /><ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 264\u2013265}}<br />{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 385\u2013388}}<br />{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1556&viewtype=text&pageseq=39 7]}}</ref> As he later wrote in his ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|Autobiography]]''''':'''\n\n{{Quote|In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed.

[[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was still firmly against the transmutation of species. [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], \"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a \"big book on species\" titled ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]'', which was to include his \"note on Man\". He continued his researches, [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|obtaining information]] and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in [[Borneo]]. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; \"Theory applied to Races of Man\", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of ''Natural Selection'', which omitted [[human evolution|human origins]] and [[sexual selection]]. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, \"so surrounded with prejudices\", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that \"I go much further than you.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 412\u2013441, 457\u2013458, 462\u2013463}}<br />{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=283\u2013284, 290\u2013292, 295}}</ref>\n\nDarwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection.

Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave [[John Edmonstone]], whom he long recalled as \"a very pleasant and intelligent man\", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the ''Beagle'' voyage.{{sfn|Browne|1995|pp=196\u2013198, 240}} These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans.

In ''The Descent of Man'', Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, \"the noblest part of our nature\", and factors such as education could be more important.

Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat-dog capitalism, [[colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included \"dependence of one being on another\"; thus [[pacifism|pacifists]], socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paul|2003|pp=223\u2013225}}</ref> Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bannister|1989}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in \"positive eugenics\". During the \"[[Eclipse of Darwinism]]\", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. Negative eugenics to remove the \"feebleminded\" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and [[eugenics in the United States]] introduced [[compulsory sterilisation]] laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, [[Nazi eugenics]] brought the field into disrepute.{{Ref label|H|VIII|2}}\n\nThe term \"[[Social Darwinism]]\" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by [[Richard Hofstadter]] to attack the [[laissez-faire conservatism]] of those like [[William Graham Sumner]] who opposed reform and socialism.

It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=14&itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text 1]}}</ref> In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: \"it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1874|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=13&itemID=F944&viewtype=text vi]}}</ref>\n\n'''{{small|V}}.''' {{Note label|E|V|none}} See, for example, WILLA volume 4, ''[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall95/DeSimone.html Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Feminization of Education]'' by Deborah M.

His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]], nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt.

Darwin was well prepared to compare this to [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle]]'s \"warring of the species\" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the \"final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes\", so that \"One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones.\"<ref name=JvW /><ref name=\"134e\">{{cite web | title = Darwin transmutation notebook D pp. 134e\u2013135e | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&pageseq=112 | accessdate = 4 June 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120718105154/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=CUL-DAR123.-&pageseq=112 | archivedate = 18 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> This would result in the formation of new species.<ref name=JvW /><ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 264\u2013265}}<br />{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 385\u2013388}}<br />{{Harvnb|Darwin|1842|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1556&viewtype=text&pageseq=39 7]}}</ref> As he later wrote in his ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|Autobiography]]''''':'''\n\n{{Quote|In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed.

[[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was still firmly against the transmutation of species. [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], \"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a \"big book on species\" titled ''[[Natural Selection (manuscript)|Natural Selection]]'', which was to include his \"note on Man\". He continued his researches, [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|obtaining information]] and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in [[Borneo]]. In mid-1857 he added a section heading; \"Theory applied to Races of Man\", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of ''Natural Selection'', which omitted [[human evolution|human origins]] and [[sexual selection]]. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, \"so surrounded with prejudices\", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that \"I go much further than you.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 412\u2013441, 457\u2013458, 462\u2013463}}<br />{{harvnb | Desmond |Moore | 2009 | pp=283\u2013284, 290\u2013292, 295}}</ref>\n\nDarwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection.

When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a \"caste\" of \"those who are naturally gifted\", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it \"the sole feasible, yet I fear [[utopian]], plan of procedure in improving the human race\", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=556\u2013557, 572, 598}}<br />{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.1&pageseq=180 167\u2013173], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.2&pageseq=419 402\u2013403]}}<br />{{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|title=Correspondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin|accessdate=8 November 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102150434/http://galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|archivedate=2 January 2009}}</ref> Francis Galton named this field of study \"[[eugenics]]\" in 1883.{{Ref label|H|VIII|1}} After Darwin's death, his theories were cited to promote eugenic policies that went against his humanitarian principles.<ref name=barta/>\n\n==Evolutionary social movements==\n[[File:VanityFair-Darwin2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Full length portrait of a very thin white bearded Darwin, seated but leaning eagerly forward and smiling.|[[Caricatures of Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory in 19th-century England|Caricature of Darwin]] from 1871 ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'']]\n{{Further|Darwinism|Eugenics|Social Darwinism}}\nDarwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.\n\n[[Thomas Malthus]] had argued that [[Malthusian catastrophe|population growth beyond resources]] was ordained by God to get humans to [[Protestant work ethic|work productively]] and show restraint in getting families; this was used in the 1830s to justify [[workhouse]]s and [[laissez-faire economics]].<ref name=wm>{{harvnb|Wilkins|1997}}<br />{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}</ref> Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and [[Herbert Spencer]]'s 1851 book ''Social Statics'' based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sweet|2004}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the ''Origin'' was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term ''[[Darwinism]]'' was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's \"[[survival of the fittest]]\" as free-market progress, and [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[polygenism|polygenistic]] ideas of [[Ernst Haeckel#Polygenism and racial theory|human development]]. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat-dog capitalism, [[colonialism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included \"dependence of one being on another\"; thus [[pacifism|pacifists]], socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paul|2003|pp=223\u2013225}}</ref> Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bannister|1989}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in \"positive eugenics\". During the \"[[Eclipse of Darwinism]]\", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. Negative eugenics to remove the \"feebleminded\" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and [[eugenics in the United States]] introduced [[compulsory sterilisation]] laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, [[Nazi eugenics]] brought the field into disrepute.{{Ref label|H|VIII|2}}\n\nThe term \"[[Social Darwinism]]\" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by [[Richard Hofstadter]] to attack the [[laissez-faire conservatism]] of those like [[William Graham Sumner]] who opposed reform and socialism.

While ''On the Origin of Species'' dominates perceptions of his work, ''The Descent of Man'' and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' had considerable impact, and his books on plants including ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]'' were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on ''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Balfour|1882}}<br />{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}<br />{{Harvnb|Anonymous|1882}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Brummitt|first = R.
