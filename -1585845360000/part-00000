{"title_page": "List of rulers of Croatia", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\nThis is a complete '''list of rulers of Croatia''' under domestic ethnic and elected dynasties during the [[Croatian Kingdom (disambiguation)|Croatian Kingdom]] (925\u20131918). This article follows the monarch's title number according to Hungarian succession for convenience. For example, the Hungarian monarch B\u00e9la IV is according to Croatian succession correctly titled B\u00e9la III. This is because Hungarians had a king named B\u00e9la prior to the incorporation of Croatia under the Hungarian Crown but the Croats did not.\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|Origin hypotheses of the Croats}}The details of the arrival of the [[Croats]] are scarcely documented. Around 626, Croats migrated from [[White Croatia]] (around what is now [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]) at the invitation of [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]]. According to a legend recorded in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', the Croats came to their present region under the leadership of five brothers called Kloukas, Lobelos, Kosentzis, Mouchlo, Chrobatos and two sisters called Touga and Bouga.\n\nIt is theorized that one of the brothers called Chrobatos (''Hrvat'') gave the name for Croats (''Hrvati'') as a whole, although mainstream historians dismiss this as not verifiable. The Croats started gradually converting to Christianity under the rule of [[Porga of Croatia|Porga]] in the 7th century.\n\n== Dukes of Pannonia (8th century\u2013896) ==\n{{see also|Duchy of Pannonian Croatia}}\n\nAlso called Pannonian Croatia in Croatian historiography. Croatian sources claim it was a Croatian duchy while others claim it was an unspecified Slavic duchy with its inhabitants called simply \"Slavs\" (lat. ''Sclavi'').\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"  width=100%\n! width=5%  | Portrait\n! width=15% | Name\n! width=10% | Reign start \n! width=10% | Reign end\n! width=25% | Notes\n|-\n|  ||'''[[Vojnomir of Pannonian Croatia|Vojnomir]]'''|| c. 791 || c. 810 ||\n|-\n| ||'''[[Ljudevit]]'''||{{Circa|810}}|| c. 823 ||align=\"left\"|\n|-\n|  ||'''[[Ratimir, Duke of Lower Pannonia|Ratimir]]'''|| 829 || 838 ||\n|-\n|  ||'''[[Braslav, Duke of Lower Pannonia|Braslav]]'''|| 880 || c. 896 || \n|- \n|}\n\n== Dukes of Dalmatian Croatia (7th century\u2013925) ==\n{{see also|Duchy of Croatia}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=100%\n! width=5%  | Portrait\n! width=15% | Name\n! width=10% | Reign start \n! width=10% | Reign end\n! width=25% | Notes\n|-\n|  ||'''[[Vi\u0161eslav of Croatia|Vi\u0161eslav]]'''|| c. 785 || c. 802 || align=\"left\" |Vi\u0161eslav left behind a [[baptismal font]], surviving to this day, which mentioned him being a duke (although duke of an unspecified region).

This article follows the monarch's title number according to Hungarian succession for convenience. For example, the Hungarian monarch B\u00e9la IV is according to Croatian succession correctly titled B\u00e9la III. This is because Hungarians had a king named B\u00e9la prior to the incorporation of Croatia under the Hungarian Crown but the Croats did not.\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|Origin hypotheses of the Croats}}The details of the arrival of the [[Croats]] are scarcely documented. Around 626, Croats migrated from [[White Croatia]] (around what is now [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]) at the invitation of [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]]. According to a legend recorded in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', the Croats came to their present region under the leadership of five brothers called Kloukas, Lobelos, Kosentzis, Mouchlo, Chrobatos and two sisters called Touga and Bouga.\n\nIt is theorized that one of the brothers called Chrobatos (''Hrvat'') gave the name for Croats (''Hrvati'') as a whole, although mainstream historians dismiss this as not verifiable. The Croats started gradually converting to Christianity under the rule of [[Porga of Croatia|Porga]] in the 7th century.\n\n== Dukes of Pannonia (8th century\u2013896) ==\n{{see also|Duchy of Pannonian Croatia}}\n\nAlso called Pannonian Croatia in Croatian historiography.

The Goddess movement has found voice in various films and self-published media, such as the [[Women and Spirituality: The Goddess Trilogy|''Women and Spirituality'']] trilogy made by Donna Read for the [[National Film Board of Canada]].\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Seal of Inanna, 2350-2150 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] [[cylinder seal]] depicting the goddess [[Inanna]] resting her foot on the back of a lion while [[Ninshubur]] stands in front of her paying obeisance, c. 2334\u20132154 BC]]\n\nAssociated terms sometimes used within the movement include the following:\n\n*'''Goddesses''' refers to a local or specific deities linked clearly to a particular culture and often to particular aspects, attributes and powers (for example: the [[Mesopotamia]]n goddess [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]]; [[Athena]]; or [[Hindu]] goddesses like [[Sarasvati]], the goddess of [[learning]], [[poetry]], music, [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]] and [[wisdom]]; and [[Lakshmi]] goddess of wealth and [[sovereignty]]).\n*'''The Goddess''' or '''the Great Goddess''' is a female deity that is regarded as primary. Such a religious system existed historically in many cultures, though not under the same names and not necessarily with the same traits. If there is a male god, he often seen as her equal, or his powers may be seen as deriving from her.<ref>{{cite book|title=Matriarchal Mythology in Former Times and Today (pamphlet)|last=G\u00f6ttner-Abendroth|first=Heide|date=1987|publisher=Crossing Press|ref=harv|author-link=Heide G\u00f6ttner-Abendroth}}</ref> These terms are ''not'' usually understood to refer a single deity that is identical across cultures but rather a concept common in many ancient cultures, which those in the Goddess movement want to restore.<ref name=\"christ1997\" /> When Goddess is spoken of as a personal guardian, as in 'my Goddess' it means 'my worldview in Goddess spirituality.'\n*'''Goddess Spirituality''' is sometimes used as a synonym for Goddess Movement and sometimes as the spiritual practice that is part of the Goddess movement.<ref name=\":6\" /> It could also refer to the Goddess Movement's ethos, particularly when used to construct Christianity as the diametrical opposite of the Goddess.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christian Goddess Spirituality: Enchanting Christianity|last=Beavis|first=Mary Ann|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138936881|location=New York|pages=29}}</ref> Here, the term becomes a distinguishing concept that sets the movement apart from Christianity with little room for overlap.\n*'''Goddessing''' is a recent contribution to Goddess vocabulary, possibly derived from the British journal of the same name, following from [[Mary Daly]]'s suggestion that deity is too dynamic, too much in process and changing continually, to be a noun, and should better be spoken as a verb (Daly 1973). Goddessing may also mean Goddess culture, Goddess way of life, Goddess practice, or 'my goddessing' as in my individual interpretation and experience of Goddess.\n*'''Priestess''' refers to women who dedicate themselves to one or more goddesses. It may or may not include leadership of a group, and it may or may not include legal ordination. The analogous term for men is \"priest.\" However, not everyone who dedicates themselves to the Goddess or goddesses calls themselves a priestess (or priest).\n*'''[[Thealogy]]''' is a term whose first use in the context of feminist analysis of religion and discussion of Goddess is usually credited to Naomi Goldenberg, who used the term in her book ''Changing of the Gods''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/changingofgodsfe00gold|url-access=registration|title=Changing of the Gods: Feminism & the End of Traditional Religions|last=Goldenberg|first=Naomi|date=1979|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0-8070-1111-8|location=Boston|pp=[https://archive.org/details/changingofgodsfe00gold/page/96 96]\u201399|access-date=2015-10-30}}</ref> It substitutes the Greek feminine prefix \"thea-\" for the supposedly generic use of the Greek masculine prefix \"theo-\".

Within the Goddess community, members generally consider it proper to capitalize the word \"Goddess\", but not necessary when generic references are made, as in the word \"goddesses\".\n\n== Use of mythological materials ==\nParticipants in the Goddess movement often invoke myths.

Reinterpretation becomes necessary because myths from religions that included goddesses, those after the [[Bronze Age]], including Greek and Roman mythology, are believed to have a patriarchal bias.

Starhawk speaks of the Goddess as immanent (infusing all of nature) but sometimes also simultaneously transcendent (existing independently of the material world).<ref name=Starhawk1987/> Many Goddess authors agree and also describe Goddess as, at one and the same time, immanently pantheistic and panentheistic. The former means that Goddess flows into and through each individual aspect of nature\u2014each tree, blade of grass, human, animal, planet; the latter means that all exist within the Goddess.<ref name=christ1997/><ref name=Starhawk1999/>\n\nStarhawk also speaks of the Goddess as both a psychological symbol and \"manifest reality. She exists ''and'' we create Her\" (italics hers).<ref>{{harvnb|Starhawk|1999|p=77}}</ref>  Carol P. Christ (2003), describes what she sees as similarities between Goddess theology and [[process theology]], and suggests that Goddess theologians adopt more of the process viewpoint.\n\n=== Deity vs metaphor ===\nThe theological variations that characterize the Goddess movement can also be classified into two: the views that describe the Goddess as a metaphor and those that consider the Goddess as a deity. The former emerged from among Jewish and Christian adherents and maintains that the Goddess serves as the means of talking about, imagining, or relating to the divine and this is demonstrated in the push to recover the feminine face of God based on scriptural and historical sources.<ref name=\":3\" /> On the other hand, the theology that the Goddess is a deity, with importantly and unchangeably female persona, emerged out of the feminists who came from polytheistic faiths such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Native American, and traditional African religions.<ref name=\":3\" /> The goddesses in this theology are rarely understood as metaphors or images since they have distinct individual features and that worshippers can interact with their suprahuman personages or symbols.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Ethics ==\n[[File:Kaliposter1940s.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Modern, western depiction of the Hindu goddess [[Kali]], shown standing atop [[Shiva]], wearing a necklace of severed heads, in front of a fiery background]]\n\nAlthough the Goddess movement has no specific code of behavior, there are commonly held tenets and concepts within the movement that form a basis for ethical behavior.<ref>{{cite web |last=Christ |first=Carol P. |title=Musings on the Goddess and Her Cultural Despisers--Provoked by Naomi Goldenberg |date=2005 |url=http://www.belili.org/marija/carol_christ.html |access-date=January 25, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215224641/http://www.belili.org/marija/carol_christ.html |archive-date=December 15, 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> Those participants in Goddess spirituality who define themselves as Wiccan, usually follow what is known as the [[Wiccan Rede]]: \" 'An it harm none, do what ye will\", (\"an\" being an archaic English word understood to mean \"if\", or \"as long as\"). Many also believe in the [[Threefold Law]], which states that \"what you send (or do), returns three times over\".<ref name=Starhawk1999/> Some traditions believe that this means it will be returned to the sender three times, or in a portion three times in volume, while others say it will instead be returned to the sender on three levels of being\u2014physical, mental, and spiritual. Still others postulate that the number \"three\" is symbolic, meant to indicate a magnified karmic result for one's actions.\n\nSome people in the Goddess movement honor the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] of Maiden, Mother, and Crone. The Maiden aspect of the Goddess shows women how to be independent and strong; the Mother aspect shows women how to be nurturing; and the Crone aspect shows that respecting elders is important and focuses on wisdom, change, and transformation.<ref name=Starhawk1999/>\n\nBecause the Crone aspect of the Goddess is understood by some to be destructive at times, some consider it to contain both positive and negative imagery and to present an ethical quandary. The Hindu Goddess [[Kali]], or Kali Ma, is often seen as an example of the Crone aspect. The concept is that the corrective force in a Dark Age must be a righteously directed dark force. Thus, to combat the [[demons]] of ignorance, ego, anger, etc., the darker aspect manifests. Later on, even her fierce image softens in the love of her devotees. Her duality is easily reconciled with the monism of Hinduism, which claims to understand the fundamental unity of truth as being impersonal and stratified in an ego-knotted existence (such as the human condition), and thus to the evil or unrighteous she is destruction personified and to the loving and moral devotee she is nothing but the love of the mother.<ref name=Jayran2000/>\n\nOther Goddess ethical beliefs are that one should not harm the interconnected web of life, and that peace and partnership should be the goals, rather than war and domination. According to Goddess theologian [[Carol P. Christ]] the following are ethical touchstones:\n\n{{quote|\"Nurture life; Walk in love and beauty; Trust the knowledge that comes through the body; Speak the truth about conflict, pain, and suffering; Take only what you need; Think about the consequences of your actions for seven generations; Approach the taking of life with great restraint; Practice great generosity; Repair the web.\"<ref name=christ1997/>}}\n\n== Prehistoric cultures ==\n[[File:Willendorf-Venus-1468.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|The famous [[Venus of Willendorf]] (circa 28,000-25,000 B.C.)]]\n{{Main|Matriarchal religion}}\n\nThe Goddess movement draws some of its inspiration from the work of archaeologists such as [[Marija Gimbutas]],<ref name=Gimbuta1982>{{cite book |last=Gimbutas |first=Marija |title=The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe, 6500-3500 B.C.: Myths and Cult Images |publisher=University of California Press |date=1982 |orig-year=1974 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zKFFOoPlyjIC |isbn=978-0-5202-5398-8 |ref=harv |access-date=2015-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109063144/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zKFFOoPlyjIC |archive-date=2016-01-09 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=Gimbutas2001>{{cite book |last=Gimbutas |first=Marija |title=The Language of the Goddess: Unearthing the Hidden Symbols of Western Civilization |publisher=Thames & Hudson |date=2001 |orig-year=1989 |isbn=978-0-5002-8249-6 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=Mellaart>{{cite book |title=Catal-huyuk.

She presented a theory of the transformation of prehistoric cultures in which the local goddess was primary and the male god, if any, derived his power from the goddess. In what she terms the \"Downfall\", which occurred at varying times throughout a multitude of cultures, the gods overcame the goddesses and made them subservient.<ref>{{harvnb|G\u00f6ttner-Abendroth|1987}}</ref>\n\nG\u00f6ttner-Abendroth's terminology is [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]]. The term \"[[matriarchy]]\" to describe these cultures has been rejected by many Goddess-movement scholars, especially those in North America, because it implies female domination as the reverse of the male domination present in patriarchy. These scholars make the point that such a reversal was not the case; rather these prehistoric cultures were egalitarian and had a social structure that included [[matrilineality]] - inheritance of assets and parentage traced through the maternal line.<ref name=christ1997/><ref name=Gimbutas2001/><ref>{{cite web |last=Dashu |first=Max |title=Knocking Down Straw Dolls: A critique of Cynthia Eller's 'The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory' |website=Suppressed Histories |url=http://www.suppressedhistories.net/articles/eller.html |access-date=December 30, 2005 |date=2000 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203215431/http://www.suppressedhistories.net/articles/eller.html |archivedate=December 3, 2005 }}</ref><ref name=Eisler>{{cite book |last=Eisler |first=Riane |title=The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |date=2011 |orig-year=1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-nWXwQzH3cC |isbn=978-0-0620-4630-7 |access-date=2015-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905122958/https://books.google.com/books?id=U-nWXwQzH3cC |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lerner |first=Gerda |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1986 |url=https://archive.org/details/creationofpatria0000lern |url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-1950-5185-8 |access-date=2015-10-30 }}</ref> According to [[Riane Eisler]], cultures in which women and men shared power, and which worshiped female deities, were more peaceful than the patriarchal societies that followed.\n\nIan Hodder's reinterpretation of Gimbutas<ref name=Gimbuta1982/> and Mellaart's works<ref name=Mellaart/> disputes the existence of \"matriarchal\" or \"matrifocal\" cultures, as do some other archaeologists and historians in this field.<ref name=Eller/><ref>{{cite book |last=Meskell |first=Lynn |title=Twin Peaks: The Archaeologies of \u00c7atalh\u00f6yuk |editor-last=Goodison |editor-first=Lucy |editor-first2=Christine |editor-last2=Morris |work=Ancient Goddesses |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-2991-6320-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-link1=Ruth Tringham |last1=Tringham |first1=Ruth |last2=Conkey |first2=Margaret |title=Rethinking Figurines: A Critical View from Archaeology of Gimbutas, the 'Goddess' and Popular Culture |editor-last=Goodison |editor-first=Lucy |editor-first2=Christine |editor-last2=Morris |work=Ancient Goddesses |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-2991-6320-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |title=The Pagan Religions in the Ancient British Isles |publisher=Wiley |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-6311-8946-6}}</ref> However, mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] compared the importance of Gimbutas' output to the historical importance of the [[Rosetta Stone]] in deciphering [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].

One way to characterize the central male-female divine dyad in Wicca is to say that it's a duotheistic religion with a theology based on the divine gender polarity of male and female.\n\nThe existence of witchcraft as the remnants of an old pagan religion as late as the [[early Modern Age]] was first suggested to a wide readership by [[Margaret Murray]]'s books, ''The Witch Cult in Western Europe'', ''The God of the Witches'' (1933) and ''The Divine King in England''. Her works have since been largely discredited by other scholars but have left a feminist legacy upon Wiccan culture.\n\n[[File:Diane de Versailles Leochares.jpg|thumb|Roman copy of a Greek statue by [[Leochares]] of the goddess [[Artemis]], who was known to the Romans as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]]]\n\nWicca and [[Neopaganism]], and to some extent the Goddess movement, were influenced by 19th-century occultism, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Greer |first=Mary K. |title=Women of the Golden Dawn |publisher=Park Street Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-8928-1516-6}}</ref> and romantic nature movements in which both male and female were valued and honored as sacred, in contrast to and perhaps in reaction to mainstream Christian spirituality. Such views are described, for example, in the work of [[Robert Graves]], especially ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (the origin of the neopagan 'Triple Goddess' concept) and ''Mammon and the Black Goddess''.\n\nWicca was also heavily influenced by the ideas of alchemic symbolism, which emphasized the essential complementary polarity of male and female, and that characterized that basic duality or gender polarity as a partnership of the solar (male) and the lunar (female). In Wicca the moon is the symbol of the Goddess and the sun is the symbol of the God; and the central liturgical mystery and ritual act is \"The Great Rite\" or Hieros Gamos, which is a symbolic union of the God and the Goddess, as the primal male and female powers of the cosmos. In alchemy this was known as \"the alchemical wedding\" of the sun and the moon. In a parallel vein, traditional Wicca also draws heavily upon the Western Hermetic Tradition and its roots in the kabbalistic Tree of Life; where the twin pillars of masculine and feminine divine forces are joined by a Middle Pillar that encompasses and transcends both male and female. These \"twin pillars\" as they are shown in tarot decks are analogous to Valiente's depiction of the God and the Goddess as the two \"mystical pillars.\" In this emphasis on the feminine as the equal and complementary polar opposite of the masculine, Wicca echoes not only kabbalistic sources but also the polarity of yin and yang\u2014feminine and masculine\u2014in Taoism.\n\n{{quote|The Dianic view is that separatism, in a world where gender roles were once strictly defined, is sometimes considered dangerous because it challenges what they see as patriarchal assumptions of Western culture.<ref name=Budapest1980/>}}\n\nThere are, however, Wiccan groups that do not subscribe to the male-female dualism of the divine. For instance, there is the case of the Budapest Dianics. Although these retained many Wiccan rituals and symbols, they only used female imagery and created a creation myth that eliminated the need for the male.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religion and American Cultures: An Encyclopedia of Traditions|last=Laderman|first=Gary|last2=Leon|first2=Luis|publisher=ABC_CLIO|year=2003|isbn=157607238X|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=243}}</ref> While Wiccans also accept male members,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The SAGE Handbook of the Sociology of Religion|last=Beckford|first=James|last2=Demarath|publisher=Jay|year=2007|isbn=9781412911955|location=London|pages=576}}</ref> the Dianics called themselves a \"wimmin's religion\" and, thus, rejected males from their ranks.\n\n== Joseph Campbell ==\n[[Image:Egypt.IsisHorus.01.png|thumb|upright|Ancient Egyptian depiction of [[Isis]] nursing [[Horus]], wearing the headdress of [[Hathor]]]]\n\nFirst broadcast on [[PBS]] in 1988 as a documentary interview with [[Bill Moyers]], ''[[The Power of Myth]]'', written by [[Joseph Campbell]], was also released in the same year as a book created under the direction of the late [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Campbell |title=The Power of Myth |date=1988 |edition=first |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |pp=166\u2013167 |isbn=978-0-3077-9472-7 |ref=harv|title-link=The Power of Myth }}</ref> ''The Power of Myth'' links the image of the Earth or Mother Goddess to symbols of fertility and reproduction.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|1988|loc=Chapter 6, \"The Gift of the Goddess\"}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Love and the Goddess |series=Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth |season=1 |number=5 |network=PBS |date=June 25, 1988 |url=http://www.tv.com/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth/love-and-the-goddess/episode/459330/summary.html |access-date=June 12, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709044825/http://www.tv.com/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth/love-and-the-goddess/episode/459330/summary.html |archivedate=July 9, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> For example, Campbell states that, \"There have been systems of religion where the mother is the prime parent, the source...

The Goddess movement has found voice in various films and self-published media, such as the [[Women and Spirituality: The Goddess Trilogy|''Women and Spirituality'']] trilogy made by Donna Read for the [[National Film Board of Canada]].\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Seal of Inanna, 2350-2150 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] [[cylinder seal]] depicting the goddess [[Inanna]] resting her foot on the back of a lion while [[Ninshubur]] stands in front of her paying obeisance, c. 2334\u20132154 BC]]\n\nAssociated terms sometimes used within the movement include the following:\n\n*'''Goddesses''' refers to a local or specific deities linked clearly to a particular culture and often to particular aspects, attributes and powers (for example: the [[Mesopotamia]]n goddess [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]]; [[Athena]]; or [[Hindu]] goddesses like [[Sarasvati]], the goddess of [[learning]], [[poetry]], music, [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]] and [[wisdom]]; and [[Lakshmi]] goddess of wealth and [[sovereignty]]).\n*'''The Goddess''' or '''the Great Goddess''' is a female deity that is regarded as primary. Such a religious system existed historically in many cultures, though not under the same names and not necessarily with the same traits. If there is a male god, he often seen as her equal, or his powers may be seen as deriving from her.<ref>{{cite book|title=Matriarchal Mythology in Former Times and Today (pamphlet)|last=G\u00f6ttner-Abendroth|first=Heide|date=1987|publisher=Crossing Press|ref=harv|author-link=Heide G\u00f6ttner-Abendroth}}</ref> These terms are ''not'' usually understood to refer a single deity that is identical across cultures but rather a concept common in many ancient cultures, which those in the Goddess movement want to restore.<ref name=\"christ1997\" /> When Goddess is spoken of as a personal guardian, as in 'my Goddess' it means 'my worldview in Goddess spirituality.'\n*'''Goddess Spirituality''' is sometimes used as a synonym for Goddess Movement and sometimes as the spiritual practice that is part of the Goddess movement.<ref name=\":6\" /> It could also refer to the Goddess Movement's ethos, particularly when used to construct Christianity as the diametrical opposite of the Goddess.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christian Goddess Spirituality: Enchanting Christianity|last=Beavis|first=Mary Ann|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138936881|location=New York|pages=29}}</ref> Here, the term becomes a distinguishing concept that sets the movement apart from Christianity with little room for overlap.\n*'''Goddessing''' is a recent contribution to Goddess vocabulary, possibly derived from the British journal of the same name, following from [[Mary Daly]]'s suggestion that deity is too dynamic, too much in process and changing continually, to be a noun, and should better be spoken as a verb (Daly 1973). Goddessing may also mean Goddess culture, Goddess way of life, Goddess practice, or 'my goddessing' as in my individual interpretation and experience of Goddess.\n*'''Priestess''' refers to women who dedicate themselves to one or more goddesses. It may or may not include leadership of a group, and it may or may not include legal ordination. The analogous term for men is \"priest.\" However, not everyone who dedicates themselves to the Goddess or goddesses calls themselves a priestess (or priest).\n*'''[[Thealogy]]''' is a term whose first use in the context of feminist analysis of religion and discussion of Goddess is usually credited to Naomi Goldenberg, who used the term in her book ''Changing of the Gods''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/changingofgodsfe00gold|url-access=registration|title=Changing of the Gods: Feminism & the End of Traditional Religions|last=Goldenberg|first=Naomi|date=1979|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0-8070-1111-8|location=Boston|pp=[https://archive.org/details/changingofgodsfe00gold/page/96 96]\u201399|access-date=2015-10-30}}</ref> It substitutes the Greek feminine prefix \"thea-\" for the supposedly generic use of the Greek masculine prefix \"theo-\". It refers to the activity of determining the meaning of Goddess as opposed to theology, which reflects on the meaning of God.<ref name=\":5\" /> Frequently used to mean analysis of Goddess thought and mysticism, it can also be used more liberally to mean any kind of divine, not just deity divine, as in meditation, ethics, ritual pragmatics.\n\nCapitalization of terms such as \"Goddess\" and \"Goddesses\" usually vary with author or with the style guides of publications or publishers. Within the Goddess community, members generally consider it proper to capitalize the word \"Goddess\", but not necessary when generic references are made, as in the word \"goddesses\".\n\n== Use of mythological materials ==\nParticipants in the Goddess movement often invoke myths.

Reinterpretation becomes necessary because myths from religions that included goddesses, those after the [[Bronze Age]], including Greek and Roman mythology, are believed to have a patriarchal bias.

Starhawk speaks of the Goddess as immanent (infusing all of nature) but sometimes also simultaneously transcendent (existing independently of the material world).<ref name=Starhawk1987/> Many Goddess authors agree and also describe Goddess as, at one and the same time, immanently pantheistic and panentheistic. The former means that Goddess flows into and through each individual aspect of nature\u2014each tree, blade of grass, human, animal, planet; the latter means that all exist within the Goddess.<ref name=christ1997/><ref name=Starhawk1999/>\n\nStarhawk also speaks of the Goddess as both a psychological symbol and \"manifest reality. She exists ''and'' we create Her\" (italics hers).<ref>{{harvnb|Starhawk|1999|p=77}}</ref>  Carol P. Christ (2003), describes what she sees as similarities between Goddess theology and [[process theology]], and suggests that Goddess theologians adopt more of the process viewpoint.\n\n=== Deity vs metaphor ===\nThe theological variations that characterize the Goddess movement can also be classified into two: the views that describe the Goddess as a metaphor and those that consider the Goddess as a deity. The former emerged from among Jewish and Christian adherents and maintains that the Goddess serves as the means of talking about, imagining, or relating to the divine and this is demonstrated in the push to recover the feminine face of God based on scriptural and historical sources.<ref name=\":3\" /> On the other hand, the theology that the Goddess is a deity, with importantly and unchangeably female persona, emerged out of the feminists who came from polytheistic faiths such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Native American, and traditional African religions.<ref name=\":3\" /> The goddesses in this theology are rarely understood as metaphors or images since they have distinct individual features and that worshippers can interact with their suprahuman personages or symbols.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Ethics ==\n[[File:Kaliposter1940s.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Modern, western depiction of the Hindu goddess [[Kali]], shown standing atop [[Shiva]], wearing a necklace of severed heads, in front of a fiery background]]\n\nAlthough the Goddess movement has no specific code of behavior, there are commonly held tenets and concepts within the movement that form a basis for ethical behavior.<ref>{{cite web |last=Christ |first=Carol P. |title=Musings on the Goddess and Her Cultural Despisers--Provoked by Naomi Goldenberg |date=2005 |url=http://www.belili.org/marija/carol_christ.html |access-date=January 25, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215224641/http://www.belili.org/marija/carol_christ.html |archive-date=December 15, 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> Those participants in Goddess spirituality who define themselves as Wiccan, usually follow what is known as the [[Wiccan Rede]]: \" 'An it harm none, do what ye will\", (\"an\" being an archaic English word understood to mean \"if\", or \"as long as\"). Many also believe in the [[Threefold Law]], which states that \"what you send (or do), returns three times over\".<ref name=Starhawk1999/> Some traditions believe that this means it will be returned to the sender three times, or in a portion three times in volume, while others say it will instead be returned to the sender on three levels of being- physical, mental, and spiritual. Still others postulate that the number \"three\" is symbolic, meant to indicate a magnified karmic result for one's actions.\n\nSome people in the Goddess movement honor the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] of Maiden, Mother, and Crone. The Maiden aspect of the Goddess shows women how to be independent and strong; the Mother aspect shows women how to be nurturing; and the Crone aspect shows that respecting elders is important and focuses on wisdom, change, and transformation.<ref name=Starhawk1999/>\n\nBecause the Crone aspect of the Goddess is understood by some to be destructive at times, some consider it to contain both positive and negative imagery and to present an ethical quandary. The Hindu Goddess [[Kali]], or Kali Ma, is often seen as an example of the Crone aspect. The concept is that the corrective force in a Dark Age must be a righteously directed dark force. Thus, to combat the [[demons]] of ignorance, ego, anger, etc., the darker aspect manifests. Later on, even her fierce image softens in the love of her devotees. Her duality is easily reconciled with the monism of Hinduism, which claims to understand the fundamental unity of truth as being impersonal and stratified in an ego-knotted existence (such as the human condition), and thus to the evil or unrighteous she is destruction personified and to the loving and moral devotee she is nothing but the love of the mother.<ref name=Jayran2000/>\n\nOther Goddess ethical beliefs are that one should not harm the interconnected web of life, and that peace and partnership should be the goals, rather than war and domination. According to Goddess theologian [[Carol P. Christ]] the following are ethical touchstones:\n\n{{quote|\"Nurture life; Walk in love and beauty; Trust the knowledge that comes through the body; Speak the truth about conflict, pain, and suffering; Take only what you need; Think about the consequences of your actions for seven generations; Approach the taking of life with great restraint; Practice great generosity; Repair the web.\"<ref name=christ1997/>}}\n\n== Prehistoric cultures ==\n[[File:Willendorf-Venus-1468.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|The famous [[Venus of Willendorf]] (circa 28,000-25,000 B.C.)]]\n{{Main|Matriarchal religion}}\n\nThe Goddess movement draws some of its inspiration from the work of archaeologists such as [[Marija Gimbutas]],<ref name=Gimbuta1982>{{cite book |last=Gimbutas |first=Marija |title=The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe, 6500-3500 B.C.: Myths and Cult Images |publisher=University of California Press |date=1982 |orig-year=1974 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zKFFOoPlyjIC |isbn=978-0-5202-5398-8 |ref=harv |access-date=2015-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109063144/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zKFFOoPlyjIC |archive-date=2016-01-09 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=Gimbutas2001>{{cite book |last=Gimbutas |first=Marija |title=The Language of the Goddess: Unearthing the Hidden Symbols of Western Civilization |publisher=Thames & Hudson |date=2001 |orig-year=1989 |isbn=978-0-5002-8249-6 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=Mellaart>{{cite book |title=Catal-huyuk.

She presented a theory of the transformation of prehistoric cultures in which the local goddess was primary and the male god, if any, derived his power from the goddess.

One way to characterize the central male-female divine dyad in Wicca is to say that it's a duotheistic religion with a theology based on the divine gender polarity of male and female.\n\nThe existence of witchcraft as the remnants of an old pagan religion as late as the [[early Modern Age]] was first suggested to a wide readership by [[Margaret Murray]]'s books, ''The Witch Cult in Western Europe'', ''The God of the Witches'' (1933) and ''The Divine King in England''. Her works have since been largely discredited by other scholars but have left a feminist legacy upon Wiccan culture.\n\n[[File:Diane de Versailles Leochares.jpg|thumb|Roman copy of a Greek statue by [[Leochares]] of the goddess [[Artemis]], who was known to the Romans as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]]]\n\nWicca and [[Neopaganism]], and to some extent the Goddess movement, were influenced by 19th-century occultism, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Greer |first=Mary K. |title=Women of the Golden Dawn |publisher=Park Street Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-8928-1516-6}}</ref> and romantic nature movements in which both male and female were valued and honored as sacred, in contrast to and perhaps in reaction to mainstream Christian spirituality. Such views are described, for example, in the work of [[Robert Graves]], especially ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (the origin of the neopagan 'Triple Goddess' concept) and ''Mammon and the Black Goddess''.\n\nWicca was also heavily influenced by the ideas of alchemic symbolism, which emphasized the essential complementary polarity of male and female, and that characterized that basic duality or gender polarity as a partnership of the solar (male) and the lunar (female). In Wicca the moon is the symbol of the Goddess and the sun is the symbol of the God; and the central liturgical mystery and ritual act is \"The Great Rite\" or Hieros Gamos, which is a symbolic union of the God and the Goddess, as the primal male and female powers of the cosmos. In alchemy this was known as \"the alchemical wedding\" of the sun and the moon. In a parallel vein, traditional Wicca also draws heavily upon the Western Hermetic Tradition and its roots in the kabbalistic Tree of Life; where the twin pillars of masculine and feminine divine forces are joined by a Middle Pillar that encompasses and transcends both male and female. These \"twin pillars\" as they are shown in tarot decks are analogous to Valiente's depiction of the God and the Goddess as the two \"mystical pillars.\" In this emphasis on the feminine as the equal and complementary polar opposite of the masculine, Wicca echoes not only kabbalistic sources but also the polarity of yin and yang\u2014feminine and masculine\u2014in Taoism.\n\n{{quote|The Dianic view is that separatism, in a world where gender roles were once strictly defined, is sometimes considered dangerous because it challenges what they see as patriarchal assumptions of Western culture.<ref name=Budapest1980/>}}\n\nThere are, however, Wiccan groups that do not subscribe to the male-female dualism of the divine. For instance, there is the case of the Budapest Dianics. Although these retained many Wiccan rituals and symbols, they only used female imagery and created a creation myth that eliminated the need for the male.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religion and American Cultures: An Encyclopedia of Traditions|last=Laderman|first=Gary|last2=Leon|first2=Luis|publisher=ABC_CLIO|year=2003|isbn=157607238X|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=243}}</ref> While Wiccans also accept male members,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The SAGE Handbook of the Sociology of Religion|last=Beckford|first=James|last2=Demarath|publisher=Jay|year=2007|isbn=9781412911955|location=London|pages=576}}</ref> the Dianics called themselves a \"wimmin's religion\" and, thus, rejected males from their ranks.\n\n== Joseph Campbell ==\n[[Image:Egypt.IsisHorus.01.png|thumb|upright|Ancient Egyptian depiction of [[Isis]] nursing [[Horus]], wearing the headdress of [[Hathor]]]]\n\nFirst broadcast on [[PBS]] in 1988 as a documentary interview with [[Bill Moyers]], ''[[The Power of Myth]]'', written by [[Joseph Campbell]], was also released in the same year as a book created under the direction of the late [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Campbell |title=The Power of Myth |date=1988 |edition=first |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |pp=166\u2013167 |isbn=978-0-3077-9472-7 |ref=harv|title-link=The Power of Myth }}</ref> ''The Power of Myth'' links the image of the Earth or Mother Goddess to symbols of fertility and reproduction.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|1988|loc=Chapter 6, \"The Gift of the Goddess\"}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Love and the Goddess |series=Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth |season=1 |number=5 |network=PBS |date=June 25, 1988 |url=http://www.tv.com/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth/love-and-the-goddess/episode/459330/summary.html |access-date=June 12, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709044825/http://www.tv.com/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth/love-and-the-goddess/episode/459330/summary.html |archivedate=July 9, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> For example, Campbell states that, \"There have been systems of religion where the mother is the prime parent, the source...

The word ''piragua'' is derived from the combination of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words ''pir\u00e1mide'' (\"[[pyramid]]\") and ''agua'' (\"water\").<ref name=Toro/>{{rp|12}} In Latin America, frozen treats similar to the piragua are known by many different names.<ref name=\"PRH2\">{{cite news |newspaper=Puerto Rico Herald |volume=7 |number=43 |title=In Latino Neighborhood, Forecast Calls For Snow Cones |first=Miguel |last=Perez |date=July 29, 2003 |url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n43/InLatinoNeigh-en.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928065114/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n43/InLatinoNeigh-en.html |archivedate=2017-09-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Comida: Piragua \u2013 Puerto Rico Piragua |date=August 10, 2010 |website=Boricua.com |url=http://boricua.com/comida/piragua-puerto-rico-piragua |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928103036/http://boricua.com/comida/piragua-puerto-rico-piragua |archivedate=2017-09-28 }}</ref>\n[[File:Piraguas, Puerto Rican shave ice.jpg|thumb|Piraguas, Puerto Rican shave ice]]\n==Preparation and sale==\n===Pirag\u00fceros===\n[[File:Nilda and Piragua3.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Customer posing with a piragua pushcart in Puerto Rico]]\nA piragua vendor is known as a \"pirag\u00fcero\".

They were not the sons of Thomas Townsend of Lynn, MA and this is confirmed by male line YDNA testing which is incontrovertible. The Oyster Bay Townsends and the Townsends of Lynn do not share male line YDNA.  The testing was done at FTDNA under the auspices of the Townsend Society of America as the Townsend Project and is ongoing. https://gap.familytreedna.com/.

The Lynn, MA YDNA group [haplogroup R-L21] has 10 men surnamed Townsend who match each other.  So far, fifteen completely unrelated Townsend families who have descendants living today in the United States have been identified by YDNA testing.  The majority are presumed to have originated in England and they arrived anywhere from about 1640 to the late 1700s.\n\n==Career==\nTownsend settled in Flushing, where his brother [[John Townsend (Norwich)|John Townsend]] was granted a patent by Gov.

It is a loose [[parody]] of ''[[Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President]]'', another children's book featuring Marlon Bundo written by [[Charlotte Pence]] and illustrated by [[Karen Pence]].\n\nThe book and its [[LGBT|LGBTQ]]-inclusive theme was written by Jill Twiss (with Marlon Bundo credited as co-writer), who is a comedy writer for the television show ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'', aiming to deride Vice President Pence over his controversial anti-LGBTQ views, such as his alleged support for [[conversion therapy]] of gay adolescents and opposition to [[same-sex marriage]].<ref name=\"AV Club\">{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/john-oliver-hijacks-homophobe-mike-pences-bunny-book-wi-1823879129|title=John Oliver hijacks homophobe Mike Pence's bunny book with a better one in A Day In The Life Of Marlon Bundo|last=Perkins|first=Dennis|date=March 19, 2018|website=[[The A.V.
