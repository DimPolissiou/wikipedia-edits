{"title_page": "List of Tipperary hurlers", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is an incomplete list of all [[Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship|Tipperary Senior hurlers]]. The players in this list included are from 1887 onwards. This list also includes a number of players from the first county selection in 1886, a year before the first All-Ireland Senior championship. This list is an A-Z of Tipperary Senior hurlers that have had the privilege of donning the Blue and Gold jersey of Tipperary and the All-Ireland and Munster Senior medals that they have individually won. This list also includes players from the incomplete 1888 championship that was never finished due to the GAA's invasion of America.\n__NOTOC__ \n{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}\n\n==A==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;background:blue;color:gold;\"\n|'''Name'''\n|'''Club'''\n|'''All-Ireland SHC Medals'''\n|'''Munster SHC Medals'''\n|-\n| John Addish\n| [[Moycarkey-Borris GAA|Moycarkey-Borris]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Con Ahearne\n| [[Clonoulty-Rossmore GAA|Clonoulty-Rossmore]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Martin Ahearne\n| [[Newport GAA|Newport]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Tom Allen\n| [[Moycarkey-Borris GAA|Moycarkey-Borris]]\n| 1900, 1906\n| 1900, 1906\n|-\n| Patsy Armstrong\n| [[Boherlahan-Dualla GAA|Boherlahan]]\n| 1895\n| 1895\n|-\n| Pat Arrigan\n| [[Carrick Davins GAA|Carrick Davins]]\n| 1960, 1965\n| 1960, 1965, 1967\n|-\n| Martin Ayres\n| [[Nenagh \u00c9ire \u00d3g GAA|Nenagh \u00c9ire \u00d3g]]\n|\n| 1922\n|-\n|}\n\n==B==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;background:blue;color:gold;\"\n|'''Name'''\n|'''Club'''\n|'''All-Ireland SHC Medals'''\n|'''Munster SHC Medals'''\n|-\n| Joe Banaghan\n| [[Kilruane MacDonagh's GAA|Kilruane MacDonagh's]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Francis Bannon\n| [[Holycross-Ballycahill GAA|Holycross-Ballycahill]]\n| 1949\n| 1949\n|-\n| Jack Bannon\n| [[Thurles Sarsfields|Thurles]]\n| 1887\n| 1887\n|-\n| Joe Bannon\n| [[Holycross-Ballycahill GAA|Holycross-Ballycahill]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| [[S\u00e9amus Bannon]]\n| [[Drom-Inch GAA|Drom-Inch]]\n| 1949, 1950, 1951\n| 1949, 1950, 1951\n|-\n|[[Cathal Barrett|Cathal Barret]]\n|[[Holycross-Ballycahill GAA|Holycross-Ballycahill]]\n|2016,\n\n2019\n|2015,\n\n2016\n|-\n| Michael Barrett\n| [[Cahir GAA|Cahir]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Sean Power\n| [[Carrick Swan / Ballyneale ]]\n| 1951, 1958\n| 1951, 1958\n|-\n| Aidan Barry\n| [[Lorrha-Dorrha GAA|Lorrha-Dooha]]\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[James Barry (hurler)|James Barry]]\n|[[Upperchurch-Drombane GAA|Upperchurch-Drombane]]\n|2016,\n\n2019\n|2015,\n\n2016\n|-\n| Seamus Barry\n| [[Upperchurch-Drombane GAA|Upperchurch-Drombane]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Tom Barry\n| [[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Willie Barry\n| [[Cappawhite GAA|Cappawhite]]\n| 1937\n| 1937\n|-\n| Jack Bergin\n| [[Moycarkey-Borris GAA|Moycarkey-Borris]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Liam Bergin\n| [[Moycarkey-Borris GAA|Moycarkey-Borris]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Rody Berkery\n| [[Thurles Sarsfields|Thurles Blues]]\n| 1906\n| 1906\n|-\n| Pat Bermingham\n| [[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| [[Colm Bonnar]]\n| [[Cashel King Cormacs GAA|Cashel King Cormacs]]\n| 1989, 1991\n| 1987, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1993\n|-\n| [[Conal Bonnar]]\n| [[Cashel King Cormacs GAA|Cashel King Cormacs]]\n| 1989, 1991\n| 1988, 1989, 1991, 1993\n|-\n| [[Cormac Bonnar]]\n| [[Cashel King Cormacs GAA|Cashel King Cormacs]]\n| 1989, 1991\n| 1988, 1989, 1991\n|-\n| Martin Bourke\n| [[Toomevara GAA|Toomevara]]\n| 1945\n| 1945\n|-\n| Pa Bourke\n| [[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n| 2010\n| 2008, 2009\n|-\n| Paddy Bourke\n| [[J.K.

This list also includes players from the incomplete 1888 championship that was never finished due to the GAA's invasion of America.\n__NOTOC__ \n{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}\n\n==A==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;background:blue;color:gold;\"\n|'''Name'''\n|'''Club'''\n|'''All-Ireland SHC Medals'''\n|'''Munster SHC Medals'''\n|-\n| John Addish\n| [[Moycarkey-Borris GAA|Moycarkey-Borris]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Con Ahearne\n| [[Clonoulty-Rossmore GAA|Clonoulty-Rossmore]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Martin Ahearne\n| [[Newport GAA|Newport]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Tom Allen\n| [[Moycarkey-Borris GAA|Moycarkey-Borris]]\n| 1900, 1906\n| 1900, 1906\n|-\n| Patsy Armstrong\n| [[Boherlahan-Dualla GAA|Boherlahan]]\n| 1895\n| 1895\n|-\n| Pat Arrigan\n| [[Carrick Davins GAA|Carrick Davins]]\n| 1960, 1965\n| 1960, 1965, 1967\n|-\n| Martin Ayres\n| [[Nenagh \u00c9ire \u00d3g GAA|Nenagh \u00c9ire \u00d3g]]\n|\n| 1922\n|-\n|}\n\n==B==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;background:blue;color:gold;\"\n|'''Name'''\n|'''Club'''\n|'''All-Ireland SHC Medals'''\n|'''Munster SHC Medals'''\n|-\n| Joe Banaghan\n| [[Kilruane MacDonagh's GAA|Kilruane MacDonagh's]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Francis Bannon\n| [[Holycross-Ballycahill GAA|Holycross-Ballycahill]]\n| 1949\n| 1949\n|-\n| Jack Bannon\n| [[Thurles Sarsfields|Thurles]]\n| 1887\n| 1887\n|-\n| Joe Bannon\n| [[Holycross-Ballycahill GAA|Holycross-Ballycahill]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| [[S\u00e9amus Bannon]]\n| [[Drom-Inch GAA|Drom-Inch]]\n| 1949, 1950, 1951\n| 1949, 1950, 1951\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Michael Barrett\n| [[Cahir GAA|Cahir]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Sean Power\n| [[Carrick Swan / Ballyneale ]]\n| 1951, 1958\n| 1951, 1958\n|-\n| Aidan Barry\n| [[Lorrha-Dorrha GAA|Lorrha-Dooha]]\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Seamus Barry\n| [[Upperchurch-Drombane GAA|Upperchurch-Drombane]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Tom Barry\n| [[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Willie Barry\n| [[Cappawhite GAA|Cappawhite]]\n| 1937\n| 1937\n|-\n| Jack Bergin\n| [[Moycarkey-Borris GAA|Moycarkey-Borris]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Liam Bergin\n| [[Moycarkey-Borris GAA|Moycarkey-Borris]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| Rody Berkery\n| [[Thurles Sarsfields|Thurles Blues]]\n| 1906\n| 1906\n|-\n| Pat Bermingham\n| [[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n|\n|\n|-\n| [[Colm Bonnar]]\n| [[Cashel King Cormacs GAA|Cashel King Cormacs]]\n| 1989, 1991\n| 1987, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1993\n|-\n| [[Conal Bonnar]]\n| [[Cashel King Cormacs GAA|Cashel King Cormacs]]\n| 1989, 1991\n| 1988, 1989, 1991, 1993\n|-\n| [[Cormac Bonnar]]\n| [[Cashel King Cormacs GAA|Cashel King Cormacs]]\n| 1989, 1991\n| 1988, 1989, 1991\n|-\n| Martin Bourke\n| [[Toomevara GAA|Toomevara]]\n| 1945\n| 1945\n|-\n| Pa Bourke\n| [[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n| 2010\n| 2008, 2009\n|-\n| Paddy Bourke\n| [[J.K.

It was formed as per the instructions given by Swami Vivekananda, a patriot-saint of India.<ref>''Swami Vivekananda's Dream, Sri Sarada Math'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2005), p.7 </ref> Fifty years after the passing away of Swami Vivekananda, in 1954, the Sri Sarada Math was established at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata with a group of eight nuns. \n\nThe headquarters of Sri Sarada Math is situated on the bank of Ganga in Dakshineshwar, Kolkata. Presently, the organisation has branch centres all over India, and in Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/centers.php</ref>\n\nThe main aim of the organisation is to fulfil the mission of Swami Vivekananda, that is \u2018Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva\u2019 serving God in Man, irrespective of caste, creed and nationality as well as the upliftment and empowerment of women.<ref>http://srisaradamathrb.org/our-origin/</ref><ref>''Echoes of Vedanta in the far East'' (Ramakrishnan Sarada Vedanta Societty of New South Wales: Australia, 1994), p.i)</ref>\n\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]]. \n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in Udbodhan magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation. \n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur. The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math. \n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women\u2019s Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]]<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992), 48</ref>, [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]]<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009), p.20</ref>, [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]]. \n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created. \n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]]. Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion. \n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission\u2019s main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two centres run the Ramakrishna Mission for women, the Matri Bhavan (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Women\u2019s Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. \n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the Sister Nivedita Girls School to the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math\u2019s emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen. \n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was Pravrajika Bharatiprana (1894-1973)<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref>.

They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in Udbodhan magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation. \n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur. The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math. \n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women\u2019s Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were Pravrajika Bharatiprana<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992), 48</ref>, Pravrajika Mokshaprana, Pravrajika Muktiprana, Pravrajika Dayaprana, Pravrajika Vidyaprana, Pravrajika Shraddhaprana<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009), p.20</ref>, Pravrajika Bhaktiprana, and Pravrajika Medhaprana. \n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created. \n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].

However his plans backfired when he inadvertently ended up striking Galloway with a chair on the first occasion and the second occasion he struck him with a kendo stick. Following on from this, the two began a heated rivalry, fighting each other on several occasions, including an unsanctioned fight that led to a no-contest at [[Destination X (2016)|Destination X]].

However, his speech was ignored, and a match between El Patron and Lashley was scheduled. Carter watched the main event and congratulated El Patron for his championship win. However, when El Patron relinquished the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, a match between Carter and him for the number one contender was scheduled the following week, which El Patron won by submission.\n\n==== Impact Grand Champion (2017\u20132018) ====\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:EC3 Impact Grand Champion 2017.jpg|thumb|left|Carter as [[Impact Grand Championship|Impact Grand Champion]] in September 2017]]\nOn April 20 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Carter interfered in the match between [[Bobby Lashley|Lashley]] and [[James Storm]] for the World Heavyweight Championship, hitting Storm over the head with a beer bottle, thus turning [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in the process once again. On May 11 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Carter came out dressed as a Cowboy and proceeded to berate James Storm and the new management of [[Impact Wrestling]]. Storm then tried to attack Carter but Carter retaliated by lashing James Storm over 30 times with a leather belt causing significant injury to the back of James Storm. The following week, Carter was defeated by James Storm after Carter brutally lashed the referee. After the match however, he tried to attack Storm after which Storm came out on top, but was immediately attacked by [[Magnus (wrestler)|Magnus]].

But, after an altercation with Prichard, Carter attacked him. The following week, Carter defeated James Storm and Magnus and become the number one contender to the Impact Wrestling Heavyweight Championship.

At Slammiversary, Carter defeated James Storm in a Strap match.\n\nAfter that, Carter was put in the orbit of the Impact Grand Championship, which he won on the August 3 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', when he defeated Moose via split decision to win the [[Impact Grand Championship]]. On the August 24 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Carter entered in the 20 Man Gauntlet for the Gold match for the vacant [[GFW World Heavyweight Championship]] at N\u00b07, but was eliminated by Moose and Eddie Edwards. Then, he started a feud with Mexican luchadores from AAA [[El Hijo del Fantasma]], [[Pagano (wrestler)|Pagano]] and [[El Texano Jr.]], culminating in a match at [[Bound for Glory (2017)|Bound for Glory]] where EC3, Eddie Edwards, and James Storm defeated El Hijo del Fantasma, Texano, and Pagano. After defences against Hijo del Fantasma and [[Fallah Bahh]], Carter put the title on the line against [[Matt Sydal]], but the match ended in a draw. On the January 4 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', EC3 retained his title in a three-way match against Matt Sydal and Fallah Bahh. At the end, he lost the title at [[TNA Genesis|Genesis]] to Sydal.\n\nOn the February 1 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'' (taped before his January 13 release), EC3 and Alberto El Patron were defeated by Moose and Johnny Impact in a tag-team match. This led to a fatal-four-way match the following week to determine the number one contender for the [[Impact World Championship]], which was won by Johnny Impact. On the February 15 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', EC3 teamed with a returning [[Tyrus (wrestler)|Tyrus]] and defeated Johnny Impact and Matt Sydal. After the match, Carter challenged Impact for a match where if he won, he takes his number one contender spot, which Impact accepted. However, EC3 lost the match the following week after a misunderstood with him and Tyrus. On the March 1 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', EC3 was defeated by Tyrus. On the March 15 (which was taped on January 13) episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Ethan Carter III participated at the Feast or Fired match where he picked one of the briefcases alongside [[Eli Drake]], [[Petey Williams]] and Moose. After the match, he attacked Tyrus with the briefcase. The following week, EC3 opened his briefcase, which revealed to be the Pink Slip, resulted to him being fired. After rejecting the result, he accepted his fate and was cheered by the Impact Zone despite being a heel. However, he attacked [[Jeremy Borash]] with his briefcase before being confronted and attacked by [[Brian Cage]]. This was his last Impact Wrestling appearance. He was released by Impact Wrestling from his contract on January 13, 2018.\n\n=== Return to WWE ===\n\n==== Return to NXT (2018\u20132019) ====\n[[File:EC3 NXT Takeover New Orleans

On the August 7 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', EC3, Rhino, Rycklon and Snitsky were defeated in an eight-man Hardcore War against [[The Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]], [[Al Snow]] and Tommy Dreamer.

However, when El Patron relinquished the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, a match between Carter and him for the number one contender was scheduled the following week, which El Patron won by submission.\n\n==== Impact Grand Champion (2017\u20132018) ====\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:EC3 Impact Grand Champion 2017.jpg|thumb|left|Carter as [[Impact Grand Championship|Impact Grand Champion]] in September 2017]]\nOn April 20 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Carter interfered in the match between [[Bobby Lashley|Lashley]] and [[James Storm]] for the World Heavyweight Championship, hitting Storm over the head with a beer bottle, thus turning [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in the process once again. On May 11 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Carter came out dressed as a Cowboy and proceeded to berate James Storm and the new management of [[Impact Wrestling]]. Storm then tried to attack Carter but Carter retaliated by lashing James Storm over 30 times with a leather belt causing significant injury to the back of James Storm. The following week, Carter was defeated by James Storm after Carter brutally lashed the referee. After the match however, he tried to attack Storm after which Storm came out on top, but was immediately attacked by [[Magnus (wrestler)|Magnus]]. Then, [[Bruce Prichard]] announced a 3-way match between Carter, Storm and Magnus to determine the number one contender to the [[Impact World Heavyweight Championship]]. But, after an altercation with Prichard, Carter attacked him. The following week, Carter defeated James Storm and Magnus and become the number one contender to the Impact Wrestling Heavyweight Championship. However, on the June 1 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Carter was defeated by [[Alberto El Patr\u00f3n]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel Cages|Six Sides of Steel match]], failing to win the [[GFW Global Championship (2014\u20132017)|GFW Global Championship]] and lost his opportunity to face Lashley at [[Slammiversary 2017|Slammiversary]]. At Slammiversary, Carter defeated James Storm in a Strap match.\n\nAfter that, Carter was put in the orbit of the Impact Grand Championship, which he won on the August 3 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', when he defeated Moose via split decision to win the [[Impact Grand Championship]]. On the August 24 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Carter entered in the 20 Man Gauntlet for the Gold match for the vacant [[GFW World Heavyweight Championship]] at N\u00b07, but was eliminated by Moose and Eddie Edwards. Then, he started a feud with Mexican luchadores from AAA [[El Hijo del Fantasma]], [[Pagano (wrestler)|Pagano]] and [[El Texano Jr.]], culminating in a match at [[Bound for Glory (2017)|Bound for Glory]] where EC3, Eddie Edwards, and James Storm defeated El Hijo del Fantasma, Texano, and Pagano. After defences against Hijo del Fantasma and [[Fallah Bahh]], Carter put the title on the line against [[Matt Sydal]], but the match ended in a draw. On the January 4 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', EC3 retained his title in a three-way match against Matt Sydal and Fallah Bahh. At the end, he lost the title at [[TNA Genesis|Genesis]] to Sydal.\n\nOn the February 1 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'' (taped before his January 13 release), EC3 and Alberto El Patron were defeated by Moose and Johnny Impact in a tag-team match. This led to a fatal-four-way match the following week to determine the number one contender for the [[Impact World Championship]], which was won by Johnny Impact. On the February 15 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', EC3 teamed with a returning [[Tyrus (wrestler)|Tyrus]] and defeated Johnny Impact and Matt Sydal. After the match, Carter challenged Impact for a match where if he won, he takes his number one contender spot, which Impact accepted. However, EC3 lost the match the following week after a misunderstood with him and Tyrus. On the March 1 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', EC3 was defeated by Tyrus. On the March 15 (which was taped on January 13) episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Ethan Carter III participated at the Feast or Fired match where he picked one of the briefcases alongside [[Eli Drake]], [[Petey Williams]] and Moose. After the match, he attacked Tyrus with the briefcase. The following week, EC3 opened his briefcase, which revealed to be the Pink Slip, resulted to him being fired. After rejecting the result, he accepted his fate and was cheered by the Impact Zone despite being a heel. However, he attacked [[Jeremy Borash]] with his briefcase before being confronted and attacked by [[Brian Cage]]. This was his last Impact Wrestling appearance. He was released by Impact Wrestling from his contract on January 13, 2018.\n\n=== Return to WWE ===\n\n==== Return to NXT (2018\u20132019) ====\n[[File:EC3 NXT Takeover New Orleans

It is an industrial chemical that is mainly used in the [[desalination]] of [[brackish water]] or used as a chemical intermediate and acid neutralizer. ''N'',''N''-Diethylmethylamine is a clear, colorless to pale yellow liquid at room temperature.\n\nDiethylmethylamine is a dangerous and toxic chemical which will cause serious injuries to the human body. There is evidence showing that skin contact with diethylmethylamine will cause a sensitization reaction in some people and chronic exposure may lead to organ damage. Diethylmethylamine can be converted to [[nitrosamine]] through nitrosating agents. In general Nitrosamines are considered to be [[carcinogen|carcinogenic]]. However, it occurs during production in certain foods, cosmetic, and hygiene products as an unwanted byproduct. Not only from the production, nitrosamine can also form during the preparation of production, even at room temperature. The use of [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] can inhibit the formation of nitrosamine. For consumers' safety, commercial goods with a significant amount of nitrosamine are not allowed. Due to those reasons, it must be carefully stored in approved plastic containers and avoid contact with acid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-236115.pdf|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine|last=|first=|date=|website=Santa Cruz Biotechnology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\nDiethylmethylamine can be produced by the reaction between [[Methyl p-toluate|methyl toluate]] and [[diethylamine]]:\n\nCH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub> + HN(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n\nThis reaction required a temperature between 200<sup>o</sup>C to 250<sup>o</sup>C and a pressure between atmospheric and 1000 [[Pounds per square inch|p.s.i]]. The diethylmethylamine produced by the reaction is a typical organic tertiary amine which have the same characteristic as other amine. This was obtained from the experiment results. Since in this reaction, diethylmethylamine is an additional product which only have a little amount, the industrial production may use other reaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Class|first=J.B.|title=Production of diethylemthylamine|publisher=United States Patent Office|year=1960|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nBasic properties like density and melting point are shown in the information box. The properties also contained part that need be discussed in micro level. Since diethylmethylamine is a polymer, it can have several isomers, the structural of the molecular is always focused.\n\n===Molecular structure and conformation===\nDue to the rotation of a single bond, [[Conformational isomerism|conformational isomers]] are formed. Conformational isomers have the same structural formula but different characteristic. This has always been interested by the scientist. In 1978, Crocker and Goggin had experimented on determined the conformation of diethylmethylamine. They used [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]] and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectra]] on diethylmethylamine in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Results showed two conformers exist in the solid phase and can be determined as tt (trans-trans conformer) and g<sup>+</sup>t (gauche<sup>+</sup>-trans conformer). Because of the complexity of the vapor spectrum, they can only infer there are two or more conformers that exist in the gas phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Christopher|last2=Goggin|first2=Peter L.|date=1978|title=Infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of conformations in liquid and solid triethyl-, diethyl(methyl)- and ethyldimethyl-amines, -phosphines, and -arsines|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions|issue=5|pages=388|doi=10.1039/dt9780000388|issn=0300-9246}}</ref>\n\nPresent studies used gas-phase IR spectra and FT-Raman spectra of the liquid to get more detailed results. The results of the regular coordinate analysis indicated there were four conformers, and the [[diffraction]] data showed the conformation of diethylmethylamine is 35 (14)% tt + 27 (14)% g<sup>+</sup>t + 20 (17)% g<sup>-</sup>t (gauche<sup>-</sup>-trans conformer) + 18 (23)% g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup>(gauche<sup>+</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer). To confirm the result, a [[Vibrational analysis with scanning probe microscopy|vibrational analysis]] of hydrocarbon analog in the liquid phase was done, and it identified the conformers were the same as diffraction data showed. Moreover, tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers were found more stable than the other two. The conformational stability of diethylmethylamine can be explained by the numbers of trans CNCC fragment that two fragments of tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers trans conformation and one fragment of g<sup>-</sup>t and g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup> conformers trans conformation. Further study showed the reason why diethylmethylamine did't have a g<sup>-</sup>g<sup>+</sup> (gauche<sup>-</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer) conformer that is the steric repulsion between terminal methyl groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Hiroshi|last2=Ito|first2=Masaki|last3=Egawa|first3=Toru|date=2007-09-17|title=Molecular structure and conformation of diethylmethylamine determined by gas electron diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure|volume=840|issue=1\u20133|pages=107\u2013113|doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2006.11.027|bibcode=2007JMoSt.840..107T|hdl=2115/28245|issn=0022-2860}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereodynamics (dynamics of stereochemical reaction) of N,N-diethylmethylamine ===\ndiethylmethylamine is the simplest trialkylamine that can be tested with two processes about the nitrogen atom in it. The first one is indeed pyramidal inversion, and the second is the isolated rotation of nitrogen carbon bond. From these two processes, the <sup>1</sup>H dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy obtained clear evidence for nitrogen [[pyramidal inversion]]. Also, the result indicates there were several \" familiars\" of [[rotamer]]s exist in diethylmethylamine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bushweller|first=C.H.|last2=Fleischman|first2=S.P.|last3=Grady|first3=G.L.|last4=McGoff|first4=P.|last5=Rithner|first5=C.D.|last6=Whalon|first6=M.R.|last7=Brennan|first7=J.G.|last8=Marcantonio|first8=R.P.|last9=Dominigue|first9=R.P.|date=1982-11-01|title=Stereodynamics of diethylmethylamine and triethylamine|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=104|issue=23|pages=6224\u20136236|doi=10.1021/ja00387a012}}</ref>\n\n=== Rotation inversion ===\nRotation is part of the conformational isomer, so study the rotational isomer help the scientists to understand the chemical better. Rotation study of diethylmethylamine was done by Bushweller and Laurenzi. From the research image of <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine at 200 K, ethyl group shows a A<sub>2</sub> X<sub>3</sub> spectrum and N-methyl protons shows a [[singlet]]. Two resonances can be tested in temperature range 140 K to 200 K---N-methyl and C-methyl resonances and they are independent. The result of DNMR also indicated, the slow nitrogen inversion in diethylmethylamine was caused by the coalescence phenomenon connected with CH<sub>2</sub> resonance. The nitrogen inversion process in diethylmethylamine contained not only the inversion of nitrogen but also rotation about the C-N bond, which can be named as inversion rotation. Inversion rotation means nitrogen inversion always occur with rotation about the C-N bond. Other studies found out that at low temperature (99 K), the <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine has more change. At 99 K, N-methyl and C-methyl resonance separate into more peaks. Two important things need to be mentioned. First, peaks of the N-methyl in diethylmethylamine can be assumed as broad singlets. Second, the C-methyl resonance can be assumed as equivalent for all three methyl protons.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bushweller|first=C.

In research, it can be the lineshape standard of the NMR test. In industry, it always play a role in extraction reaction due to its characteristic.\n\n=== Lineshape standard of nuclear magnetic resonance experiment ===\nFor an [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) experiment, the most important thing is to make sure the existence of narrow peak and maximum sensitivity, which can be achieved by adjusting shimming field to enhance the [[magnetic field]] homogeneity. A typically used sample is not very useful during low temperature (150 K) experiments, because the peak showed will broaden. Since no available samples can use in low temperature experiments, many tests were done under the condition that the researchers assume the field condition was the same for both low-temperature terms and room temperature conditions. This will influence the NMR result since the change in inhomogeneity is hard to notice. There were research shows in some instrument, re-shimming the field after changing temperature could improve the homogeneity. So, something is a liquid at standard temperature, and pressure has a low melting point is needed.\n\nN, N-diethylmethylamine was used to experiment. As the experimental results show, diethylmethylamine is useful in shimming magnetic field around 140 K. With other research, diethylmethylamine can be used in shimming the magnetic field at room temperature in NMR experiments and low temperature in dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. diethylmethylamine was very useful around 140 K; however, many low-temperature experiments need to proceed below 140 K. Future research need to focus on finding efficiency substitute of diethylmethylamine to work in experiments below 140 K. For now, diethylmethylamine is the best choice among all substances for low-temperature NMR experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritzsching|first=Keith J.|last2=Itin|first2=Boris|last3=McDermott|first3=Ann E.|date=2018-02-21|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine as lineshape standard for NMR above 130\u202fK|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance|volume=287|pages=110\u2013112|doi=10.1016/j.jmr.2017.12.021|pmid=29335163|pmc=5821130|bibcode=2018JMagR.287..110F|issn=1090-7807}}</ref>\n\n=== Extraction of oil sand with microemulsions===\n[[Oil sands|Tar sand]] is an important source of petroleum, which contain 60 percent of the petroleum around the world. Extracting oil from tar sand has become an important part for nowadays industry. One way to extract oil is by using [[microemulsion]]s which are a mixture of oil, water and [[surfactant]]. Extracting oil sand with microemulsions, an important step is to decentralize the light hydrocarbons in the aqueous medium. Usually, alcohols are used as cosurfactants in the microemulsions. A good cosurfactants has two conditions which are strong acid-base type interaction with water and good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. However, some studies showed that diethylmethylamine is a more effective cosurfactants in water than commonly used alcohol. Experimental results indicated that a system based on diethylmethylamine and system based on simple alcohols have a similar feature in microemulsions. The result also pointed out diethylmethylamine reacts as medium chain length alcohols, which has both good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance and high solubility in water and many types of oil. However, this property causes diethylmethylamine has high efficiency and low specificity on nature and temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desnoyers|first=Jacques E.|last2=Quirion|first2=Fran\u00e7ois|last3=H\u00c9Tu|first3=Daniel|last4=Perron|first4=G\u00c9Rald|date=1983|title=Tar sand extractions with microemulsions: I-the dissolution of light hydrocarbons by microemulsions using 2-butoxyethanol and diethylmethylamine as cosurfactants|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=61|issue=5|pages=672\u2013679|doi=10.1002/cjce.5450610509|issn=0008-4034}}</ref>\n\n=== Extractive crystallization ===\nExtractive crystallization is a way to obtain crystal besides using boiling. In the past, researchers used [[Diisopropylamine|di-isopropylamine]] (DIPA) to extract water; however, to get the crystal, it need to wait for the solution cool down. To reduce the energy used in refrigeration, diethylmethylamine is decided to use in extractive crystallization since it has similar properties as DIPA and higher [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical solution temperature]]. Critical solution temperature is the boundary that the mixture will mix. If the temperature is under the critical solution temperature, the mixture will remain the state of not mixed. So, a higher critical solution temperature means no refrigeration was needed. From the experiment, first, at low temperature (10<sup>o</sup>C to -0.5<sup>o</sup>C), diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium chloride; however, the percentage of sodium chloride in the organic phase increases. The best temperature range is 5<sup>o</sup>C to 10<sup>o</sup>C. In this range, the solubility of sodium chloride is relatively insensitive to temperature. For the diethylmethylamine/sodium chloride system, the lowest critical solution temperature is -0.6<sup>o</sup>C. Second, diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium sulfate at room temperature (21<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C). In this range, sodium sulfate solubility in diethylmethylamine is relatively insensitive to temperature. Further, for the diethylmethylamine/sodium sulfate system, the lowest critical solution temperature is 20<sup>o</sup>C.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ting|first=Andrew M.|last2=Lynn|first2=Scott|last3=Prausnitz|first3=John M.|date=1992-04-01|title=Liquid-liquid equilibria for aqueous systems containing N,N-diethylmethylamine and sodium chloride or sodium sulfate|journal=Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data|volume=37|issue=2|pages=252\u2013259|doi=10.1021/je00006a032|issn=0021-9568}}</ref>\n\n== Reaction with other chemical ==\n\n=== Interfacial bonding mechanisms between iron and diethylmethylamine ===\nMetal are easily be corroded when expose in environment, so polymers are always used on the surface of the metal inhibit it from erosion. Although it's common to use polymers on the surface of metal to prevent it from corrosive things, the interfacial bonding mechanisms between them are not understandable yet. Research was done to understand the intersection mechanisms of dissolved diethylmethylamine (dissolve in [[tetrahydrofuran]]) to iron surface. From the [[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]] (FTIR) result of unrinsed and rinsed sample, researchers discovered that diethylmethylamine bonds to Fe surface were washed away because of the rinsing. The potential-time respond showed, the potential maintained constant for both unrinsed and rinsed sample. Further test by [[Attenuated total reflectance|ATR-FTIR]] about the iron surface indicated through the reaction all molecular compound still remains the same as original.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=P.|last2=Terryn|first2=H.|last3=Mol|first3=J.M.C.|date=2015-11-01|title=An in situ study of amine and amide molecular interaction on Fe surfaces|journal=Applied Surface Science|volume=354|pages=242\u2013249|doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.08.042|bibcode=2015ApSS..354..242T|issn=0169-4332}}</ref>\n\n=== Substrate of trimethylamine dehydrogenase half reaction ===\n[[Trimethylamine dehydrogenase]] is an enzyme which used as catalyst in [[chemical reaction]]. Since it's enzyme, a substrate is needed to study the reductive half-reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase.

It is an industrial chemical that is mainly used in the [[desalination]] of [[brackish water]] or used as a chemical intermediate and acid neutralizer. ''N'',''N''-Diethylmethylamine is a clear, colorless to pale yellow liquid at room temperature.\n\nDiethylmethylamine is a dangerous and toxic chemical which will cause serious injuries to the human body. There is evidence showing that skin contact with diethylmethylamine will cause a sensitization reaction in some people and chronic exposure may lead to organ damage. Diethylmethylamine can be converted to [[nitrosamine]] through nitrosating agents. In general Nitrosamines are considered to be [[carcinogen|carcinogenic]]. However, it occurs during production in certain foods, cosmetic, and hygeine products as an unwanted byproduct. Not only from the production, nitrosamine can also form during the preparation of production, even at room temperature. The use of [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] can inhibit the formation of nitrosamine. For consumers' safety, commercial goods with a significant amount of nitrosamine are not allowed. Due to those reasons, it must be carefully stored in approved plastic containers and avoid contact with acid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-236115.pdf|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine|last=|first=|date=|website=Santa Cruz Biotechnology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\nDiethylmethylamine can be produced by the reaction between [[Methyl p-toluate|methyl toluate]] and [[diethylamine]]:\n\nCH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub> + HN(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n\nThis reaction required a temperature between 200<sup>o</sup>C to 250<sup>o</sup>C and a pressure between atmospheric and 1000 [[Pounds per square inch|p.s.i]]. The diethylmethylamine produced by the reaction is a typical organic tertiary amine which have the same characteristic as other amine. This was obtained from the experiment results. Since in this reaction, diethylmethylamine is an additional product which only have a little amount, the industrial production may use other reaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Class|first=J.B.|title=Production of diethylemthylamine|publisher=United States Patent Office|year=1960|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nBasic properties like density and melting point are shown in the information box. The properties also contained part that need be discussed in micro level. Since diethylmethylamine is a polymer, it can have several isomers, the structural of the molecular is always focused.\n\n===Molecular structure and conformation===\nDue to the rotation of a single bond, [[Conformational isomerism|conformational isomers]] are formed. Conformational isomers have the same structural formula but different characteristic. This has always been interested by the scientist. In 1978, Crocker and Goggin had experimented on determined the conformation of diethylmethylamine. They used [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]] and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectra]] on diethylmethylamine in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Results showed two conformers exist in the solid phase and can be determined as tt (trans-trans conformer) and g<sup>+</sup>t (gauche<sup>+</sup>-trans conformer). Because of the complexity of the vapor spectrum, they can only infer there are two or more conformers that exist in the gas phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Christopher|last2=Goggin|first2=Peter L.|date=1978|title=Infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of conformations in liquid and solid triethyl-, diethyl(methyl)- and ethyldimethyl-amines, -phosphines, and -arsines|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions|issue=5|pages=388|doi=10.1039/dt9780000388|issn=0300-9246}}</ref>\n\nPresent studies used gas-phase IR spectra and FT-Raman spectra of the liquid to get more detailed results. The results of the regular coordinate analysis indicated there were four conformers, and the [[diffraction]] data showed the conformation of diethylmethylamine is 35 (14)% tt + 27 (14)% g<sup>+</sup>t + 20 (17)% g<sup>-</sup>t (gauche<sup>-</sup>-trans conformer) + 18 (23)% g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup>(gauche<sup>+</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer). To confirm the result, a [[Vibrational analysis with scanning probe microscopy|vibrational analysis]] of hydrocarbon analog in the liquid phase was done, and it identified the conformers were the same as diffraction data showed. Moreover, tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers were found more stable than the other two. The conformational stability of diethylmethylamine can be explained by the numbers of trans CNCC fragment that two fragments of tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers trans conformation and one fragment of g<sup>-</sup>t and g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup> conformers trans conformation. Further study showed the reason why diethylmethylamine did't have a g<sup>-</sup>g<sup>+</sup> (gauche<sup>-</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer) conformer that is the steric repulsion between terminal methyl groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Hiroshi|last2=Ito|first2=Masaki|last3=Egawa|first3=Toru|date=2007-09-17|title=Molecular structure and conformation of diethylmethylamine determined by gas electron diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure|volume=840|issue=1\u20133|pages=107\u2013113|doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2006.11.027|bibcode=2007JMoSt.840..107T|hdl=2115/28245|issn=0022-2860}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereodynamics (dynamics of stereochemical reaction) of N,N-diethylmethylamine ===\ndiethylmethylamine is the simplest trialkylamine that can be tested with two processes about the nitrogen atom in it. The first one is indeed pyramidal inversion, and the second is the isolated rotation of nitrogen carbon bond. From these two processes, the <sup>1</sup>H dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy obtained clear evidence for nitrogen [[pyramidal inversion]]. Also, the result indicates there were several \" familiars\" of [[rotamer]]s exist in diethylmethylamine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bushweller|first=C.H.|last2=Fleischman|first2=S.P.|last3=Grady|first3=G.L.|last4=McGoff|first4=P.|last5=Rithner|first5=C.D.|last6=Whalon|first6=M.R.|last7=Brennan|first7=J.G.|last8=Marcantonio|first8=R.P.|last9=Dominigue|first9=R.P.|date=1982-11-01|title=Stereodynamics of diethylmethylamine and triethylamine|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=104|issue=23|pages=6224\u20136236|doi=10.1021/ja00387a012}}</ref>\n\n=== Rotation inversion ===\nRotation is part of the conformational isomer, so study the rotational isomer help the scientists to understand the chemical better. Rotation study of diethylmethylamine was done by Bushweller and Laurenzi. From the research image of <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine at 200 K, ethyl group shows a A<sub>2</sub> X<sub>3</sub> spectrum and N-methyl protons shows a [[singlet]]. Two resonances can be tested in temperature range 140 K to 200 K---N-methyl and C-methyl resonances and they are independent. The result of DNMR also indicated, the slow nitrogen inversion in diethylmethylamine was caused by the coalescence phenomenon connected with CH<sub>2</sub> resonance. The nitrogen inversion process in diethylmethylamine contained not only the inversion of nitrogen but also rotation about the C-N bond, which can be named as inversion rotation. Inversion rotation means nitrogen inversion always occur with rotation about the C-N bond. Other studies found out that at low temperature (99 K), the <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine has more change. At 99 K, N-methyl and C-methyl resonance separate into more peaks. Two important things need to be mentioned. First, peaks of the N-methyl in diethylmethylamine can be assumed as broad singlets. Second, the C-methyl resonance can be assumed as equivalent for all three methyl protons.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bushweller|first=C.

In research, it can be the lineshape standard of the NMR test. In industry, it always play a role in extraction reaction due to its characteristic.\n\n=== Lineshape standard of nuclear magnetic resonance experiment ===\nFor an [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) experiment, the most important thing is to make sure the existence of narrow peak and maximum sensitivity, which can be achieved by adjusting shimming field to enhance the [[magnetic field]] homogeneity. A typically used sample is not very useful during low temperature (150 K) experiments, because the peak showed will broaden. Since no available samples can use in low temperature experiments, many tests were done under the condition that the researchers assume the field condition was the same for both low-temperature terms and room temperature conditions. This will influence the NMR result since the change in inhomogeneity is hard to notice. There were research shows in some instrument, re-shimming the field after changing temperature could improve the homogeneity. So, something is a liquid at standard temperature, and pressure has a low melting point is needed.\n\nN, N-diethylmethylamine was used to experiment. As the experimental results show, diethylmethylamine is useful in shimming magnetic field around 140 K. With other research, diethylmethylamine can be used in shimming the magnetic field at room temperature in NMR experiments and low temperature in dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. diethylmethylamine was very useful around 140 K; however, many low-temperature experiments need to proceed below 140 K. Future research need to focus on finding efficiency substitute of diethylmethylamine to work in experiments below 140 K. For now, diethylmethylamine is the best choice among all substances for low-temperature NMR experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritzsching|first=Keith J.|last2=Itin|first2=Boris|last3=McDermott|first3=Ann E.|date=2018-02-21|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine as lineshape standard for NMR above 130\u202fK|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance|volume=287|pages=110\u2013112|doi=10.1016/j.jmr.2017.12.021|pmid=29335163|pmc=5821130|bibcode=2018JMagR.287..110F|issn=1090-7807}}</ref>\n\n=== Extraction of oil sand with microemulsions===\n[[Oil sands|Tar sand]] is an important source of petroleum, which contain 60 percent of the petroleum around the world. Extracting oil from tar sand has become an important part for nowadays industry. One way to extract oil is by using [[microemulsion]]s which are a mixture of oil, water and [[surfactant]]. Extracting oil sand with microemulsions, an important step is to decentralize the light hydrocarbons in the aqueous medium. Usually, alcohols are used as cosurfactants in the microemulsions. A good cosurfactants has two conditions which are strong acid-base type interaction with water and good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. However, some studies showed that diethylmethylamine is a more effective cosurfactants in water than commonly used alcohol. Experimental results indicated that a system based on diethylmethylamine and system based on simple alcohols have a similar feature in microemulsions. The result also pointed out diethylmethylamine reacts as medium chain length alcohols, which has both good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance and high solubility in water and many types of oil. However, this property causes diethylmethylamine has high efficiency and low specificity on nature and temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desnoyers|first=Jacques E.|last2=Quirion|first2=Fran\u00e7ois|last3=H\u00c9Tu|first3=Daniel|last4=Perron|first4=G\u00c9Rald|date=1983|title=Tar sand extractions with microemulsions: I-the dissolution of light hydrocarbons by microemulsions using 2-butoxyethanol and diethylmethylamine as cosurfactants|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=61|issue=5|pages=672\u2013679|doi=10.1002/cjce.5450610509|issn=0008-4034}}</ref>\n\n=== Extractive crystallization ===\nExtractive crystallization is a way to obtain crystal besides using boiling. In the past, researchers used [[Diisopropylamine|di-isopropylamine]] (DIPA) to extract water; however, to get the crystal, it need to wait for the solution cool down. To reduce the energy used in refrigeration, diethylmethylamine is decided to use in extractive crystallization since it has similar properties as DIPA and higher [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical solution temperature]]. Critical solution temperature is the boundary that the mixture will mix. If the temperature is under the critical solution temperature, the mixture will remain the state of not mixed. So, a higher critical solution temperature means no refrigeration was needed. From the experiment, first, at low temperature (10<sup>o</sup>C to -0.5<sup>o</sup>C), diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium chloride; however, the percentage of sodium chloride in the organic phase increases. The best temperature range is 5<sup>o</sup>C to 10<sup>o</sup>C. In this range, the solubility of sodium chloride is relatively insensitive to temperature. For the diethylmethylamine/sodium chloride system, the lowest critical solution temperature is -0.6<sup>o</sup>C. Second, diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium sulfate at room temperature (21<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C). In this range, sodium sulfate solubility in diethylmethylamine is relatively insensitive to temperature. Further, for the diethylmethylamine/sodium sulfate system, the lowest critical solution temperature is 20<sup>o</sup>C.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ting|first=Andrew M.|last2=Lynn|first2=Scott|last3=Prausnitz|first3=John M.|date=1992-04-01|title=Liquid-liquid equilibria for aqueous systems containing N,N-diethylmethylamine and sodium chloride or sodium sulfate|journal=Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data|volume=37|issue=2|pages=252\u2013259|doi=10.1021/je00006a032|issn=0021-9568}}</ref>\n\n== Reaction with other chemical ==\n\n=== Interfacial bonding mechanisms between iron and diethylmethylamine ===\nMetal are easily be corroded when expose in environment, so polymers are always used on the surface of the metal inhibit it from erosion. Although it's common to use polymers on the surface of metal to prevent it from corrosive things, the interfacial bonding mechanisms between them are not understandable yet. Research was done to understand the intersection mechanisms of dissolved diethylmethylamine (dissolve in [[tetrahydrofuran]]) to iron surface. From the [[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]] (FTIR) result of unrinsed and rinsed sample, researchers discovered that diethylmethylamine bonds to Fe surface were washed away because of the rinsing. The potential-time respond showed, the potential maintained constant for both unrinsed and rinsed sample.

An outwardly simple tale of a linen weaver, it is notable for its strong [[realist novel|realism]] and its sophisticated treatment of a variety of issues ranging from religion to industrialisation to community.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel is set in the early years of the 19th century. Silas Marner, a weaver, is a member of a small [[Calvinist]] congregation in Lantern Yard, a slum street in [[Northern England]]. He is falsely accused of stealing the congregation's funds while watching over the very ill deacon. Two clues are given against Silas: a pocket knife, and the discovery in his own house of the bag formerly containing the money. There is the strong suggestion that Silas' best friend, William Dane, has framed him since Silas had lent his pocket knife to William shortly before the crime was committed. Lots are drawn in the belief \u2013 shared by Silas \u2013 that God will direct the process and establish the truth, but they indicate that Silas is guilty. The woman Silas was to marry breaks their engagement and marries William instead. With his life shattered, his trust in God lost, and his heart broken, Silas leaves Lantern Yard and the city for a rural area where he is unknown.\n\nMarner travels south to the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and settles near the rural village of Raveloe in [[Warwickshire]] where he lives isolated and alone, choosing to have only minimal contact with the residents beyond his work as a linen weaver. He devotes himself wholeheartedly to his craft and comes to adore the gold coins he earns and hoards from his weaving.\n\nOne foggy night, the two bags of gold are stolen by Dunstan (\"Dunsey\") Cass, a dissolute younger son of Squire Cass, the town's leading landowner. On discovering the theft, Silas sinks into a deep depression despite the villagers' attempts to aid him. Dunsey immediately disappears, but the community makes little of this disappearance since he has vanished several times before.\n\nGodfrey Cass, Dunsey's elder brother, also harbours a secret past. He is married to, but estranged from, Molly Farren, an [[opium]]-addicted working-class woman living in another town. This secret prevents Godfrey from marrying Nancy Lammeter, a young middle-class woman. On a winter's night, Molly tries to make her way to Squire Cass's New Year's Eve party with her two-year-old girl to announce that she is Godfrey's wife. On the way, she collapses in the snow and loses consciousness. The child wanders away and into Silas' house. Silas follows the child's tracks in the snow and discovers the woman dead. When he goes to the party for help, Godfrey heads outdoors to the scene of the accident, but resolves to tell no one that Molly was his wife. Molly's death, conveniently for Godfrey and Nancy, puts an end to the marriage.\n\nSilas keeps the child and names her Eppie, after his deceased mother and sister, both named [[Hephzibah]]. Eppie changes Silas' life completely. Silas has been robbed of his material gold, but thinks that he has it returned to him symbolically in the form of the golden-haired child. Godfrey Cass is now free to marry Nancy, but continues to conceal the fact of his previous marriage\u2014and child\u2014from her. However, he aids Marner in caring for Eppie with occasional financial gifts. More practical help and support in bringing up the child is provided by Dolly Winthrop, a kindly neighbour of Marner's. Dolly's help and advice assist Marner not only in bringing up Eppie, but also in integrating them into village society.\n\nSixteen years pass, and Eppie grows up to be the pride of the village. She has a strong bond with Silas, who through her has found a place in the rural society and a purpose in life. Meanwhile, Godfrey and Nancy mourn their own childless state, after the death of their baby. Eventually, the skeleton of Dunstan Cass\u2014still clutching Silas' gold\u2014is found at the bottom of the stone quarry near Silas' home, and the money is duly returned to Silas. Shocked by this revelation, and coming to the realisation of his own conscience, Godfrey confesses to Nancy that Molly was his first wife and that Eppie is his child. They offer to raise her as a gentleman's daughter, but this would mean Eppie would have to forsake living with Silas. Eppie politely but firmly refuses, saying, \"I can't think o' no happiness without him.\"\n\nSilas revisits Lantern Yard, but his old neighbourhood has been \"swept away\" in the intervening years and replaced by a large factory. No one seems to know what happened to Lantern Yard's inhabitants. However, Silas contentedly resigns himself to the fact that he will never know and now leads a happy existence among his self-made family and friends. In the end, Eppie marries a local boy she has grown up with, Dolly's son Aaron, and they move into Silas' house, which has been newly improved courtesy of Godfrey. Silas' actions through the years in caring for Eppie have apparently provided joy for everyone, and the extended family celebrates its happiness.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Silas and Eppie.jpg|thumb|\"Silas finds Eppie\"]]\n* '''Silas Marner''': lower class by birth, a weaver who is betrayed at Lantern Yard (site of a dissenting sect) by his treacherous friend William Dane, moves away to Raveloe (where the community is Church of England), becomes taken for a miser, as he accumulates a small fortune, only to have it stolen by Dunstan Cass.

An outwardly simple tale of a linen weaver, it is notable for its strong [[realist novel|realism]] and its sophisticated treatment of a variety of issues ranging from religion to industrialisation to community.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel is set in the early years of the 19th century. Silas Marner, a weaver, is a member of a small [[Calvinist]] congregation in Lantern Yard, a slum street in [[Northern England]]. He is falsely accused of stealing the congregation's funds while watching over the very ill deacon. Two clues are given against Silas: a pocket knife, and the discovery in his own house of the bag formerly containing the money. There is the strong suggestion that Silas' best friend, William Dane, has framed him since Silas had lent his pocket knife to William shortly before the crime was committed. Lots are drawn in the belief \u2013 shared by Silas \u2013 that God will direct the process and establish the truth, but they indicate that Silas is guilty. The woman Silas was to marry breaks their engagement and marries William instead. With his life shattered, his trust in God lost, and his heart broken, Silas leaves Lantern Yard and the city for a rural area where he is unknown.\n\nMarner travels south to the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and settles near the rural village of Raveloe in [[Warwickshire]] where he lives isolated and alone, choosing to have only minimal contact with the residents beyond his work as a linen weaver. He devotes himself wholeheartedly to his craft and comes to adore the gold coins he earns and hoards from his weaving.\n\nOne foggy night, the two bags of gold are stolen by Dunstan (\"Dunsey\") Cass, a dissolute younger son of Squire Cass, the town's leading landowner. On discovering the theft, Silas sinks into a deep depression despite the villagers' attempts to aid him. Dunsey immediately disappears, but the community makes little of this disappearance since he has vanished several times before.\n\nGodfrey Cass, Dunsey's elder brother, also harbours a secret past. He is married to, but estranged from, Molly Farren, an [[opium]]-addicted working-class woman living in another town. This secret prevents Godfrey from marrying Nancy Lammeter, a young middle-class woman. On a winter's night, Molly tries to make her way to Squire Cass's New Year's Eve party with her two-year-old girl to announce that she is Godfrey's wife. On the way, she collapses in the snow and loses consciousness. The child wanders away and into Silas' house. Silas follows the child's tracks in the snow and discovers the woman dead. When he goes to the party for help, Godfrey heads outdoors to the scene of the accident, but resolves to tell no one that Molly was his wife. Molly's death, conveniently for Godfrey and Nancy, puts an end to the marriage.\n\nSilas keeps the child and names her Eppie, after his deceased mother and sister, both named [[Hephzibah]]. Eppie changes Silas' life completely. Silas has been robbed of his material gold, but thinks that he has it returned to him symbolically in the form of the golden-haired child. Godfrey Cass is now free to marry Nancy, but continues to conceal the fact of his previous marriage\u2014and child\u2014from her. However, he aids Marner in caring for Eppie with occasional financial gifts. More practical help and support in bringing up the child is provided by Dolly Winthrop, a kindly neighbour of Marner's. Dolly's help and advice assist Marner not only in bringing up Eppie, but also in integrating them into village society.\n\nSixteen years pass, and Eppie grows up to be the pride of the village. She has a strong bond with Silas, who through her has found a place in the rural society and a purpose in life. Meanwhile, Godfrey and Nancy mourn their own childless state, after the death of their baby. Eventually, the skeleton of Dunstan Cass\u2014still clutching Silas' gold\u2014is found at the bottom of the stone quarry near Silas' home, and the money is duly returned to Silas. Shocked by this revelation, and coming to the realisation of his own conscience, Godfrey confesses to Nancy that Molly was his first wife and that Eppie is his child. They offer to raise her as a gentleman's daughter, but this would mean Eppie would have to forsake living with Silas. Eppie politely but firmly refuses, saying, \"I can't think o' no happiness without him.\"\n\nSilas revisits Lantern Yard, but his old neighbourhood has been \"swept away\" in the intervening years and replaced by a large factory. No one seems to know what happened to Lantern Yard's inhabitants. However, Silas contentedly resigns himself to the fact that he will never know and now leads a happy existence among his self-made family and friends. In the end, Eppie marries a local boy she has grown up with, Dolly's son Aaron, and they move into Silas' house, which has been newly improved courtesy of Godfrey. Silas' actions through the years in caring for Eppie have apparently provided joy for everyone, and the extended family celebrates its happiness.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Silas and Eppie.jpg|thumb|\"Silas finds Eppie\"]]\n* '''Silas Marner''': lower class by birth, a weaver who is betrayed at Lantern Yard (site of a dissenting sect) by his treacherous friend William Dane, moves away to Raveloe (where the community is Church of England), becomes taken for a miser, as he accumulates a small fortune, only to have it stolen by Dunstan Cass.

In 1071, at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], a city in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine-controlled]] Eastern Anatolia, the Seljuk Turks routed the Byzantine armies and captured the Byzantine emperor.\nIn the resulting chaos, the Turks easily overran much of the Byzantine empire and, despite Byzantine reconquests and occasional western incursions in the form of crusading armies, a series of Turkish states were established in Anatolia.  These Turkic tribes came around the south end of the Caspian Sea for the most part, and hence absorbed and transmitted [[Islamic]] culture and civilization in contrast to other Turks who, such as the [[Cumans]], became partially Westernized and Christianized. With some superiority in population{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} and organization, regional power naturally came to rest in the hands of the Turkic speaking population. Many Turkic people came into the region fleeing from the [[Mongol]] invasions, and others later came in as soldiers fighting in the ranks of Mongol armies.  Turkic Islamized populations also absorbed large numbers of the older inhabitants of Asia Minor, including Greeks, Phyrigians, and Armenians, who went over to the Islamic religion and Turkic language, creating a frontier society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Armenian communities continued to flourish under relatively tolerant Ottoman rule for centuries, either as minority populations in urban areas or as exclusively Armenian towns in rural areas. In cities such as [[Istanbul]] and [[\u0130zmir]], Armenians played particularly important roles; an 1851 report in ''[[The New York Times]]'', for instance, indicates that Armenians comprised nearly one quarter of the population of Istanbul at that time, with over 200,000 residents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1854/03/10/archives/the-asias-newsthe-greek-insurrection.html\n|accessdate=2008-08-14\n|title=The Asia's News\u2014The Greek Insurrection\n|work=[[The New York Times]]\n|date=1854-03-10\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Akdamar and mountain.jpg|thumb|225px|Abandoned since 1915, the tenth-century [[Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross]] on [[Akhtamar Island]] underwent a controversial restoration in 2006, paid for by the Turkish Ministry of Culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9987685\n|title=Unearthing the past, endangering the future\n|work=Economist\n|date=2007-10-18\n|accessdate=2008-08-14\n}}<!-- readers' comments: http://www.economist.com/blogs/theinbox/2007/11/unearthing_the_past_endangerin.cfm --></ref>]]\n\n===Armenian\u2013Turkish relations during the decline of the Ottoman Empire===\n====Hamidian rule====\nFor a half century leading up to World War I, the Armenian populations of [[Anatolia]] became increasingly politically active, and in turn endured increasingly more brutal persecution under Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]].

Within two months of its signing, the Ottoman Empire reneged on the treaty by invading the nascent Armenian state, being stopped at the [[Battle of Sardarabad]]. The invasion culminated in the [[Treaty of Batum]] in June 1918.\n\n===The interwar period, and the Soviet era===\n{{See also|Turkish\u2013Armenian War|Armenian SSR}}\nThe [[interwar period]] was marked by the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]; Anatolia became the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923. [[Turkish revolutionaries]] waged the [[Turkish War of Independence]] against Ottoman loyalists and neighboring countries, and engaged in continuing conflict with the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]].\n\nOn September 24, 1920, Turkish forces invaded and advanced unto Sarighamish and Kars resulting in the [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War]]. [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] sent delegations to Moscow; the DRA would ultimately become the [[Armenian SSR]] of the Soviet Union. The [[Treaty of Kars]], identical to the previously concluded Russo-Turkish [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]], was signed on October 23, 1921, between the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] and representatives of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]], [[Armenian SSR|Soviet Armenia]], [[Azerbaijani SSR|Soviet Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Georgia]] (all of which formed part of the Soviet Union after the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|December 1922 Union Treaty]]).\n\nThe Soviet Union and Turkey remained officially neutral after the Treaty of Kars, and there was no hostility between Turkey and the Armenian SSR. The land border was closed except for the Kars\u2013Leninakan railway.\n\n====Capital tax and A\u015fkale====\nDuring World War II, an extremely high tax burden was imposed on Armenian, Greek and Jewish citizens of Turkey, and tax assessors had a free hand in determining the amount, often amounts that could not be paid. In the winter of 1942, hundreds who could not pay, including elderly men, were brought to the town of [[A\u015fkale]], with very harsh winters, and made to shovel snow continually for as much as five months. Some were able to pay locals to perform the labor for them, and some succumbed to the cold and conditions, sleeping in barns, coffeehouses, or anywhere else they could get shelter.<ref>Yalcin, Kemal. \"[http://www.gomidas.org/books/KemalYalcin.htm You Rejoice My Heart]\", [[Gomidas Institute]], London. 2007, pp. 78\u201389</ref> The book \"You Rejoice My Heart\" by Turkish author [[Kemal Yal\u00e7\u0131n]] includes a visit by the author to A\u015fkale in the 1990s to learn first hand about the tax and the labor camps, the conditions and the victims at a time when this incident was dangerous and taboo to discuss in Turkey.<ref>Yal\u00e7\u0131n, Kemal.

Ankara, however, refused to establish diplomatic relations with Yerevan, as well as to launch the two Turkish-Armenian border gates, such as Alijan \u2013 Margaran and Dogukap \u2013 Akhurik. Turkey put forward two preconditions: Armenia must recognize the Turkish-Armenian border, which was established under the [[Treaty of Kars]] in 1921, that is, waive territorial claims, as well as put an end to the process of international recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aniarc.am/2017/11/02/armenia-turkey-100-years-of-diplomatic-relations-standpoint-of-armenia/|title=Armenia-Turkey: 100 years of Diplomatic Relations; Standpoint of Armenia {{!}} Aniarc|website=www.aniarc.am|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic freeze===\n====Nagorno-Karabakh War====\n{{Main|Nagorno-Karabakh War}}\n\nTurkey was an active member of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]] created in 1992 by the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] to mediate an end to the conflict between Armenia and Turkey's fellow Turkic ally [[Azerbaijan]] over the disputed [[autonomous oblast]] of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], which had been raging since the oblast's parliament had voted to unify with Armenia on February 20, 1988, but the group made little progress and full-scale fighting quickly re-erupted.\n\nArmenia\u2013Turkey relations gradually worsened as the Armenian military continued to make gains in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and the May 9, 1992 [[capture of Shusha]] by the Armenians resulted in [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Turkish Prime Minister]] [[Suleyman Demirel]] coming under intense public pressure to intervene. Demirel opposed such intervention, saying that Turkey's entrance into the war would trigger an even greater Muslim\u2013Christian conflict. Turkey did not send troops to aid Azerbaijan, but provided Azerbaijan with military aid and advisors.\n\nSubsequent ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh of all of its Azerbaijani population which culminated in the [[Khojaly Massacre]] in February 1992 and of the ethnic cleansing of Armenians living in other regions of Azerbaijan, as was the case during the [[Baku Pogrom]], further aggravated relations, which have never really recovered.\n\n====United Nations Security Council Resolution 822====\nTurkey cosponsored [[UN Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 822|Resolution 822]] affirming Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and demanding that Armenian forces withdraw from Kelbajar.

In 1071, at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], a city in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine-controlled]] Eastern Anatolia, the Seljuk Turks routed the Byzantine armies and captured the Byzantine emperor.\nIn the resulting chaos, the Turks easily overran much of the Byzantine empire and, despite Byzantine reconquests and occasional western incursions in the form of crusading armies, a series of Turkish states were established in Anatolia.  These Turkic tribes came around the south end of the Caspian Sea for the most part, and hence absorbed and transmitted [[Islamic]] culture and civilization in contrast to other Turks who, such as the [[Cumans]], became partially Westernized and Christianized. With some superiority in population{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} and organization, regional power naturally came to rest in the hands of the Turkic speaking population. Many Turkic people came into the region fleeing from the [[Mongol]] invasions, and others later came in as soldiers fighting in the ranks of Mongol armies.  Turkic Islamized populations also absorbed large numbers of the older inhabitants of Asia Minor, including Greeks, Phyrigians, and Armenians, who went over to the Islamic religion and Turkic language, creating a frontier society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} Armenian communities continued to flourish under relatively tolerant Ottoman rule for centuries, either as minority populations in urban areas or as exclusively Armenian towns in rural areas. In cities such as [[Istanbul]] and [[\u0130zmir]], Armenians played particularly important roles; an 1851 report in ''[[The New York Times]]'', for instance, indicates that Armenians comprised nearly one quarter of the population of Istanbul at that time, with over 200,000 residents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1854/03/10/archives/the-asias-newsthe-greek-insurrection.html\n|accessdate=2008-08-14\n|title=The Asia's News\u2014The Greek Insurrection\n|work=[[The New York Times]]\n|date=1854-03-10\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Akdamar and mountain.jpg|thumb|225px|Abandoned since 1915, the tenth-century [[Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross]] on [[Akhtamar Island]] underwent a controversial restoration in 2006, paid for by the Turkish Ministry of Culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9987685\n|title=Unearthing the past, endangering the future\n|work=Economist\n|date=2007-10-18\n|accessdate=2008-08-14\n}}<!-- readers' comments: http://www.economist.com/blogs/theinbox/2007/11/unearthing_the_past_endangerin.cfm --></ref>]]\n\n===Armenian\u2013Turkish relations during the decline of the Ottoman Empire===\n====Hamidian rule====\nFor a half century leading up to World War I, the Armenian populations of [[Anatolia]] became increasingly politically active, and in turn endured increasingly more brutal persecution under Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]].

The [[Treaty of Kars]], identical to the previously concluded Russo-Turkish [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]], was signed on October 23, 1921, between the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] and representatives of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]], [[Armenian SSR|Soviet Armenia]], [[Azerbaijani SSR|Soviet Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Georgia]] (all of which formed part of the Soviet Union after the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|December 1922 Union Treaty]]).\n\nThe Soviet Union and Turkey remained officially neutral after the Treaty of Kars, and there was no hostility between Turkey and the Armenian SSR. The land border was closed except for the Kars\u2013Leninakan railway.\n\n====Capital tax and A\u015fkale====\nDuring World War II, an extremely high tax burden was imposed on Armenian, Greek and Jewish citizens of Turkey, and tax assessors had a free hand in determining the amount, often amounts that could not be paid. In the winter of 1942, hundreds who could not pay, including elderly men, were brought to the town of [[A\u015fkale]], with very harsh winters, and made to shovel snow continually for as much as five months. Some were able to pay locals to perform the labor for them, and some succumbed to the cold and conditions, sleeping in barns, coffeehouses, or anywhere else they could get shelter.<ref>Yalcin, Kemal. \"[http://www.gomidas.org/books/KemalYalcin.htm You Rejoice My Heart]\", [[Gomidas Institute]], London. 2007, pp. 78\u201389</ref> The book \"You Rejoice My Heart\" by Turkish author [[Kemal Yal\u00e7\u0131n]] includes a visit by the author to A\u015fkale in the 1990s to learn first hand about the tax and the labor camps, the conditions and the victims at a time when this incident was dangerous and taboo to discuss in Turkey.<ref>Yal\u00e7\u0131n, Kemal.

Ankara, however, refused to establish diplomatic relations with Yerevan, as well as to launch the two Turkish-Armenian border gates, such as Alijan \u2013 Margaran and Dogukap \u2013 Akhurik. Turkey put forward two preconditions: Armenia must recognize the Turkish-Armenian border, which was established under the [[Treaty of Kars]] in 1921, that is, waive territorial claims, as well as put an end to the process of international recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aniarc.am/2017/11/02/armenia-turkey-100-years-of-diplomatic-relations-standpoint-of-armenia/|title=Armenia-Turkey: 100 years of Diplomatic Relations; Standpoint of Armenia {{!}} Aniarc|website=www.aniarc.am|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic freeze===\n====Nagorno-Karabakh War====\n{{Main|Nagorno-Karabakh War}}\n\nTurkey was an active member of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]] created in 1992 by the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] to mediate an end to the conflict between Armenia and Turkey's fellow Turkic ally [[Azerbaijan]] over the disputed [[autonomous oblast]] of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], which had been raging since the oblast's parliament had voted to unify with Armenia on February 20, 1988, but the group made little progress and full-scale fighting quickly re-erupted.\n\nArmenia\u2013Turkey relations gradually worsened as the Armenian military continued to make gains in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and the May 9, 1992 [[capture of Shusha]] by the Armenians resulted in [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Turkish Prime Minister]] [[Suleyman Demirel]] coming under intense public pressure to intervene. Demirel opposed such intervention, saying that Turkey's entrance into the war would trigger an even greater Muslim\u2013Christian conflict. Turkey did not send troops to aid Azerbaijan, but provided Azerbaijan with military aid and advisors.\n\nSubsequent ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh of all of its Azerbaijani population which culminated in the [[Khojaly Massacre]] in February 1992 and of the ethnic cleansing of Armenians living in other regions of Azerbaijan, as was the case during the [[Baku Pogrom]], further aggravated relations, which have never really recovered.\n\n====United Nations Security Council Resolution 822====\nTurkey cosponsored [[UN Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 822|Resolution 822]] affirming Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and demanding that Armenian forces withdraw from Kelbajar.
