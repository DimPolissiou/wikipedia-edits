It was co-founded in [[New York City]]'s fabled [[Spanish Harlem]] by three [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Muslims - John (Yahya) Figueroa, Ramon (Rahim) Ocasio, and Freddie (Ibrahim) Gonzalez, who all lived within five blocks of each other. \n\nAlianza Islamica has become an iconic model for inner-city, grassroots Muslim activism with the new generation of Latino Muslim activists for its emphasis on bringing the message of [[Islam]] and Islamic service to the most disadvantaged and broken. The two remaining founders, Figueroa and Ocasio, have kept Alianza's message legacy alive through lectures, interviews and articles. most of which are available at the website [http://alianzaislamica.org/ alianzaislamica.org.]\n\n== [[History]] ==\nFigueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez all came of age during the tumultuous '60s and early '70s. As teenagers, they became associated with the militant [[Young Lords|Young Lords Party]] during that organization's heyday in New York City. Ocasio, Figueroa, and Gonzalez participated in organizations affiliated with the Party. That organization stood out for its activism, vigorous social and educational programs, and unwavering support for Puerto Rican independence.\n\nAfter ending their association with the YLP, Figueroa and Ocasio briefly joined the [[Nation of Islam]] breakaway group [[The Five-Percent Nation]]. Though short-lived, their exposure to the Nation of Islam, with its strong message of self-reliance and economic independence, was to become a significant influence.\n\nBetween late 1972 and mid-1973, all three of the future founders converted to Islam. In 1975, Figueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez joined the Islamic Party of North America, a Washington, D.C.-based Muslim organization. It was the United States' first constitutionally-based indigenous Islamic organization. With a keen emphasis on disciplined, coordinated activism, the Islamic Party expressed Islam through civic engagement and addressed problems of poverty and social and economic injustice.\n\nOcasio moved to IPNA's Washington headquarters and was eventually elected to that branch's Guidance Council. Meanwhile, Figueroa and Gonzalez continued the Party's work in New York. Ocasio rejoined Figueroa and Gonzalez in New York City in 1978. What followed were years of dawah (Islamic proselytizing) and attempts at organizing, which met with limited success. &nbsp;\n\nIn 1986, the trio collaborated on a successful event at the [[Museo del Barrio]] on Fifth Avenue in New York entitled \"Reclamado Nuestra Herencia Islamica (Reclaiming Our Islamic Heritage). There they met Daniel Ahmad Mena from Florida and Carl Askia Al Amin from Chicago, who, along with Figueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez, formed the first iteration of Alianza Islamica. A virtual, three-city partnership, it most notable accomplishment was its eponymous journal, the first bilingual Islamic periodical ever published in the United States. Logistical problems, however, led to the organization's dissolution after nearly two years.\n\nIn the late 80s, Figueroa and Ocasio discussed going in a new direction: the establishment of a Barrio-based storefront center inspired by the [[Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood]]'s tea room of the '70s. Its calm, non-intimidating ambiance would distinguish the center, and be the antidote to alienating high pressure evangelizing. The center would be an unassuming, unobtrusive, and an organic part of the neighborhood.\n\nMeanwhile, Figueroa's work with recovering addicts led to a sizable number of converts and the first-ever Muslim recovery group, Brothers in Recovery. With these new Muslims at its core, Figueroa and Ocasio decided to resurrect Alianza Islamica. A storefront was secured at 1717 Lexington Avenue, near 107th Street, in El Barrio, Spanish Harlem. \n\nThough Alianza Islamica's priority was the spread of the message of Islam, a more holistic approach was advanced to best serve its disadvantaged community. To that end, Alianza developed GED and ESL programs as well as programs on health and nutrition, employment assistance, and drug counseling. A significant number of spousal abuse cases, primarily in marriages between Latinas and Arab husbands, prompted Alianza Islamica also to take action in and initiate a counseling program in this area.\n\nAt a time when Muslim institutions treated their fellow Muslims who died of [[AIDS]]/[[HIV]] as pariahs, Alianza became the first Islamic organization to ritually wash the bodies of their co-religionists who had died of the disease. Alianza Islamic also conducted outreach programs to educate Muslims and non-Muslims alike on AIDS/HIV. \n\nTo dispel the spectre of the alien, Alianza embarked on Islamizing Latino cultural elements. At religious holidays such as Eid ul Fitr and Eid ul Adha, lamb and chicken replaced pork in traditional dishes, and congas and \"guitarras\" created a soundtrack authentically Muslim and Latino.\n\nAlianza Islamica cleared drug dealers from the neighborhood on at least two occasions. On the second occasion, the owner of a building across the street offered Alianza Islamica a new location in return for their assistance with ridding his building of drug dealers from the notorious Jamaican Posse. Alianza used the opportunity to establish La Mezquita del Barrio, the first Latino Muslim mosque on the East Coast, and quite possibly the nation.\n\nAfter Alianza cleared the drug dealers from the area, the landlord initiated eviction proceedings against Alianza. After its removal from the premises, Alianza resettled at 287 Alexander Avenue in the South Bronx. The organization disbanded shortly after a fire destroyed their building in 2005. &nbsp;\n\n13.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ibrahim Gonzalez, a Bronx artist, activist and musician known for his work in community television and radio, dead at age 57|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/ibrahim-gonzalez-musician-radio-tv-fixture-bronx-activist-dead-57-article-1.1364381|publisher=[[Daily News (New York)]]|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Post Alianza Islamica ==\nIbrahim Gonzalez went on to a distinguished career as a musician, activist, and television and radio personality known primarily for his popular radio show on WBAI.

[[Urea-formaldehyde resin|Urea-formaldehyde]] is more toxic and should be avoided in home use. [[Phenol formaldehyde resin|Phenol-formaldehyde]] products are considered to be relatively hazard-free.

A good part of the men who made up the unit had previous field experience in the [[4th New Jersey Militia]], a three-month enlistment regiment that was disbanded in July 1861 (Company F, for example, was largely made up of men who served in the 4th NJ Militia's Company K). During its field service fighting against the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]], it took part in a number of engagements, such as the [[Battle of Williamsburg]], the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], and the [[Battle of the Wilderness]]. On September 13, 1861, the Sixth was brigaded with the [[55th New York Volunteer Infantry|55th New York, Gardes Lafayette]], the [[Anderson Zouaves|62d New York, Anderson Zouaves]] and the [[102nd Pennsylvania Infantry|102nd Pennsylvania]] (the Old 13th Pittsburgh Washington Infantry), under the command of General [[John J. Peck]]. However, the 6th was soon removed and placed in the \"Second New Jersey Brigade\" along with the [[5th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry]], the [[7th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry]], and the [[8th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry]]. Despite its beginnings as an all-New Jersey unit, regiments from other states were eventually added to the brigade, starting in 1863. It fought as part of the [[Army of the Potomac]]'s [[III Corps (ACW)|III Corps]] until the corps was disbanded in March 1864. From that point until its muster out it was part of the [[II Corps (ACW)|II Corps]].\n\nIn September 1864, the original enlistments of the unit expired by law, and the men who served a full three years were mustered out of service. Men of the 6th New Jersey who had re-enlisted or were recruited after the regiment was formed were folded into the 8th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, with whom they served for the duration of the war.\n\n==Commanders==\n\nThree officers served as Colonel of the regiment:\n\n*James T. Hatfield, who resigned his commission on April 27, 1862.\n*[[Gershom Mott]], who was promoted to Brigadier General on September 7, 1862,\n*[[George C. Burling]], who resigned March 4, 1864, and was brevetted Brigadier General, US Volunteers on March 13, 1865.\n\nWhile Colonel Burling was in brigade command, and after he resigned, the unit was led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Stephen Rose Gilkyson]].\n\n==Original Field & Staff officers==\nMustered in at the end of August/beginning of September 1861 -\n\n*Colonel James T. Hatfield\n*Lieutenant Colonel Simpson R. Stroud\n*Major John P. Van Leer\n*[[Adjutant]] Leonard J. Gordon\n*[[Quartermaster]] Joseph Woodward\n*[[Surgeon]] John Wiley\n*Assistant Surgeon Redfield Sharp\n*[[Chaplain]] Samuel T. Moore\n*[[Sergeant Major]] Charles Merriam\n\nOf the men who made up the 6th New Jersey's initial leadership, only Surgeon Wiley and Chaplain Moore would still serve in their duties when their three-year enlistments expired in September 1864. Colonel Hatfield resigned due to \"disability\" just prior to the 1862 Peninsular Campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Simpson Stroud died of disease in [[Camden, New Jersey]], in November 1861, never seeing any field service. Major John P. Van Leer would be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel to replace Stroud, and was killed in action at the Battle of Williamsburg (briefly leading the regiment before his demise). Adjutant Gordon resigned in January 1862 (his replacement, Lieutenant Aaron Wilkes of Company B, was also killed at the Battle of Williamsburg). Quartermaster Woodward resigned due to disability in April 1863. Assistant Surgeon Sharp was promoted to Surgeon of the 15th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry in July 1862. While Chaplain Moore continued to serve with the 8th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry after September 1864, Surgeon Wiley chose to not re-enlist after three full years, and was honorably mustered out. Sergeant Major Merriam was promoted to 1st Lieutenant of Company H before he resigned in January 1863.\n\n==Casualties==\n\nAccording to the 1876 published work ''Record of Officers and Men of New Jersey in the Civil War'' by [[William S. Stryker]] (a Civil War veteran who was serving as New Jersey's [[Adjutant General]] at the time), a total of 1,434 men were listed as having served in the 6th New Jersey. Through its service in the field, the regiment lost 4 officers and 176 men killed, mortally wounded or died of disease, for a total of 180.<ref>[http://slic.njstatelib.org/slic_files/searchable_publications/civilwar/NJCWn299.html William S.

Their first product was an [[adult video game]] based on ''[[Tetris]]'', which they then offered on [[floppy disks]] in the ad section of ''Computer Magazine''. Around this time [[CD-ROM]] games such as [[The 7th Guest]] were becoming popular, inspiring Van Biesen and Cannie to begin working with Private, one of the larger producers of adult video games at the time. Private released multiple Image-Line CD-ROM games including ''Private Prison'' and ''Private Castle''.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> The company officially adopted the name Image-Line in 1994.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\n===Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin===\nAround the time they released the games for Private, [[IBM]] launched the \"Da Vinci\" contest where the first prizes were color laptops. Image-Line, which at the time had little money, won the contest in the multimedia category after reworking one of their game environments to fit the contest criteria.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nImage-Line took an interest in Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin, the developer who won the overall Da Vinci contest as well as the Game category. They hired the 19-year-old to work for them, and his first game for the company was the game ''Private Investigator.'' <ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> Dambrin's next project for Image-Line was the platform game ''Eat This'',<ref name=\"eat this\"/>  a [[shoot 'em up]] game that involved killing aliens.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nOther Image-Line developers created products such as the [[invoice|invoicing]] program Fact2000 and E-OfficeDirect, a content-based web tool that would a precursor to their later product [[EZGenerator]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> Image-Line also topped the Belgian game charts 4 years in a row with their CD version of the Belgian TV [[game show]] ''[[Blokken]].''<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\n===Audio software===\nIn 1997 Dambrin gained an interest in music applications of the time such as Hammerhead and Rebirth 338, and developed a simple [[MIDI]]-only [[drum machine]] in an effort to merge the two products into a [[step sequencer]] that utilized both rows and steps. Dubbed FruityLoops 1.0, the program didn't fit with Image-Line's other product lines of the time. However, the demo version released in December 1997 became so popular that the number of downloads quickly overwhelmed the Image-Line servers.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> To gather income to support their servers, Image-Line had Dambrin develop an [[EJay]] clone called FruityTracks. Image-Line then served as the program's [[OEM]] for [[Mattel]]. The program was released as Pro-DJ in [[France]] and the [[UK]], and Radio 538 Music Machine in The [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\nImage-Line continued to develop the FruityLoops application from a simple [[drum machine]] into a large and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FruityLoops was eventually renamed [[FL Studio]] for branding purposes and to avoid a prolonged trademark dispute in the [[United States]] with [[Kelloggs]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> FL Studio is now one of the most popular software production systems in the world, and Image-Line's flagship program.<ref name=\"musik\"/> A multitude of [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s have been developed by Image-Line to work with FL Studio, including [[synthesizers]] such as [[Sytrus]] and [[Audio signal processing|effects]] [[plugins]] such as Maximus and Edison.<ref name=\"musik\"/> In 2007 Image-Line released [[Deckadance]], a [[DJ]] [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] program developed by programmer [[Arguru]]. Deckadance works as both a stand-alone program and as a FL Studio plugin.\n\n===Other software===\nBeyond audio products, Image-Line developed and distributed [[EZGenerator]], a software program for website design and maintenance.

company best known for its [[digital audio workstation]] program [[FL Studio]]<ref name=\"musik\"/> and related [[audio plugin|audio plugins]] such as [[Sytrus]]<ref name=\"sytrus\"/> and [[Harmor]].<ref name=\"Harmor\"/> Image-Line was founded in 1994.<ref name=\"Image-Line Company Page\"/> In 2007, Image-Line introduced [[Deckadance]], a virtual DJ console application.<ref name=\"musik\"/> The company also produced [[EZGenerator]], a template-based [[web development|web editing]] program.<ref name=\"awardsez\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early development===\nImage-Wine was founded by Jean-Marie Cannie and Frank Van Biesen, who after seven years of creating [[stock market]] software for Pavell Software, decided in 1992 to branch into [[video games]]. Their first product was an [[adult video game]] based on ''[[Tetris]]'', which they then offered on [[floppy disks]] in the ad section of ''Computer Magazine''. Around this time [[CD-ROM]] games such as [[The 7th Guest]] were becoming popular, inspiring Van Biesen and Cannie to begin working with Private, one of the larger producers of adult video games at the time. Private released multiple Image-Line CD-ROM games including ''Private Prison'' and ''Private Castle''.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> The company officially adopted the name Image-Line in 1994.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\n===Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin===\nAround the time they released the games for Private, [[IBM]] launched the \"Da Vinci\" contest where the first prizes were color laptops. Image-Line, which at the time had little money, won the contest in the multimedia category after reworking one of their game environments to fit the contest criteria.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nImage-Line took an interest in Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin, the developer who won the overall Da Vinci contest as well as the Game category. They hired the 19-year-old to work for them, and his first game for the company was the game ''Private Investigator.'' <ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> Dambrin's next project for Image-Line was the platform game ''Eat This'',<ref name=\"eat this\"/>  a [[shoot 'em up]] game that involved killing aliens.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nOther Image-Line developers created products such as the [[invoice|invoicing]] program Fact2000 and E-OfficeDirect, a content-based web tool that would a precursor to their later product [[EZGenerator]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> Image-Line also topped the Belgian game charts 4 years in a row with their CD version of the Belgian TV [[game show]] ''[[Blokken]].''<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\n===Audio software===\nIn 1997 Dambrin gained an interest in music applications of the time such as Hammerhead and Rebirth 338, and developed a simple [[MIDI]]-only [[drum machine]] in an effort to merge the two products into a [[step sequencer]] that utilized both rows and steps. Dubbed FruityLoops 1.0, the program didn't fit with Image-Line's other product lines of the time. However, the demo version released in December 1997 became so popular that the number of downloads quickly overwhelmed the Image-Line servers.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> To gather income to support their servers, Image-Line had Dambrin develop an [[EJay]] clone called FruityTracks. Image-Line then served as the program's [[OEM]] for [[Mattel]]. The program was released as Pro-DJ in [[France]] and the [[UK]], and Radio 538 Music Machine in The [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\nImage-Line continued to develop the FruityLoops application from a simple [[drum machine]] into a large and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FruityLoops was eventually renamed [[FL Studio]] for branding purposes and to avoid a prolonged trademark dispute in the [[United States]] with [[Kelloggs]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> FL Studio is now one of the most popular software production systems in the world, and Image-Line's flagship program.<ref name=\"musik\"/> A multitude of [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s have been developed by Image-Line to work with FL Studio, including [[synthesizers]] such as [[Sytrus]] and [[Audio signal processing|effects]] [[plugins]] such as Maximus and Edison.<ref name=\"musik\"/> In 2007 Image-Line released [[Deckadance]], a [[DJ]] [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] program developed by programmer [[Arguru]]. Deckadance works as both a stand-alone program and as a FL Studio plugin.\n\n===Other software===\nBeyond audio products, Image-Line developed and distributed [[EZGenerator]], a software program for website design and maintenance. EZGenerator has won multiple awards since its release.<ref name=\"awardsez\"/>\n\n==Products==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:left;\"\n|-\n! Software\n! Release\n!

It tells the story of the amnesiac reptilian-headed Caiman working together with his friend Nikaido to recover his memories and survive in a strange and violent world.\n\nThe series was formerly serialized in [[Shogakukan]]'s ''[[seinen manga|seinen]]'' magazine ''[[Monthly Ikki]]'' since 2000, but after its cessation in 2014 the series was moved to ''Hibana'' in 2015. However, after the cessation of ''Hibana'' in August 2017, the series was transferred to ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' magazine in November 2017 and finished in September 2018.\n\nThe series was licensed for an English-language release by [[Viz Media]] in 2009, which began distributing the manga digitally when it launched SigIKKI, the now-former online English version of ''Ikki'' magazine.\n\nA 12-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]] was broadcast from January to March 2020 in [[Japan]] on [[Tokyo MX]], to be followed by a worldwide [[Netflix]] release in May 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Dorohedoro'' story takes place in a [[post-apocalyptic]] setting,<ref name=\"debut\">{{cite web |title=Viz Media Debuts Apocalyptic Dorohedoro Manga |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2010-03-09/viz-media-debuts-apocalypitic-dorohedoro-manga |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |date=March 10, 2010}}</ref> split in two separate dimensions; the Hole, a dismal cityscape where humans reside; and the Sorcerers' world, home of sorcerers. Despite appearing similar, humans and sorcerers are two distinct species, the former evolving naturally, while the latter was created by a primordial devil named Chidaruma. Sorcerers are capable of entering the Hole by summoning magical doors.\n\nSorcerers have specialized organs in their body allowing them to produce \"smoke\", which is the source of their unique magical powers. Some sorcerers have incredibly weak powers while others may be capable of far greater feats such as resurrecting the dead or controlling time; these powers are incredibly rare and highly prized. The amount of smoke a sorcerer is capable of producing (thus how effective their magic may be) also factors into a sorcerer's abilities, and many sorcerers work to improve their smoke output through surgery, or more commonly, the illicit use of black powder, which is distributed by a gang of low-level sorcerers called the Cross-Eyes. Smoke can also be bought and sold. The hierarchy of the sorcerers' world is structured around these differences in ability: powerful sorcerers, such as \u201cThe En Family\u201d, enjoy a life of luxury; while weak sorcerers, who produce such low amounts of smoke they may be unable to use magic at all, live in destitution. Powerful sorcerers may undergo a metamorphosis into a 'devil' \u2014 an immortal being with incredible power, following a rigorous training regime. Devils are deeply respected by sorcerer-kind and also manage the affairs of a third realm, Hell, where they work with Chidaruma to torture the souls of dead sorcerers.\n\nSorcerers regularly visit the Hole in order to practice their magic on human victims, leading to huge numbers of disfigured survivors. Hospitals have been set up to deal with the ever-growing numbers of magic victims, but humans can do little to repel sorcerers. To make matters worse, the residual magic smoke in the air mixes with the Hole's toxic rain, causing the dead to periodically rise from the grave and attack the living. The residents of the Hole call this annual event \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and work with local priests to kill zombies for prizes.\n\n===Plot===\nThe plot centers on a man named Caiman and his search for his real identity after a transformation by a sorcerer left him with a reptile's head and no memory of his former life. Along with his female friend Nikaido, he violently assaults sorcerers in the Hole, with the aim of taking their heads into his mouth, where a strange face will appear and confirm whether the sorcerer he has bitten onto was the one responsible for his transformation or not. Somehow, Caiman is immune to magical effects and as a result is extremely dangerous to sorcerers.\n\nThe news of a lizard-headed magician-killer immune to magic attracts the attention of En, a powerful sorcerer and head of a syndicate known as \u201cThe En Family\u201d, who sends his [[Fixer (person)|cleaners]] to kill Caiman. En himself is currently attempting to scrub out a gang of low-level sorcerers known as the Cross-Eyes, after an encounter with their legendary boss almost cost him his life years ago.\n\nAs the residents of the Hole, the En family and the Cross-Eyes gang, along with many others, collide with one another, the mystery of Caiman's identity begins to unravel, reigniting ancient grudges and threatening to forever change both the Hole and the sorcerers' world.\n\n==Characters==\n=== Residents of the Hole ===\n;{{nihongo|Caiman|\u30ab\u30a4\u30de\u30f3}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Wataru Takagi]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:The protagonist of the series. Caiman is a victim of a magic attack that has left him with the head of a reptile and no memory of his original identity. He works with his friend Nikaido to hunt down Sorcerers who enter the Hole, hoping to find the one who cast the spell on him and kill him to nullify it. By biting down on the heads of Sorcerers, a mysterious presence that lives in his mouth communicates with the bewildered Sorcerer, stating whether or not they are \"the one\". Caiman then spits them out and asks the Sorcerer to repeat the information to him. This is his only lead to finding his original identity. Caiman's immunity to magic and formidable knife skills make him incredibly skilled at battling Sorcerers. He also has the ability to regenerate his head, allowing him to survive lethal attacks such as [[decapitation]]. When not fighting, Caiman loves eating [[Jiaozi|gyoza]] and frequently sends Nikaido's restaurant, The Hungry Bug, teetering towards financial ruin due to his reluctance to pay his tab. While his imposing figure frightens some, he is generally well-liked in the Hole. At the beginning of the series, he works part time at a hospital for the treatment of magic victims.\n:Caiman's original identity is a complicated affair. He was born a human in the Hole named Ai Coleman, who dreamed of becoming a Sorcerer. Working with professor Kasukabe, Ai underwent an experimental procedure to transform himself into a Sorcerer, utilising the body parts of eight slaughtered Sorcerers. While acquiring a Sorcerer body, Ai plunged into the Hole's central, toxic lake of refuse, where he made contact with an entity formed from the residual magic soaked into Hole's mud and the souls of countless humans slaughtered by Sorcerers. This entity, known as \"Hole\" entered his body acting as a secondary consciousness that would periodically take over. Following the conclusion of the experiment, Ai was found dead in the corrosive waters of the Hole and was subsequently buried. However, due to the presence of Hole within him, he was revived by the polluted rainwater and escaped into the Sorcerer's world. While living as a Sorcerer, Ai bounced between [[Dissociative identity disorder|two distinct personalities]]; Aikawa, a carefree student, and Kai, the murderous boss of 'the Cross-Eye Gang', who began to orchestrate Hole's ancient revenge plot by slaughtering Sorcerers and collecting their devil tumours (the source of each sorcerer's unique power). Ultimately, Caiman came into being when Kai murdered Aikawa's best friend, Risu, triggering his unique \"curse\" magic and sending Kai fleeing back into the Hole. Risu's vengeful ghost decapitated him. However, due to the original 8 sorcerer corpses used in the experiment, he now had 9 heads which functioned as 9 lives. As the second head began to emerge, Kai's headless corpse smashed a bottle of reptile-transformation smoke he had been given for protection. These multiple magic effects smashed together, trapping Risu's curse within Kai's body (the source of the man in his mouth), transforming his head into a lizard's and severely damaging his memories.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nikaid\u014d|\u4e8c\u968e\u5802|Nikaid\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Reina Kond\u014d]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Caiman's best friend, and owner of the Hungry Bug, a gyoza restaurant in the Hole. She found Caiman after his initial transformation and helps him hunt down Sorcerers in the hopes of returning his memories and face. She is secretly a Sorcerer herself, and the only known Sorcerer capable of time manipulation. Unwilling to use her magic due to an incident in her youth, she fled to the Hole at a young age and has resided there ever since. Despite this, she has powerful contacts in the Sorcerer's world, namely a devil named Asu who was once a childhood friend. Nikaido is an incredibly skilled fighter in spite of not using magic, typically utilising powerful kicks and acrobatics to disable foes.\n\n;{{nihongo|Professor Kasukabe|\u6625\u65e5\u90e8\u535a\u58eb|Kasukabe hakase}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mitsuhiro Ichiki]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:A mad scientist obsessed with Sorcerers who has studied them intently for decades. He is approached by Caiman and Nikaido to use his artificial door to the Sorcerer's world. Although in his 60s, he looks incredibly young due to magic cast on him by his estranged, Sorcerer wife, Haru, who has since become a devil. His real name is Haze. He is frequently seen with his sidekick, Jonson. Kasukabe is one of the only characters who remembers Ai Coleman and played a pivotal role in Caiman's history.\n\n;{{nihongo|Jonson|\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30bd\u30f3|Jonson}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]]}}<ref name=\"more-cast\">{{cite web |author1=Jennifer Sherman |title=Dorohedoro Anime Casts Ryohei Kimura, Yuuki Kaji |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-02-09/dorohedoro-anime-casts-ryohei-kimura-yuuki-kaji/.156268 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 9, 2020 |date=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n:A giant cockroach living in the sewers of the Hole who was mutated by the residual smoke in the Hole's polluted water.

He's shown to be a man who has a large expansive group of lackeys, and is Noi and Shin's boss. He wears a mask that holds over his mouth similar to a surgeon's mask, and his smoke can turn people and objects into mushrooms. He is also quite fond of mushrooms, so much so that he themes every product he sells after them, and tends to only eat mushrooms.\n:From the moment he was born, En was surrounded by mushrooms. He believes he transformed his parents into mushrooms, and survived by eating them until a man entered his house and sold him off to a group who extracted and sold smoke from Sorcerers. He escaped when he was nine, where he was found by a devil who dumped him into hell. En only survived the journey into hell because he was so full of hate that he couldn't risk dying before exacting revenge. In hell he survived by creating mushrooms to feed upon. Some time after the devil Chidaruma found him and gave him the name 'En', then sent him back to the surface. A year and a half later he exacted his revenge against the workers in the factory who stole the magic of others. He destroyed the factory and made all the victims inside his friends. It was from there his criminal empire began to grow.\n\n;{{nihongo|Shin|\u5fc3}} {{nobold|and}} {{nihongo|Noi|\u80fd\u4e95}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoshimasa Hosoya]]}} (Shin)<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]}} (Noi)<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Shin and Noi are En's [[Mob enforcer|enforcers]]. As partners, Shin and Noi are commonly shown competing with one another while on a job, placing bets on who can kill more people, or kill a person faster.\n:Shin is one of the most powerful fighters. He fights with a hammer as a weapon and uses magic smoke that slices up victims without killing them. Shin's mask is shaped like a human heart, although he usually wears it backwards. Without the mask he is blond with blue eyes, and wears glasses. He is usually in a suit with an untucked white shirt and sneakers.\n:Noi is a powerful cleaner for En's organization and is also En's younger cousin. She is heavily muscled and towering in height. Noi's hair is pale white-blond, and her eyes appear red\u2014suggesting she might be [[Albinism|albino]]. Her hair is mid length, and she has several piercings on her ears. Her smoke heals almost any injury short of actual death. She is very affectionate to Shin, sometimes to his exasperation. Noi's mask is very detailed, dark blue and apparently vinylic.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fujita|\u85e4\u7530}}\n:{{voiced by|Kengo Takanashi}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Fujita is a low-level who works for a company headed by En.\n:His partner is killed by Caiman. He is assigned to find the Sorcerer who transformed Caiman into a saurian. A bit of research reveals a reptilian transformation specialist\u2014Ebisu. Fujita recalls passing her while in the Hole, and so he manages to locate and save her just as she's stuck in the jaws of Caiman. The incident leaves Ebisu traumatized, and Fujita watches after her while waiting for her memory to return.\n:Fujita wears a trapper hat and a Tengu mask, and is known to cover his eyes during horror movies. His magic has yet to be defined, although he fired his smoke like bullets on one occasion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ebisu|\u6075\u6bd4\u5bff}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Miyu Tomita]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Ebisu is a young and sullen-looking woman who wears a skull-shaped mask. While in the Hole, she runs into Caiman and Nikaido, who cut off Ebisu's fingers to prevent her from using magic, and bites down on her head after removing her mask. Before he can withdraw to ask her his question, a frantic Fujita appears from a door behind her and forcefully pulls her out of his clamped-down jaws into the door. After this incident, Ebisu is shown to be haunted by nightmares, and has become somewhat insane. At En's residence, she is restrained until Noi can properly heal and restore her fingers and face. Past that point, it is evident her head trauma caused some brain damage, as seen in her suddenly eccentric behavior. She is commonly seen with Fujita.\n:Records state she is skilled in Reptile transformation. However between panels it shows her having attacked someone with a surplus of power after being fed Black Powder by someone who appeared to have met her before. It is revealed she was a black smoke user, and had heard the words said to her from the man inside Caiman's head. Some of her memories return when she herself transforms into a large dinosauric lizard, proving that the consumption of black powder from a young age has caused an increase in power. It is eventually revealed that she was the one who hexed Caiman when she is temporarily killed and the spell is lifted from Caiman. It is revealed later that this is due to a bottle of her smoke that she had sold, and not a direct curse.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kikurage|\u30ad\u30af\u30e9\u30b2}}\n:{{voiced by|Mayu Udono}}<ref name=\"staff2\"/>\nKikurage is a small, white chimeric creature.

It tells the story of the amnesiac reptilian-headed Caiman working together with his friend Nikaido to recover his memories and survive in a strange and violent world.\n\nThe series was formerly serialized in [[Shogakukan]]'s ''[[seinen manga|seinen]]'' magazine ''[[Monthly Ikki]]'' since 2000, but after its cessation in 2014 the series was moved to ''Hibana'' in 2015. However, after the cessation of ''Hibana'' in August 2017, the series was transferred to ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' magazine in November 2017 and finished in September 2018.\n\nThe series was licensed for an English-language release by [[Viz Media]] in 2009, which began distributing the manga digitally when it launched SigIKKI, the now-former online English version of ''Ikki'' magazine.\n\nA 12-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation produced by [[MAPPA (studio)|MAPPA]] was broadcast from January to March 2020, to be followed by a worldwide [[Netflix]] release in May 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Dorohedoro'' story takes place in a [[post-apocalyptic]] setting,<ref name=\"debut\">{{cite web |title=Viz Media Debuts Apocalyptic Dorohedoro Manga |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2010-03-09/viz-media-debuts-apocalypitic-dorohedoro-manga |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |date=March 10, 2010}}</ref> split in two separate dimensions; the Hole, a dismal cityscape where humans reside; and the Sorcerers' world, home of sorcerers. Despite appearing similar, humans and sorcerers are two distinct species, the former evolving naturally, while the latter was created by a primordial devil named Chidaruma. Sorcerers are capable of entering the Hole by summoning magical doors.\n\nSorcerers have specialized organs in their body allowing them to produce \"smoke\", which is the source of their unique magical powers. Some sorcerers have incredibly weak powers while others may be capable of far greater feats such as resurrecting the dead or controlling time; these powers are incredibly rare and highly prized. The amount of smoke a sorcerer is capable of producing (thus how effective their magic may be) also factors into a sorcerer's abilities, and many sorcerers work to improve their smoke output through surgery, or more commonly, the illicit use of black powder, which is distributed by a gang of low-level sorcerers called the Cross-Eyes. Smoke can also be bought and sold. The hierarchy of the sorcerers' world is structured around these differences in ability: powerful sorcerers, such as \u201cThe En Family\u201d, enjoy a life of luxury; while weak sorcerers, who produce such low amounts of smoke they may be unable to use magic at all, live in destitution. Powerful sorcerers may undergo a metamorphosis into a 'devil' \u2014 an immortal being with incredible power, following a rigorous training regime. Devils are deeply respected by sorcerer-kind and also manage the affairs of a third realm, Hell, where they work with Chidaruma to torture the souls of dead sorcerers.\n\nSorcerers regularly visit the Hole in order to practice their magic on human victims, leading to huge numbers of disfigured survivors. Hospitals have been set up to deal with the ever-growing numbers of magic victims, but humans can do little to repel sorcerers. To make matters worse, the residual magic smoke in the air mixes with the Hole's toxic rain, causing the dead to periodically rise from the grave and attack the living. The residents of the Hole call this annual event \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and work with local priests to kill zombies for prizes.\n\n===Plot===\nThe plot centers on a man named Caiman and his search for his real identity after a transformation by a sorcerer left him with a reptile's head and no memory of his former life. Along with his female friend Nikaido, he violently assaults sorcerers in the Hole, with the aim of taking their heads into his mouth, where a strange face will appear and confirm whether the sorcerer he has bitten onto was the one responsible for his transformation or not. Somehow, Caiman is immune to magical effects and as a result is extremely dangerous to sorcerers.\n\nThe news of a lizard-headed magician-killer immune to magic attracts the attention of En, a powerful sorcerer and head of a syndicate known as \u201cThe En Family\u201d, who sends his [[Fixer (person)|cleaners]] to kill Caiman. En himself is currently attempting to scrub out a gang of low-level sorcerers known as the Cross-Eyes, after an encounter with their legendary boss almost cost him his life years ago.\n\nAs the residents of the Hole, the En family and the Cross-Eyes gang, along with many others, collide with one another, the mystery of Caiman's identity begins to unravel, reigniting ancient grudges and threatening to forever change both the Hole and the sorcerers' world.\n\n==Characters==\n=== Residents of the Hole ===\n;{{nihongo|Caiman|\u30ab\u30a4\u30de\u30f3}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Wataru Takagi]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:The protagonist of the series. Caiman is a victim of a magic attack that has left him with the head of a reptile and no memory of his original identity. He works with his friend Nikaido to hunt down Sorcerers who enter the Hole, hoping to find the one who cast the spell on him and kill him to nullify it. By biting down on the heads of Sorcerers, a mysterious presence that lives in his mouth communicates with the bewildered Sorcerer, stating whether or not they are \"the one\". Caiman then spits them out and asks the Sorcerer to repeat the information to him. This is his only lead to finding his original identity. Caiman's immunity to magic and formidable knife skills make him incredibly skilled at battling Sorcerers. He also has the ability to regenerate his head, allowing him to survive lethal attacks such as [[decapitation]]. When not fighting, Caiman loves eating [[Jiaozi|gyoza]] and frequently sends Nikaido's restaurant, The Hungry Bug, teetering towards financial ruin due to his reluctance to pay his tab. While his imposing figure frightens some, he is generally well-liked in the Hole. At the beginning of the series, he works part time at a hospital for the treatment of magic victims.\n:Caiman's original identity is a complicated affair. He was born a human in the Hole named Ai Coleman, who dreamed of becoming a Sorcerer. Working with professor Kasukabe, Ai underwent an experimental procedure to transform himself into a Sorcerer, utilising the body parts of eight slaughtered Sorcerers. While acquiring a Sorcerer body, Ai plunged into the Hole's central, toxic lake of refuse, where he made contact with an entity formed from the residual magic soaked into Hole's mud and the souls of countless humans slaughtered by Sorcerers. This entity, known as \"Hole\" entered his body acting as a secondary consciousness that would periodically take over. Following the conclusion of the experiment, Ai was found dead in the corrosive waters of the Hole and was subsequently buried. However, due to the presence of Hole within him, he was revived by the polluted rainwater and escaped into the Sorcerer's world. While living as a Sorcerer, Ai bounced between [[Dissociative identity disorder|two distinct personalities]]; Aikawa, a carefree student, and Kai, the murderous boss of 'the Cross-Eye Gang', who began to orchestrate Hole's ancient revenge plot by slaughtering Sorcerers and collecting their devil tumours (the source of each sorcerer's unique power). Ultimately, Caiman came into being when Kai murdered Aikawa's best friend, Risu, triggering his unique \"curse\" magic and sending Kai fleeing back into the Hole. Risu's vengeful ghost decapitated him. However, due to the original 8 sorcerer corpses used in the experiment, he now had 9 heads which functioned as 9 lives. As the second head began to emerge, Kai's headless corpse smashed a bottle of reptile-transformation smoke he had been given for protection. These multiple magic effects smashed together, trapping Risu's curse within Kai's body (the source of the man in his mouth), transforming his head into a lizard's and severely damaging his memories.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nikaid\u014d|\u4e8c\u968e\u5802|Nikaid\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Reina Kond\u014d]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Caiman's best friend, and owner of the Hungry Bug, a gyoza restaurant in the Hole. She found Caiman after his initial transformation and helps him hunt down Sorcerers in the hopes of returning his memories and face. She is secretly a Sorcerer herself, and the only known Sorcerer capable of time manipulation. Unwilling to use her magic due to an incident in her youth, she fled to the Hole at a young age and has resided there ever since. Despite this, she has powerful contacts in the Sorcerer's world, namely a devil named Asu who was once a childhood friend. Nikaido is an incredibly skilled fighter in spite of not using magic, typically utilising powerful kicks and acrobatics to disable foes.\n\n;{{nihongo|Professor Kasukabe|\u6625\u65e5\u90e8\u535a\u58eb|Kasukabe hakase}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mitsuhiro Ichiki]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:A mad scientist obsessed with Sorcerers who has studied them intently for decades. He is approached by Caiman and Nikaido to use his artificial door to the Sorcerer's world. Although in his 60s, he looks incredibly young due to magic cast on him by his estranged, Sorcerer wife, Haru, who has since become a devil. His real name is Haze. He is frequently seen with his sidekick, Jonson.

He's shown to be a man who has a large expansive group of lackeys, and is Noi and Shin's boss. He wears a mask that holds over his mouth similar to a surgeon's mask, and his smoke can turn people and objects into mushrooms. He is also quite fond of mushrooms, so much so that he themes every product he sells after them, and tends to only eat mushrooms.\n:From the moment he was born, En was surrounded by mushrooms. He believes he transformed his parents into mushrooms, and survived by eating them until a man entered his house and sold him off to a group who extracted and sold smoke from Sorcerers. He escaped when he was nine, where he was found by a devil who dumped him into hell. En only survived the journey into hell because he was so full of hate that he couldn't risk dying before exacting revenge. In hell he survived by creating mushrooms to feed upon. Some time after the devil Chidaruma found him and gave him the name 'En', then sent him back to the surface. A year and a half later he exacted his revenge against the workers in the factory who stole the magic of others. He destroyed the factory and made all the victims inside his friends. It was from there his criminal empire began to grow.\n\n;{{nihongo|Shin|\u5fc3}} {{nobold|and}} {{nihongo|Noi|\u80fd\u4e95}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoshimasa Hosoya]]}} (Shin)<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]}} (Noi)<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Shin and Noi are En's [[Mob enforcer|enforcers]]. As partners, Shin and Noi are commonly shown competing with one another while on a job, placing bets on who can kill more people, or kill a person faster.\n:Shin is one of the most powerful fighters. He fights with a hammer as a weapon and uses magic smoke that slices up victims without killing them. Shin's mask is shaped like a human heart, although he usually wears it backwards. Without the mask he is blond with blue eyes, and wears glasses. He is usually in a suit with an untucked white shirt and sneakers.\n:Noi is a powerful cleaner for En's organization and is also En's younger cousin. She is heavily muscled and towering in height. Noi's hair is pale white-blond, and her eyes appear red\u2014suggesting she might be [[Albinism|albino]]. Her hair is mid length, and she has several piercings on her ears. Her smoke heals almost any injury short of actual death. She is very affectionate to Shin, sometimes to his exasperation. Noi's mask is very detailed, dark blue and apparently vinylic.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fujita|\u85e4\u7530}}\n:{{voiced by|Kengo Takanashi}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Fujita is a low-level who works for a company headed by En.\n:His partner is killed by Caiman. He is assigned to find the Sorcerer who transformed Caiman into a saurian. A bit of research reveals a reptilian transformation specialist\u2014Ebisu. Fujita recalls passing her while in the Hole, and so he manages to locate and save her just as she's stuck in the jaws of Caiman. The incident leaves Ebisu traumatized, and Fujita watches after her while waiting for her memory to return.\n:Fujita wears a trapper hat and a Tengu mask, and is known to cover his eyes during horror movies. His magic has yet to be defined, although he fired his smoke like bullets on one occasion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ebisu|\u6075\u6bd4\u5bff}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Miyu Tomita]]}}<ref name=\"staff\"/>\n:Ebisu is a young and sullen-looking woman who wears a skull-shaped mask. While in the Hole, she runs into Caiman and Nikaido, who cut off Ebisu's fingers to prevent her from using magic, and bites down on her head after removing her mask. Before he can withdraw to ask her his question, a frantic Fujita appears from a door behind her and forcefully pulls her out of his clamped-down jaws into the door. After this incident, Ebisu is shown to be haunted by nightmares, and has become somewhat insane. At En's residence, she is restrained until Noi can properly heal and restore her fingers and face. Past that point, it is evident her head trauma caused some brain damage, as seen in her suddenly eccentric behavior. She is commonly seen with Fujita.\n:Records state she is skilled in Reptile transformation. However between panels it shows her having attacked someone with a surplus of power after being fed Black Powder by someone who appeared to have met her before. It is revealed she was a black smoke user, and had heard the words said to her from the man inside Caiman's head. Some of her memories return when she herself transforms into a large dinosauric lizard, proving that the consumption of black powder from a young age has caused an increase in power. It is eventually revealed that she was the one who hexed Caiman when she is temporarily killed and the spell is lifted from Caiman. It is revealed later that this is due to a bottle of her smoke that she had sold, and not a direct curse.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kikurage|\u30ad\u30af\u30e9\u30b2}}\n:{{voiced by|Mayu Udono}}<ref name=\"staff2\"/>\nKikurage is a small, white chimeric creature.

Gosden's father has also stated that he suspected that Gosden might have gone to London to do something for which he felt it was easier to seek forgiveness rather than permission.<ref>{{cite podcast |url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/thin-air-podcast/episode-29-andrew-gosden/ |title=Andrew Gosden |website=Thin Air |publisher= |host=Daniel Calderon & Jordan Sims |date=11 September 2017 |time=9m50s |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nSpeaking in 2009 Kevin Gosden speculated on the reason for Andrew's disappearance: \"Did he decide to do the Reginald Perrin thing and reinvent himself or was there something troubling him that he felt he couldn't tell us?

Sheds vary considerably in their size and complexity of construction, from simple open-sided ones designed to cover bicycles or garden items to large wood-framed structures with shingled roofs, windows, and [[AC power plugs and sockets|electrical outlets]]. Sheds used on [[farm]]s or in industry can be large structures. The main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (the roof may be asphalt shingled or sheathed in tin), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Small sheds may include a wooden or plastic floor, while more permanent ones may be built on a concrete pad or foundation. Sheds may be [[Lock and key|lockable]] to deter theft or entry by children, domestic animals, wildlife, etc.\n\nA culture of shed enthusiasts exists in several countries for people who enjoy building sheds and spending time in them for relaxation. In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] there are magazines called ''The Shed'', an association for shed hobbyists (the [[Australian Men's Shed Association]]), and a book entitled ''Men and Sheds''.\n\n==Terminology==\nDepending on the region and type of use, a shed may also be called a [[shack]], [[Outhouse (disambiguation)|outhouse]], or \"outbuilding\". Sheds may be classified as \"accessory buildings\" in [[By-law#Municipal by-laws|municipal bylaws]] which may regulate their size, appearance, and distance from the principal building and boundary lines.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Station Oudegem - Foto 3 (2009).png|thumb|A bicycle shed]]\n{{redirect2|Bicycle shed|Bike shed|\"the bicycle shed effect\"|Law of triviality}}\n{{redirect|Garden shed|the song|Garden Shed (song)}}\n{{redirect|Toolshed|the Tool demo album|72826}}\n\n* '''Agricultural sheds''' [[File:Hay shed.jpg|right|thumb|A hay shed typical of Australia and New Zealand (elsewhere often termed a \"[[barn]]\")]]\n**Arena sheds may have a simple open roof structure, or be partially walled or fully enclosed.  They are typically used as horse-riding equestrian venues, providing all-year usage of the facility with protection from the weather.\n** Farm sheds and other outbuildings are used to store farm equipment, tractors, tools, hay, and supplies, or to house horses, cattle, poultry or other farm animals. Run-in sheds are three-sided structures with an open face used for horses and cattle.\n** [[Shearing shed]]s can be large sheds found on sheep stations to accommodate large-scale [[sheep shearing]].\n\n* '''Bike sheds''' or '''bicycle sheds''' usually contain a framework on which bikes can be supported and locked and a roof to keep rain and/or snow off the bikes and their riders while mounting and dismounting. Bike sheds range from little more than a supported roof to more-complex structures with walls and locking doors or gates. The [[color of a bikeshed]] is the topic of a well-known adage about the challenges of group work in organizational psychology.\n\n* '''Boat sheds''' (or '''boatsheds''') {{Main|boatshed}} Boat sheds are typically lockable wooden sheds built near a body of water to store small private boats, bathing suits, life vests and related items. Boat sheds used for rowing clubs are generally larger structures for storing [[rowing skiff]]s.\n\n* '''Garden sheds''' or '''garden tool sheds''', including [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]] sheds. Garden sheds are used to store seeds, soil, hoses, portable sprinklers, or [[garden tool]]s such as [[Rake (tool)|hand rakes]], [[shovel]]s, [[lawnmower]]s, etc.\n\n* '''Railway sheds'''\n** [[Motive power depot|Engine shed]]s are structures used for the maintenance or storage of railway locomotives. In Britain these are also called [[motive power depot]]s.\n** [[Goods shed]]s are railway buildings designed for storing goods before or after carriage in a train.\n** [[Train shed]]s are buildings adjacent to a [[railway station]] where the tracks and platforms are covered by a roof. The first train shed was built in 1830 at Liverpool's [[Crown Street Station]].\n** [[Snow shed]]s are strongly built timber or reinforced-concrete [[tunnel]]s that protect railroad tracks (or roads) from [[avalanche]]s.\n\n* '''Storage sheds''' may contain any items any person wishes to store and to organize and/or protect from precipitation, wind, small children, domestical animals, wildlife, etc.\n\n* '''Tool sheds''' may contain [[hand tool]]s and/or [[power tool]]s used to repair [[automobile]]s or for [[construction]].\n\n* '''Wood sheds''' are sheds used for storage of large quantities of [[firewood]]. Woodsheds help protect firewood from adverse weather and moisture, especially in snowy or wet climates. Woodsheds are commonly in close proximity to buildings heated by a [[wood-burning stove]], such as a [[log cabin]].

These kits are designed for regular people to be able to assemble themselves using commonly available tools (e.g., screwdriver). Both shed kits and [[DIY]] (do-it-yourself) plans are available for wooden and plastic sheds. Sheds are used to store home and garden [[tool]]s and equipment such as lawn tractors, and gardening supplies. In addition, sheds can be used to store items that are not suitable for indoor storage, such as petrol ([[gasoline]]), pesticides, or [[herbicide]]s. For homes with small gardens or modest storage needs, there are several types of very small sheds. The sheds not only use less ground area but also have a low profile less likely to obstruct the view or clash with the landscaping.\n\nThese small sheds include corner sheds, which fit into a corner (3&nbsp;ft tall&nbsp;\u00d7 3 wide&nbsp;\u00d7 2 deep, or about 1&nbsp;m tall&nbsp;\u00d7 1&nbsp;m wide&nbsp;\u00d7 50&nbsp;cm deep), vertical sheds ({{convert|5|x|3|x|4|ft|m|disp=x| deep, or |abbr=on|round=0.5}}), horizontal sheds ({{convert|3|x|5|x|4|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on|round=0.5}}), and tool sheds. When a shed is used for tool storage, [[shelf (storage)|shelves]] and [[hook (wall)|hooks]] are often used to maximize the storage space.  [[Gambrel]]-style roofed sheds (sometimes called baby barns), which resemble a Dutch-style [[barn]], have a high sloping roofline which increases storage space in the \"loft\" area. Some Gambrel-styles have no loft and offer the advantage of reduced overall height.  Another style of small shed is the [[saltbox]]-style shed. \n\nMany sheds have either a pent or apex roof shape. A pent shed features a single roof section which is angled downwards to let rainwater run off, with more headroom at the front than the back. This is a simple, practical design that will fit particularly well next to a wall or fence. It is also usually lower than the typical apex shed, so could be a better choice if there are any height restrictions. A pent shed may be free-standing or attached to a wall (when it is known, unsurprisingly, as a wall shed).  \n\nAn apex shed has a pointed roof in an inverted V shape similar to the roof line of many houses. Two roof sections meet at a ridge in the middle, providing more headroom in the centre than at the sides. This type is generally regarded as a more attractive and traditional design, and may be preferable if the shed is going to be visible from the house. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.love2learnallotmenting.co.uk/wooden-shed-buying-guide|title=Wooden Shed Buying Guide - Love2Learn Allotmenting|website=Love2Learn Allotmenting|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701041626/http://www.love2learnallotmenting.co.uk/wooden-shed-buying-guide|archivedate=2016-07-01}}</ref> \n\nA twist on the standard apex shape is the reverse apex shed. In this design, the door is set in a side wall instead of the front. The main advantage of the reverse apex design is that the door opens into the widest part of the shed instead of the narrowest, so it's easier to reach into all areas to retrieve or store equipment.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/sheds-explained/|title=Sheds explained|website=www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523075739/http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/sheds-explained/|archivedate=2016-05-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Larger domestic  ===\n[[File:TallShed.JPG|left|thumb|upright=0.90|A tall shed with windows and a shingled roof]]\nLarger, more-expensive sheds are typically constructed of [[wood]] and include features typically found in house construction, such as windows, a shingled roof, and electrical outlets.

There is a growing industry in providing \"off the peg\" garden offices to cater for this demand, particularly in the UK but also in the US.\n \nShed owners can customize wooden sheds to match the features (e.g., siding, trim, etc.) of the main house. A number of decorative options can be added to sheds, such as [[dormer]]s, shutters, flowerboxes, finials, and [[weathervane]]s. As well, practical options can be added such as benches, ramps, ventilation systems (e.g., in cases where a swimming pool heater is installed in a shed), and electric lighting. Sheds designed for gardening, called \"potting sheds\", often feature windows or skylights for illumination, ventilation grilles, and a potter's bench for mixing soil and re-potting plants.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Materials===\nThe main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (wood frame, wood siding and wood roof), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Each type has various advantages and disadvantages that a homeowner has to consider. For example, while metal sheds are fire and termite-resistant, they can rust over time, or be severely damaged by high winds or heavy snow loads. Wood sheds are easier to modify or customize than plastic or metal, because carpentry tools and basic carpentry skills are more readily available. Vinyl-sided, wood-framed sheds blend the strength of a wood frame with the maintenance-free aspect of vinyl siding (it does not need to be painted or varnished). The [[International Building Code]] (IBC) defines a shed as a building or structure of an accessory character; it classifies them under utility and miscellaneous group U (Chapter 3 Section 312).\n\n====Metal====\n[[File:Corrugated iron shed.jpg|thumb|right|A corrugated iron shed]]\nMetal sheds made from thin sheet metal sheathing ([[galvanized steel]], [[aluminium]], or corrugated iron) attached to a metal frame. Metal sheds are a good choice when long-term strength and resistance to fire, rot, or termites is desired. However, metal sheds may [[rust]] over time, particularly if they are constructed from steel that is not galvanized. Be aware that concrete is highly corrosive so care needs to be taken when assembling your shed to avoid contact with the outside panels.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalsheds.com.au/tips-on-erecting-a-shed/ |title=Tips on Kit Shed Assembly |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131194751/http://www.nationalsheds.com.au/tips-on-erecting-a-shed/ |archivedate=2011-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nAs well, some types of metal sheds that have thin walls are easily dented, which may makes some types of thin metal sheds a poor choice for vandal-prone areas or for high-traffic activities such as small businesses. In cold climates, metal sheds with thin walls need to have snow and ice cleared from the roof, because the thin metal may be damaged by a heavy accumulation. Since thin metal sheds weigh much less than wood or PVC plastic sheds, thin metal sheds are more at risk of being damaged by heavy winds. To prevent wind damage, thin metal sheds should be attached to a concrete foundation with screws.<ref>[http://www.hardware2u.com.au/absco-garden-sheds-for-sale-and-assemble-instructional-videos How to assemble a garden shed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803134029/http://www.hardware2u.com.au/absco-garden-sheds-for-sale-and-assemble-instructional-videos/ |date=2009-08-03 }}</ref> In countries where the climate is generally mild, such as Australia, very large metal sheds are used for many types of industry. Corrugated metal sheds may be better able to withstand wind and snow loads, as the corrugated shape makes the metal stronger than flat tin.\n\n====Plastic====\n[[File:Lifetimesheds.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lifetime Products|Lifetime]] brand blow-molded plastic sheds]]\n[[Plastic]] shed kits utilizing heavy molded plastics such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[polyethylene]] may be less expensive than sheet-metal sheds. PVC resins and high-impact, [[Ultraviolet|UV light]]-resistant [[polyethylene]] make plastic outdoor sheds stronger, lighter, more durable, and more resistant to denting and chipping than wood, and tend to be more stable. Plastic shed kits sided with vinyl are typically among the least-expensive types of shed construction. Higher-quality sheds use UV-resistant plastic and [[powder coating|powder-coated]] metal frames. Many plastic sheds are modular to allow for easy extensions, peg-boards, shelving, attic-storage, windows, skylights, and other accessories to be added later, if these additions are purchased from the manufacturer.\n\nPlastic sheds are not susceptible to [[termite]] or wood-boring insect damage, and they require little maintenance. Being rot-proof they do not need to have preservative applied. This makes them preferable in climates where the weather can be changeable, such as the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@ethangardener/the-best-plastic-garden-storage-boxes-sheds-and-cupboards-8b8638635a83|title=The Best Plastic Garden Storage Boxes, Sheds and Cupboards|first=Ethan|last=Knight|date=28 October 2016|website=medium.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220124414/https://medium.com/@ethangardener/the-best-plastic-garden-storage-boxes-sheds-and-cupboards-8b8638635a83|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref> Unlike wooden or metal sheds, which often require a permit to build, in many areas, plastic sheds do not.

Despite the strength of wood, over time, untreated and neglected wood can rot, split, warp or become susceptible to [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[mildew]], so wood sheds should be treated for protection with stain and varnish. Wood sheds need regular maintenance. This includes keeping plant matter and debris from piling up beside the walls and on the roof, and occasional rot-proofing with preservative. Sheds are sometimes also re-stained or varnished at times for aesthetic and wood protection reasons. Fire and, in some regions, [[termite]] attack are also potential problems.\n\nStains and preservatives can be applied to wood sheds to prevent damage to the wood caused by exposure to rain, damp ground, [[Ultraviolet|UV light]], harsh climatic conditions, [[Fungus|fungal]] attack and wood-boring insects. If a coloured preservative oil or stain is used, a wooden shed can either be made to stand out as a feature within a garden, or to blend in with its surroundings. Red cedar coloured stain is popular. Legislation such as the European Biocidal Products Regulation has reduced the number of effective active ingredients available for wood preservative formulations. For this reason, in recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on preserving wood by keeping it dry, for example through the application of water-repellent \"wood protection creams.\"\n\nSome types of wood, such as [[Cedrus|cedar]], are more naturally resistant to water damage.\n\nWhen looking for a wooden shed, it is important to understand the difference between the two types of preservative used in their manufacture. The timber will have been treated in one of two ways: dip treatment or pressure treatment. Dip-treated sheds are made from components that are lowered into a tank of preservative before the panels are assembled. This is a quick and simple process which keeps costs down and encourages manufacturers to produce a wide variety, making dip-treated sheds the most popular and affordable type on the market. They are easily recognisable by their golden brown colour, which is due to a dye added to the preservative. Most manufacturers offer a 10-year anti-rot guarantee on dip-treated sheds, but they have to be re-coated every year or two. [http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/benefits-of-a-dip-treated-shed-or-workshop/]\n\nPressure-treated sheds are made from timber planks which have had the moisture sucked out of them under vacuum conditions in a special cylinder. A powerful preservative is then forced into the wood at high pressure until it is absorbed deep into the grain, becoming an integral part of the timber. This provides excellent protection against the weather - so much so that manufacturers generally give a 15-year anti-rot guarantee. These sheds are usually distinguished by a pale green tinge which will fade eventually to a silvery grey. Although pressure-treated sheds tend to be more expensive than dip-treated ones, their big advantage is that they won't need any further preservative treatment during the guarantee period, saving owners time and money. [http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/benefits-of-a-pressure-treated-shed-or-workshop/]\n\nOne advantage of using wood sheds over metal versions is that it is easier to modify them by adding windows, doors, shelving, or exterior trim (etc.) because wood can be cut and drilled using commonly available tools, whereas a plastic or metal shed requires specialized tools. Some homeowners may prefer wood sheds because wood is a renewable resource.\n\n====Vinyl-sided====\n[[File:10x12 Vinyl Manor.jpg|left|thumb|An Amish-style vinyl-sided shed]]\nVinyl-sided sheds are typically built with standard wood framing construction and oriented strand board (OSB) on the walls covered with standard vinyl siding. The vinyl siding protects the OSB wood and the frame from moisture from rain and snow. Vinyl-sided sheds never need to be painted, and are maintenance-free. They are stronger than plastic or metal sheds, and are usually built to conform with the local building codes. They offer good value for money because they hold up in all weather, including winters with heavy snowfall, as they use a strong wooden frame and the OSB panels have stronger structural support than thin metal or PVC siding or roofs.  Metal, plastic and resin sheds are cheaper, but they cannot handle the weight of snow in winter (roofs may cave in). Vinyl sheds also offer more colour options.\n\n====Asbestos====\nIn the early and middle years of the 20th century, many garden sheds and domestic garages were made of [[asbestos]]-cement sheets supported on a very light angle-iron frame.  Concerns about safety led to the practice being discontinued, but they were cheap and long-lasting, and many can still be seen in British gardens.  Advice on continued use or disposal is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.org.uk/FAQAC.html|title=Asbestos Cement FAQs - Asbestos Garage Roof Q&A - AIC|website=www.aic.org.uk|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425050354/http://www.aic.org.uk/FAQAC.html|archivedate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====TPR====\nSince 2013 garden sheds have been available in the UK made from TPR - a sustainable alternative to concrete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.affresol.com/non-timber-framed-low-cost-housing.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715044234/http://affresol.com/non-timber-framed-low-cost-housing.asp |archivedate=2014-07-15 }}</ref> They are typically coated in a marine gelcoat and are far stronger and more durable than traditional sheds.

The first attested usage of the word, in 1481, was in the sentence, {{lang|ang|\"A yearde in whiche was a shadde where in were six grete dogges\"}}. The Anglo Saxon word ''\"shud\"'', which means \"cover\" may also have been part of the development of the word. In 1440, a \"shud\" was defined as a {{lang|ang|\"... schudde, hovel, swyne kote or howse of sympyl hyllynge [covering] to kepe yn beestys\"}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Air-raid shelter|Anderson shelter]]\n* [[Lean-to]]\n* [[Nissen hut]]\n* [[Sala (architecture)|Sala]]\n* [[Shanty town]]\n* [[Tuff Shed]]\n* [[Wendy house]]\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Sheds}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Shed|volume=24|page=817}}\n* Gordon Thorburn, ''Men and Sheds'', {{ISBN|1-84330-329-9}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons cat inline|Sheds}}\n\n[[Category:Agricultural buildings]]\n[[Category:Garden features]]\n[[Category:Gardening aids]]\n[[Category:Building types]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n[[File:A Shed by the Water.jpg|right|thumb|A waterside shed in Sweden]]\n[[File:Schuppen 7235.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.90|A rural shed]]\n[[File:Bike shed 15d06.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.90|Modern secure bike sheds]]\n[[File:Shed.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.90|A garden shed with a [[gambrel]] roof]]\n\nA '''shed''' is typically a simple, single-story roofed structure in a [[back garden]] or on an [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] that is used for storage, [[hobby|hobbies]], or as a [[workshop]]. Sheds vary considerably in their size and complexity of construction, from simple open-sided ones designed to cover bicycles or garden items to large wood-framed structures with shingled roofs, windows, and [[AC power plugs and sockets|electrical outlets]]. Sheds used on [[farm]]s or in industry can be large structures. The main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (the roof may be asphalt shingled or sheathed in tin), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Small sheds may include a wooden or plastic floor, while more permanent ones may be built on a concrete pad or foundation.

These kits are designed for regular people to be able to assemble themselves using commonly available tools (e.g., screwdriver). Both shed kits and [[DIY]] (do-it-yourself) plans are available for wooden and plastic sheds. Sheds are used to store home and garden [[tool]]s and equipment such as lawn tractors, and gardening supplies. In addition, sheds can be used to store items that are not suitable for indoor storage, such as petrol ([[gasoline]]), pesticides, or [[herbicide]]s. For homes with small gardens or modest storage needs, there are several types of very small sheds. The sheds not only use less ground area but also have a low profile less likely to obstruct the view or clash with the landscaping.\n\nThese small sheds include corner sheds, which fit into a corner (3&nbsp;ft tall&nbsp;\u00d7 3 wide&nbsp;\u00d7 2 deep, or about 1&nbsp;m tall&nbsp;\u00d7 1&nbsp;m wide&nbsp;\u00d7 50&nbsp;cm deep), vertical sheds ({{convert|5|x|3|x|4|ft|m|disp=x| deep, or |abbr=on|round=0.5}}), horizontal sheds ({{convert|3|x|5|x|4|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on|round=0.5}}), and tool sheds. When a shed is used for tool storage, [[shelf (storage)|shelves]] and [[hook (wall)|hooks]] are often used to maximize the storage space.  [[Gambrel]]-style roofed sheds (sometimes called baby barns), which resemble a Dutch-style [[barn]], have a high sloping roofline which increases storage space in the \"loft\" area. Some Gambrel-styles have no loft and offer the advantage of reduced overall height.  Another style of small shed is the [[saltbox]]-style shed. \n\nMany sheds have either a pent or apex roof shape. A pent shed features a single roof section which is angled downwards to let rainwater run off, with more headroom at the front than the back. This is a simple, practical design that will fit particularly well next to a wall or fence. It is also usually lower than the typical apex shed, so could be a better choice if there are any height restrictions. A pent shed may be free-standing or attached to a wall (when it is known, unsurprisingly, as a wall shed).  \n\nAn apex shed has a pointed roof in an inverted V shape similar to the roof line of many houses. Two roof sections meet at a ridge in the middle, providing more headroom in the centre than at the sides. This type is generally regarded as a more attractive and traditional design, and may be preferable if the shed is going to be visible from the house. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.love2learnallotmenting.co.uk/wooden-shed-buying-guide|title=Wooden Shed Buying Guide - Love2Learn Allotmenting|website=Love2Learn Allotmenting|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701041626/http://www.love2learnallotmenting.co.uk/wooden-shed-buying-guide|archivedate=2016-07-01}}</ref> \n\nA twist on the standard apex shape is the reverse apex shed. In this design, the door is set in a side wall instead of the front. The main advantage of the reverse apex design is that the door opens into the widest part of the shed instead of the narrowest, so it's easier to reach into all areas to retrieve or store equipment.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/sheds-explained/|title=Sheds explained|website=www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523075739/http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/sheds-explained/|archivedate=2016-05-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Larger domestic  ===\n[[File:TallShed.JPG|left|thumb|upright=0.90|A tall shed with windows and a shingled roof]]\nLarger, more-expensive sheds are typically constructed of [[wood]] and include features typically found in house construction, such as windows, a shingled roof, and electrical outlets. Larger sheds provide more space for engaging in hobbies such as [[gardening]], small [[internal combustion engine|engine]] repair, or [[tinkering]]. <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed:  [[File:Typical shed.jpg|right|220px|thumb|A typical large domestic workshop shed]] -->Some sheds have small porches or include furniture, which allows them to be used for relaxation purposes. In some cases, [[Telecommuting|teleworkers]] and homeworkers in general who live in mild climates use small to medium-sized wooden garden sheds as outdoor offices. There is a growing industry in providing \"off the peg\" garden offices to cater for this demand, particularly in the UK but also in the US.\n \nShed owners can customize wooden sheds to match the features (e.g., siding, trim, etc.) of the main house. A number of decorative options can be added to sheds, such as [[dormer]]s, shutters, flowerboxes, finials, and [[weathervane]]s. As well, practical options can be added such as benches, ramps, ventilation systems (e.g., in cases where a swimming pool heater is installed in a shed), and electric lighting. Sheds designed for gardening, called \"potting sheds\", often feature windows or skylights for illumination, ventilation grilles, and a potter's bench for mixing soil and re-potting plants.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Materials===\nThe main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (wood frame, wood siding and wood roof), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Each type has various advantages and disadvantages that a homeowner has to consider. For example, while metal sheds are fire and termite-resistant, they can rust over time, or be severely damaged by high winds or heavy snow loads. Wood sheds are easier to modify or customize than plastic or metal, because carpentry tools and basic carpentry skills are more readily available. Vinyl-sided, wood-framed sheds blend the strength of a wood frame with the maintenance-free aspect of vinyl siding (it does not need to be painted or varnished). The [[International Building Code]] (IBC) defines a shed as a building or structure of an accessory character; it classifies them under utility and miscellaneous group U (Chapter 3 Section 312).\n\n====Metal====\n[[File:Corrugated iron shed.jpg|thumb|right|A corrugated iron shed]]\nMetal sheds made from thin sheet metal sheathing ([[galvanized steel]], [[aluminium]], or corrugated iron) attached to a metal frame. Metal sheds are a good choice when long-term strength and resistance to fire, rot, or termites is desired. However, metal sheds may [[rust]] over time, particularly if they are constructed from steel that is not galvanized. Be aware that concrete is highly corrosive so care needs to be taken when assembling your shed to avoid contact with the outside panels.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalsheds.com.au/tips-on-erecting-a-shed/ |title=Tips on Kit Shed Assembly |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131194751/http://www.nationalsheds.com.au/tips-on-erecting-a-shed/ |archivedate=2011-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nAs well, some types of metal sheds that have thin walls are easily dented, which may makes some types of thin metal sheds a poor choice for vandal-prone areas or for high-traffic activities such as small businesses. In cold climates, metal sheds with thin walls need to have snow and ice cleared from the roof, because the thin metal may be damaged by a heavy accumulation. Since thin metal sheds weigh much less than wood or PVC plastic sheds, thin metal sheds are more at risk of being damaged by heavy winds. To prevent wind damage, thin metal sheds should be attached to a concrete foundation with screws.<ref>[http://www.hardware2u.com.au/absco-garden-sheds-for-sale-and-assemble-instructional-videos How to assemble a garden shed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803134029/http://www.hardware2u.com.au/absco-garden-sheds-for-sale-and-assemble-instructional-videos/ |date=2009-08-03 }}</ref> In countries where the climate is generally mild, such as Australia, very large metal sheds are used for many types of industry. Corrugated metal sheds may be better able to withstand wind and snow loads, as the corrugated shape makes the metal stronger than flat tin.\n\n====Plastic====\n[[File:Lifetimesheds.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lifetime Products|Lifetime]] brand blow-molded plastic sheds]]\n[[Plastic]] shed kits utilizing heavy molded plastics such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[polyethylene]] may be less expensive than sheet-metal sheds. PVC resins and high-impact, [[Ultraviolet|UV light]]-resistant [[polyethylene]] make plastic outdoor sheds stronger, lighter, more durable, and more resistant to denting and chipping than wood, and tend to be more stable. Plastic shed kits sided with vinyl are typically among the least-expensive types of shed construction. Higher-quality sheds use UV-resistant plastic and [[powder coating|powder-coated]] metal frames. Many plastic sheds are modular to allow for easy extensions, peg-boards, shelving, attic-storage, windows, skylights, and other accessories to be added later, if these additions are purchased from the manufacturer.\n\nPlastic sheds are not susceptible to [[termite]] or wood-boring insect damage, and they require little maintenance. Being rot-proof they do not need to have preservative applied. This makes them preferable in climates where the weather can be changeable, such as the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@ethangardener/the-best-plastic-garden-storage-boxes-sheds-and-cupboards-8b8638635a83|title=The Best Plastic Garden Storage Boxes, Sheds and Cupboards|first=Ethan|last=Knight|date=28 October 2016|website=medium.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220124414/https://medium.com/@ethangardener/the-best-plastic-garden-storage-boxes-sheds-and-cupboards-8b8638635a83|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref> Unlike wooden or metal sheds, which often require a permit to build, in many areas, plastic sheds do not. However, this is something property owners will need to verify. A call to your council/town's planning or building code office can provide information on permits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.keter.com/tips-and-articles/shed-permit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303090023/http://www.keter.com/tips-and-articles/shed-permit |archivedate=2015-03-03 }}</ref>\n\n====Wood====\n[[File:Tool-shed.jpg|thumb|right|Domestic wooden sheds.]]\n[[File:Cedar storage shed wood.jpg|thumb|Example of wood storage shed from US cedar shed builder.]]\n\nWooden sheds have a natural look that can blend in well with garden environments. Despite the strength of wood, over time, untreated and neglected wood can rot, split, warp or become susceptible to [[mold]] and [[mildew]], so wood sheds should be treated for protection with stain and varnish. Wood sheds need regular maintenance. This includes keeping plant matter and debris from piling up beside the walls and on the roof, and occasional rot-proofing with preservative. Sheds are sometimes also re-stained or varnished at times for aesthetic and wood protection reasons. Fire and, in some regions, [[termite]] attack are also potential problems.\n\nStains and preservatives can be applied to wood sheds to prevent damage to the wood caused by exposure to rain, damp ground, [[Ultraviolet|UV light]], harsh climatic conditions, [[Fungus|fungal]] attack and wood-boring insects. If a coloured preservative oil or stain is used, a wooden shed can either be made to stand out as a feature within a garden, or to blend in with its surroundings. Red cedar coloured stain is popular. Legislation such as the European Biocidal Products Regulation has reduced the number of effective active ingredients available for wood preservative formulations. For this reason, in recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on preserving wood by keeping it dry, for example through the application of water-repellent \"wood protection creams.\"\n\nSome types of wood, such as [[Cedrus|cedar]], are more naturally resistant to water damage.\n\nWhen looking for a wooden shed, it is important to understand the difference between the two types of preservative used in their manufacture. The timber will have been treated in one of two ways: dip treatment or pressure treatment. Dip-treated sheds are made from components that are lowered into a tank of preservative before the panels are assembled. This is a quick and simple process which keeps costs down and encourages manufacturers to produce a wide variety, making dip-treated sheds the most popular and affordable type on the market. They are easily recognisable by their golden brown colour, which is due to a dye added to the preservative. Most manufacturers offer a 10-year anti-rot guarantee on dip-treated sheds, but they have to be re-coated every year or two. [http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/benefits-of-a-dip-treated-shed-or-workshop/]\n\nPressure-treated sheds are made from timber planks which have had the moisture sucked out of them under vacuum conditions in a special cylinder. A powerful preservative is then forced into the wood at high pressure until it is absorbed deep into the grain, becoming an integral part of the timber. This provides excellent protection against the weather - so much so that manufacturers generally give a 15-year anti-rot guarantee. These sheds are usually distinguished by a pale green tinge which will fade eventually to a silvery grey. Although pressure-treated sheds tend to be more expensive than dip-treated ones, their big advantage is that they won't need any further preservative treatment during the guarantee period, saving owners time and money. [http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/benefits-of-a-pressure-treated-shed-or-workshop/]\n\nOne advantage of using wood sheds over metal versions is that it is easier to modify them by adding windows, doors, shelving, or exterior trim (etc.) because wood can be cut and drilled using commonly available tools, whereas a plastic or metal shed requires specialized tools. Some homeowners may prefer wood sheds because wood is a renewable resource.\n\n====Vinyl-sided====\n[[File:10x12 Vinyl Manor.jpg|left|thumb|An Amish-style vinyl-sided shed]]\nVinyl-sided sheds are typically built with standard wood framing construction and oriented strand board (OSB) on the walls covered with standard vinyl siding. The vinyl siding protects the OSB wood and the frame from moisture from rain and snow. Vinyl-sided sheds never need to be painted, and are maintenance-free. They are stronger than plastic or metal sheds, and are usually built to conform with the local building codes. They offer good value for money because they hold up in all weather, including winters with heavy snowfall, as they use a strong wooden frame and the OSB panels have stronger structural support than thin metal or PVC siding or roofs.  Metal, plastic and resin sheds are cheaper, but they cannot handle the weight of snow in winter (roofs may cave in). Vinyl sheds also offer more colour options.\n\n====Asbestos====\nIn the early and middle years of the 20th century, many garden sheds and domestic garages were made of [[asbestos]]-cement sheets supported on a very light angle-iron frame.  Concerns about safety led to the practice being discontinued, but they were cheap and long-lasting, and many can still be seen in British gardens.  Advice on continued use or disposal is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.org.uk/FAQAC.html|title=Asbestos Cement FAQs - Asbestos Garage Roof Q&A - AIC|website=www.aic.org.uk|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425050354/http://www.aic.org.uk/FAQAC.html|archivedate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====TPR====\nSince 2013 garden sheds have been available in the UK made from TPR - a sustainable alternative to concrete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.affresol.com/non-timber-framed-low-cost-housing.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715044234/http://affresol.com/non-timber-framed-low-cost-housing.asp |archivedate=2014-07-15 }}</ref> They are typically coated in a marine gelcoat and are far stronger and more durable than traditional sheds.

After being contacted by local woman Meche Moreyra Orozco, the head of the Association of Collatinos in Lima, Hyland was granted access to the [[Epistle|epistolary]] ''quipus'' of San Juan de Collata. These ''quipus'' were exchanged during an 18th century rebellion against the Spanish government. A combination of color, fiber and [[Ply (layer)|ply]] direction leads to a total of 95 combinations in these ''quipus'', which is within the range of a logosyllabic [[writing system]]. Exchanging information about the rebellion through ''quipus'' would have prevented the Spanish authorities from understanding the messages if they were intercepted, and the Collata ''quipus'' are non-numeric. With the help of local leaders, who described the ''quipu'' as \"a language of animals\", Hyland was able to translate the names of the two ''ayllus'', or family lineages, who received and sent the ''quipu''. The translation relied on phonetic references to the animal fibers and colors of the relevant ''quipu'' cords. Future research will attempt to determine whether Hyland's findings are applicable to ''quipus'' from the Inca period and earlier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2017/oct/unraveling-a-secret|title=The Inka Empire Recorded Their World In Knotted Cords Called Khipu|last=Alex|first=Bridget|date=4 January 2019|website=Discover}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/unraveling-an-ancient-code-written-in-strings/|title=Unraveling an Ancient Code Written in Strings|last=Hyland|first=Sabine|date=11 November 2017|website=Scientific American}}</ref>\n\n=== Numerial system ===\n{{Numeral systems}}\n[[Marcia Ascher]] and Robert Ascher, after having analyzed several hundred ''quipus'', have shown that most information on ''quipus'' is numeric, and these numbers can be read. Each cluster of knots is a digit, and there are three main types of knots: simple [[overhand knot]]s; \"long knots\", consisting of an overhand knot with one or more additional [[turn (knot)|turns]]; and [[figure-eight knot]]s. In the Aschers\u2019 system, a fourth type of knot\u2014figure-of-eight knot with an extra twist\u2014is referred to as \"EE\". A number is represented as a sequence of knot clusters in base 10.<ref>\"Quipu\" (2012)</ref>\n* Powers of ten are shown by position along the string, and this position is aligned between successive strands.\n* Digits in positions for 10 and higher powers are represented by clusters of simple knots (e.g., 40 is four simple knots in a row in the \"tens\" position).\n* Digits in the \"ones\" position are represented by long knots (e.g., 4 is a knot with four turns). Because of the way the knots are tied, the digit 1 cannot be shown this way and is represented in this position by a figure-of-eight knot.\n* [[Zero]] is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.\n* Because the ones digit is shown in a distinctive way, it is clear where a number ends. One strand on a ''quipu'' can therefore contain several numbers.\n\nFor example, if 4s represents four simple knots, 3L represents a long knot with three turns, E represents a figure-of-eight knot and X represents a space:\n* The number 731 would be represented by 7s, 3s, E.\n* The number 804 would be represented by 8s, X, 4L.\n* The number 107 followed by the number 51 would be represented by 1s, X, 7L, 5s, E.\n\nThis reading can be confirmed by a fortunate fact: ''quipus'' regularly contain sums in a systematic way. For instance, a cord may contain the sum of the next ''n'' cords, and this relationship is repeated throughout the ''quipu''. Sometimes there are sums of sums as well. Such a relationship would be very improbable if the knots were incorrectly read.<ref name=\"AncientScripts\" />\n\nSome data items are not numbers but what Ascher and Ascher call ''number labels''. They are still composed of digits, but the resulting number seems to be used as a code, much as we use numbers to identify individuals, places, or things. Lacking the context for individual quipus, it is difficult to guess what any given code might mean. Other aspects of a ''quipu'' could have communicated information as well: color-coding, relative placement of cords, spacing, and the structure of cords and sub-cords.<ref name=\"Locke, 1912\">Locke, 1912</ref>\n\n=== Literary uses ===\nSome have argued that far more than numeric information is present and that ''quipus'' are a [[writing system]]. This would be an especially important discovery as there is no surviving record of written Quechua predating the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|Spanish invasion]]. Possible reasons for this apparent absence of a written language include an actual absence of a written language, destruction by the Spanish of all written records, or the successful concealment by the Inca peoples of those records. Making the matter even more complex, the Inca 'kept separate \"khipu\" for each province, on which a pendant string recorded the number of people belonging to each category.'<ref>D'altroy, Terrence N. \"The Incas.\" 234\u2013235</ref> This creates yet another step in the process of decryption in addition to the Spanish attempts at eradicating the system.<ref name=suppress/> Historians Edward Hyams and George Ordish believe quipus were recording devices, similar to musical notation, in that the notes on the page present basic information, and the performer would then bring those details to life.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Ordish, George |author2=Hyams, Edward |title=The last of the Incas: the rise and fall of an American empire |publisher=Barnes & Noble |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/lastofincasrisef0000hyam/page/84 84] |isbn=978-0-88029-595-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=https://archive.org/details/lastofincasrisef0000hyam/page/84 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, while checking the geometric signs that appear on drawings of Inca dresses from the ''[[Primer Nueva Cor\u00f3nica y Buen Gobierno|First New Chronicle and Good Government]]'', written by [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]] in 1615, [[William Burns Glynn]] found a pattern that seems to decipher some words from ''quipus'' by matching knots to colors of strings.\n\nThe August 12, 2005, edition of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' includes a report titled \"Khipu Accounting in Ancient Peru\" by anthropologist [[Gary Urton]] and mathematician [[Carrie J.

This manuscript consists of nine [[folios]] with Spanish, [[Latin]], and ciphered Italian texts. Owned by the family of Neapolitan historian Clara Miccinelli, the manuscript also includes a wool ''quipu'' fragment. Miccinelli believes that the text was written by two Italian Jesuit missionaries, Joan Antonio Cumis and Giovanni Anello Oliva, around 1610\u20131638, and [[Blas Valera]], a [[mestizo]] Jesuit sometime before 1618. Along with the details of reading literary ''quipus'', the documents also discuss the events and people of the Spanish conquest of [[Peru]]. According to Cumis, since so many ''quipus'' were burned by the Spanish, very few remained for him to analyze. As related in the manuscript, the word [[Pacha Kamaq]], the Inca deity of earth and time, was used many times in these ''quipus'', where the syllables were represented by symbols formed in the knots. Following the analysis of the use of \"Pacha Kamaq\", the manuscript offers a list of many words present in ''quipus''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Laurencich-Minelli |first1=Laura |title=Historia et Rudimenta Linguae Piruanorum \u00bfun estorbo o un acontecimiento? |journal=Anthropologica del Departamento de Ciencias Sociales |date=28 March 1998 |volume=16 |issue=16 |pages=349\u2013367 |url=http://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/anthropologica/article/view/1561 |language=es |issn=2224-6428}}</ref> However, Bruce Mannheim, the director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the [[University of Michigan]], and [[Colgate University]]'s Gary Urton, question its origin and authenticity.

After being contacted by local woman Meche Moreyra Orozco, the head of the Association of Collatinos in Lima, Hyland was granted access to the [[Epistle|epistolary]] ''quipus'' of San Juan de Collata. These ''quipus'' were exchanged during an 18th century rebellion against the Spanish government. A combination of color, fiber and [[Ply (layer)|ply]] direction leads to a total of 95 combinations in these ''quipus'', which is within the range of a logosyllabic [[writing system]]. Exchanging information about the rebellion through ''quipus'' would have prevented the Spanish authorities from understanding the messages if they were intercepted, and the Collata ''quipus'' are non-numeric. With the help of local leaders, who described the ''quipu'' as \"a language of animals\", Hyland was able to translate the names of the two ''ayllus'', or family lineages, who received and sent the ''quipu''.

Future research will attempt to determine whether Hyland's findings are applicable to ''quipus'' from the Inca period and earlier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2017/oct/unraveling-a-secret|title=The Inka Empire Recorded Their World In Knotted Cords Called Khipu|last=Alex|first=Bridget|date=4 January 2019|website=Discover}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/unraveling-an-ancient-code-written-in-strings/|title=Unraveling an Ancient Code Written in Strings|last=Hyland|first=Sabine|date=11 November 2017|website=Scientific American}}</ref>\n\n=== Numerial system ===\n{{Numeral systems}}\n[[Marcia Ascher]] and Robert Ascher, after having analyzed several hundred ''quipus'', have shown that most information on ''quipus'' is numeric, and these numbers can be read. Each cluster of knots is a digit, and there are three main types of knots: simple [[overhand knot]]s; \"long knots\", consisting of an overhand knot with one or more additional [[turn (knot)|turns]]; and [[figure-eight knot]]s. In the Aschers\u2019 system, a fourth type of knot\u2014figure-of-eight knot with an extra twist\u2014is referred to as \"EE\". A number is represented as a sequence of knot clusters in base 10.<ref>\"Quipu\" (2012)</ref>\n* Powers of ten are shown by position along the string, and this position is aligned between successive strands.\n* Digits in positions for 10 and higher powers are represented by clusters of simple knots (e.g., 40 is four simple knots in a row in the \"tens\" position).\n* Digits in the \"ones\" position are represented by long knots (e.g., 4 is a knot with four turns). Because of the way the knots are tied, the digit 1 cannot be shown this way and is represented in this position by a figure-of-eight knot.\n* [[Zero]] is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.\n* Because the ones digit is shown in a distinctive way, it is clear where a number ends. One strand on a ''quipu'' can therefore contain several numbers.\n\nFor example, if 4s represents four simple knots, 3L represents a long knot with three turns, E represents a figure-of-eight knot and X represents a space:\n* The number 731 would be represented by 7s, 3s, E.\n* The number 804 would be represented by 8s, X, 4L.\n* The number 107 followed by the number 51 would be represented by 1s, X, 7L, 5s, E.\n\nThis reading can be confirmed by a fortunate fact: ''quipus'' regularly contain sums in a systematic way. For instance, a cord may contain the sum of the next ''n'' cords, and this relationship is repeated throughout the ''quipu''. Sometimes there are sums of sums as well. Such a relationship would be very improbable if the knots were incorrectly read.<ref name=\"AncientScripts\" />\n\nSome data items are not numbers but what Ascher and Ascher call ''number labels''. They are still composed of digits, but the resulting number seems to be used as a code, much as we use numbers to identify individuals, places, or things. Lacking the context for individual quipus, it is difficult to guess what any given code might mean. Other aspects of a ''quipu'' could have communicated information as well: color-coding, relative placement of cords, spacing, and the structure of cords and sub-cords.<ref name=\"Locke, 1912\">Locke, 1912</ref>\n\n=== Literary uses ===\nSome have argued that far more than numeric information is present and that ''quipus'' are a [[writing system]]. This would be an especially important discovery as there is no surviving record of written Quechua predating the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|Spanish invasion]]. Possible reasons for this apparent absence of a written language include an actual absence of a written language, destruction by the Spanish of all written records, or the successful concealment by the Inca peoples of those records. Making the matter even more complex, the Inca 'kept separate \"khipu\" for each province, on which a pendant string recorded the number of people belonging to each category.'<ref>D'altroy, Terrence N. \"The Incas.\" 234\u2013235</ref> This creates yet another step in the process of decryption in addition to the Spanish attempts at eradicating the system.<ref name=suppress/> Historians Edward Hyams and George Ordish believe quipus were recording devices, similar to musical notation, in that the notes on the page present basic information, and the performer would then bring those details to life.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Ordish, George |author2=Hyams, Edward |title=The last of the Incas: the rise and fall of an American empire |publisher=Barnes & Noble |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/lastofincasrisef0000hyam/page/84 84] |isbn=978-0-88029-595-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=https://archive.org/details/lastofincasrisef0000hyam/page/84 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, while checking the geometric signs that appear on drawings of Inca dresses from the ''[[Primer Nueva Cor\u00f3nica y Buen Gobierno|First New Chronicle and Good Government]]'', written by [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala]] in 1615, [[William Burns Glynn]] found a pattern that seems to decipher some words from ''quipus'' by matching knots to colors of strings.\n\nThe August 12, 2005, edition of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' includes a report titled \"Khipu Accounting in Ancient Peru\" by anthropologist [[Gary Urton]] and mathematician [[Carrie J.

This manuscript consists of nine [[folios]] with Spanish, [[Latin]], and ciphered Italian texts. Owned by the family of Neapolitan historian Clara Miccinelli, the manuscript also includes a wool ''quipu'' fragment. Miccinelli believes that the text was written by two Italian Jesuit missionaries, Joan Antonio Cumis and Giovanni Anello Oliva, around 1610\u20131638, and [[Blas Valera]], a [[mestizo]] Jesuit sometime before 1618. Along with the details of reading literary ''quipus'', the documents also discuss the events and people of the Spanish conquest of [[Peru]]. According to Cumis, since so many ''quipus'' were burned by the Spanish, very few remained for him to analyze. As related in the manuscript, the word [[Pacha Kamaq]], the Inca deity of earth and time, was used many times in these ''quipus'', where the syllables were represented by symbols formed in the knots. Following the analysis of the use of \"Pacha Kamaq\", the manuscript offers a list of many words present in ''quipus''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Laurencich-Minelli |first1=Laura |title=Historia et Rudimenta Linguae Piruanorum \u00bfun estorbo o un acontecimiento? |journal=Anthropologica del Departamento de Ciencias Sociales |date=28 March 1998 |volume=16 |issue=16 |pages=349\u2013367 |url=http://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/anthropologica/article/view/1561 |language=es |issn=2224-6428}}</ref> However, Bruce Mannheim, the director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the [[University of Michigan]], and [[Colgate University]]'s Gary Urton, question its origin and authenticity.

''Quipu'' cords can be \"mechanically cleaned with brushes, small tools and light vacuuming\".<ref name=\"Salomon\" /> Just as the application of [[fungicides]] is not recommended to rid quipus of mold, neither is the use of [[solvents]] to clean them.\n\nEven when people have tried to preserve ''quipus'', corrective care may still be required.
