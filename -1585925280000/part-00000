Despite not being part of the original Arabic text, it is one of the best known tales in [[One Thousand and One Nights|''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (The Arabian Nights)'']]. It was added to the collection in the 18th century by the Frenchman [[Antoine Galland]], who acquired the tale from [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronites|Maronite]] storyteller [[Hanna Diyab]],<ref name=\"razzaque\">Razzaque (2017)</ref> and has since been one of the best known and most retold of all fairy tales.\n\n==Sources==\nKnown along with [[Ali Baba]] as one of the \"orphan tales\", the story was not part of the original ''Nights'' collection and has no authentic Arabic textual source, but was incorporated into the book ''[[Les mille et une nuits]]'' by its [[French language|French]] translator, [[Antoine Galland]].<ref>Allen (2005) pp.280\u2013</ref>\n\n[[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]] quotes passages from Galland's unpublished diary: recording Galland's encounter with a [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronite]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]], [[Hanna Diyab]].<ref name=\"razzaque\"/> According to Galland's diary, he met with Hanna, who had travelled from Aleppo to [[Paris]] with celebrated French traveller [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], on March 25, 1709. Galland's diary further reports that his transcription of \"Aladdin\" for publication occurred in the winter of 1709\u201310. It was included in his volumes ix and x of the ''Nights'', published in 1710, without any mention or published acknowledgment of Hanna's contribution. Paulo Lemos Horta, in the introduction to his translation of ''Aladdin'', speculates that Diyab might be the original author of at least some of the \"orphan\" tales, including Aladdin.<ref name=\"Horta\">Horta (2018) pp. 8-10</ref>\n\nTo return to Payne, he also records the discovery in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] in Paris of two [[Arabic language|Arabic manuscripts]] containing ''Aladdin'' (with two more of the \"interpolated\" tales). One was written by a Syrian Christian priest living in Paris, named [[Dionysios Shawish]], alias Dom Denis Chavis. The other is supposed to be a copy Mikhail Sabbagh made of a manuscript written in [[Baghdad]] in 1703. It was purchased by the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at the end of the nineteenth century.<ref name=Payne1>Payne (1901) pp. 13-15</ref> As part of his work on the first critical edition of the ''Nights'', [[Iraq]]'s [[Muhsin Mahdi]] has shown<ref>Irwin (1994) pp. 57-58</ref> that both these manuscripts are \"back-translations\" of Galland's text into Arabic.<ref name=Mahdi1>Mahdi (1994) pp. 51-71 </ref><ref>Dobie (2008) p.36</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Robida - Aladin illustration page1.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|The Sorcerer traps Aladdin in the magic cave.]]\nThe story is often \"re-told\" with variations. The following is a pr\u00e9cis of the Burton translation of 1885.''<ref name=Burtony1>Burton (2009) pp. 1 ff</ref>\n\nAladdin is an impoverished young ne'er-do-well, dwelling in \"one of the cities of China\". He is recruited by a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] from the [[Maghreb]], who passes himself off as the brother of Aladdin's late father, ''Mustapha the [[tailor]]'', convincing Aladdin and his mother of his good will by pretending to set up the lad as a wealthy merchant. The sorcerer's real motive is to persuade young Aladdin to retrieve a wonderful [[oil lamp]] from a [[Booby trap|booby-trapped]] magic cave. After the sorcerer attempts to double-cross him, Aladdin finds himself trapped in the cave. Aladdin is still wearing a [[magic ring]] the sorcerer has lent him. When he rubs his hands in despair, he inadvertently rubs the ring and a [[jinn]]\u012b (or \"genie\") appears who releases him from the cave, allowing him to return to his mother while in possession of the lamp. When his mother tries to clean the lamp, so they can sell it to buy food for their supper, a second far more powerful genie appears who is bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp.\n\nWith the aid of the genie of the lamp, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries Princess [[Badroulbadour]], the [[sultan]]'s daughter (after magically foiling her marriage to the [[vizier]]'s son). The genie builds Aladdin and his bride a wonderful palace, far more magnificent than the sultan's.\n\nThe sorcerer hears of Aladdin's good fortune, and returns; he gets his hands on the lamp by tricking Aladdin's wife (who is unaware of the lamp's importance) by offering to exchange \"new lamps for old\". He orders the genie of the lamp to take the palace, along with all its contents, to his home in the Maghreb. Aladdin still has the magic ring and is able to summon the lesser genie. The genie of the ring cannot directly undo any of the magic of the genie of the lamp, but he is able to transport Aladdin to the Maghreb where, with the help of the \"woman's wiles\" of the princess, he recovers the lamp and slays the sorcerer, returning the palace to its proper place.\n\nThe sorcerer's more powerful and evil brother plots to destroy Aladdin for killing his brother by disguising himself as an old woman known for her healing powers. Badroulbadour falls for his disguise and commands the \"woman\" to stay in her palace in case of any illnesses. Aladdin is warned of this danger by the genie of the lamp and slays the impostor.\n\nAladdin eventually succeeds to his father-in-law's throne.\n\n==Setting==\nThe opening sentences of the story, in both the Galland and the Burton versions, set it in \"one of the cities of China\".<ref name=Plotz1>Plotz (2001) p. 148\u2013149</ref> On the other hand, there is practically nothing in the rest of the story that is inconsistent with a Middle Eastern setting. For instance, the ruler is referred to as \"[[Sultan]]\" rather than being called the \"[[Emperor of China|Emperor]]\", as in some re-tellings, and the people in the story are Muslims and their conversation is larded with [[Muslims|devout Muslim]] platitudes. A [[Jews|Jewish]] merchant buys Aladdin's wares (and incidentally cheats him), but there is no mention of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] or [[Confucianism|Confucians]] (or other distinctively [[Chinese people]]).\n\nNotably, [[ethnic groups in Chinese history]] have long included [[Chinese Muslims|Muslim groups]], including large populations of [[Uighurs]], and the [[Hui people]] whose origins go back to [[Silk Road]] travelers. Islamic communities have been known to exist in the region since the [[History of Islam in China#Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]]. Some have suggested that the intended setting may be [[Turkestan]] (encompassing [[Central Asia]] and the modern Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] in [[Western China]]).<ref name=Moon1>Moon (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\nFor all this, speculation about a \"real\" Chinese setting depends on a knowledge of China that the teller of a folk tale (as opposed to a geographic expert) might well not possess.<ref name=honor1>Honour (1973) - Section I \"The Imaginary Continent\"</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{See also|Aladdin (franchise)}}\n\nAdaptations vary in their faithfulness to the original story. In particular, difficulties with the Chinese setting are sometimes resolved by giving the story a more typical ''Arabian Nights'' background.\n\n===Books===\n* One of the many literary retellings of the tale appears in ''A Book of Wizards'' (1966) and ''[[A Choice of Magic]]'' (1971), by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]].\n* \"The Nobility of Faith\" by [[Jonathan Clements]] in the anthology ''[[Doctor Who]] Short Trips: The Ghosts of Christmas ''(2007) is a retelling of the Aladdin story in the style of the Arabian Nights, but featuring the Doctor in the role of the genie.\n\n===Pantomimes===\n[[File:He's behind you.jpg|thumb|120px|right| An 1886 theatre poster advertising a production of the pantomime Aladdin.]]\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the story of Aladdin was dramatised in 1788 by [[John O'Keeffe (writer)|John O'Keefe]] for the [[The Royal Opera|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]].<ref name=\"Witchard1\">Witchard (2017)</ref> It has been a popular subject for [[pantomime]] for over 200 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html |title=Aladdin |website=www.its-behind-you.com |accessdate=2008-01-22 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205031442/http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html| archivedate= 5 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Aladdin pantomime is the source of the well-known pantomime character [[Widow Twankey]] (Aladdin's mother). In pantomime versions, changes in the setting and story are often made to fit it better into \"China\" (albeit a China situated in the [[East End of London]] rather than Medieval [[Baghdad]]), and elements of other Arabian Nights tales (in particular [[Ali Baba]]) are often introduced into the plot. One version of the \"pantomime Aladdin\" is [[Sandy Wilson]]'s [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Aladdin (1979 musical)|Aladdin]]'', from 1979.\n\nSince the early 1990s Aladdin pantomimes have tended to be influenced by [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|the Disney animation]]. For instance, the 2007/8 production at the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]] starring [[John Barrowman]] featured songs from the Disney movies ''Aladdin'' and ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''.\n\n=== Other musical theatre ===\n[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''New Crowns for Old'', a 19th-century British cartoon based on the Aladdin story ([[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] as Abanazer from the [[pantomime]] version of Aladdin offering [[Queen Victoria]] an Imperial crown (of India) in exchange for a Royal one)]]\n* ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' was a successful [[Edwardian musical comedy]] in 1906.\n*[[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] wrote his verse drama ''Aladdin'' in 1805.

In this version the princess Aladdin pursues is Achmed's sister and the sorcerer is his rival for her hand. The sorcerer steals the castle and the princess through his own magic and then sets a monster to attack Aladdin, from which Achmed rescues him. Achmed then informs Aladdin he requires the lamp to rescue his own intended wife, Princess Pari Banou, from the demons of the Island of Wak Wak. They convince the Witch of the Fiery Mountain to defeat the sorcerer, and then all three heroes join forces to battle the demons.\n* The 1938 animated film ''[[Have You Got Any Castles?]]'', Aladdin makes a brief appearance asking for help but gets punched by one of the Three Musketeers.\n* ''[[Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp]]'' is a 1939 ''[[Popeye|Popeye the Sailor]]'' cartoon.\n* The 1959 animated film ''[[1001 Arabian Nights (1959 film)|1001 Arabian Nights]]'' starring [[Mr. Magoo]] as Aladdin's uncle and produced by [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]]''.\n* The animated feature ''[[Aladdin and His Magic Lamp (1970 film)|Aladdin et la lampe merveilleuse]]'' by Film Jean Image was released in 1970 in France. The story contains many of the original elements of the story as compared to the Disney version.\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1982 film)|Aladdin and the Magic Lamp]]'' was a rendition in Japanese directed by Yoshikatsu Kasai, produced in Japan by [[Toei Animation]] and released in United States by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]] in 1982.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', the 1992 [[animated feature]] by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] (possibly currently the best known re-telling of the story). In this version several characters are renamed or amalgamated. For instance the Sorcerer and the Sultan's vizier become one character named [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Jafar|Jafar]] while the Princess is re-named [[Princess Jasmine|Jasmine]]. They have new motivations for their actions. The [[Genie (Disney)|Genie of the Lamp]] only grants three wishes and desires freedom from his role. A sentient [[magic carpet]] replaces the ring's genie while Jafar uses a royal magic ring to find Aladdin. The names \"Jafar\" and \"Abu\", the Sultan's delight in toys, and their physical appearances are borrowed from the 1940 film, ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]''. The setting is moved from China to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah and the structure of the plot is simplified.\n**''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994), [[direct-to-video]] sequel to the 1992 Walt Disney movie.\n**''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996), direct-to-video second and final sequel to the 1992 Walt Disney movie.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Golden Films film)|Aladdin]]'' by [[Golden Films]] was released directly on video in 1992.\n\n====Live action====\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1917 film)|Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp]]'' (1917), directed by [[Chester M.

Despite not being part of the original Arabic text, it is one of the best known tales in [[One Thousand and One Nights|''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (The Arabian Nights)'']]. It was added to the collection in the 18th century by the Frenchman [[Antoine Galland]], who acquired the tale from [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronites|Maronite]] storyteller [[Hanna Diyab]].<ref name=\"razzaque\">Razzaque (2017)</ref> In any case, since it first appeared, ''\"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp\"'' has been one of the best known and most retold of all fairy tales.\n\n==Sources==\nKnown along with [[Ali Baba]] as one of the \"orphan tales\", the story was not part of the original ''Nights'' collection and has no authentic Arabic textual source, but was incorporated into the book ''[[Les mille et une nuits]]'' by its [[French language|French]] translator, [[Antoine Galland]].<ref>Allen (2005) pp.280\u2013</ref>\n\n[[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]] quotes passages from Galland's unpublished diary: recording Galland's encounter with a [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian]] [[Maronite]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]], [[Hanna Diyab]].<ref name=\"razzaque\"/> According to Galland's diary, he met with Hanna, who had travelled from Aleppo to [[Paris]] with celebrated French traveller [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], on March 25, 1709. Galland's diary further reports that his transcription of \"Aladdin\" for publication occurred in the winter of 1709\u201310. It was included in his volumes ix and x of the ''Nights'', published in 1710, without any mention or published acknowledgment of Hanna's contribution. Paulo Lemos Horta, in the introduction to his translation of ''Aladdin'', speculates that Diyab might be the original author of at least some of the \"orphan\" tales, including Aladdin.<ref name=\"Horta\">Horta (2018) pp. 8-10</ref>\n\nTo return to Payne, he also records the discovery in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] in Paris of two [[Arabic language|Arabic manuscripts]] containing ''Aladdin'' (with two more of the \"interpolated\" tales). One was written by a Syrian Christian priest living in Paris, named [[Dionysios Shawish]], alias Dom Denis Chavis. The other is supposed to be a copy Mikhail Sabbagh made of a manuscript written in [[Baghdad]] in 1703. It was purchased by the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at the end of the nineteenth century.<ref name=Payne1>Payne (1901) pp. 13-15</ref> As part of his work on the first critical edition of the ''Nights'', [[Iraq]]'s [[Muhsin Mahdi]] has shown<ref>Irwin (1994) pp. 57-58</ref> that both these manuscripts are \"back-translations\" of Galland's text into Arabic.<ref name=Mahdi1>Mahdi (1994) pp. 51-71 </ref><ref>Dobie (2008) p.36</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Robida - Aladin illustration page1.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|The Sorcerer traps Aladdin in the magic cave.]]\nThe story is often \"re-told\" with variations. The following is a pr\u00e9cis of the Burton translation of 1885.''<ref name=Burtony1>Burton (2009) pp. 1 ff</ref>\n\nAladdin is an impoverished young ne'er-do-well, dwelling in \"one of the cities of China\". He is recruited by a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] from the [[Maghreb]], who passes himself off as the brother of Aladdin's late father, ''Mustapha the [[tailor]]'', convincing Aladdin and his mother of his good will by pretending to set up the lad as a wealthy merchant. The sorcerer's real motive is to persuade young Aladdin to retrieve a wonderful [[oil lamp]] from a [[Booby trap|booby-trapped]] magic cave. After the sorcerer attempts to double-cross him, Aladdin finds himself trapped in the cave. Aladdin is still wearing a [[magic ring]] the sorcerer has lent him. When he rubs his hands in despair, he inadvertently rubs the ring and a [[jinn]]\u012b (or \"genie\") appears who releases him from the cave, allowing him to return to his mother while in possession of the lamp. When his mother tries to clean the lamp, so they can sell it to buy food for their supper, a second far more powerful genie appears who is bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp.\n\nWith the aid of the genie of the lamp, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries Princess [[Badroulbadour]], the [[sultan]]'s daughter (after magically foiling her marriage to the [[vizier]]'s son). The genie builds Aladdin and his bride a wonderful palace, far more magnificent than the sultan's.\n\nThe sorcerer hears of Aladdin's good fortune, and returns; he gets his hands on the lamp by tricking Aladdin's wife (who is unaware of the lamp's importance) by offering to exchange \"new lamps for old\". He orders the genie of the lamp to take the palace, along with all its contents, to his home in the Maghreb. Aladdin still has the magic ring and is able to summon the lesser genie. The genie of the ring cannot directly undo any of the magic of the genie of the lamp, but he is able to transport Aladdin to the Maghreb where, with the help of the \"woman's wiles\" of the princess, he recovers the lamp and slays the sorcerer, returning the palace to its proper place.\n\nThe sorcerer's more powerful and evil brother plots to destroy Aladdin for killing his brother by disguising himself as an old woman known for her healing powers. Badroulbadour falls for his disguise and commands the \"woman\" to stay in her palace in case of any illnesses. Aladdin is warned of this danger by the genie of the lamp and slays the impostor.\n\nAladdin eventually succeeds to his father-in-law's throne.\n\n==Setting==\nThe opening sentences of the story, in both the Galland and the Burton versions, set it in \"one of the cities of China\".<ref name=Plotz1>Plotz (2001) p. 148\u2013149</ref> On the other hand, there is practically nothing in the rest of the story that is inconsistent with a Middle Eastern setting. For instance, the ruler is referred to as \"[[Sultan]]\" rather than being called the \"[[Emperor of China|Emperor]]\", as in some re-tellings, and the people in the story are Muslims and their conversation is larded with [[Muslims|devout Muslim]] platitudes. A [[Jews|Jewish]] merchant buys Aladdin's wares (and incidentally cheats him), but there is no mention of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] or [[Confucianism|Confucians]] (or other distinctively [[Chinese people]]).\n\nNotably, [[ethnic groups in Chinese history]] have long included [[Chinese Muslims|Muslim groups]], including large populations of [[Uighurs]], and the [[Hui people]] whose origins go back to [[Silk Road]] travelers. Islamic communities have been known to exist in the region since the [[History of Islam in China#Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]]. Some have suggested that the intended setting may be [[Turkestan]] (encompassing [[Central Asia]] and the modern Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] in [[Western China]]).<ref name=Moon1>Moon (2005) p. 23</ref>\n\nFor all this, speculation about a \"real\" Chinese setting depends on a knowledge of China that the teller of a folk tale (as opposed to a geographic expert) might well not possess.<ref name=honor1>Honour (1973) - Section I \"The Imaginary Continent\"</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n{{See also|Aladdin (franchise)}}\n\nAdaptations vary in their faithfulness to the original story. In particular, difficulties with the Chinese setting are sometimes resolved by giving the story a more typical ''Arabian Nights'' background.\n\n===Books===\n* One of the many literary retellings of the tale appears in ''A Book of Wizards'' (1966) and ''[[A Choice of Magic]]'' (1971), by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]].\n* \"The Nobility of Faith\" by [[Jonathan Clements]] in the anthology ''[[Doctor Who]] Short Trips: The Ghosts of Christmas ''(2007) is a retelling of the Aladdin story in the style of the Arabian Nights, but featuring the Doctor in the role of the genie.\n\n===Pantomimes===\n[[File:He's behind you.jpg|thumb|120px|right| An 1886 theatre poster advertising a production of the pantomime Aladdin.]]\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the story of Aladdin was dramatised in 1788 by [[John O'Keeffe (writer)|John O'Keefe]] for the [[The Royal Opera|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]].<ref name=\"Witchard1\">Witchard (2017)</ref> It has been a popular subject for [[pantomime]] for over 200 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html |title=Aladdin |website=www.its-behind-you.com |accessdate=2008-01-22 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205031442/http://www.its-behind-you.com/aladdin.html| archivedate= 5 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Aladdin pantomime is the source of the well-known pantomime character [[Widow Twankey]] (Aladdin's mother). In pantomime versions, changes in the setting and story are often made to fit it better into \"China\" (albeit a China situated in the [[East End of London]] rather than Medieval [[Baghdad]]), and elements of other Arabian Nights tales (in particular [[Ali Baba]]) are often introduced into the plot. One version of the \"pantomime Aladdin\" is [[Sandy Wilson]]'s [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Aladdin (1979 musical)|Aladdin]]'', from 1979.\n\nSince the early 1990s Aladdin pantomimes have tended to be influenced by [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|the Disney animation]]. For instance, the 2007/8 production at the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]] starring [[John Barrowman]] featured songs from the Disney movies ''Aladdin'' and ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''.\n\n=== Other musical theatre ===\n[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''New Crowns for Old'', a 19th-century British cartoon based on the Aladdin story ([[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] as Abanazer from the [[pantomime]] version of Aladdin offering [[Queen Victoria]] an Imperial crown (of India) in exchange for a Royal one)]]\n* ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' was a successful [[Edwardian musical comedy]] in 1906.\n*[[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] wrote his verse drama ''Aladdin'' in 1805.

In this version the princess Aladdin pursues is Achmed's sister and the sorcerer is his rival for her hand. The sorcerer steals the castle and the princess through his own magic and then sets a monster to attack Aladdin, from which Achmed rescues him. Achmed then informs Aladdin he requires the lamp to rescue his own intended wife, Princess Pari Banou, from the demons of the Island of Wak Wak. They convince the Witch of the Fiery Mountain to defeat the sorcerer, and then all three heroes join forces to battle the demons.\n* The 1938 animated film ''[[Have You Got Any Castles?]]'', Aladdin makes a brief appearance asking for help but gets punched by one of the Three Musketeers.\n* ''[[Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp]]'' is a 1939 ''[[Popeye|Popeye the Sailor]]'' cartoon.\n* The 1959 animated film ''[[1001 Arabian Nights (1959 film)|1001 Arabian Nights]]'' starring [[Mr. Magoo]] as Aladdin's uncle and produced by [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]]''.\n* The animated feature ''[[Aladdin and His Magic Lamp (1970 film)|Aladdin et la lampe merveilleuse]]'' by Film Jean Image was released in 1970 in France. The story contains many of the original elements of the story as compared to the Disney version.\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1982 film)|Aladdin and the Magic Lamp]]'' was a rendition in Japanese directed by Yoshikatsu Kasai, produced in Japan by [[Toei Animation]] and released in United States by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]] in 1982.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', the 1992 [[animated feature]] by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] (possibly currently the best known re-telling of the story). In this version several characters are renamed or amalgamated. For instance the Sorcerer and the Sultan's vizier become one character named [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Jafar|Jafar]] while the Princess is re-named [[Princess Jasmine|Jasmine]]. They have new motivations for their actions. The [[Genie (Disney)|Genie of the Lamp]] only grants three wishes and desires freedom from his role. A sentient [[magic carpet]] replaces the ring's genie while Jafar uses a royal magic ring to find Aladdin. The names \"Jafar\" and \"Abu\", the Sultan's delight in toys, and their physical appearances are borrowed from the 1940 film, ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]''. The setting is moved from China to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah and the structure of the plot is simplified.\n**''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994), [[direct-to-video]] sequel to the 1992 Walt Disney movie.\n**''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996), direct-to-video second and final sequel to the 1992 Walt Disney movie.\n* ''[[Aladdin (1992 Golden Films film)|Aladdin]]'' by [[Golden Films]] was released directly on video in 1992.\n\n====Live action====\n* ''[[Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp (1917 film)|Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp]]'' (1917), directed by [[Chester M.

They were directed by [[T. R. Raghunath]] and produced by [[T. S. Balaiah]].\n* In the 1960s [[Bollywood]] produced ''Aladdin and [[Sinbad the Sailor|Sinbad]]'', very loosely based on the original, in which the two named heroes get to meet and share in each other's adventures.

Following the discovery in the early 2000s that the drug would be effective against tumours with hyperactivated [[Protein kinase B|Akt]], it is now again under consideration in a variety of cancers. As PTX-200, the drug is currently in two early stage clinical trials in breast cancer and ovarian cancer being conducted by the small molecule drug development company [[Prescient Therapeutics]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nTriciribine is a cell-permeable unnatural [[nucleoside]] that inhibits the [[phosphorylation]] and signalling of all three family members of Akt - Akt-1, Akt-2 and Akt-3. These are [[serine]]/[[threonine]] protein [[kinase]]s in the [[phosphoinositide 3-kinase]] (PI3K) signalling pathway that play a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. Following recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane, phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 (Akt-1 numbering) by [[Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1|PDK-1]] or PDK-2 results in full activation of the enzyme. Triciribine does not inhibit PI3K or PDK1, the direct upstream activators of Akt, nor does it inhibit [[Protein kinase C|PKC]], [[Protein kinase A|PKA]], [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]]1/2, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, p38, [[STAT3]], or JNK signalling pathways.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Yang L |author2=Dan HC |author3=Sun M |author4=Liu Q |author5=Sun XM |author6=Feldman RI |author7=Hamilton AD |author8=Polokoff M |author9=Nicosia SV |author10=Herlyn M |author11=Sebti SM |author12=Cheng JQ. |title=Akt/protein kinase B signaling inhibitor-2, a selective small molecule inhibitor of Akt signaling with antitumor activity in cancer cells overexpressing Akt.\n |journal=Cancer Res. \n |volume=64\n |issue=13\n |pages=4394\u20139\n |date=July 1, 2004\n |doi= 10.1158/0008-5472.can-04-0343\n |pmid=15231645\n}}</ref>\n\n== Early development, 1971-2004 ==\n\nTriciribine, first synthesized in 1971,<ref>{{cite journal\n |vauthors=Schram KH, Townsend LB |title=The synthesis of 6-amino-4-methyl-8-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl (4-H)pyrrolo-[4-3-2depyrimido(4, 5-C) pyridazine, a new tricyclic nucleoside\n |journal=Tetrahedron Lett. \n |volume=12\n |issue=49\n |pages=4757\u20134760\n |date=December 3, 1971\n |pmid=\n |doi= 10.1016/s0040-4039(01)87546-8\n }}</ref> was found to have definite anti-cancer properties<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Townsend LB |author2=Milne GH. |title=Synthesis, chemical reactivity, and chemotherapeutic activity of certain selenonucleosides and nucleosides related to the pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidine nucleoside antibiotics.\n |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci \n |volume=255\n |issue=\n |pages=91\u2013103\n |date=August 8, 1975\n |doi= 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1975.tb29216.x\n |pmid=1059377\n}}</ref> and a phosphate ester of the drug went into clinical trials in the 1980s because it had improved solubility.

Following the discovery in the early 2000s that the drug would be effective against tumours with hyperactivated [[Protein kinase B|Akt]], it is now again under consideration in a variety of cancers. As PTX-200, the drug is currently in two early stage clinical trials in breast cancer and ovarian cancer being conducted by the small molecule drug development company [[Prescient Therapeutics]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nTriciribine is a cell-permeable unnatural [[nucleoside]] that inhibits the [[phosphorylation]] and signalling of all three family members of Akt - Akt-1, Akt-2 and Akt-3. These are [[serine]]/[[threonine]] protein [[kinase]]s in the [[phosphoinositide 3-kinase]] (PI3K) signalling pathway that play a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. Following recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane, phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 (Akt-1 numbering) by [[Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1|PDK-1]] or PDK-2 results in full activation of the enzyme. Triciribine does not inhibit PI3K or PDK1, the direct upstream activators of Akt, nor does it inhibit [[Protein kinase C|PKC]], [[Protein kinase A|PKA]], [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]]1/2, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, p38, [[STAT3]], or JNK signalling pathways.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Yang L |author2=Dan HC |author3=Sun M |author4=Liu Q |author5=Sun XM |author6=Feldman RI |author7=Hamilton AD |author8=Polokoff M |author9=Nicosia SV |author10=Herlyn M |author11=Sebti SM |author12=Cheng JQ. |title=Akt/protein kinase B signaling inhibitor-2, a selective small molecule inhibitor of Akt signaling with antitumor activity in cancer cells overexpressing Akt.\n |journal=Cancer Res. \n |volume=64\n |issue=13\n |pages=4394\u20139\n |date=July 1, 2004\n |doi= 10.1158/0008-5472.can-04-0343\n |pmid=15231645\n}}</ref>\n\n== Early development, 1971-2004 ==\n\nTriciribine, first synthesized in 1971,<ref>{{cite journal\n |vauthors=Schram KH, Townsend LB |title=The synthesis of 6-amino-4-methyl-8-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl (4-H)pyrrolo-[4-3-2depyrimido(4, 5-C) pyridazine, a new tricyclic nucleoside\n |journal=Tetrahedron Lett. \n |volume=12\n |issue=49\n |pages=4757\u20134760\n |date=December 3, 1971\n |pmid=\n |doi= 10.1016/s0040-4039(01)87546-8\n }}</ref> was found to have definite anti-cancer properties<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Townsend LB |author2=Milne GH. |title=Synthesis, chemical reactivity, and chemotherapeutic activity of certain selenonucleosides and nucleosides related to the pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidine nucleoside antibiotics.\n |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci \n |volume=255\n |issue=\n |pages=91\u2013103\n |date=August 8, 1975\n |doi= 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1975.tb29216.x\n |pmid=1059377\n}}</ref> and a phosphate ester of the drug went into clinical trials in the 1980s because it had improved solubility.
