Congress passed the [[Metric Conversion Act|Metric Conversion Act of 1975]] \"to coordinate and plan the increasing use of the metric system in the United States\". Voluntary conversion was initiated, and the [[United States Metric Board]] (USMB) was established for planning, coordination, and public education.

The ANMC became a separately incorporated organization in 1976. The ANMC was intended to facilitate U.S. metrication by maintaining a voluntary and orderly process that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits, and to provide information, forums, individual assistance, and other services for its subscribers. The ANMC attempted to coordinate the metric planning of many industrial sectors, unlike the USMB, which only attempted to implement the policy set forth in the [[Metric Conversion Act]] of 1975. After the formation of the USMB, committees of the ANMC submitted conversion plans for the chemical sector and for the instruments sector. These sector conversion plans were later approved by the USMB. From 1975 through 1987, the ANMC held a series of well-attended annual conferences. Subsequently, a series of National Metric Conferences, jointly sponsored by the ANMC, the [[U.S. Metric Association]] (USMA), the Department of Commerce, and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), were held from 1989 through 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.us-metric.org/american-national-metric-council|publisher=U.S. Metric Association, Inc|accessdate = September 3, 2015| title = American National Metric Council }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SpeedLimit-CoralRidge-MiKm-May1992 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1980s-vintage dual miles per hour and kilometers per hour sign, (formerly) located in Florida.

This legislation amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and designated the metric system as \"the Preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce\". The legislation states that the federal government has a responsibility to assist industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement.\n\nThis legislation required most federal agencies to use the metric system in their procurement, grants, and other business-related activities by the end of 1992. While not mandating metric use in the private sector, the federal government has sought to serve as a catalyst in the metric conversion of the country's trade, industry, and commerce. Exceptions were made for the highway and construction industries. The Department of Transportation planned to require metric units by 2000, but this plan was canceled by the [[Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century|1998 highway bill TEA21]].

Soft drink containers of 1 and 0.5 liters (and more recently 1.25 liter bottles) are sometimes sold alongside 12 [[fluid ounce|fl&nbsp;oz]], 16 fl&nbsp;oz, 20 fl&nbsp;oz, and 24 fl&nbsp;oz (355, 473, 591 and 710&nbsp;mL) sizes.\n\nThe half-liter water bottle (16.9 fl oz) has nearly replaced the 16 ounce size. 700&nbsp;mL (23.6 fl oz) and one-liter sizes are also common, though 20 fl&nbsp;oz, and 24 fl&nbsp;oz sizes remain popular, particularly in vending machines.\n\nAttempts to sell 3- or 4-liter jugs of [[milk]], instead of [[gallon]]s (3.785 L), have been largely unsuccessful, and such bottles are rarely seen in the United States. Milk remains sold in binary divisions of the gallon, with half-pints, [[pint]]s, [[quart]]s and half-gallons being the primary sizes.\n\n[[Shampoo]], [[mouthwash]], and [[dental floss]] have begun to be sold in metric sizes. [[PowerBar]]s and similar products have always been sold (but not marketed) by the gram.\n\n[[Nutrition facts label|Nutritional food labels]] typically report serving sizes in both systems but only list metric values (g or mg) for the breakdown of individual nutrients.\n\n==== Alcohol ====\nWine is sold in standard bottles of 750&nbsp;mL, as in the rest of the world. A fifth of liquor, once one-fifth of a U.S. gallon, or 757&nbsp;mL, is now commonly 750&nbsp;mL, though it is still referred to as \"a fifth\". Beer is sold in fluid ounce denominations. Regulations are set by the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] which controls the permissible sizes of containers. Unlike non-alcoholic beverages, most alcohol products are not required to carry unit conversions on labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ttb.gov/pdf/brochures/p51902.pdf|title=Distilled Spirits Labeling Regulations-- 27 CFR 5.38/5.47a|last=Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221014416/https://www.ttb.gov/pdf/brochures/p51902.pdf|archive-date=February 21, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Tomatos Price Per Pound.jpg|thumb|163x163px|Tomatoes being sold by the pound.]]\n\n==== Non-packaged foods ====\nLoose fruits and vegetables are near universally priced per pound or per item.

[[Compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s are 120&nbsp;mm in diameter, but their size is rarely mentioned; [[mini CD]]s are sometimes called 80mm CDs.\n\nComputer fan sizes are exclusively referred to by metric units (120&nbsp;mm or 80&nbsp;mm case fans, for example), while [[hard disk drive]] and CD drive bay widths are customary measurements, typically 3{{1/2}} inches and 5{{1/4}} inches, respectively.\n\nConsumer-size [[photographic film]] was commonly sold in a [[35mm format|35 mm standard]] (24\u00d736&nbsp;mm negative), although print sizes and [[Large format (photography)|large format]] films are defined in inches. [[Optical format|Digital camera sensor sizes]] are measured in an archaic manner indicating inverse fractions of an inch representing the diameter of an equivalent [[vidicon]] tube. For example, a {{frac|1|1.6&nbsp;in}} sensor is larger than a {{frac|1|2.5&nbsp;in}} sensor. However, lenses are marked in terms of focal length in millimeters (e.g., average natural human field of view is a lens with 50&nbsp;mm focal length for 35&nbsp;mm film).\n\n==== Clothing ====\nClothing is measured in inches, not [[centimeters]]. American [[Shoe size|shoes sizes]] are measured on different scales for children, men, and women but all sizes are derived from inches.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Your-Shoe-Size|title=How to Find Your Shoe Size|work=wikiHow|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Major multi-national apparel brands including [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]], [[Hanesbrands|Hanes]], and [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] often sell the same inventory worldwide, with tags containing both SI and customary units in addition to [[Laundry symbol|laundry care symbols]] and instructions in many languages.\n\n==== Bedding ====\n[[Bed size|Mattress sizes]] use non-numeric labels, such as king, queen, full, or twin. These sizes are defined in inches, unlike most other countries, which use similar labels defined using metric units. The FPLA mandates bed sheets state the type of bed they are intended for in addition to dimensions in centimeters and inches. The FPLA also mandates dual scales on many other woven goods such as towels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/05/09/section-IVa-12-h130-final.pdf|title=Handbook 130 \u2013 2012 Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation|last=|first=|date=May 9, 2017|website=US National Institute of Standards and Technology|page=81|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nOf all industries, construction has adopted metric units the least. [[Dimensional lumber]] comes in standard nominal inch cross-section sizes and lengths are given in feet. Although [[model building code]]s\u2014such as the [[International Building Code]]\u2014provide information in both customary and metric units, locally developed building code amendments and [[zoning]] codes often provide customary units exclusively. Because of [[Canada]]'s proximity to the U.S., issues of common units still arise. This tendency in construction is similar to [[Japan]], an otherwise metricated country where traditional construction still uses [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese units]] predating metrication. However, blueprints commonly signify measurements using decimals (e.g., 9.2&nbsp;ft.); since feet are not divided into tenths on United States measuring tapes, builders commonly are forced to make conversions on-site that are often imprecise. In the previous example, 9.2&nbsp;ft equals 9&nbsp;ft 2.4 inches; slightly more than the 9&nbsp;ft {{frac|2|3|8}} mark on United States tape measures, though this degree of error is usually insignificant for these applications.\n\n===Aviation===\nAircraft altitudes for air traffic control and related purposes are measured in feet in the U.S. In fact, most of the world has used feet for aviation altitudes since the end of World War II (meters before 1945 in all European countries except the UK), with the notable exceptions of China, North Korea, and many [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] (former Soviet) countries. For instance, an airliner on a long flight, even if neither its starting point nor destination are in the United States, might use a nominal cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, using an internationally standardized system of [[flight level]]s (Flight Level 360 in this case). In 2011, Russia switched from metric to foot-denominated flight levels at high altitude to eliminate the need for adjustments when crossing in to or out of its airspace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=119021# |title=\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0424 \u043e\u0442 05.09.2011 N 743 \"\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438\" \u2013 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441 |publisher=Base.consultant.ru |date= |accessdate=December 22, 2017 |trans-title=Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 743 of September 5, 2011 \"On Amendments to the Federal Rules for the Use of the Airspace of the Russian Federation\" \u2013 ConsultantPlus}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial aviation===\nFrequent-flyer programs from commercial airlines in the United States are commonly managed using miles. This is likely to continue; in fact, some international airlines that used kilometers are switching to miles or using both, to simplify the redemption of miles with United States airline partners (Aeromexico switched from kilometers to miles, and Varig from Brazil has used miles since the program was named \"Smiles\"). Aircraft speed is often measured in [[knot (unit)|knot]]s and elevation in feet ([[flight level]]) in many countries.\n\nFor both domestic and international routes, U.S. airlines set luggage size and weight restrictions in terms of customary units. Conversely, international airlines that fly to the U.S. often restrict baggage to metric sizes.\n\nThe temperatures in aviation-related weather reports are given in degrees Celsius in the United States.\n\nFor carry-on luggage, the [[Transportation Security Administration]] restricts liquids to 3.4 fluid ounces (100 mL).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule|title=Liquids Rule|date=December 16, 2014|work=Transportation Security Administration|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Originally, the agency planned to restrict to 3 ounces but switched it to 3.4 oz / 100 mL after pressure from the European Union.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2009/02/25/3-oz-or-34-oz-what-gives|title=3 oz or 3.4 oz?

Units of length, volume, and mass are typically introduced through comparison with ordinary objects. The metric system is not reinforced much outside the classroom due to lack of popular metric use. Consequently, while students may understand some of the concepts underlying the metric system, they do not necessarily have an intuitive sense of the value of the units.\n\nIn science education, students predominantly use metric measures in experiments and equations, allowing those interested in the sciences to become more familiar with the metric system. A few science [[Course credit|course credit]]s are requisites for an undergraduate degree in the U.S. which ensures most educated people have some exposure to the metric system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Within [[higher education]], the metric system is universal for classes in the sciences (see [[Metrication in the United States#Science and medicine|below]]), except for exercises designed to illustrate complex conversions. Engineering programs still widely use English Engineering Units, but this varies depending on the field. Electrical Engineering programs mostly use metric, while fields such as aerospace, materials, thermal, and manufacturing engineering use customary units extensively. Some non-science textbooks in the U.S. use only the metric system without giving conversions in order to promote metrication.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Electricity and energy===\nThere are no U.S. customary units for electric current, potential difference, or charge since these concepts were developed after the international adoption of metric in science. The metric units [[ampere]], [[volt]], [[ohm]] and [[coulomb]] are the only units used. The SI term [[hertz]] has replaced the term ''cycles per second'' for the same unit of frequency.\n\nEnergy is often measured in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (SI-based), [[calorie]]s (SI-based), [[British thermal unit|BTUs]] (customary) or [[therm]]s (customary) rather than the SI [[joule]]. Residential and commercial electrical energy use is metered and billed in kilowatt hours, [[Kilowatt hour|kW\u00b7h]], as in most metric countries. Force measurements regularly use the [[pound-force|pound]] instead of the SI [[newton (force)|newton]]; [[torque]] is measured in [[pound-foot|pound-feet]]. Fuel prices are mostly given in customary units, such as dollars per gallon, barrel, thousand cubic feet, or ton (short or long). Heating, cooling, and combustion are often measured in BTUs per hour or [[Ton of refrigeration|refrigeration tons]] and powerplant efficiency is often measured by its \"heat rate\", in BTU per kW\u00b7hour. The rated power of [[internal combustion engine|engines]], [[electric motor]]s, and [[Power station|power plant]] [[steam turbine]]s is frequently measured in [[horsepower]]. Power plant output is generally expressed in [[megawatt]]s.\n\n===Financial services===\nSome [[commodity market]] prices are quoted in customary units (such as [[Oil barrel|barrels]] of oil, [[troy ounce]]s of gold, pounds of frozen [[Pork belly|pork bellies]], etc.). The federal government reports international production figures in metric units (for instance, wheat in metric tons) but in [[bushel]]s for domestic production figures.\n\n===Firearms===\nThe U.S. uses both the inch and millimeter for [[caliber]] on civilian and law enforcement firearms.<ref name=\"m14\">{{cite web|title=M14 |work=Nazarian's Gun Recognition Guide |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |url=http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013417/http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}</ref>\nHistorically, ammunition rounds designed in the United States were denoted by their caliber in inches (e.g., [[.45 Colt]] and [[.270 Winchester]].) Two developments changed this tradition: the large preponderance of different cartridges using an identical caliber and the international arms trade bringing metric calibers to the United States. The former led to bullet diameter (rather than caliber) often being used to describe rounds to differentiate otherwise similar rounds. A good example is the [[.308 Winchester]], which fires the same .30-caliber projectile as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] and the [[.300 Savage]]. Occasionally, the caliber is just a number close to the diameter of the bullet, like the [[.220 Swift]], [[.223 Remington]] and [[.222 Remington Magnum]], all of which actually have .22 caliber or {{convert|.224|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} bullets.\n\nThe second development is actual metric calibers being introduced to the United States. 6&nbsp;mm and 7&nbsp;mm caliber rifles are particularly popular as are 9&nbsp;mm and 10&nbsp;mm caliber handguns. These metric caliber rounds are either described by their metric caliber, such as the very popular [[7mm Remington Magnum]] round or have their bullet diameter converted into inches, such as the also extremely popular [[.243 Winchester]]. Occasionally, U.S.-designed inch-caliber rounds are stated in metric as well.\n\nThe U.S. military, reflecting its need to ensure interoperability with its [[NATO]] allies, uses metric measurements for almost all weapons calibers, even for calibers that originated as or were derived from a different measurement (e.g. [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62&nbsp;mm]] rather than [[.308 Winchester|.308]], or [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56&nbsp;mm]] instead of [[.223 Remington|.223]]). However, civilian rifles chambered for .223 Remington may load military 5.56&nbsp;mm ammunition but not fire it safely because 5.56&nbsp;mm NATO ammunition is loaded to create greater chamber pressure than .223 Remington. Controversy exists whether this is true for civilian rifles chambered for .308 Winchester firing 7.62\u00d751&nbsp;mm NATO military ammunition. Major [[handloading]] manuals in the U.S. use U.S. customary units for all pertinent measurements including bullet diameter, cartridge overall length, powder charge weight, velocity, and maximum pressure, even with European-designed fully metric rounds.\n\n===Gemstones===\nGemstones and pearls are sold in [[Carat (mass)|metric carats]].\n\n===Manufacturing===\nGlobalization of manufacturing has led to wide adoption of metric standards, although this is not yet universal{{where|date=June 2015}}. After a period where [[Car|automobiles]] were assembled with both customary and metric [[fastener]]s in each vehicle, cars are now universally built with metric parts. Automobile engines were once named after their displacement in cubic inches. For example, the [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Chrysler \"426 Hemi\"]] engine would be described as 7 liters in modern terminology. Technical publications by industry publishers and American automakers often give engine displacements in cubic inches as well as cubic centimeters (which are equivalent to milliliters), or liters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupe/112_0506_maserati_mc12/specs_price.html |title=Maserati MC12 \u2013 Engine, Chassis, Dimensions, Price, Warranty & Performance \u2013 Road Test Review |publisher=Motor Trend |date=December 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitdiesel.com/pdf/Engines/2006_S60_specs.pdf|title=Demand Detroit \u2013 Demand Detroit|website=www.detroitdiesel.com}}</ref> For example, the specifications for the Dodge SRT-8&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;L Hemi state the displacement as {{convert|370|cuin|cm3}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |title=The Official Chrysler HEMI engine Web site |publisher=HEMI |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807045824/http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |archivedate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nThe U.S. military uses metric measurements extensively to ensure interoperability with allied forces, particularly [[NATO]] [[Standardization Agreement]]s (STANAG).

The [[METAR]] reporting system in use in the United States differs from the one used by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) in that [[wind]] speeds are delivered in knots (instead of meters per second), water-equivalent precipitation in hundredths of an inch, and [[flight level|altimeter setting]] in the customary inches of mercury (instead of hectopascals). Furthermore, [[temperature]]s are reported in whole degrees Fahrenheit but are converted to Celsius when encoded in METAR reports. Most synoptic observation charts are expressed in SI units, except for the aforementioned wind speeds, which must be converted for the purposes of calculation. Upper-air temperature charts typically use the Celsius scale (the freezing line is of great importance at lower levels of the atmosphere in determining precipitation type) while [[potential temperature]] charts use the [[kelvin]]; both of these are in line with international usage.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Atmospheric [[vorticity]] is typically measured in full rotations per 100,000 seconds (a rough [[metric time|metrication of the day]]) but does not use the SI-recommended [[radian]].\n\n[[National Weather Service]] and TV/radio [[broadcasting|broadcast]] public forecasts are given almost exclusively in customary units: [[degrees Fahrenheit]] for temperature and [[dewpoint]], fractions of an inch of rain or ice and whole inches of [[snow]] (less than an inch often indicated by fractions or informal terms like \"dusting\" when very low), inches of mercury; and for wind speeds, miles per hour, except in marine forecasts, in which knots are used. [[wave height|Wave height]]s are measured in feet. Actual [[ice pellets|sleet]] and snowfall and their depths on the ground are measured in tenths of an inch, with actual rainfall in hundredths, and ice accretion in either fractions or decimals. [[Hail]]stone sizes are typically reported without a fixed unit of measure; they are instead compared to familiar round or spherical items (e.g. [[dime (United States coin)|dime]]-sized or [[golf ball]]-sized). [[Barometer]] readings for [[hurricane]]s are usually given in [[millibar]]s (mb), which are equal to hectopascals (hPa), or ten times the kilopascals (kPa) used in neighboring Canada; the use of inches of mercury in such applications is rapidly declining.\n\nIn early 2007, NASA announced that it would use metric units for all operations on the lunar surface upon its return to the Moon, then projected for 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/08jan_metricmoon/ |title=NASA&nbsp;\u2013 Metric Moon |publisher=Science.nasa.gov |date=April 6, 2011 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref> NASA's lunar return program was then canceled in 2010.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/27/nation/la-na-nasa-budget27-2010jan27 White House won't fund NASA moon program], LA Times, January 27, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe medical field uses predominantly metric units.

However, many people colloquially refer to the small spoon in a utensil set as the teaspoon and the big spoon as the tablespoon.

Exercise is commonly discussed with patients in terms of miles walked. Intake of sugar, sodium, and other nutrients is usually discussed in terms of grams and milligrams.\n\nUse among [[veterinarian]]s varies, but because of the heavy emphasis on public interaction, animal weights (e.g., for [[Domestic cat|cats]] or [[dog]]s) are nearly always recorded and reported in pounds and ounces.

The final holdout was the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS) administering high school sports, which switched to metric in 1980.\n\nThat said, U.S. track-and-field competitions are commonly run in increments of 400 meters, which roughly correspond to traditional mile-based lengths. In the Olympics, athletes run 1500 meters, not 1600 meters.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nRunning races in the U.S. are usually run in metric distances (e.g., the [[100 metres]] dash or the [[5K run]]), although the mile distance remains popular. But even 5 and 10 kilometer races most often have mile markers on the course, and no kilometer markers. Long-distance races are often measured in kilometers, although exceptions exist (generally 10&nbsp;mile races). The [[marathon]] is referred to as a 26.219-mile race (the official marathon standard distance originally being in English units&nbsp;\u2014 26 miles, 385 yards) rather than 42.195&nbsp;km. [[Ultramarathon]]s are measured in either miles or kilometers, with little standardization either way.\n\nAlthough the Olympics and U.S. track events have been metric for years, it is still common for sports commentators to provide conversions to help the American audience understand the measurements.\n\nMeasured distances as used in events such as [[shot put]], [[high jump]], and [[discus throw]] are, however, often in feet and inches, except at the national and international levels. In 2017, the Florida High School Athletic Association became the first to buck this trend and use metric measures for field events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/high-school/fla-hs-track-and-field-goes-metric.html|title=Florida High School Track and Field Goes Metric \u2013 Athletic Business|last=Cameron|first=Courtney|website=www.athleticbusiness.com|access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref> The field and court sizes for most popular team sports such as [[Association football|soccer]] were originally set in non-metric units. This is reflected in [[American football]], in which the playing field is divided into yards, and many important statistics are measured in yards. Similarly, the dimensions for all [[baseball]] parks, [[basketball]] courts, [[tennis]] courts and [[ice hockey]] rinks are given in feet, [[golf]] courses in yards, [[auto racing]] tracks in miles (or fractions thereof), and [[horse racing]] in [[furlong]]s. The lengths of automobile races in the U.S. are generally set in miles.

Many authors have assumed that the United States and the human race in general will use metric units; however, others have assumed the continued use of U.S. customary units or have neglected to take metrication into account. Writers sometimes use customary units simply because American readers and watchers will understand the measurements; other times, they are simply used by accident.

The ANMC became a separately incorporated organization in 1976. The ANMC was intended to facilitate U.S. metrication by maintaining a voluntary and orderly process that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits, and to provide information, forums, individual assistance, and other services for its subscribers. The ANMC attempted to coordinate the metric planning of many industrial sectors, unlike the USMB, which only attempted to implement the policy set forth in the [[Metric Conversion Act]] of 1975. After the formation of the USMB, committees of the ANMC submitted conversion plans for the chemical sector and for the instruments sector. These sector conversion plans were later approved by the USMB. From 1975 through 1987, the ANMC held a series of well-attended annual conferences. Subsequently, a series of National Metric Conferences, jointly sponsored by the ANMC, the [[U.S. Metric Association]] (USMA), the Department of Commerce, and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), were held from 1989 through 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.us-metric.org/american-national-metric-council|publisher=U.S. Metric Association, Inc|accessdate = September 3, 2015| title = American National Metric Council }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SpeedLimit-CoralRidge-MiKm-May1992 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1980s-vintage dual miles per hour and kilometers per hour sign, (formerly) located in Florida.

While not mandating metric use in the private sector, the federal government has sought to serve as a catalyst in the metric conversion of the country's trade, industry, and commerce.

Note the [[Estimated sign|\u212e]] estimated net quantity symbol indicates the product also conforms to European Union regulations.]]\nSome U.S. consumer products come in rounded metric sizes. This appears to be increasing because of the international nature of manufacturing, distribution, and sales. Many items are produced in rounded metric quantities and some manufacturers opt to display the metric quantity first or more prominently (e.g., [[Crest Glide]] [[dental floss]] is available in 35-, 40-, and 50-meter packages).\n\nPerhaps the most common metric item sold is the [[two-liter bottle]]. Some [[supermarket]] chains also make their [[store brand]] soft drinks available in 3-liter sizes. Soft drink containers of 1 and 0.5 liters (and more recently 1.25 liter bottles) are sometimes sold alongside 12 [[fluid ounce|fl&nbsp;oz]], 16 fl&nbsp;oz, 20 fl&nbsp;oz, and 24 fl&nbsp;oz (355, 473, 591 and 710&nbsp;mL) sizes.\n\nThe half-liter water bottle (16.9 fl oz) has nearly replaced the 16 ounce size. 700&nbsp;mL (23.6 fl oz) and one-liter sizes are also common, though 20 fl&nbsp;oz, and 24 fl&nbsp;oz sizes remain popular, particularly in vending machines.\n\nAttempts to sell 3- or 4-liter jugs of [[milk]], instead of [[gallon]]s (3.785 L), have been largely unsuccessful, and such bottles are rarely seen in the United States. Milk remains sold in binary divisions of the gallon, with half-pints, [[pint]]s, [[quart]]s and half-gallons being the primary sizes.\n\n[[Shampoo]], [[mouthwash]], and [[dental floss]] have begun to be sold in metric sizes. [[PowerBar]]s and similar products have always been sold (but not marketed) by the gram.\n\n[[Nutrition facts label|Nutritional food labels]] typically report serving sizes in both systems but only list metric values (g or mg) for the breakdown of individual nutrients.\n\n==== Alcohol ====\nWine is sold in standard bottles of 750&nbsp;mL, as in the rest of the world. A fifth of liquor, once one-fifth of a U.S. gallon, or 757&nbsp;mL, is now commonly 750&nbsp;mL, though it is still referred to as \"a fifth\". Beer is sold in fluid ounce denominations. Regulations are set by the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] which controls the permissible sizes of containers.

[[Compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s are 120&nbsp;mm in diameter, but their size is rarely mentioned; [[mini CD]]s are sometimes called 80mm CDs.\n\nComputer fan sizes are exclusively referred to by metric units (120&nbsp;mm or 80&nbsp;mm case fans, for example), while [[hard disk drive]] and CD drive bay widths are customary measurements, typically 3{{1/2}} inches and 5{{1/4}} inches, respectively.\n\nConsumer-size [[photographic film]] was commonly sold in a [[35mm format|35 mm standard]] (24\u00d736&nbsp;mm negative), although print sizes and [[Large format (photography)|large format]] films are defined in inches. [[Optical format|Digital camera sensor sizes]] are measured in an archaic manner indicating inverse fractions of an inch representing the diameter of an equivalent [[vidicon]] tube. For example, a {{frac|1|1.6&nbsp;in}} sensor is larger than a {{frac|1|2.5&nbsp;in}} sensor. However, lenses are marked in terms of focal length in millimeters (e.g., average natural human field of view is a lens with 50&nbsp;mm focal length for 35&nbsp;mm film).\n\n==== Clothing ====\nClothing is measured in inches, not [[centimeters]]. American [[Shoe size|shoes sizes]] are measured on different scales for children, men, and women but all sizes are derived from inches.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Your-Shoe-Size|title=How to Find Your Shoe Size|work=wikiHow|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Major multi-national apparel brands including [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]], [[Hanesbrands|Hanes]], and [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] often sell the same inventory worldwide, with tags containing both SI and customary units in addition to [[Laundry symbol|laundry care symbols]] and instructions in many languages.\n\n==== Bedding ====\n[[Bed size|Mattress sizes]] use non-numeric labels, such as king, queen, full, or twin. These sizes are defined in inches, unlike most other countries, which use similar labels defined using metric units. The FPLA mandates bed sheets state the type of bed they are intended for in addition to dimensions in centimeters and inches. The FPLA also mandates dual scales on many other woven goods such as towels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/05/09/section-IVa-12-h130-final.pdf|title=Handbook 130 \u2013 2012 Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation|last=|first=|date=May 9, 2017|website=US National Institute of Standards and Technology|page=81|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nOf all industries, construction has adopted metric units the least. [[Dimensional lumber]] comes in standard nominal inch cross-section sizes and lengths are given in feet. Although [[model building code]]s\u2014such as the [[International Building Code]]\u2014provide information in both customary and metric units, locally developed building code amendments and [[zoning]] codes often provide customary units exclusively. Because of [[Canada]]'s proximity to the U.S., issues of common units still arise. This tendency in construction is similar to [[Japan]], an otherwise metricated country where traditional construction still uses [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese units]] predating metrication. However, blueprints commonly signify measurements using decimals (e.g., 9.2&nbsp;ft.); since feet are not divided into tenths on United States measuring tapes, builders commonly are forced to make conversions on-site that are often imprecise. In the previous example, 9.2&nbsp;ft equals 9&nbsp;ft 2.4 inches; slightly more than the 9&nbsp;ft {{frac|2|3|8}} mark on United States tape measures, though this degree of error is usually insignificant for these applications.\n\n===Aviation===\nAircraft altitudes for air traffic control and related purposes are measured in feet in the U.S. In fact, most of the world has used feet for aviation altitudes since the end of World War II (meters before 1945 in all European countries except the UK), with the notable exceptions of China, North Korea, and many [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] (former Soviet) countries. For instance, an airliner on a long flight, even if neither its starting point nor destination are in the United States, might use a nominal cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, using an internationally standardized system of [[flight level]]s (Flight Level 360 in this case). In 2011, Russia switched from metric to foot-denominated flight levels at high altitude to eliminate the need for adjustments when crossing in to or out of its airspace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=119021# |title=\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0424 \u043e\u0442 05.09.2011 N 743 \"\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438\" \u2013 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441 |publisher=Base.consultant.ru |date= |accessdate=December 22, 2017 |trans-title=Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 743 of September 5, 2011 \"On Amendments to the Federal Rules for the Use of the Airspace of the Russian Federation\" \u2013 ConsultantPlus}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial aviation===\nFrequent-flyer programs from commercial airlines in the United States are commonly managed using miles. This is likely to continue; in fact, some international airlines that used kilometers are switching to miles or using both, to simplify the redemption of miles with United States airline partners (Aeromexico switched from kilometers to miles, and Varig from Brazil has used miles since the program was named \"Smiles\"). Aircraft speed is often measured in [[knot (unit)|knot]]s and elevation in feet ([[flight level]]) in many countries.\n\nFor both domestic and international routes, U.S. airlines set luggage size and weight restrictions in terms of customary units. Conversely, international airlines that fly to the U.S. often restrict baggage to metric sizes.\n\nThe temperatures in aviation-related weather reports are given in degrees Celsius in the United States.\n\nFor carry-on luggage, the [[Transportation Security Administration]] restricts liquids to 3.4 fluid ounces (100 mL).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule|title=Liquids Rule|date=December 16, 2014|work=Transportation Security Administration|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Originally, the agency planned to restrict to 3 ounces but switched it to 3.4 oz / 100 mL after pressure from the European Union.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2009/02/25/3-oz-or-34-oz-what-gives|title=3 oz or 3.4 oz?

Units of length, volume, and mass are typically introduced through comparison with ordinary objects. The metric system is not reinforced much outside the classroom due to lack of popular metric use. Consequently, while students may understand some of the concepts underlying the metric system, they do not necessarily have an intuitive sense of the value of the units.\n\nIn science education, students predominantly use metric measures in experiments and equations, allowing those interested in the sciences to become more familiar with the metric system. A few science [[Course credit|course credit]]s are requisites for an undergraduate degree in the U.S. which ensures most educated people have some exposure to the metric system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Within [[higher education]], the metric system is universal for classes in the sciences (see [[Metrication in the United States#Science and medicine|below]]), except for exercises designed to illustrate complex conversions. Engineering programs still widely use English Engineering Units, but this varies depending on the field. Electrical Engineering programs mostly use metric, while fields such as aerospace, materials, thermal, and manufacturing engineering use customary units extensively. Some non-science textbooks in the U.S. use only the metric system without giving conversions in order to promote metrication.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Electricity and energy===\nThere are no U.S. customary units for electric current, potential difference, or charge since these concepts were developed after the international adoption of metric in science. The metric units [[ampere]], [[volt]], [[ohm]] and [[coulomb]] are the only units used. The SI term [[hertz]] has replaced the term ''cycles per second'' for the same unit of frequency.\n\nEnergy is often measured in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (SI-based), [[calorie]]s (SI-based), [[British thermal unit|BTUs]] (customary) or [[therm]]s (customary) rather than the SI [[joule]]. Residential and commercial electrical energy use is metered and billed in kilowatt hours, [[Kilowatt hour|kW\u00b7h]], as in most metric countries. Force measurements regularly use the [[pound-force|pound]] instead of the SI [[newton (force)|newton]]; [[torque]] is measured in [[pound-foot|pound-feet]]. Fuel prices are mostly given in customary units, such as dollars per gallon, barrel, thousand cubic feet, or ton (short or long). Heating, cooling, and combustion are often measured in BTUs per hour or [[Ton of refrigeration|refrigeration tons]] and powerplant efficiency is often measured by its \"heat rate\", in BTU per kW\u00b7hour. The rated power of [[internal combustion engine|engines]], [[electric motor]]s, and [[Power station|power plant]] [[steam turbine]]s is frequently measured in [[horsepower]]. Power plant output is generally expressed in [[megawatt]]s.\n\n===Financial services===\nSome [[commodity market]] prices are quoted in customary units (such as [[Oil barrel|barrels]] of oil, [[troy ounce]]s of gold, pounds of frozen [[Pork belly|pork bellies]], etc.). The federal government reports international production figures in metric units (for instance, wheat in metric tons) but in [[bushel]]s for domestic production figures.\n\n===Firearms===\nThe U.S. uses both the inch and millimeter for [[caliber]] on civilian and law enforcement firearms.<ref name=\"m14\">{{cite web|title=M14 |work=Nazarian's Gun Recognition Guide |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |url=http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013417/http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}</ref>\nHistorically, ammunition rounds designed in the United States were denoted by their caliber in inches (e.g., [[.45 Colt]] and [[.270 Winchester]].) Two developments changed this tradition: the large preponderance of different cartridges using an identical caliber and the international arms trade bringing metric calibers to the United States. The former led to bullet diameter (rather than caliber) often being used to describe rounds to differentiate otherwise similar rounds. A good example is the [[.308 Winchester]], which fires the same .30-caliber projectile as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] and the [[.300 Savage]]. Occasionally, the caliber is just a number close to the diameter of the bullet, like the [[.220 Swift]], [[.223 Remington]] and [[.222 Remington Magnum]], all of which actually have .22 caliber or {{convert|.224|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} bullets.\n\nThe second development is actual metric calibers being introduced to the United States. 6&nbsp;mm and 7&nbsp;mm caliber rifles are particularly popular as are 9&nbsp;mm and 10&nbsp;mm caliber handguns. These metric caliber rounds are either described by their metric caliber, such as the very popular [[7mm Remington Magnum]] round or have their bullet diameter converted into inches, such as the also extremely popular [[.243 Winchester]]. Occasionally, U.S.-designed inch-caliber rounds are stated in metric as well.\n\nThe U.S. military, reflecting its need to ensure interoperability with its [[NATO]] allies, uses metric measurements for almost all weapons calibers, even for calibers that originated as or were derived from a different measurement (e.g. [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62&nbsp;mm]] rather than [[.308 Winchester|.308]], or [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56&nbsp;mm]] instead of [[.223 Remington|.223]]). However, civilian rifles chambered for .223 Remington may load military 5.56&nbsp;mm ammunition but not fire it safely because 5.56&nbsp;mm NATO ammunition is loaded to create greater chamber pressure than .223 Remington. Controversy exists whether this is true for civilian rifles chambered for .308 Winchester firing 7.62\u00d751&nbsp;mm NATO military ammunition. Major [[handloading]] manuals in the U.S. use U.S. customary units for all pertinent measurements including bullet diameter, cartridge overall length, powder charge weight, velocity, and maximum pressure, even with European-designed fully metric rounds.\n\n===Gemstones===\nGemstones and pearls are sold in [[Carat (mass)|metric carats]].\n\n===Manufacturing===\nGlobalization of manufacturing has led to wide adoption of metric standards, although this is not yet universal{{where|date=June 2015}}. After a period where [[Car|automobiles]] were assembled with both customary and metric [[fastener]]s in each vehicle, cars are now universally built with metric parts. Automobile engines were once named after their displacement in cubic inches. For example, the [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Chrysler \"426 Hemi\"]] engine would be described as 7 liters in modern terminology. Technical publications by industry publishers and American automakers often give engine displacements in cubic inches as well as cubic centimeters (which are equivalent to milliliters), or liters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupe/112_0506_maserati_mc12/specs_price.html |title=Maserati MC12 \u2013 Engine, Chassis, Dimensions, Price, Warranty & Performance \u2013 Road Test Review |publisher=Motor Trend |date=December 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitdiesel.com/pdf/Engines/2006_S60_specs.pdf|title=Demand Detroit \u2013 Demand Detroit|website=www.detroitdiesel.com}}</ref> For example, the specifications for the Dodge SRT-8&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;L Hemi state the displacement as {{convert|370|cuin|cm3}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |title=The Official Chrysler HEMI engine Web site |publisher=HEMI |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807045824/http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |archivedate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nThe U.S. military uses metric measurements extensively to ensure interoperability with allied forces, particularly [[NATO]] [[Standardization Agreement]]s (STANAG).

The [[METAR]] reporting system in use in the United States differs from the one used by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) in that [[wind]] speeds are delivered in knots (instead of meters per second), water-equivalent precipitation in hundredths of an inch, and [[flight level|altimeter setting]] in the customary inches of mercury (instead of hectopascals). Furthermore, [[temperature]]s are reported in whole degrees Fahrenheit but are converted to Celsius when encoded in METAR reports. Most synoptic observation charts are expressed in SI units, except for the aforementioned wind speeds, which must be converted for the purposes of calculation. Upper-air temperature charts typically use the Celsius scale (the freezing line is of great importance at lower levels of the atmosphere in determining precipitation type) while [[potential temperature]] charts use the [[kelvin]]; both of these are in line with international usage.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Atmospheric [[vorticity]] is typically measured in full rotations per 100,000 seconds (a rough [[metric time|metrication of the day]]) but does not use the SI-recommended [[radian]].\n\n[[National Weather Service]] and TV/radio [[broadcasting|broadcast]] public forecasts are given almost exclusively in customary units: [[degrees Fahrenheit]] for temperature and [[dewpoint]], fractions of an inch of rain or ice and whole inches of [[snow]] (less than an inch often indicated by fractions or informal terms like \"dusting\" when very low), inches of mercury; and for wind speeds, miles per hour, except in marine forecasts, in which knots are used. [[wave height|Wave height]]s are measured in feet. Actual [[ice pellets|sleet]] and snowfall and their depths on the ground are measured in tenths of an inch, with actual rainfall in hundredths, and ice accretion in either fractions or decimals. [[Hail]]stone sizes are typically reported without a fixed unit of measure; they are instead compared to familiar round or spherical items (e.g. [[dime (United States coin)|dime]]-sized or [[golf ball]]-sized). [[Barometer]] readings for [[hurricane]]s are usually given in [[millibar]]s (mb), which are equal to hectopascals (hPa), or ten times the kilopascals (kPa) used in neighboring Canada; the use of inches of mercury in such applications is rapidly declining.\n\nIn early 2007, NASA announced that it would use metric units for all operations on the lunar surface upon its return to the Moon, then projected for 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/08jan_metricmoon/ |title=NASA&nbsp;\u2013 Metric Moon |publisher=Science.nasa.gov |date=April 6, 2011 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref> NASA's lunar return program was then canceled in 2010.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/27/nation/la-na-nasa-budget27-2010jan27 White House won't fund NASA moon program], LA Times, January 27, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe medical field uses predominantly metric units.

In the Olympics, athletes run 1500 meters, not 1600 meters.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nRunning races in the U.S. are usually run in metric distances (e.g., the [[100 metres]] dash or the [[5K run]]), although the mile distance remains popular. But even 5 and 10 kilometer races most often have mile markers on the course, and no kilometer markers. Long-distance races are often measured in kilometers, although exceptions exist (generally 10&nbsp;mile races). The [[marathon]] is referred to as a 26.219-mile race (the official marathon standard distance originally being in English units&nbsp;\u2014 26 miles, 385 yards) rather than 42.195&nbsp;km. [[Ultramarathon]]s are measured in either miles or kilometers, with little standardization either way.\n\nAlthough the Olympics and U.S. track events have been metric for years, it is still common for sports commentators to provide conversions to help the American audience understand the measurements.\n\nMeasured distances as used in events such as [[shot put]], [[high jump]], and [[discus throw]] are, however, often in feet and inches, except at the national and international levels. In 2017, the Florida High School Athletic Association became the first to buck this trend and use metric measures for field events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/high-school/fla-hs-track-and-field-goes-metric.html|title=Florida High School Track and Field Goes Metric \u2013 Athletic Business|last=Cameron|first=Courtney|website=www.athleticbusiness.com|access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref> The field and court sizes for most popular team sports such as [[Association football|soccer]] were originally set in non-metric units.

The U.S. territory of [[Puerto Rico]] generally uses American-style ([[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]]) signs with metric measurement on highways, displaying kilometer posts and distances in km, yet speed limit signs are in miles per hour. The [[Maine Turnpike]] has metric measurements on its highway signs in addition to customary measurements, partly to assist the large numbers of [[Canada|Canadian]] tourists who visit Maine's beaches.\n\nThe first signs in metric in the United States were posted on February 12, 1973, on [[Interstate 71]] in [[Ohio]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Rebecca|last=Goodman|title=Ohio Moments|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/02/12/loc_ohiodate0212.html|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=February 12, 2003|access-date=March 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nGasoline and diesel fuel are sold by the U.S. gallon, and [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] is rated in miles per gallon (MPG). In most other countries, using the [[metric system]], fuel consumption is measured in [[liter]]s per 100{{nbsp}}[[kilometers]] or kilometers per liter. The European Union official standard is liters per {{val|100|u=km}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bilsweden.se/miljo-sakerhet/miljo/information-gallande-bransleforbrukning-for-nya-bilar#|accessdate=29 December 2019|title=Information on the fuel consumption of new cars (translate button)|language=Swedish}}</ref> Stations in [[Point Roberts, Washington]], a short, noncontiguous peninsula that is accessible from the rest of the state of Washington only by crossing into Canada, sells its gasoline from pumps calibrated to dispense in liters. Gasoline is dispensed in liters in Puerto Rico. Automobile crankcase oil is sold by the quart, antifreeze by the gallon, brake fluid by the ounce (fluid), and air conditioning refrigerant by the ounce (mass). Windshield wiper replacement blades are measured in inches.\n\nDomestic airline flights are assigned altitudes in feet and measure speed in [[knot (unit)|knots]]. [[Nautical chart]]s show depth in [[fathom]]s and use the [[nautical mile]] for distance. (One minute of arc of latitude at the radius of the earth at sea level was the standard for one nautical mile until about 1929. The nautical mile is now defined as exactly 1,852 meters.) Railroads use the [[standard gauge]] of 4 feet {{frac|8|1|2}} inches, as does most of Europe (where it is expressed instead as 1,435&nbsp;mm). \n[[File:Dodge Dart Speedometer.jpg|thumb|MPH and smaller km/h values on speedometer]]\nU.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101, which governs vehicle controls and displays, permits speedometers to display miles per hour (MPH) or both MPH and km/h.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/05/15/00-11493/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-fmvss-101-technical-correction-speedometer-display|title=Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; FMVSS 101-Technical Correction-Speedometer Display|date=May 15, 2000|work=Federal Register|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref> In practice, most U.S.-market vehicles have mile odometers and dual-labeled speedometers with miles-per-hour as the primary calibration. Some 2000s era [[Buick]]s have a single speed gauge with a button on the instrument panel to switch the scale between MPH and km/h. Other vehicles have digital speedometers which can be set to read out speeds in either MPH or km/h.\n\nAnother common unit of speed is meters per second (m/s), used especially for lifts and cable cars. Odometers are permitted to record miles or kilometers, but must be clearly labeled as to which unit they record.\n[[File:Tire and Loading Information.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Vehicle capacity sticker]]\nTire inflation for passenger cars is typically about 30 pounds per square inch [[Pounds per square inch|(psi)]] or 207 kilopascals ([[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]).

On recently introduced [[Christmas lights]], however, millimeters are often used with small [[Sphere|globe]]-shaped bulbs (G30 and G40), and with miniature [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] sets, where the standard T1\u00be ({{frac|7|32}}-inch tube) ones are sometimes called M5 (5&nbsp;mm miniature; not to be confused with [[ISO metric screw thread|M5 thread]]).\n\nFor properties understood more recently, such as those related to electricity, there is no traditional unit; international units are always used, often in combination with U.S. customary units. One among many examples is in Table 8, chapter 9, of the ''National Electrical Code Handbook (8th ed.)'', where resistance of conductors per unit length is given in ohms per thousand feet.\n\nOther units are based on customary units, but use [[Power of 10|power-of-ten]] factors and [[metric prefix]]es. For example, distance to target for a U.S. submarine is expressed in kiloyards (kyd) rather than some combination of miles, yards, and feet. Telephone transmission line length and loop distances are measured in kilofeet.<ref>AT&T, ''Telecommunication Transmission Engineering'', Volume 2 \u2013 ''Facilities'', Bell Center for Technical Education (1977)</ref> In some fields of [[civil engineering]] (especially [[structural engineering]]), and [[architecture]], large loads and forces (such as the weight of a building or the amount of load applied to a column) are measured in [[kip (unit)|kips]] (kilopounds or 1000 [[pounds-force]]) instead of [[Short ton-force|short tons-force]] (2000 pounds-force), which are used in virtually all other non-metric industries in the United States, as well as in common usage among the public, when dealing with large values of force.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nThe continuing use of U.S. customary units has caused writers to speculate in fiction set in the future about the adoption of the metric system. Many authors have assumed that the United States and the human race in general will use metric units; however, others have assumed the continued use of U.S. customary units or have neglected to take metrication into account. Writers sometimes use customary units simply because American readers and watchers will understand the measurements; other times, they are simply used by accident. The 1966 show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', for instance, initially used U.S. customary units despite multiple Earth national origins and a setting in the 23rd century. Later, starting with \"[[The Changeling (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Changeling]]\", metric measures were used, albeit inconsistently. Later sequels of the show, such as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (set in the 22nd century), used the metric system exclusively.\n\nBoth the metric system and attitudes in the U.S. toward the metric system are a target of humorous jabs in shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'',<ref>In ''The Simpsons'', jokes about the situation are made in episodes \"[[A Star Is Burns]],\" \"[[Homer the Great]],\" \"[[The Seven-Beer Snitch]],\" and others. For instance, Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson once remarked: \"The metric system is the tool of the devil! My car gets forty [[Rod (unit)|rod]]s to the [[hogshead]] and that's the way I likes it.\"</ref> ''[[Futurama]]''<ref>An example is in \"[[The Series Has Landed]],\" when a farmer on the Moon states that at night, the temperature drops down to \u2212173. Fry asks, \"Is that Fahrenheit or Celsius?\" to which the farmer replies, \"First one, then the other.\" Another is in \"[[I, Roommate]],\" when Calculon attempts to put a ring on Monique's finger; when it fits, she replies, \"It fits! But then, you must know that I'm&nbsp;...\" \"Metric? I've always known, but for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.\"</ref> and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.<ref>Season 4 Episode 07 \"[[Apology Insufficiency]]\"; Sheldon: \"Ethyl alcohol. 40 milliliters.\" Penny: \"I'm sorry, honey, I don't know milliliters.\" Sheldon: \"Ah. I blame President James \"Jimmy\" Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.\"</ref> A ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch titled \"Decabet\", released at the height of the metrication movement, lampooned the different metric measurements by introducing a new alphabet consisting of only ten letters.\n\nIn the 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', Vincent Vega ([[John Travolta]]) tells Jules Winnfield ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) that \"Europe is a little different\", because for example in [[Paris]], they don't call it a \"[[Quarter Pounder]] with Cheese\" but a \"Royale with Cheese\" as \"they've got the metric system, they don't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is\". Later, Jules compliments the intelligence of one of their victims, after he correctly surmises that [[France|French]] use of the metric system is what precludes the term \"Quarter Pounder.\"\n\nIn the \"The Martian\" (Ridley Scott film) the dialogue for the aproach between \"Hermes\" and Ares ship to rescue astronaut Mark Watney is wholely in metric units. \n\n''[[Popular Science]]''<nowiki/>'s September 2003 edition listed NIST's \"Metric System Advocate\" on its list of the \"Worst Jobs in Science\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Speed |first=William |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2003-09/worst-jobs-science-2003 |title=The Worst Jobs in Science 2003 &#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date= |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[U.S. Metric Association]]\n* [[Frank Mankiewicz#Anti-metrication|Frank Mankiewicz]]\n* [[History of the metric system]]\n* [[Lyn Nofziger#Anti-metrication|Lyn Nofziger]]\n* [[Metrication in Australia]]\n* [[Metrication in Canada]]\n* [[Metrication in New Zealand]]\n* [[Metrication in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Metrication opposition]]\n* [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the USA]], 1790 report including proposal for decimal system based on the foot\n* [[The Metric Marvels]]\n* [[United States customary units]]\n* [[Public Land Survey System|United States Public Land Survey System]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111209113714/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/lc1136a.cfm The United States and the Metric System (LC 1136) nist.gov] Archive.org\n* [http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/usmetric.html The Metric System in the United States]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111113000612/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/4858.cfm A Metric America: A Decision Whose Time Has Come on nist.gov] Archive.org\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111105080437/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/pub814.cfm#act Metric Conversion Act of 1975 on nist.gov] Archive.org\n* [http://www.us-metric.org www.us-metric.org]&nbsp;\u2014 U.S. Metric Association ([http://www.metric.org/ mirror link])\n* [http://internetoracle.org/bestof.cgi?N=351-375#365-10 Mean Mr Metric] satire about the (non)conversion to metric units.

Near the end of 1983, these songs were compiled on ''[[Introducing The Style Council]]'', a [[long playing|mini-album]] initially released in Japan, the Netherlands, Canada, and the US only. The Dutch version was heavily imported to the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1984 the band undertook a brief tour of the United States, during which they played two gigs at the [[Hudson Theatre|Savoy]] in New York at the beginning of May.<ref name=Palmer-May1984>{{cite news |last=Palmer |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Palmer (writer) |date=16 May 1984 |title=The Pop Life \u2013 Style Council's Rhythm-and-Blues |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/16/arts/the-pop-life-193854.html\n|newspaper=New York Times |page=C22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524154236/https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/16/arts/the-pop-life-193854.html |archive-date=24 May 2015 |access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |title=The Style Council Setlist at The Savoy, New York \u2013 11 May 1984 |url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-style-council/1984/the-savoy-new-york-ny-6bdf72a2.html |website=setlist.fm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401211023/https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-style-council/1984/the-savoy-new-york-ny-6bdf72a2.html |archive-date=1 April 2020 |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> This lead to modest chart success with the single \"[[My Ever Changing Moods]]\",{{efn|The [[B-side]] comprised \"Mick's Company\", an instrumental from ''Caf\u00e9 Bleu'' featuring Mick Talbot playing a [[Hammond organ]].<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |title=The Style Council \u2013 My Ever Changing Moods (US Version) |url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Style-Council-My-Ever-Changing-Moods/release/8890198 |website=Discogs |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref>}} which reached No.&nbsp;29 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] the following month.

This was unknown to Polydor, and the single was pulled from the shops three days prior to release. Acid Jazz founder Eddie Piller said \"The pair offered to make a single for my new label, which I'd just started with Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson as a side project.

After the split, Weller embarked on a successful solo career (which featured [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]] on drums, who had left The Style Council by the time ''[[Confessions of a Pop Group]]'' was released, having only played on a few{{vague|date=August 2015}} of its tracks). Talbot and White released two albums as Talbot/White\u2014''United States of Mind'' (1995) and ''Off The Beaten Track'' (1996). Talbot and White then formed [[The Players (supergroup)|The Players]] with Damon Minchella and [[Aziz Ibrahim]]. White and Minchella went on to form Trio Valore whilst Talbot went touring with [[Candi Staton]] in 2009.\n\nAll of The Style Council's UK releases (including singles, 12\" [[maxi single|maxis]], albums, compact discs and re-issues thereof) featured the work of graphic designer [[Simon Halfon]], who often collaborated with Weller to hone his ideas into a graphic form. Weller and Halfon began working together at the end of The Jam's career, and continue to work together on Weller's solo material.\n\n== Politics ==\n\nIn December 1984, Weller put together an ensemble called The Council Collective to make a charity record, \"Soul Deep\", initially to raise money for striking miners during a [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|long-running industrial dispute]], and subsequently also for the family of [[Killing of David Wilkie|David Wilkie]].

In 1985, Weller was persuaded by [[Billy Bragg]] to let the Style Council play a leading role in [[Red Wedge]], a youth-oriented political campaign associated with the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Although his views at the time have since been described as those of a \"traditional British socialist\", in 2014 Weller admitted the experience had left him feeling \"exploited\" by politicians, noting further that: \"Before the Wedge, the Style Council had done a lot independently, raised a lot of money in benefits.

Near the end of 1983, these songs were compiled on ''[[Introducing The Style Council]]'', a [[long playing|mini-album]] initially released in Japan, the Netherlands, Canada, and the US only.

In the UK, the group reached the height of its popularity with the release of ''[[Our Favourite Shop]]'', which entered the UK album chart at number 1 immediately following its release in June 1985 (only to be surplanted by [[Brian Ferry]]'s ''[[Boys and Girls (album)|Boys and Girls]]'' a week later). It notched up a total of 13 weeks in the top 40 (including a re-entry in October), of which 3 weeks were spent in the top 10.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated-->|title=Our Favourite Shop |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/our-favourite-shop/ |website=UK Official Charts |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110065424/https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/our-favourite-shop/ |archive-date=10 November 2019 |access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref> In 2015 it was included in a list of 50 albums released in 1985 which, according to the ''[[NME]]'', \"still sound great today\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Barker |first=Emily |date=13 February 2015 |title=50 Albums Released In 1985 That Still Sound Great Today |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/50-albums-released-in-1985-that-still-sound-great-today-1432721 |website=NME |url-status= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027180335/https://www.nme.com/photos/50-albums-released-in-1985-that-still-sound-great-today-1432721 |archive-date=27 October 2016 |access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref> Together with \"You're The Best Thing\" (from ''[[Caf\u00e9 Bleu]]'') and \"The Big Boss Groove\", two songs from the album \u2013 \"Internationalists\" and \"Walls Come Tumbling Down\" \u2013 were played by the band at the UK [[Live Aid]] concert,<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |title=The Style Council Setlist at Wembley Stadium, London \u2013 13 July 1985 |url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-style-council/1985/wembley-stadium-london-england-23d59c0f.html |website=setlist.fm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403004357/https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-style-council/1985/wembley-stadium-london-england-23d59c0f.html |archive-date=3 April 2020 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> where they appeared second in the running order at  [[Wembley Stadium]] between [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] and [[The Boomtown Rats]].<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |title=LIVE AID 1985: How it all happened |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/thelive8event/liveaid/history.shtml |website=BBC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601034117/https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/thelive8event/liveaid/history.shtml |archive-date=1 June 2015 |access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref> The international exposure, however, did little to boost the group's career, and future commercial success was largely confined to their home country.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=9 February 2011 |title=Five other Live Aid stories |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8314464/Five-other-Live-Aid-stories.html |website=The Telegraph |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213061706/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8314464/Five-other-Live-Aid-stories.html |archive-date=13 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, members of The Style Council went under the name of 'King Truman' to release a single on [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz]] titled \"Like a Gun\". This was unknown to Polydor, and the single was pulled from the shops three days prior to release. Acid Jazz founder Eddie Piller said \"The pair offered to make a single for my new label, which I'd just started with Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson as a side project.

About the breakup, Paul Weller said (in 1990):\n{{quote|It's something we should have done two or three years ago. We created some great music in our time, the effects of which won't be appreciated for some time.<ref name=Tobler-1992>{{cite book |last=Tobler |first=John |date=1992\n|title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years |publisher=Hamlyn |location=London |page=468 |isbn=0600576027}}</ref>}}\n\nThe [[cover version]] of \"Promised Land\" (originally by [[Joe Smooth]]) was the only release which surfaced from the ''Modernism'' sessions at the time; however, the entire album was released in 1998, both independently and in a 5-CD [[box set]], ''The Complete Adventures of The Style Council''. After the split, Weller embarked on a successful solo career (which featured [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]] on drums, who had left The Style Council by the time ''[[Confessions of a Pop Group]]'' was released, having only played on a few{{vague|date=August 2015}} of its tracks). Talbot and White released two albums as Talbot/White\u2014''United States of Mind'' (1995) and ''Off The Beaten Track'' (1996). Talbot and White then formed [[The Players (supergroup)|The Players]] with Damon Minchella and [[Aziz Ibrahim]]. White and Minchella went on to form Trio Valore whilst Talbot went touring with [[Candi Staton]] in 2009.\n\nAll of The Style Council's UK releases (including singles, 12\" [[maxi single|maxis]], albums, compact discs and re-issues thereof) featured the work of graphic designer [[Simon Halfon]], who often collaborated with Weller to hone his ideas into a graphic form. Weller and Halfon began working together at the end of The Jam's career, and continue to work together on Weller's solo material.\n\n== Politics ==\n\nIn December 1984, Weller put together an ensemble called The Council Collective to make a charity record, \"Soul Deep\", initially to raise money for striking miners and subsequently also for the family of [[Killing of David Wilkie|David Wilkie]]. The track featured The Style Council and a number of other performers, notably [[Jimmy Ruffin]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Sweeting |first=Adam |date=20 November 2014 |title=Jimmy Ruffin Obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/20/jimmy-ruffin |website=The Guardian |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121164909/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/20/jimmy-ruffin |archive-date=21 November 2014 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> and [[Junior Giscombe]].

In 1985, Weller was persuaded by [[Billy Bragg]] to let the Style Council play a leading role in [[Red Wedge]], a youth-oriented political campaign associated with the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Although his views at the time have since been described as those of a \"traditional British socialist\", in 2014 Weller admitted the experience had left him feeling \"exploited\" by politicians, noting further that: \"Before the Wedge, the Style Council had done a lot independently, raised a lot of money in benefits. But after the Wedge we were so disillusioned it all stopped. We were totally cynical about all of it.<ref name=Snow-Apr2014>{{cite web |last=Snow |first=Mat |date=16 April 2014 |title=Paul Weller: 'Most people dislike me anyway \u2026 it can only get better' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/16/paul-weller-style-council-more-modern-classics-rocks-backpages |website=The Guardian |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108113538/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/16/paul-weller-style-council-more-modern-classics-rocks-backpages |archive-date=8 January 2015 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> In a previous interview, whilst asserting that there was still \"a place for outspokenness\" in popular music, Weller had pointed out he was \"first and foremost\" a musician, and stated: \"In the '80s, in the Style Council, we were involved with a lot of political things going on at that time.

To do this, the guests team up with him to participate in challenges and [[escape room]] puzzles, competing with each other to escape from the historical era by solving and completing them. At the end of each episode, two guests are voted into a challenge to compete against each other, where the losing guest is eliminated via a fictional death until one or more guests ultimately win and are sent back to the modern world.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nYouTube announced [[YouTube Red|YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red)]], a paid subscription service that would allow

Once there, they are cut off from the outside world, challenged to survive the night and escape the estate. To do this, the guests team up with him to participate in challenges and [[escape room]] puzzles, competing with each other to escape from the historical era by solving and completing them. At the end of each episode, two guests are voted into a challenge to compete against each other, where the losing guest is eliminated via a fictional death until one or more guests ultimately win and are sent back to the modern world.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nYouTube announced [[YouTube Red|YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red)]], a paid subscription service that would allow

{"title_page": "Gustav von Franck", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n'''Gustav Ritter von Franck''' (born 22 March 1807, [[Vienna]] &ndash; died 8 January 1860, London) was an Austrian author and publisher.\n\n==Life and work==\nGustav Ritter von Franck was born on 22 March 1807 in Vienna and was the son of the banker and businessman Johann Jakob Ritter von Franck and his wife Anna Maria, n\u00e9e Graumann. He was the second oldest of seven sons.\n\nThe father\u2019s side of the von Franck family originated from [[Mulhouse]], which was, at that time, part of the [[Swiss Confederation]].  On 8 November 1771, Gustav\u2018s grandfather, Johann Jakob Franck, a patrician and a member of the Grand Council of the city of Mulhouse, married Rosina von Fries, who was thirteen years younger and the daughter of Baron Philipp von Fries, whose brother, Johann von Fries, was regarded as one of the richest men of his time. Johann Jakob Franck moved with his wife to [[Austria]] and bought himself into the tobacco business there. The [[Holy Roman Empress|Empress]]  [[Maria Theresia]] elevated him to Knighthood for his activities in this sphere and, from then on, Johann Jakob and all his heirs were permitted to use the title 'von Franck' and display a [[coat of arms]].\n\nFranck\u2019s father, Johann Jakob von Franck, a wholesale dealer, banker and art lover, inherited his grandfather\u2019s wealth but not his title. The von Franck household was at the centre of artistic and intellectual life in Vienna. Literary figures and musicians frequented the household, among whom [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] was a welcome guest during his stay in Vienna. Beethoven was the most well known pianist in Vienna at that time and he dedicated his sonata A-major, Opus 101 to Baroness Dorothea von Ertmann, an aunt of Gustav on his mother\u2019s side.\n\nIn 1829, Gustav von Franck received a Doctorate in Law in [[Padua]].  But he exercised his profession as an advocate for just several months since he was financially independent after the early death of his father. Thereafter, he was active exclusively as an author and publisher. His literary output consisted mainly of plays, comedies, tragedies and poetry; but he also wrote an autobiographical novel, [[journalism|journalistic]] pieces and revolutionary articles.\n\nIn 1842, whilst he was the Theater Director at the German Theater in Pest (nowadays a part of [[Budapest]]), he met his wife-to-be, the opera singer Sophie Wirnser. They had a daughter, Melanie von Franck, in 1844. Because of his revolutionary activities he had to flee Austria in 1848 and he then tried to establish himself in [[Leipzig]] and to publish a newspaper, the \"Wiener Boten\u201d (the Vienna Herald).\n\nOn the pretext of a legal action against his paper Gustav von Franck was arrested and threatened with extradition to Austria.

He was the second oldest of seven sons.\n\nThe father\u2019s side of the von Franck family originated from [[Mulhouse]], which was, at that time, part of the [[Swiss Confederation]].  On 8 November 1771, Gustav\u2018s grandfather, Johann Jakob Franck, a patrician and a member of the Grand Council of the city of Mulhouse, married Rosina von Fries, who was thirteen years younger and the daughter of Baron Philipp von Fries, whose brother, Johann von Fries, was regarded as one of the richest men of his time. Johann Jakob Franck moved with his wife to [[Austria]] and bought himself into the tobacco business there. The [[Holy Roman Empress|Empress]]  [[Maria Theresia]] elevated him to Knighthood for his activities in this sphere and, from then on, Johann Jakob and all his heirs were permitted to use the title 'von Franck' and display a [[coat of arms]].\n\nFranck\u2019s father, Johann Jakob von Franck, a wholesale dealer, banker and art lover, inherited his grandfather\u2019s wealth but not his title. The von Franck household was at the centre of artistic and intellectual life in Vienna. Literary figures and musicians frequented the household, among whom [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] was a welcome guest during his stay in Vienna. Beethoven was the most well known pianist in Vienna at that time and he dedicated his sonata A-major, Opus 101 to Baroness Dorothea von Ertmann, an aunt of Gustav on his mother\u2019s side.\n\nIn 1829, Gustav von Franck received a Doctorate in Law in [[Padua]].  But he exercised his profession as an advocate for just several months since he was financially independent after the early death of his father. Thereafter, he was active exclusively as an author and publisher. His literary output consisted mainly of plays, comedies, tragedies and poetry; but he also wrote an autobiographical novel, [[journalism|journalistic]] pieces and revolutionary articles.\n\nIn 1842, whilst he was the Theater Director at the German Theater in Pest (nowadays a part of [[Budapest]]), he met his wife-to-be, the opera singer Sophie Wirnser. They had a daughter, Melanie von Franck, in 1844. Because of his revolutionary activities he had to flee Austria in 1848 and he then tried to establish himself in [[Leipzig]] and to publish a newspaper, the \"Wiener Boten\u201d (the Vienna Herald).\n\nOn the pretext of a legal action against his paper Gustav von Franck was arrested and threatened with extradition to Austria. His wife, Sophie, succeeded in getting him freed from the prison in Leipzig.\n\nHe fled via the [[Netherlands]] to England, where he subsequently settled. He survived at first by being an art teacher and portrait painter. A year later his wife and daughter followed him in exile. Then, after initial difficulties, Franck succeeded in gaining a reputation as a playwright. In collaboration with William und Robert Brough** he put on two comedies at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] and at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] and critics at the time acclaimed the popularity of \"A Tale of a Coat\" and \"Kicks and Halfpence\".\n\nFranck was also a founder member of the \"[[Savage Club]]\", in Whitehall Place in London, which still exists today and he belonged to a circle of German speaking immigrants, who lived in exile in England.

From its founding as a [[Diocese|bishopric]] in 1000 until 1821, it was under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]]. From 1821 to 1930 it was subjected directly to the [[Apostolic See]]. Between 1821 and 1972 it was officially known as '''(Arch)Diocese of Breslau'''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early medieval era===\nChristianity was first introduced into [[Silesia]] by missionaries from [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]]. After the conversion of Duke [[Mieszko I]] of Poland and the conquest of Silesia, the work of bringing the people to the new faith went on more rapidly. Up to about the year 1000 Silesia had no bishop of its own, but was united with neighbouring dioceses. In this way, the connection of Silesia with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] continued. The upper part of the [[Oder River]] formed the boundary of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131138)|Kingdom of Poland]]. All the territory which is now Silesia \u2013 lying on the right-hand bank of the Oder \u2013 belonged, therefore, to the [[Diocese of Pozna\u0144]], which was [[suffragan]] to the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]]. This part of Silesia was thus under the jurisdiction of a priest named Jordan who was appointed first Bishop of Pozna\u0144 in 968. The part of Silesia lying on the left bank of the Oder belonged to the territory included in then [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and was consequently within the diocesan jurisdiction of [[Prague]]. The [[Bishopric of Prague]], founded in 973, was suffragan to the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].\n\nDuke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], the son of Mieszko, obtained the Bohemian part of Silesia during his wars of conquest, and a change in the ecclesiastical dependence of the province followed. By a patent of Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] in 995, Silesia was attached to the [[Bishopric of Meissen]], which, like Pozna\u0144, was suffragan to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. Soon after, Boles\u0142aw, who had pledged allegiance to the empero Otto who ruled all of Silesia, founded the Diocese of Wroc\u0142aw, which, together with the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Bishopric of Ko\u0142obrzeg|Ko\u0142obrzeg]], was placed under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]], founded by Otto in 1000 during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]. The first Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw is said to have been named [[Jan (bishop of Wroc\u0142aw)|Johannes]], but nothing more than this is known of him, nor is there extant any official document giving the boundaries of the diocese at the time of its erection. However, they are defined in the Bulls of approval and protection issued by [[Pope Adrian IV]], 23 April 1155, and by [[Pope Innocent IV]], 9 August 1245.\n\nThe powerful Polish ruler Boles\u0142aw I was succeeded by his son [[Mieszko II Lambert]], who had but a short reign. After his death a revolt against Christianity and the reigning family broke out, the new Church organization of Poland disappeared from view, and the names of the Bishops of Wroc\u0142aw for the next half century are unknown. [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]], the son of Mieszko, and his mother were driven out of the country, but through German aid they returned and the affairs of the Church were brought into better order. A Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw from probably 1051 to 1062 was Hieronymus, said by later tradition to have been a [[Rome|Roman]] nobleman. He was followed by Johannes I (1062\u201372), who was succeeded by Petrus I (1071\u20131111). During the episcopate of Petrus, Count Peter Wlast entered upon the work of founding churches and monasteries which has preserved his name. Petrus was followed by: \u017byros\u0142aw I (1112\u201320); Heimo (1120\u201326), who welcomed [[Otto of Bamberg]] to Wroc\u0142aw in May 1124 when the saint was on his missionary journey to Pomerania; Robert I (1127\u201342), who was [[List of Roman Catholic bishops of Krak\u00f3w|Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]]; Robert II (1142\u201346); and Johannes II (1146\u201349), who became Archbishop of Gniezno.\n\n===Silesian duchies (Poland's fragmentation)===\nWith the episcopate of Bishop Walter (1149\u201369) the history of the diocese of Wroc\u0142aw begins to grow clearer. [[Pope Adrian IV]], at Walter's request in 1155, took the bishopric under his protection and confirmed to it the territorial possessions of which a list had been submitted to him. Among the rights which the Pope then confirmed was that of jurisdiction over the lands belonging to the castle of [[Otmuch\u00f3w]] (Ottmachau) which had been regarded as the patrimony of the diocese from its foundation. In 1163 the sons of the exiled Polish duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] returned from the Empire and, through the intervention of Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], received as an independent duchy the part of Silesia which was included at that date in the see of Wroc\u0142aw. Bishop Walter built a new, massively constructed cathedral, in which he was buried. \u017byros\u0142aw II (1170\u201398) encouraged the founding of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery of [[Lebus]] by Duke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Tall]]. In 1180 \u017byros\u0142aw took part in the national assembly at [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] at which laws for the protection of the Church and its property were promulgated. Jaros\u0142aw (1198\u20131201), the oldest son of Duke Boles\u0142aw, and Duke of [[Opole|Oppeln]], was the first prince to become Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw (see [[prince-bishop]]).\n\nCyprian (1201\u20137) was originally Abbot of the [[Premonstratensian]] monastery of St. Vincent near Wroc\u0142aw, then [[Bishop of Lebus]], and afterwards Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw. During Cyprian's episcopate Duke Heinrich I and his wife, [[Hedwig of Andechs|St. Hedwig]], founded the [[Cistercian convent at Trebnitz]]. The episcopate of Bishop Lorenz (1207\u201332) was marked by his efforts to bring colonies of Germans into the church territories, to effect the cultivation of waste lands. This introduction of German settlers by the bishop was in accordance with the example set by Heinrich I and St. Hedwig. The monasteries of the [[Augustinian Canons]], [[Premonstratensians]] and [[Cistercian]]s took an active part in carrying out the schemes of the rulers by placing great numbers of Germans, especially [[Thuringians]] and [[Franconia]]ns, on the large estates that had been granted them.\nOne of the most noted bishops of the diocese, Thomas I (1232\u201368), continued the work of German colonization with so much energy that even the marauding incursions of the [[Mongols]] (1241) made but a temporary break in the process. As German colonization in Silesia increased the city of Wroc\u0142aw began to be known by the German name of Breslau, leading to the diocese also becoming called the Bishopric of Breslau. Thomas's defence of the rights of the Church involved him in bitter conflicts with Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]]. Thomas began the construction of the present cathedral, the chancel being the first part erected. St. Hedwig died during his episcopate; and he lived until the process of her canonization was completed, but died before the final solemnity of her elevation to the altars of the Catholic Church. After Thomas I, Ladislaus, a grandson of Saint Hedwig, and [[Archbishop of Salzburg]], was Administrator of the Diocese of Breslau until his death in 1270.\n\nHe was followed by Thomas II (1270\u201392), who was involved for years in a violent dispute with Duke [[Henryk IV Probus|Henry IV]] as to the prerogatives of the Church in Silesia. In 1287 a reconciliation was effected between them at [[Regensburg]], and in 1288 the duke founded the collegiate church of the Holy Cross at Breslau. Before his death, on the Eve of St. John in 1290, the duke confirmed the rights of the Church to sovereignty over the territories of [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]] and Ottmachau. Thomas II consecrated the high altar of the cathedral; he was present at the [[First Council of Lyon]] (1274) and in 1279 held a diocesan synod. Johann III Romka (1292\u20131301), belonged to the Polish party in the [[cathedral chapter]]. His maintenance of the prerogatives of the Church brought him, also, into conflict with the temporal rulers of Silesia; in 1296 he called a synod for the defence of these rights.\n\nIn the election of Heinrich I of W\u00fcrben (1302\u201319), the German party in the cathedral chapter won, but this victory cost the new bishop the enmity of the opposing faction. He was made guardian of the youthful Dukes of Breslau, and this appointment, together with the factional disputes, led to the bringing of grave accusations against him. The researches of more recent times have proved the groundlessness of these attacks. He was kept in [[Avignon]] a number of years by a suit before the [[Curia]] which was finally settled in his favour. Notwithstanding the troubles of his life he was energetic in the performance of his duties. He carried on the construction of the cathedral, and in 1305 and 1316 held diocesan synods. The office of [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of Breslau dates from his episcopate. After his death a divided vote led to a vacancy of the see. The two candidates, Weit and Lutold, elected by the opposing factions, finally resigned, and [[Pope John XXII]] transferred Nanker of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to Breslau (1326\u201341).\n\n===Within Bohemia===\n\nThe constant division and subdivision of Silesian territory into small principalities for the members of the ruling families resulted in a condition of weakness that necessitated dependence on a stronger neighbour, and Silesia thus came under the control of Bohemia (first between 1289\u20131306; definitely from 1327 onwards), which itself was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. A quarrel broke out between Bishop Nanker and the suzerain of Silesia, King [[John I of Bohemia]], when the king seized the castle of [[Milicz|Militsch]] which belonged to the cathedral chapter. The bishop excommunicated the king and those members of the Council of Breslau who sided with him. On account of this he was obliged to flee from Breslau and take refuge in [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], where he died.\n\n[[File:Preczlaus de Pogrella.png|thumb|120px|right|Przec\u0142aw of Pogarell, 20th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nPrzec\u0142aw of Pogarell (1341\u20131376) was elected bishop while pursuing his studies at [[Bologna]], and was consecrated bishop at [[Avignon]]. Through his friendship with Charles, the son of King John, he was soon able to settle the discord that had arisen under his predecessor. The diocese prospered greatly under his rule. He bought the Duchy of [[Grodk\u00f3w]] (Grottkau) from Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Brzeg|Brieg]] and added it to the episcopal territory of Neisse. The Bishops of Breslau had, therefore, after this the titles of ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince) of Neisse and Duke of Grottkau, and took precedence over the other Silesian rulers who held principalities in fief.\n\nEmperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] wished to separate Breslau from the [[Archdiocese of Gniezno]] and to make it a suffragan of the newly erected [[Archbishopric of Prague]] (1344) but the plan failed, owing to the opposition of the Archbishop of Gniezno. Przec\u0142aw added to the cathedral the beautiful Lady Chapel, in which he was buried and where his tomb still exists. Dietrich, dean of the cathedral, who was elected as successor to Przec\u0142aw, could not obtain the papal confirmation, and the [[Bishop of Olomouc]] (Olm\u00fctz), who was chosen in his place, soon died. After a long contest with Charles, Bishop Wenzel of Lebus, Duke of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]], was transferred to Breslau (1382\u20131417). The new bishop devoted himself to repairing the damage<!-- ??? What damage exactly? It should be more specificated. --> inflicted on the Church in Silesia by the actions of Charles. He held two synods, in 1410 and 1415, with the object of securing a higher standard of ecclesiastical discipline; and he settled the right of inheritance in the territory under his dominion by promulgating the church decree called \"Wenzel's law\". Resigning his bishopric in 1417, Wenzel died in 1419.\n\nThe episcopate of Conrad, Duke of [[Ole\u015bnica]] (Oels), the next bishop (1417\u201347), was a trying time for Silesia during the [[Hussite wars]]. Conrad was placed at the head of the Silesian confederation formed to defend the country against hostile incursions. In 1435 the bishop issued a decree of which the chief intent was to close the prebends in the diocese of Breslau to foreigners, and thus prevent the Poles from obtaining these offices. The effort to shut out the Polish element and to loosen the connection with [[Gniezno]] was not a momentary one; it continued, and led gradually to a virtual separation from the Polish archdiocese some time before the formal separation took place. The troubles of the times brought the bishop and the diocese into serious pecuniary difficulties, and in 1444 Conrad resigned, but his resignation was not accepted and he resumed his office. In 1446 he held a diocesan synod and died in the following year.\n[[File:Biskup Piotr Nowak.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Peter Nowak, 23rd Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nConrad's successor was the provest of the cathedral of Breslau, Peter II Nowak (1447\u201356). By wise economy Bishop Peter succeeded in bringing the diocesan finances into a better condition and in redeeming the greater part of the church lands which his predecessor had been obliged to mortgage. At the diocesan synod of 1454 he endeavoured to suppress the abuses that had arisen in the diocese.\n\n[[File:Jodok z Ro\u017cemberku.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Jo\u0161t of Ro\u017emberk, 24th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nJodokus (Jo\u0161t) of Rosenberg (1456\u201367) was a [[Bohemian]] nobleman and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Knights of St. John]]. His love of peace made his position a very difficult one during the fierce ecclesiastic-political contention that raged between the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], and the people of Breslau, who had taken sides with the German party. Jodokus was followed by a bishop from the region of the [[Rhine]], Rudolf von R\u00fcdesheim (1468\u201382). As [[papal legate]], Rudolf had become popular in Breslau through his energetic opposition to George of Podebrady; for this reason the cathedral chapter requested his transfer from the small [[Diocese of Lavant]] in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], after he had confirmed their privileges. From this time these privileges were called \"the Rudolfian statutes\". Under his leadership the party opposed to Podebrady obtained the victory, and Rudolf proceeded at once to repair the damage which had been occasioned to the Church during this strife; mortgaged church lands were redeemed; in 1473 and 1475 diocesan synods were held, at which the bishop took active measures in regard to church discipline.\n[[File:JanRoth.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Johann IV. Roth, 26th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nAs coadjutor, he had selected a [[Swabians|Swabian]], Johann IV Roth, [[Bishop of Lavant]], a man of humanistic training. Urged by King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of [[Hungary]], to whom Silesia was then subject, the cathedral chapter, somewhat unwillingly, chose the coadjutor as bishop (1482\u20131506). His episcopate was marked by violent quarrels with the cathedral chapter. But at the same time he was a promoter of art and learning, and strict in his conception of church rights and duties. He endeavoured to improve the spiritual life of the diocese by holding a number of synods. Before he died the famous worker in bronze, [[Peter Vischer of Nuremberg]], cast his monument, the most beautiful bishop's tomb in Silesia. His coadjutor with right of succession was Johann V (1506\u201320), a member of the noble [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] family of [[Thurzo]]. Johann V took an active part in the intellectual life of the time and sought at the diocesan synods to promote learning and church discipline, and to improve the schools. On the ruins of the old stronghold of [[Jauernig]] he built the castle called [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|Johannisberg]], later the summer residence of the Prince-Bishop of Breslau.\n\nThe religious disturbances of the 16th century began to be conspicuously apparent during this episcopate, and soon after Johann's death Protestantism began to spread in Silesia, which belonged to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] since 1526. Princes, nobles, and town councils were zealous promoters of the new belief; even in the episcopal principality of [[Neisse-Grottkau]] Protestant doctrines found approval and acceptance. The successors of Johann V were partly responsible for this condition of affairs. Jacob von Salza (1520\u201339) was personally a stanch adherent of the Church; yet the gentleness of his disposition caused him to shrink from carrying on a war against the powerful religious movement that had arisen. To an even greater degree than Jacob von Salza his successor, Balthasar von Promnitz (1539\u201363), avoided coming into conflict with Protestantism. He was more friendly in his attitude to the new doctrine than any other Bishop of Breslau. Casper von Logau (1562\u201374) showed at first greater energy than his predecessor in endeavouring to compose the troubles of his distracted diocese, but later in his episcopate his attitude towards Lutheranism and his slackness in defending church rights gave great offence to those who had remained true to the Faith. These circumstances make the advance of Protestantism easy to understand. At the same time it must be remembered that the bishops, although also secular rulers, had a difficult position in regard to spiritual matters. At the assemblies of the nobles and at the meetings of the diet, the bishops and the deputies of the cathedral chapter were, as a rule, the only Catholics against a large and powerful majority on the side of Protestantism. The [[Habsburg]] suzerains, who lived far from Silesia (in Vienna or Prague), and who were constantly preoccupied by the danger of a [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turkish invasion]], were not in a position to enforce the edicts which they issued for the protection of the Church.\n\nThe Silesian clergy had in great measure lost their high concept of the priestly office, although there were honourable exceptions. Among those faithful were the majority of the canons of the cathedral of Breslau; they distinguished themselves not only by their learning, but also by their religious zeal. It was in the main due to them that the diocese did not fall into spiritual ruin. The chapter was the willing assistant of the bishops in the reform of the diocese. Martin von Gerstmann (1574\u201385) began the renovation of the diocese, and the special means by which he hoped to attain the desired end were: the founding of a seminary for clerics, visitations of the diocese, diocesan synods, and the introduction of the Jesuits.\n\nHis successor, Andreas von Jerin (1585\u201396), a Swabian who had educated at the German College at Rome, followed in his footsteps. At the diocesan synod of 1592 he endeavoured to improve church discipline. Besides his zeal in elevating the life of the Church, he was also a promoter of the arts and learning. The silver altar with which he adorned his cathedral still exists, and he brought the schools in the principality of Neisse into a flourishing condition. The bishop also rendered important services to the emperor, as [[papal legate|legate]] at various times.\n\nBonaventura Hahn, elected in 1596 as the successor of Andreas von Jerin, was not recognized by the emperor and was obliged to resign his position. The candidate of the emperor, Paul Albert (1599\u20131600), occupied the see only one year. Johann VI (1600\u20138), a member of a noble family of Silesia named von Sitsch, took more severe measures than his predecessors against Protestantism, in the hope of checking it, especially in the episcopal principality of Neisse-Grottkau.\n\nBishop Charles (1608\u201324), an Archduke of Austria, had greater success than his predecessor after the first period of the [[Thirty Years' War]] had taken a turn favourable to Austria and the Catholic party. Charles wanted to move under protection of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], hoping to avoid participation in the war which was ravaging the Holy Roman Empire. As Charles's bishopric was nominally subordinated to the Polish Archbishopric of Gniezno, he asked the Archbishop of Gniezno for mediation in talks with King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] of Poland about protection and subordination of his bishopric. In May 1619, Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw (the future King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]]), invited by his uncle Charles, left [[Warsaw]] and started a trip to Silesia. During talks with W\u0142adys\u0142aw in mid-1619, the Habsburgs promised to agree to a temporary occupation of part of Silesia by Polish forces, which the unsuccessfully Vasas hoped would later allow the incorporation of those areas into Poland.\n\nIn July 1619 Czech Protestants rebelled against King [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and offered the Bohemian crown to [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. On 27 September 1619, probably on hearing the news, W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Charles left Silesia in a hurry and on 7 October 1619 arrived in Warsaw. In December 1619, young W\u0142adys\u0142aw's brother, Prince [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Opole]], was chosen by Charles as auxiliary bishop of Wroc\u0142aw, which was confirmed by the Polish episcopate. The [[Battle of the White Mountain]] (1620) broke the revolt in Bohemian Crown (i.e. including the opposition of the Protestants of Silesia). The Bishopric of Breslau returned to the rule of the Archbishopric of Gniezno in 1620, having before been practically independent. Bishop Charles began the restoration of the principality of Neisse to the Catholic faith. The work was completed by his successor, Charles Ferdinand, Prince of Poland (1625\u201355), who spent most of his time in his own country, but appointed excellent administrators for the diocese, such as the Coadjutor-Bishop Liesch von Hornau, and Archdeacon Gebauer. Imperial commissioners gave back to the Catholic Church those church buildings in the chief places of the principalities which had become the property of the sovereign through the extinction of vassal families. Until 1632 ''de facto'' rule was held in Warsaw by King Sigismund III and not by the bishop or archbishop.\n\nAccording to the terms of the 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]], the remaining churches, 693 in number, of such territories were secularized in the years 1653, 1654, and 1668. This led to a complete reorganization of the diocese. The person who effected it was Sebastian of Rostock, a man of humble birth who was [[vicar-general]] and administrator of the diocese under the bishops Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (1656\u201362) and Archduke Charles Joseph (1663\u201364), neither of whom lived in the territory of Breslau. After Sebastian of Rostock became bishop (1664\u201371) he carried on the work of reorganization with still greater success than before.\n\n[[File:Friedrich-Kardinal.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Friedrich of Hesse-Darmstadt, 41st Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n[[Friedrich von Hessen-Darmstadt]], Cardinal and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of St. John]], was the next Bishop of Breslau (1671\u201382). The new bishop was of Protestant origin but had become a Catholic at Rome. Under his administration the rehabilitation of the diocese went on. He beautified the cathedral and elaborated its services. For the red cap and violet almutium of the canons he substituted the red [[mozzetta]]. He was buried in a beautiful chapel which he had added to the cathedral in honour of his ancestress, St. Elizabeth of Thuringia.\n\nAfter his death the chapter presented Carl von Liechtenstein, Bishop of Olomouc, for confirmation. Their choice was opposed by the emperor, whose candidate was the [[Count Palatine]] Wolfgang of the ruling family of [[Pfalz-Neuburg]]. Count Wolfgang died, and his brother Franz Ludwig (1683\u20131732) was made bishop. The new ruler of the diocese was at the same time [[Bishop of Worms]], Grand Master of the [[German Knights]], Provost of [[Ellwangen]] and [[Elector of Trier]], and later was made [[Elector of Mainz]]. He separated the ecclesiastical administration and that of the civil tribunals, and obtained the definition, in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1699, of the extent of the jurisdiction of the vicariate-general and the consistory. In 1675, upon the death of the last reigning duke, the Silesian Duchy of [[Liegnitz-Brieg-Wohlau]] lapsed to the emperor, and a new secularization of the churches begun. But when King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] secured for the Protestants the right to their former possessions in these territories, by the Treaty of [[Altranst\u00e4dt]], in 1707, the secularization came to an end, and the churches had to be returned. The Habsburg Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] endeavoured to repair the loss of these buildings to the Catholic faith by founding the so-called Josephine vicarships.\n\n===Within Prussia (main part) and Bohemia (lesser part)===\n[[File:Schaffgotsch portrait.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Prince-Bishop [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]], 45th bishop on the see.]] The next prince-bishop, [[Philipp Ludwig von Sinzendorf|Philip, Count von Sinzendorf]], Cardinal and [[Bishop of Raab]] (1732\u20131747), owed his elevation to the favour of the emperor. During his episcopate, the greater part of the diocese was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[Silesian Wars]]. King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (Frederick the Great) desired to erect a \"Catholic Vicariate\" at Berlin, to be the highest spiritual authority for the Catholics of Prussia. This would have been in reality a separation from Rome, and the project failed through the opposition of the Holy See. Bishop Sinzendorf had neither the acuteness to perceive the inimical intent of the king's scheme, nor sufficient decision of character to withstand it. The king desired to secure a successor to Sinzendorf who would be under royal influence. In utter disregard of the principles of the Church, and heedless of the protests of the cathedral chapter, he presented Count [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]] as coadjutor-bishop.\n\nAfter the death of Cardinal Sinzendorf the king succeeded in the placement of Schaffgotsch as Bishop of Breslau (1748\u201395). Although the method of his elevation caused the new bishop to be regarded with suspicion by many strict Catholics, he was zealous in the fulfilment of his duties. During the [[Seven Years' War]] he fell into discredit with Frederick on account of his firm maintenance of the rights of the Church, and the return of peace did not fully restore him to favour. In 1766 he fled to the [[Austrian Silesia|Austrian]] part of his diocese in order to avoid confinement in [[Opole|Oppeln]] which the king had decreed against him. After this Frederick made it impossible for him to rule the Prussian part of his diocese, and until the death of the bishop this territory was ruled by [[vicars Apostolic]].\n\nThe former coadjutor of von Schaffgotsch, Joseph Christian, Prince von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein (1795\u20131817), succeeded him as bishop. During his episcopate the temporal power of the Bishops of Breslau came to an end through the secularization, in 1810, of the church estates in Prussian Silesia \u2013 only the estates in [[Austrian Silesia]] remained to the see. The cathedral foundation, eight collegiate foundations, and over eighty monasteries were suppressed, and their property confiscated. Only those monastic institutions which were occupied with teaching or nursing were allowed to exist.\n\nBishop Joseph Christian was succeeded by his coadjutor, Emmanuel von Schimonsky. The affairs of the Catholic Church in Prussia had been brought into order by the Bull \"De salute animarum\", issued in 1821. Under its provisions the cathedral chapter elected Schimonsky, who had been administrator of the diocese, as Prince-Bishop of Breslau (1824\u20131832).\n\nThe bull disentangled Breslau diocese from Gniezno ecclesiastical province and made Breslau an [[Exemption (church)|exempt]] bishopric. The bull also reconfined the Breslau diocesan area which from then on remained unchanged until 1922. Breslau diocese then included the bulk of the Catholic parishes in the Prussian [[Province of Silesia]] with the exception of Catholic parishes in the districts of [[Racib\u00f3rz|Ratibor]] and [[Leobsch\u00fctz]], which until 1972 belonged to the [[Archdiocese of Olomouc]], and Catholic parishes in the Prusso-Silesian [[County of Klodzko|County of Glatz]], which were subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] within the [[Archdiocese of Prague]] until 1972. The Breslau Diocese included the Catholic parishes in the [[Duchy of Teschen]] and the Austrian part of the [[Principality of Neisse]]. The bull also assigned the Prussian-annexed parts of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Mei\u00dfen#Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen|Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen]] in [[Lower Lusatia]] (politically part of Prussian [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] since 1815<ref>This included \u2013 among others \u2013 [[Cottbus]], [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie|Crossen]], [[Guben]], [[Neuzelle]], [[Schwiebus]] and [[Z\u00fcllichau]] etc.</ref>) and eastern [[Upper Lusatia]] (to Silesia province as of 1815) to Breslau diocese.\n\nWith the exception of the districts of [[Byt\u00f3w|B\u00fctow]] and [[L\u0119bork|Lauenburg (Pommern)]], until 1922 both part of the [[Bishopric of Culm (Che\u0142mno)|Diocese of Culm]], the rest of Brandenburg and [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania province]] were, since 1821, supervised by the [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]] ({{lang-de|link=no|F\u00fcrstbisch\u00f6fliche Delegatur f\u00fcr Brandenburg und Pommern}}, {{lang-pl|Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119co-biskupia Delegatura Brandenburgii i Pomorza}}).\n\nSchimonsky retained for himself and his successors the title of prince-bishop, although the episcopal rule in the Principality of Neisse had ended by its secularization. However, the rank of prince-bishop later included the [[ex officio member]]ship in the [[Prussian House of Lords]] (since 1854) and in the [[Reichsrat (Austria)#House of Lords|Austrian House of Lords]] (since 1861).\n\nSchimonsky combatted the rationalistic tendencies which were rife among his clergy in regard to celibacy and the use of Latin in the church services and ceremonies. During the episcopate of his predecessor the government had promulgated a law which was a source of much trouble to Schimonsky and his immediate successors; this was that in those places where Catholics were few in number, the parish should be declared extinct and the church buildings given to the newly founded [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]]. In spite of the protests of the episcopal authorities, over one hundred church buildings were lost in this way. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] put an end to this injustice, and sought to make good the injuries inflicted.\n\nFor several years after Schimonsky's death the see remained vacant. It was eventually filled by the election, through government influence, of Count [[Leopold von Sedlnitzky]] (1836\u201340). Prince-Bishop von Sedlnitzky was neither clear nor firm in his maintenance of the doctrines of the Church; on the question of [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s, which had become one of great importance, he took an undecided position. At last, upon the demand of [[Pope Gregory XVI]], he resigned his see in 1840. He went afterwards to Berlin, where he was made a privy-councillor, and where he became a Protestant in 1862. In 1871 he died in Berlin and was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Rankau (today's R\u0119k\u00f3w, a part of [[Sob\u00f3tka]]).\n\n[[File:Knauer.jpg|thumb|120px|Prince-Bishop Joseph Knauer, 49th bishop of the see|alt=]] The dean of the cathedral, Dr. Ritter, administered the diocese for several years until the election of Joseph Knauer (1843\u201344), earlier [[Grand Dean]] of the Silesian County of Glatz within the Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. The new prince-bishop, who was 79&nbsp;years old, lived only a year after his appointment.\n\nHis successor was Melchior, Freiherr von Diepenbrock (1845\u201353). This episcopate was the beginning of a new religious and ecclesiastical life in the diocese. During the revolutionary period the prince-bishop not only maintained order in his see, which was in a state of ferment, but was also a supporter of the government. He received unusual honours from the king and was made a cardinal by the Pope. He died 20 January 1853, at the [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] and was buried in the Breslau cathedral.\n\nHis successor, [[Heinrich F\u00f6rster]] (1853\u201381), carried on his work and completed it. Prince-Bishop F\u00f6rster gave generous aid to the founding of churches, monastic institutions, and schools. The strife that arose between the Church and the State brought his labours in the Prussian part of his diocese to an end. He was deposed by the State and was obliged to leave Breslau and retire to the Austrian Silesian castle of Johannisberg where he died, 20 October 1881; he was buried in the cathedral at Breslau.\n\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] appointed as his successor in the disordered diocese Robert Herzog (1882\u201386), who had been ''Prince-Episcopal Delegate for Brandenburg and Pomerania'' and provost of [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral|St. Hedwig's]] in Berlin. Prince-Bishop Herzog made every endeavour to bring order out of the confusion into which the quarrel with the State during the immediately preceding years had thrown the affairs of the diocese. Unfortunately, his episcopate was but of short duration; he died after a long illness, 26 December 1886.\n\nThe Holy See appointed as his successor a man who had done much to allay the strife between Church and State, the [[Bishop of Fulda]], [[Georg von Kopp|Georg Kopp]]. Prince-Bishop Kopp was born in 1837, at [[Duderstadt]] in the [[Diocese of Hildesheim]]; he was ordained to the priesthood (1862); consecrated and installed Bishop of Fulda in 1881; transferred to Breslau and installed 20 October 1887; later created a cardinal (1893).\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAccording to the census of 1 December 1905, the German part of Breslau diocesan area, including the prince-episcopal delegation, comprised 3,342,221 Catholics; 8,737,746 Protestants; and 204,749 Jews. It was the richest German diocese in revenues and [[offertories]]. There were actively employed in the diocese 1,632 secular and 121 regular, priests. The cathedral chapter included the two offices of provost and dean, and had 10 regular, and 6 honorary, canons.\n\nThe prince-bishopric was divided into 11 commissariates and 99 [[archipresbyterate]]s, in which there were 992 cures of various kinds (parishes, curacies, and stations), with 935 parish churches and 633 dependent and mother-churches. Besides the theological faculty of the [[Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]] in Breslau, the diocese possessed, as episcopal institutions for the training of the clergy, 5 preparatory seminaries for boys, 1 home (recently much enlarged) for theological students attending the university, and 1 [[seminary]] for priests in Breslau.

However, the ecclesiastical affiliation remained unchanged, the Breslau diocese, a cross-border bilateral bishopric since 1742 between \u2013 at last \u2013 Germany and Austro-Hungary, thus turned into a trilateral Czechoslokian-German-Polish bishopric. Since 1770 the prince-bishop had appointed separate [[vicars general]] for the Bohemian (or Austrian, since 1918 partially Czechoslovakian and Polish, resp.) part of the diocese. Also the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Dioceses of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Olomouc|of Olomouc]] comprised cross-border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakian Bohemia and smaller parts in German Silesia (Hradec Kr. diocese: [[Bad Altheide]], [[K\u0142odzko|Glatz]], [[Habelschwerdt]] and [[Neurode]]; Olomouc archdiocese: [[Branice|Branitz]], [[Kietrz|Katscher]], [[Leobsch\u00fctz]] and [[Owsiszcze|Owsch\u00fctz]]).

On 7 November 1922 the Holy See disentangled the Catholic parishes in the new voivodeship from the Breslau diocese and subordinated them to an [[Apostolic Administrator]] on 17 December the same year. On 28 October 1925 [[Pope Pius XI]] elevated that apostolic administration to the new [[diocese of Katowice]] with Bishop [[August Hlond]], then a suffragan of [[Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]], by the papal Bull ''Vixdum Poloniae Unitas''.\n\nAccording to the ''Prussian [[Concordat]]'' of 1929 the prior exempt Bishopric of Breslau was elevated to the rank of archdiocese in 1930 and was henceforth known as the '''Archbishopric of Breslau''', then supervising the ''Eastern German [[ecclesiastical province|Ecclesiastical Province]]'' comprising Breslau proper and three [[suffragan]]s, to wit the new [[diocese of Berlin]], comprising the former [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]], the formerly exempt [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia|Diocese of Ermland (Warmia)]], and the new [[Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl]].\n\n===Within Poland (main part), Czechoslovakia and East Germany (lesser parts)===\nAfter World War II, the city of Breslau was made part of Poland in 1945 and officially renamed Wroc\u0142aw. In 1972 the Archbishopric of Breslau was also renamed to the Archbishopric of Wroc\u0142aw, but still known as Vratislavia in the Latin of Rome. On 21 June 1945 [[Archbishop]] Cardinal [[Adolf Bertram]], while staying in the episcopal [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] in Czechoslovak [[Javorn\u00edk (Jesen\u00edk District)|Javorn\u00edk (Jauernig)]], appointed [[Franti\u0161ek Onderek]] (1888\u20131962) as [[vicar general]] for the Czechoslovak part of the archdiocese. Bertram died on 6 July 1945 in Johannisberg castle in Czechoslovakia, supposedly due to the Polish demands upon him (an ethnic German, who, however, had pleaded for German-Polish reconciliation during the time of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski|Pi\u0142sudski]]'s regime). Expelled deported German ex-Silesians, from [[West Germany]], have since ca. 1946 entertained claims, that Bertram was actually killed or brought near to death by Polish \"imperialists\" inside the Catholic Church of Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nOn 16 July the archdiocesan [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]], still comprising nine members, elected the Polish-speaking Ferdinand Piontek as [[capitular vicar]], whom the [[Gestapo]] had banned from Breslau in early February 1945. On his return to the town he was sworn in by the chapter on 23 July. On 12 August 1945 Cardinal [[August Hlond]] appeared and demanded Piontek to resign from his office for the archdiocesan territory east of the [[Oder-Nei\u00dfe line]], claiming to act on the authority of papal mandates, however, only applying to the pre-war territory of Poland.\n\nSo Piontek \u2013 not knowing of the restricted mandate \u2013 resigned for the Polish-held parts of the archdiocese, but not for the remaining parts in Czechoslovakia and Allied occupied Germany. Hlond divided the Polish-held archdiocesan area into the three administrative districts of [[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]], [[Opole]], and Wroc\u0142aw proper and appointed a [[diocesan administrator]] for each of them on 15 August, with effect of 1 September.

In order to strengthen Piontek's position Pius XII granted him the rights of a residing bishop on 28 February 1946. However, on 9 July the Polish authorities expelled Piontek and he stranded in [[Peine]], then British zone of occupation. On 31 July Pius XII confirmed Onderek's appointment and advanced him to ''Apostolic Administrator of the Czechoslovak part of the Archdiocese of Breslau'' ({{lang-cz|[[:cs:Apo\u0161tolsk\u00e1 administratura \u010deskot\u011b\u0161\u00ednsk\u00e1|Apo\u0161tolsk\u00e1 administratura \u010deskot\u011b\u0161\u00ednsk\u00e1]]}}), seated in [[\u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn]], thus definitely divesting it from Breslau's jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Hartelt 2008 p. 231\"/><ref>''Biographisches Handbuch der Tschechoslowakei'', Heinrich Kuhn and Otto B\u00f6ss (compilators), Munich: Lerche, 1961, (=Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen des Collegium Carolinum), p. 115</ref> The Archdiocese of Breslau remained in existence [[de jure]], however, de facto this only applied to the archdiocesan territory in the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied Occupation Zones]] in the remainder of German post-war territories.

However, the territory of the other suffragans, the [[Bishopric of Ermland (1772-1945)|diocese of Ermland/Warmia]] had come under Polish and Soviet rule, respectively, and the Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl had become Polish.\n\nIn 1947 Piontek returned to the archdiocesan territory west of Oder-Nei\u00dfe line (then part of [[Soviet occupation zone]]) and officiated as capitular vicar at the local branch of the archdiocesan [[ordinariate]] in Silesian [[G\u00f6rlitz]], built up since October 1945. Despite the anticlerical Soviet policy he managed to build up a new [[seminary]] in [[Neuzelle]] in 1948, after the old seminary in Poland was inaccessible for candidates from west of the new border. In 1953 Pius XII invested Piontek with the right to bear a [[crosier]] and bestow episcopal [[blessing]]s. On 23 May 1959 Piontek became titular bishop of [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]].\n\nThe Holy See refused to acknowledge Polish Catholic Church claims, however, and only appointed auxiliary bishops to the Archdiocese of [[Krak\u00f3w]] in order to serve the Poles, who settled in Silesia or who went there to colonize. Legally the archdiocese was still considered part of the German ''[[Fulda Conference]] of Catholic Bishops'' inside Germany of the borders of 31 December 1937. In 1951, when the [[Holy See]] \u2013 similar to [[West Germany]] \u2013 still asserted that Silesia would be returned to Germany at a near date, the Holy See appointed Theodor Bensch (1903\u20131958), titular bishop of Tabuda, as auxiliary bishop of Breslau, also responsible for the Polish part of the diocese of Berlin.\n\n===Within Poland since 1972===\n[[File:Kominek1.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Boles\u0142aw Kominek, 2nd Archbishop (first postwar) of Wroc\u0142aw]] On 28 June 1972, however, \u2013 in response to West Germany's change in [[Ostpolitik]] \u2013 [[Pope Paul VI]] redrew the archdiocesan boundary along the post-war borders.

From its founding as a [[Diocese|bishopric]] in 1000 until 1821, it was under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]]. From 1821 to 1930 it was subjected directly to the [[Apostolic See]]. Between 1821 and 1972 it was officially known as '''(Arch)Diocese of Breslau'''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early medieval era===\nChristianity was first introduced into [[Silesia]] by missionaries from [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]]. After the conversion of Duke [[Mieszko I]] of Poland and the conquest of Silesia, the work of bringing the people to the new faith went on more rapidly. Up to about the year 1000 Silesia had no bishop of its own, but was united with neighbouring dioceses. In this way, the connection of Silesia with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] continued. The upper part of the [[Oder River]] formed the boundary of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131138)|Kingdom of Poland]]. All the territory which is now Silesia \u2013 lying on the right-hand bank of the Oder \u2013 belonged, therefore, to the [[Diocese of Pozna\u0144]], which was [[suffragan]] to the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]]. This part of Silesia was thus under the jurisdiction of a priest named Jordan who was appointed first Bishop of Pozna\u0144 in 968. The part of Silesia lying on the left bank of the Oder belonged to the territory included in then [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and was consequently within the diocesan jurisdiction of [[Prague]]. The [[Bishopric of Prague]], founded in 973, was suffragan to the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].\n\nDuke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], the son of Mieszko, obtained the Bohemian part of Silesia during his wars of conquest, and a change in the ecclesiastical dependence of the province followed. By a patent of Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] in 995, Silesia was attached to the [[Bishopric of Meissen]], which, like Pozna\u0144, was suffragan to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. Soon after, Boles\u0142aw, who had pledged allegiance to the empero Otto who ruled all of Silesia, founded the Diocese of Wroc\u0142aw, which, together with the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Bishopric of Ko\u0142obrzeg|Ko\u0142obrzeg]], was placed under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]], founded by Otto in 1000 during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]. The first Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw is said to have been named [[Jan (bishop of Wroc\u0142aw)|Johannes]], but nothing more than this is known of him, nor is there extant any official document giving the boundaries of the diocese at the time of its erection. However, they are defined in the Bulls of approval and protection issued by [[Pope Adrian IV]], 23 April 1155, and by [[Pope Innocent IV]], 9 August 1245.\n\nThe powerful Polish ruler Boles\u0142aw I was succeeded by his son [[Mieszko II Lambert]], who had but a short reign. After his death a revolt against Christianity and the reigning family broke out, the new Church organization of Poland disappeared from view, and the names of the Bishops of Wroc\u0142aw for the next half century are unknown. [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]], the son of Mieszko, and his mother were driven out of the country, but through German aid they returned and the affairs of the Church were brought into better order. A Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw from probably 1051 to 1062 was Hieronymus, said by later tradition to have been a [[Rome|Roman]] nobleman. He was followed by Johannes I (1062\u201372), who was succeeded by Petrus I (1071\u20131111). During the episcopate of Petrus, Count Peter Wlast entered upon the work of founding churches and monasteries which has preserved his name. Petrus was followed by: \u017byros\u0142aw I (1112\u201320); Heimo (1120\u201326), who welcomed [[Otto of Bamberg]] to Wroc\u0142aw in May 1124 when the saint was on his missionary journey to Pomerania; Robert I (1127\u201342), who was [[List of Roman Catholic bishops of Krak\u00f3w|Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]]; Robert II (1142\u201346); and Johannes II (1146\u201349), who became Archbishop of Gniezno.\n\n===Silesian duchies (Poland's fragmentation)===\nWith the episcopate of Bishop Walter (1149\u201369) the history of the diocese of Wroc\u0142aw begins to grow clearer. [[Pope Adrian IV]], at Walter's request in 1155, took the bishopric under his protection and confirmed to it the territorial possessions of which a list had been submitted to him. Among the rights which the Pope then confirmed was that of jurisdiction over the lands belonging to the castle of [[Otmuch\u00f3w]] (Ottmachau) which had been regarded as the patrimony of the diocese from its foundation. In 1163 the sons of the exiled Polish duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] returned from the Empire and, through the intervention of Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], received as an independent duchy the part of Silesia which was included at that date in the see of Wroc\u0142aw. Bishop Walter built a new, massively constructed cathedral, in which he was buried. \u017byros\u0142aw II (1170\u201398) encouraged the founding of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery of [[Lebus]] by Duke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Tall]]. In 1180 \u017byros\u0142aw took part in the national assembly at [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] at which laws for the protection of the Church and its property were promulgated. Jaros\u0142aw (1198\u20131201), the oldest son of Duke Boles\u0142aw, and Duke of [[Opole|Oppeln]], was the first prince to become Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw (see [[prince-bishop]]).\n\nCyprian (1201\u20137) was originally Abbot of the [[Premonstratensian]] monastery of St. Vincent near Wroc\u0142aw, then [[Bishop of Lebus]], and afterwards Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw. During Cyprian's episcopate Duke Heinrich I and his wife, [[Hedwig of Andechs|St. Hedwig]], founded the [[Cistercian convent at Trebnitz]]. The episcopate of Bishop Lorenz (1207\u201332) was marked by his efforts to bring colonies of Germans into the church territories, to effect the cultivation of waste lands. This introduction of German settlers by the bishop was in accordance with the example set by Heinrich I and St. Hedwig. The monasteries of the [[Augustinian Canons]], [[Premonstratensians]] and [[Cistercian]]s took an active part in carrying out the schemes of the rulers by placing great numbers of Germans, especially [[Thuringians]] and [[Franconia]]ns, on the large estates that had been granted them.\nOne of the most noted bishops of the diocese, Thomas I (1232\u201368), continued the work of German colonization with so much energy that even the marauding incursions of the [[Mongols]] (1241) made but a temporary break in the process. As German colonization in Silesia increased the city of Wroc\u0142aw began to be known by the German name of Breslau, leading to the diocese also becoming called the Bishopric of Breslau. Thomas's defence of the rights of the Church involved him in bitter conflicts with Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]]. Thomas began the construction of the present cathedral, the chancel being the first part erected. St. Hedwig died during his episcopate; and he lived until the process of her canonization was completed, but died before the final solemnity of her elevation to the altars of the Catholic Church. After Thomas I, Ladislaus, a grandson of Saint Hedwig, and [[Archbishop of Salzburg]], was Administrator of the Diocese of Breslau until his death in 1270.\n\nHe was followed by Thomas II (1270\u201392), who was involved for years in a violent dispute with Duke [[Henryk IV Probus|Henry IV]] as to the prerogatives of the Church in Silesia. In 1287 a reconciliation was effected between them at [[Regensburg]], and in 1288 the duke founded the collegiate church of the Holy Cross at Breslau. Before his death, on the Eve of St. John in 1290, the duke confirmed the rights of the Church to sovereignty over the territories of [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]] and Ottmachau. Thomas II consecrated the high altar of the cathedral; he was present at the [[First Council of Lyon]] (1274) and in 1279 held a diocesan synod. Johann III Romka (1292\u20131301), belonged to the Polish party in the [[cathedral chapter]]. His maintenance of the prerogatives of the Church brought him, also, into conflict with the temporal rulers of Silesia; in 1296 he called a synod for the defence of these rights.\n\nIn the election of Heinrich I of W\u00fcrben (1302\u201319), the German party in the cathedral chapter won, but this victory cost the new bishop the enmity of the opposing faction. He was made guardian of the youthful Dukes of Breslau, and this appointment, together with the factional disputes, led to the bringing of grave accusations against him. The researches of more recent times have proved the groundlessness of these attacks. He was kept in [[Avignon]] a number of years by a suit before the [[Curia]] which was finally settled in his favour. Notwithstanding the troubles of his life he was energetic in the performance of his duties. He carried on the construction of the cathedral, and in 1305 and 1316 held diocesan synods. The office of [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of Breslau dates from his episcopate. After his death a divided vote led to a vacancy of the see. The two candidates, Weit and Lutold, elected by the opposing factions, finally resigned, and [[Pope John XXII]] transferred Nanker of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to Breslau (1326\u201341).\n\n===Within Bohemia===\n\nThe constant division and subdivision of Silesian territory into small principalities for the members of the ruling families resulted in a condition of weakness that necessitated dependence on a stronger neighbour, and Silesia thus came under the control of Bohemia (first between 1289\u20131306; definitely from 1327 onwards), which itself was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. A quarrel broke out between Bishop Nanker and the suzerain of Silesia, King [[John I of Bohemia]], when the king seized the castle of [[Milicz|Militsch]] which belonged to the cathedral chapter. The bishop excommunicated the king and those members of the Council of Breslau who sided with him. On account of this he was obliged to flee from Breslau and take refuge in [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], where he died.\n\n[[File:Preczlaus de Pogrella.png|thumb|120px|right|Przec\u0142aw of Pogarell, 20th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nPrzec\u0142aw of Pogarell (1341\u20131376) was elected bishop while pursuing his studies at [[Bologna]], and was consecrated bishop at [[Avignon]]. Through his friendship with Charles, the son of King John, he was soon able to settle the discord that had arisen under his predecessor. The diocese prospered greatly under his rule. He bought the Duchy of [[Grodk\u00f3w]] (Grottkau) from Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Brzeg|Brieg]] and added it to the episcopal territory of Neisse. The Bishops of Breslau had, therefore, after this the titles of ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince) of Neisse and Duke of Grottkau, and took precedence over the other Silesian rulers who held principalities in fief.\n\nEmperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] wished to separate Breslau from the [[Archdiocese of Gniezno]] and to make it a suffragan of the newly erected [[Archbishopric of Prague]] (1344) but the plan failed, owing to the opposition of the Archbishop of Gniezno. Przec\u0142aw added to the cathedral the beautiful Lady Chapel, in which he was buried and where his tomb still exists. Dietrich, dean of the cathedral, who was elected as successor to Przec\u0142aw, could not obtain the papal confirmation, and the [[Bishop of Olomouc]] (Olm\u00fctz), who was chosen in his place, soon died. After a long contest with Charles, Bishop Wenzel of Lebus, Duke of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]], was transferred to Breslau (1382\u20131417). The new bishop devoted himself to repairing the damage<!-- ??? What damage exactly? It should be more specificated. --> inflicted on the Church in Silesia by the actions of Charles. He held two synods, in 1410 and 1415, with the object of securing a higher standard of ecclesiastical discipline; and he settled the right of inheritance in the territory under his dominion by promulgating the church decree called \"Wenzel's law\". Resigning his bishopric in 1417, Wenzel died in 1419.\n\nThe episcopate of Conrad, Duke of [[Ole\u015bnica]] (Oels), the next bishop (1417\u201347), was a trying time for Silesia during the [[Hussite wars]]. Conrad was placed at the head of the Silesian confederation formed to defend the country against hostile incursions. In 1435 the bishop issued a decree of which the chief intent was to close the prebends in the diocese of Breslau to foreigners, and thus prevent the Poles from obtaining these offices. The effort to shut out the Polish element and to loosen the connection with [[Gniezno]] was not a momentary one; it continued, and led gradually to a virtual separation from the Polish archdiocese some time before the formal separation took place. The troubles of the times brought the bishop and the diocese into serious pecuniary difficulties, and in 1444 Conrad resigned, but his resignation was not accepted and he resumed his office. In 1446 he held a diocesan synod and died in the following year.\n[[File:Biskup Piotr Nowak.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Peter Nowak, 23rd Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nConrad's successor was the provest of the cathedral of Breslau, Peter II Nowak (1447\u201356). By wise economy Bishop Peter succeeded in bringing the diocesan finances into a better condition and in redeeming the greater part of the church lands which his predecessor had been obliged to mortgage. At the diocesan synod of 1454 he endeavoured to suppress the abuses that had arisen in the diocese.\n\n[[File:Jodok z Ro\u017cemberku.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Jo\u0161t of Ro\u017emberk, 24th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nJodokus (Jo\u0161t) of Rosenberg (1456\u201367) was a [[Bohemian]] nobleman and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Knights of St. John]]. His love of peace made his position a very difficult one during the fierce ecclesiastic-political contention that raged between the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], and the people of Breslau, who had taken sides with the German party. Jodokus was followed by a bishop from the region of the [[Rhine]], Rudolf von R\u00fcdesheim (1468\u201382). As [[papal legate]], Rudolf had become popular in Breslau through his energetic opposition to George of Podebrady; for this reason the cathedral chapter requested his transfer from the small [[Diocese of Lavant]] in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], after he had confirmed their privileges. From this time these privileges were called \"the Rudolfian statutes\". Under his leadership the party opposed to Podebrady obtained the victory, and Rudolf proceeded at once to repair the damage which had been occasioned to the Church during this strife; mortgaged church lands were redeemed; in 1473 and 1475 diocesan synods were held, at which the bishop took active measures in regard to church discipline.\n[[File:JanRoth.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Johann IV. Roth, 26th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nAs coadjutor, he had selected a [[Swabians|Swabian]], Johann IV Roth, [[Bishop of Lavant]], a man of humanistic training. Urged by King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of [[Hungary]], to whom Silesia was then subject, the cathedral chapter, somewhat unwillingly, chose the coadjutor as bishop (1482\u20131506). His episcopate was marked by violent quarrels with the cathedral chapter. But at the same time he was a promoter of art and learning, and strict in his conception of church rights and duties. He endeavoured to improve the spiritual life of the diocese by holding a number of synods. Before he died the famous worker in bronze, [[Peter Vischer of Nuremberg]], cast his monument, the most beautiful bishop's tomb in Silesia. His coadjutor with right of succession was Johann V (1506\u201320), a member of the noble [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] family of [[Thurzo]]. Johann V took an active part in the intellectual life of the time and sought at the diocesan synods to promote learning and church discipline, and to improve the schools. On the ruins of the old stronghold of [[Jauernig]] he built the castle called [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|Johannisberg]], later the summer residence of the Prince-Bishop of Breslau.\n\nThe religious disturbances of the 16th century began to be conspicuously apparent during this episcopate, and soon after Johann's death Protestantism began to spread in Silesia, which belonged to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] since 1526. Princes, nobles, and town councils were zealous promoters of the new belief; even in the episcopal principality of [[Neisse-Grottkau]] Protestant doctrines found approval and acceptance. The successors of Johann V were partly responsible for this condition of affairs. Jacob von Salza (1520\u201339) was personally a stanch adherent of the Church; yet the gentleness of his disposition caused him to shrink from carrying on a war against the powerful religious movement that had arisen. To an even greater degree than Jacob von Salza his successor, Balthasar von Promnitz (1539\u201363), avoided coming into conflict with Protestantism. He was more friendly in his attitude to the new doctrine than any other Bishop of Breslau. Casper von Logau (1562\u201374) showed at first greater energy than his predecessor in endeavouring to compose the troubles of his distracted diocese, but later in his episcopate his attitude towards Lutheranism and his slackness in defending church rights gave great offence to those who had remained true to the Faith. These circumstances make the advance of Protestantism easy to understand. At the same time it must be remembered that the bishops, although also secular rulers, had a difficult position in regard to spiritual matters. At the assemblies of the nobles and at the meetings of the diet, the bishops and the deputies of the cathedral chapter were, as a rule, the only Catholics against a large and powerful majority on the side of Protestantism. The [[Habsburg]] suzerains, who lived far from Silesia (in Vienna or Prague), and who were constantly preoccupied by the danger of a [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turkish invasion]], were not in a position to enforce the edicts which they issued for the protection of the Church.\n\nThe Silesian clergy had in great measure lost their high concept of the priestly office, although there were honourable exceptions. Among those faithful were the majority of the canons of the cathedral of Breslau; they distinguished themselves not only by their learning, but also by their religious zeal. It was in the main due to them that the diocese did not fall into spiritual ruin. The chapter was the willing assistant of the bishops in the reform of the diocese. Martin von Gerstmann (1574\u201385) began the renovation of the diocese, and the special means by which he hoped to attain the desired end were: the founding of a seminary for clerics, visitations of the diocese, diocesan synods, and the introduction of the Jesuits.\n\nHis successor, Andreas von Jerin (1585\u201396), a Swabian who had educated at the German College at Rome, followed in his footsteps. At the diocesan synod of 1592 he endeavoured to improve church discipline. Besides his zeal in elevating the life of the Church, he was also a promoter of the arts and learning. The silver altar with which he adorned his cathedral still exists, and he brought the schools in the principality of Neisse into a flourishing condition. The bishop also rendered important services to the emperor, as [[papal legate|legate]] at various times.\n\nBonaventura Hahn, elected in 1596 as the successor of Andreas von Jerin, was not recognized by the emperor and was obliged to resign his position. The candidate of the emperor, Paul Albert (1599\u20131600), occupied the see only one year. Johann VI (1600\u20138), a member of a noble family of Silesia named von Sitsch, took more severe measures than his predecessors against Protestantism, in the hope of checking it, especially in the episcopal principality of Neisse-Grottkau.\n\nBishop Charles (1608\u201324), an Archduke of Austria, had greater success than his predecessor after the first period of the [[Thirty Years' War]] had taken a turn favourable to Austria and the Catholic party. Charles wanted to move under protection of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], hoping to avoid participation in the war which was ravaging the Holy Roman Empire. As Charles's bishopric was nominally subordinated to the Polish Archbishopric of Gniezno, he asked the Archbishop of Gniezno for mediation in talks with King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] of Poland about protection and subordination of his bishopric. In May 1619, Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw (the future King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]]), invited by his uncle Charles, left [[Warsaw]] and started a trip to Silesia. During talks with W\u0142adys\u0142aw in mid-1619, the Habsburgs promised to agree to a temporary occupation of part of Silesia by Polish forces, which the unsuccessfully Vasas hoped would later allow the incorporation of those areas into Poland.\n\nIn July 1619 Czech Protestants rebelled against King [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and offered the Bohemian crown to [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. On 27 September 1619, probably on hearing the news, W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Charles left Silesia in a hurry and on 7 October 1619 arrived in Warsaw. In December 1619, young W\u0142adys\u0142aw's brother, Prince [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Opole]], was chosen by Charles as auxiliary bishop of Wroc\u0142aw, which was confirmed by the Polish episcopate. The [[Battle of the White Mountain]] (1620) broke the revolt in Bohemian Crown (i.e. including the opposition of the Protestants of Silesia). The Bishopric of Breslau returned to the rule of the Archbishopric of Gniezno in 1620, having before been practically independent. Bishop Charles began the restoration of the principality of Neisse to the Catholic faith. The work was completed by his successor, Charles Ferdinand, Prince of Poland (1625\u201355), who spent most of his time in his own country, but appointed excellent administrators for the diocese, such as the Coadjutor-Bishop Liesch von Hornau, and Archdeacon Gebauer. Imperial commissioners gave back to the Catholic Church those church buildings in the chief places of the principalities which had become the property of the sovereign through the extinction of vassal families. Until 1632 ''de facto'' rule was held in Warsaw by King Sigismund III and not by the bishop or archbishop.\n\nAccording to the terms of the 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]], the remaining churches, 693 in number, of such territories were secularized in the years 1653, 1654, and 1668. This led to a complete reorganization of the diocese. The person who effected it was Sebastian of Rostock, a man of humble birth who was [[vicar-general]] and administrator of the diocese under the bishops Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (1656\u201362) and Archduke Charles Joseph (1663\u201364), neither of whom lived in the territory of Breslau. After Sebastian of Rostock became bishop (1664\u201371) he carried on the work of reorganization with still greater success than before.\n\n[[File:Friedrich-Kardinal.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Friedrich of Hesse-Darmstadt, 41st Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n[[Friedrich von Hessen-Darmstadt]], Cardinal and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of St. John]], was the next Bishop of Breslau (1671\u201382). The new bishop was of Protestant origin but had become a Catholic at Rome. Under his administration the rehabilitation of the diocese went on. He beautified the cathedral and elaborated its services. For the red cap and violet almutium of the canons he substituted the red [[mozzetta]]. He was buried in a beautiful chapel which he had added to the cathedral in honour of his ancestress, St. Elizabeth of Thuringia.\n\nAfter his death the chapter presented Carl von Liechtenstein, Bishop of Olomouc, for confirmation. Their choice was opposed by the emperor, whose candidate was the [[Count Palatine]] Wolfgang of the ruling family of [[Pfalz-Neuburg]]. Count Wolfgang died, and his brother Franz Ludwig (1683\u20131732) was made bishop. The new ruler of the diocese was at the same time [[Bishop of Worms]], Grand Master of the [[German Knights]], Provost of [[Ellwangen]] and [[Elector of Trier]], and later was made [[Elector of Mainz]]. He separated the ecclesiastical administration and that of the civil tribunals, and obtained the definition, in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1699, of the extent of the jurisdiction of the vicariate-general and the consistory. In 1675, upon the death of the last reigning duke, the Silesian Duchy of [[Liegnitz-Brieg-Wohlau]] lapsed to the emperor, and a new secularization of the churches begun. But when King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] secured for the Protestants the right to their former possessions in these territories, by the Treaty of [[Altranst\u00e4dt]], in 1707, the secularization came to an end, and the churches had to be returned. The Habsburg Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] endeavoured to repair the loss of these buildings to the Catholic faith by founding the so-called Josephine vicarships.\n\n===Within Prussia (main part) and Bohemia (lesser part)===\n[[File:Schaffgotsch portrait.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Prince-Bishop [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]], 45th bishop on the see.]] The next prince-bishop, [[Philipp Ludwig von Sinzendorf|Philip, Count von Sinzendorf]], Cardinal and [[Bishop of Raab]] (1732\u20131747), owed his elevation to the favour of the emperor. During his episcopate, the greater part of the diocese was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[Silesian Wars]]. King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (Frederick the Great) desired to erect a \"Catholic Vicariate\" at Berlin, to be the highest spiritual authority for the Catholics of Prussia. This would have been in reality a separation from Rome, and the project failed through the opposition of the Holy See. Bishop Sinzendorf had neither the acuteness to perceive the inimical intent of the king's scheme, nor sufficient decision of character to withstand it. The king desired to secure a successor to Sinzendorf who would be under royal influence. In utter disregard of the principles of the Church, and heedless of the protests of the cathedral chapter, he presented Count [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]] as coadjutor-bishop.\n\nAfter the death of Cardinal Sinzendorf the king succeeded in the placement of Schaffgotsch as Bishop of Breslau (1748\u201395). Although the method of his elevation caused the new bishop to be regarded with suspicion by many strict Catholics, he was zealous in the fulfilment of his duties. During the [[Seven Years' War]] he fell into discredit with Frederick on account of his firm maintenance of the rights of the Church, and the return of peace did not fully restore him to favour. In 1766 he fled to the [[Austrian Silesia|Austrian]] part of his diocese in order to avoid confinement in [[Opole|Oppeln]] which the king had decreed against him. After this Frederick made it impossible for him to rule the Prussian part of his diocese, and until the death of the bishop this territory was ruled by [[vicars Apostolic]].\n\nThe former coadjutor of von Schaffgotsch, Joseph Christian, Prince von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein (1795\u20131817), succeeded him as bishop. During his episcopate the temporal power of the Bishops of Breslau came to an end through the secularization, in 1810, of the church estates in Prussian Silesia \u2013 only the estates in [[Austrian Silesia]] remained to the see. The cathedral foundation, eight collegiate foundations, and over eighty monasteries were suppressed, and their property confiscated. Only those monastic institutions which were occupied with teaching or nursing were allowed to exist.\n\nBishop Joseph Christian was succeeded by his coadjutor, Emmanuel von Schimonsky. The affairs of the Catholic Church in Prussia had been brought into order by the Bull \"De salute animarum\", issued in 1821. Under its provisions the cathedral chapter elected Schimonsky, who had been administrator of the diocese, as Prince-Bishop of Breslau (1824\u20131832).\n\nThe bull disentangled Breslau diocese from Gniezno ecclesiastical province and made Breslau an [[Exemption (church)|exempt]] bishopric. The bull also reconfined the Breslau diocesan area which from then on remained unchanged until 1922. Breslau diocese then included the bulk of the Catholic parishes in the Prussian [[Province of Silesia]] with the exception of Catholic parishes in the districts of [[Racib\u00f3rz|Ratibor]] and [[Leobsch\u00fctz]], which until 1972 belonged to the [[Archdiocese of Olomouc]], and Catholic parishes in the Prusso-Silesian [[County of Klodzko|County of Glatz]], which were subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] within the [[Archdiocese of Prague]] until 1972. The Breslau Diocese included the Catholic parishes in the [[Duchy of Teschen]] and the Austrian part of the [[Principality of Neisse]]. The bull also assigned the Prussian-annexed parts of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Mei\u00dfen#Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen|Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen]] in [[Lower Lusatia]] (politically part of Prussian [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] since 1815<ref>This included \u2013 among others \u2013 [[Cottbus]], [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie|Crossen]], [[Guben]], [[Neuzelle]], [[Schwiebus]] and [[Z\u00fcllichau]] etc.</ref>) and eastern [[Upper Lusatia]] (to Silesia province as of 1815) to Breslau diocese.\n\nWith the exception of the districts of [[Byt\u00f3w|B\u00fctow]] and [[L\u0119bork|Lauenburg (Pommern)]], until 1922 both part of the [[Bishopric of Culm (Che\u0142mno)|Diocese of Culm]], the rest of Brandenburg and [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania province]] were, since 1821, supervised by the [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]] ({{lang-de|link=no|F\u00fcrstbisch\u00f6fliche Delegatur f\u00fcr Brandenburg und Pommern}}, {{lang-pl|Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119co-biskupia Delegatura Brandenburgii i Pomorza}}).\n\nSchimonsky retained for himself and his successors the title of prince-bishop, although the episcopal rule in the Principality of Neisse had ended by its secularization. However, the rank of prince-bishop later included the [[Ex officio member]]ship in the [[Prussian House of Lords]] (since 1854) and in the [[Reichsrat (Austria)#House of Lords|Austrian House of Lords]] (since 1861).\n\nSchimonsky combatted the rationalistic tendencies which were rife among his clergy in regard to celibacy and the use of Latin in the church services and ceremonies. During the episcopate of his predecessor the government had promulgated a law which was a source of much trouble to Schimonsky and his immediate successors; this was that in those places where Catholics were few in number, the parish should be declared extinct, and the church buildings given to the newly founded [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]]. In spite of the protests of the episcopal authorities, over one hundred church buildings were lost in this way. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] put an end to this injustice, and sought to make good the injuries inflicted.\n\nFor several years after Schimonsky's death the see remained vacant. It was eventually filled by the election, through government influence, of Count [[Leopold von Sedlnitzky]] (1836\u201340). Prince-Bishop von Sedlnitzky was neither clear nor firm in his maintenance of the doctrines of the Church; on the question of [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s, which had become one of great importance, he took an undecided position. At last, upon the demand of [[Pope Gregory XVI]], he resigned his see in 1840. He went afterwards to Berlin, where he was made a privy-councillor, and where he became a Protestant in 1862. In 1871 he died in Berlin and was buried on the Protestant cemetery in Rankau (today's R\u0119k\u00f3w, a part of [[Sob\u00f3tka]]).\n\n[[File:Knauer.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Prince-Bishop Joseph Knauer, 49th bishop on the see]] The dean of the cathedral, Dr. Ritter, administered the diocese for several years until the election Joseph Knauer (1843\u201344), before [[Grand Dean]] of the Silesian County of Glatz within the Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. The new prince-bishop, who was 79&nbsp;years old, lived only a year after his appointment.\n\nHis successor was Melchior, Freiherr von Diepenbrock (1845\u201353). This episcopate was the beginning of a new religious and ecclesiastical life in the diocese. During the revolutionary period the prince-bishop not only maintained order in his see, which was in a state of ferment, but was also a supporter of the government. He received unusual honours from the king and was made a cardinal by the Pope. He died 20 January 1853, at the [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] and was buried in the Breslau cathedral.\n\nHis successor, [[Heinrich F\u00f6rster]] (1853\u201381), carried on his work and completed it. Prince-Bishop F\u00f6rster gave generous aid to the founding of churches, monastic institutions, and schools. The strife that arose between the Church and the State brought his labours in the Prussian part of his diocese to an end. He was deposed by the State and was obliged to leave Breslau and retire to the Austrian Silesian castle of Johannisberg where he died, 20 October 1881; he was buried in the cathedral at Breslau.\n\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] appointed as his successor in the disordered diocese Robert Herzog (1882\u201386), who had been ''Prince-Episcopal Delegate for Brandenburg and Pomerania'' and provost of [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral|St. Hedwig's]] in Berlin. Prince-Bishop Herzog made every endeavour to bring order out of the confusion into which the quarrel with the State during the immediately preceding years had thrown the affairs of the diocese. Unfortunately, his episcopate was but of short duration; he died after a long illness, 26 December 1886.\n\nThe Holy See appointed as his successor a man who had done much to allay the strife between Church and State, the [[Bishop of Fulda]], [[Georg von Kopp|Georg Kopp]]. Prince-Bishop Kopp was born in 1837, at [[Duderstadt]] in the [[Diocese of Hildesheim]]; he was ordained to the priesthood (1862); consecrated and installed Bishop of Fulda in 1881; transferred to Breslau and installed 20 October 1887; later created a cardinal (1893).\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAccording to the census of 1 December 1905, the German part of Breslau diocesan area, including the prince-episcopal delegation, comprised 3,342,221 Catholics; 8,737,746 Protestants; and 204,749 Jews. It was the richest German diocese by revenues and [[offertories]]. There were actively employed in the diocese 1,632 secular, and 121 regular, priests. The cathedral chapter included the two offices of provost and dean, and had 10 regular, and 6 honorary, canons.\n\nThe prince-bishopric was divided into 11 commissariates and 99 [[archipresbyterate]]s, in which there were 992 cures of various kinds (parishes, curacies, and stations), with 935 parish churches and 633 dependent and mother-churches. Besides the theological faculty of the [[Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]] in Breslau, the diocese possessed, as episcopal institutions for the training of the clergy, 5 preparatory seminaries for boys, 1 home (recently much enlarged) for theological students attending the university, and 1 [[seminary]] for priests in Breslau.

However, the ecclesiastical affiliation remained unchanged, the Breslau diocese, a cross-border bilateral bishopric since 1742 between \u2013 at last \u2013 Germany and Austro-Hungary, thus turned into a trilateral Czechoslokian-German-Polish bishopric. Since 1770 the prince-bishop had appointed separate [[vicars general]] for the Bohemian (or Austrian, since 1918 partially Czechoslovakian and Polish, resp.) part of the diocese. Also the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Dioceses of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Olomouc|of Olomouc]] comprised cross-border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakian Bohemia and smaller parts in German Silesia (Hradec Kr. diocese: [[Bad Altheide]], [[K\u0142odzko|Glatz]], [[Habelschwerdt]] and [[Neurode]]; Olomouc archdiocese: [[Branice|Branitz]], [[Kietrz|Katscher]], [[Leobsch\u00fctz]] and [[Owsiszcze|Owsch\u00fctz]]).

On 7 November 1922 the Holy See disentangled the Catholic parishes in the new voivodeship from the Breslau diocese and subordinated them to an [[Apostolic Administrator]] on 17 December the same year. On 28 October 1925 [[Pope Pius XI]] elevated that apostolic administration to the new [[diocese of Katowice]] with Bishop [[August Hlond]], then a suffragan of [[Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]], by the papal Bull ''Vixdum Poloniae Unitas''.\n\nAccording to the ''Prussian [[Concordat]]'' of 1929 the prior exempt Bishopric of Breslau was elevated to the rank of archdiocese in 1930 and was henceforth known as the '''Archbishopric of Breslau''', then supervising the ''Eastern German [[ecclesiastical province|Ecclesiastical Province]]'' comprising Breslau proper and three [[suffragan]]s, to wit the new [[diocese of Berlin]], comprising the former [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]], the formerly exempt [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia|Diocese of Ermland (Warmia)]] and the new [[Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl]].\n\n===Within Poland (main part), Czechoslovakia and East Germany (lesser parts)===\nAfter World War II, the city of Breslau was made part of Poland in 1945 and officially renamed Wroc\u0142aw. In 1972 the Archbishopric of Breslau was also renamed to the Archbishopric of Wroc\u0142aw, but still known as Vratislavia in the Latin of Rome. On 21 June 1945 [[Archbishop]] Cardinal [[Adolf Bertram]], while staying in the episcopal [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] in Czechoslovak [[Javorn\u00edk (Jesen\u00edk District)|Javorn\u00edk (Jauernig)]], appointed [[Franti\u0161ek Onderek]] (1888\u20131962) as [[vicar general]] for the Czechoslovak part of the archdiocese. Bertram died on 6 July 1945 in Johannisberg castle in Czechoslovakia, supposedly due to the Polish demands upon him (an ethnic German, who, however, had pleaded for German-Polish reconciliation during the time of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski|Pi\u0142sudski]]'s regime). Expelled deported German ex-Silesians, from [[West Germany]], have since ca. 1946 entertained claims, that Bertram was actually killed or brought near to death by Polish \"imperialists\" inside the Catholic Church of Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nOn 16 July the archdiocesan [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]], still comprising nine members, elected the Polish-speaking Ferdinand Piontek as [[capitular vicar]], whom the [[Gestapo]] had banned from Breslau in early February 1945. On his return to the town he was sworn in by the chapter on 23 July. On 12 August 1945 Cardinal [[August Hlond]] appeared and demanded Piontek to resign from his office for the archdiocesan territory east of the [[Oder-Nei\u00dfe line]], claiming to act on the authority of papal mandates, however, only applying to the pre-war territory of Poland.\n\nSo Piontek \u2013 not knowing of the restricted mandate \u2013 resigned for the Polish-held parts of the archdiocese, but not for the remaining parts in Czechoslovakia and Allied occupied Germany. Hlond divided the Polish-held archdiocesan area into the three administrative districts of [[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]], [[Opole]], and Wroc\u0142aw proper and appointed a [[diocesan administrator]] for each of them on 15 August, with effect of 1 September. Capitular Vicar Piontek confirmed Onderek on 18 August 1945 als vicar general for the Czechoslovakian part of the archdiocese.<ref name=\"Hartelt 2008 p. 231\">Konrad Hartelt, ''Ferdinand Piontek: (1878\u20131963); Leben und Wirken eines schlesischen Priesters und Bischofs'', Cologne et al.: B\u00f6hlau, 2008, (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 39), p. 231. {{ISBN|978-3-412-20143-2}}</ref> Piontek was asked to help Karol Milik, the new administrator in Wroc\u0142aw, and stayed. He could also take care of the Catholic clergy and laymen of German language, who were in the course of expulsion by the Polish authorities.\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] did not recognise Hlond's overbearances. In order to strengthen Piontek's position Pius XII granted him the rights of a residing bishop on 28 February 1946. However, on 9 July the Polish authorities expelled Piontek and he stranded in [[Peine]], then British zone of occupation. On 31 July Pius XII confirmed Onderek's appointment and advanced him to ''Apostolic Administrator of the Czechoslovak part of the Archdiocese of Breslau'' ({{lang-cz|[[:cs:Apo\u0161tolsk\u00e1 administratura \u010deskot\u011b\u0161\u00ednsk\u00e1|Apo\u0161tolsk\u00e1 administratura \u010deskot\u011b\u0161\u00ednsk\u00e1]]}}), seated in [[\u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn]], thus definitely divesting it from Breslau's jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Hartelt 2008 p. 231\"/><ref>''Biographisches Handbuch der Tschechoslowakei'', Heinrich Kuhn and Otto B\u00f6ss (compilators), Munich: Lerche, 1961, (=Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen des Collegium Carolinum), p. 115</ref> The Archdiocese of Breslau remained in existence [[de jure]], however, de facto this only applied to the archdiocesan territory in the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied Occupation Zones]] in the remainder of German post-war territories. This also included big parts of the [[suffragan]] [[diocese of Berlin]], except of its areas east of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line. However, the territory of the other suffragans, the [[Bishopric of Ermland (1772-1945)|diocese of Ermland/Warmia]] had come under Polish and Soviet rule, respectively, and the Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl had become Polish.\n\nIn 1947 Piontek returned to the archdiocesan territory west of Oder-Nei\u00dfe line (then part of [[Soviet occupation zone]]) and officiated as capitular vicar at the local branch of the archdiocesan [[ordinariate]] in Silesian [[G\u00f6rlitz]], built up since October 1945. Despite the anticlerical Soviet policy he managed to build up a new [[seminary]] in [[Neuzelle]] in 1948, after the old seminary in Poland was inaccessible for candidates from west of the new border. In 1953 Pius XII invested Piontek with the right to bear a [[crosier]] and bestow episcopal [[blessing]]s. On 23 May 1959 Piontek became titular bishop of [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]].\n\nThe Holy See refused to acknowledge Polish Catholic Church claims, however, and only appointed auxiliary bishops to the Archdiocese of [[Krak\u00f3w]] in order to serve the Poles, who settled in Silesia or who went there to colonize. Legally the archdiocese was still considered part of the German ''[[Fulda Conference]] of Catholic Bishops'' inside Germany of the borders of 31 December 1937. In 1951, when the [[Holy See]] \u2013 similar to [[West Germany]] \u2013 still asserted that Silesia would be returned to Germany at a near date, the Holy See appointed Theodor Bensch (1903\u20131958), titular bishop of Tabuda, as auxiliary bishop of Breslau, also responsible for the Polish part of the diocese of Berlin.\n\n===Within Poland since 1972===\n[[File:Kominek1.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Boles\u0142aw Kominek, 2nd Archbishop (first postwar) of Wroc\u0142aw]] On 28 June 1972, however, \u2013 in response to West Germany's change in [[Ostpolitik]] \u2013 [[Pope Paul VI]] redrew the archdiocesan boundary along the post-war borders.
