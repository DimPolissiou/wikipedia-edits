Following her husband's death in 1816, she remarried in 1818.<ref name=Rossel /> Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education and had to support himself, working as an [[apprentice]] to a weaver and, later, to a tailor. At fourteen, he moved to [[Copenhagen]] to seek employment as an actor. Having an excellent soprano voice, he was accepted into the [[Royal Danish Theatre]], but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet. Taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.\n\n[[File:H.C. Andersens Barndomshjemmet2.JPG|thumb|left|Andersen's childhood home in Odense]]\nJonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, held great affection for Andersen and sent him to a [[grammar school]] in [[Slagelse]], persuading [[Frederick VI of Denmark|King Frederick VI]] to pay part of the youth's education.<ref>[http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/cultural/hans-christian-andersen-281.html Hans Christian Andersen - Childhood and Education].

At one school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home, where he was abused, being told that it was \"to improve his character\".

The story, written in the 1820s, was about a candle that did not feel appreciated. It was written while Andersen was still in school and dedicated to a benefactor in whose family's possession it remained until it turned up among other family papers in a local archive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Local historian finds Hans Christian Andersen's first fairy tale|url=http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/ECE1841147/local-historian-finds-hans-christian-andersens-first-fairy-tale/|publisher=Politiken.dk|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1829, Andersen enjoyed considerable success with the short story \"A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager\". Its protagonist meets characters ranging from [[Saint Peter]] to a talking cat. Andersen followed this success with a theatrical piece, ''Love on St. Nicholas Church Tower'', and a short volume of poems. Although he made little progress writing and publishing immediately thereafter, in 1833 he received a small travel grant from the king, thus enabling him to set out on the first of many journeys through Europe. At [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], near [[Le Locle]], Switzerland, Andersen wrote the story \"Agnete and the Merman\". He spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of [[Sestri Levante]] the same year, inspiring the title of \"The Bay of Fables\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andersenfestival.it |title=Andersen Festival, Sestri Levante|publisher=Andersen Festival|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> In October 1834, he arrived in [[Rome]].

Initially his original fairy tales were not met with recognition, due partly to the difficulty of translating them. In 1835, Andersen published the first two installments of his ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.|Fairy Tales]]'' ({{lang-da|Eventyr}}; lit. \"fantastic tales\"). More stories, completing the first volume, were published in 1837. The collection comprises nine tales, including \"[[The Tinderbox]]\", \"[[The Princess and the Pea]]\", \"[[Thumbelina]]\", \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" and \"[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]\". The quality of these stories was not immediately recognized, and they sold poorly. At the same time, Andersen enjoyed more success with two novels, ''O.T.'' (1836) and ''Only a Fiddler'' (1837);<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/onlyfiddlerdanis00andeiala#page/n3/mode/2up ''Only a Fiddler''] from Archive.org</ref> the latter work was reviewed by a young [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://andersen.sdu.dk/forskning/anmeldelser/kritik_e.html|title=Criticism of Hans Christian Andersen|website=andersen.sdu.dk|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Much of his work was influenced by the Bible as when he was growing up Christianity was very important in the Danish culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/hans-christian-andersens-fairy-tales/0/steps/14184|title=Biblical themes in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales - Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales - Hans Christian Andersen Centre|last=FutureLearn|website=FutureLearn|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:C.A. Jensen 1836 - HC Andersen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Painting of Andersen, 1836, by [[Christian Albrecht Jensen]]]]\nAfter a visit to [[Sweden]] in 1837, Andersen became inspired by [[Scandinavism]] and committed himself to writing a poem that would convey the relatedness of [[Swedes]], [[Danes]] and [[Norwegians]].<ref name=\"Scandinavian\">{{cite web|work=Hans Christian Andersen and Music|url=http://www.kb.dk/elib/noder/hcamusik/skandinav/index_en.htm|title=I am a Scandinavian|accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> In July 1839, during a visit to the island of [[Funen]],  Andersen wrote the text of his poem ''Jeg er en Skandinav'' (\"I am a Scandinavian\")<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/> to capture \"the beauty of the Nordic spirit, the way the three sister nations have gradually grown together\" as part of a Scandinavian national anthem.<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/> Composer [[Otto Lindblad]] set the poem to music, and the composition was published in January 1840. Its popularity peaked in 1845, after which it was seldom sung.<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/>\n\nAndersen returned to the fairy tale genre in 1838 with another collection, ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children (1838)|Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First Booklet]]'' ({{lang|da|Eventyr, fortalte for B\u00f8rn. Ny Samling}}), which consists of \"The Daisy\", \"[[The Steadfast Tin Soldier]]\", and \"[[The Wild Swans]]\".  He went on to publish \"New Fairy Tales (1844). First Volume. First Collection\", which contained \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\" and \"[[The Ugly Duckling]]\".  After that came \"New Fairy Tales (1845). First Volume. Second Collection\" in which was found \"[[The Snow Queen]]\".  \"[[The Little Match Girl]]\" appeared in December 1845 in the \"Dansk Folkekalender (1846)\" and also in \"New Fairy Tales (1848). Second Volume. Second Collection\".\n\n1845 saw a breakthrough for Andersen with the publication of four translations of his fairy tales. \"The Little Mermaid\" appeared in the periodical ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]'', followed by a second volume, ''Wonderful Stories for Children''. Two other volumes enthusiastically received were ''A Danish Story Book'' and ''Danish Fairy Tales and Legends''. A review that appeared in the London journal ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athen\u00e6um]]'' (February 1846) said of ''Wonderful Stories'', \"This is a book full of life and fancy; a book for grandfathers no less than grandchildren, not a word of which will be skipped by those who have it once in hand.\"<ref name=\"Wullschl\u00e4ger 2002\"/>\n\nAndersen would continue to write fairy tales and published them in installments until 1872.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/who-was-hans-christian-andersen|title=Who Was Hans Christian Andersen?|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Travelogues===\nIn 1851, he published to wide acclaim ''In Sweden'', a volume of travel sketches. A keen traveller, Andersen published several other long [[travel literature|travelogues]]: ''Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831'', ''A Poet's Bazaar'', ''In Spain'' and ''A Visit to Portugal in 1866''. (The last describes his visit with his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] friends Jorge and Jose O'Neill, who were his fellows in the mid-1820s while living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen took heed of some of the contemporary conventions about travel writing, but always developed the genre to suit his own purposes. Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of the sights he saw with more philosophical passages on topics such as being an author, immortality, and the nature of fiction in the literary travel report. Some of the travelogues, such as ''In Sweden'', even contain fairy-tales.\n\nIn the 1840s, Andersen's attention returned to the stage, but with little success. He had better fortune with the publication of the ''Picture-Book without Pictures'' (1840). A second series of fairy tales began in 1838 and a third in 1845. Andersen was now celebrated throughout Europe, although his native [[Denmark]] still showed some resistance to his pretensions.\n\nBetween 1845 and 1864, H. C. Andersen lived at [[Nyhavn 67]], Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque now stands.<ref name=\"Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725103354/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 July 2008 |title=Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen |publisher=Visitcopenhagen.com |accessdate=2 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Kierkegaard===\nIn \u2018Andersen as a Novelist\u2019, Kierkegaard remarks that Andersen is characterized as, \u201c...a possibility of a personality, wrapped up in such a web of arbitrary moods and moving through an elegiac duo-decimal scale [i.e., a chromatic scale. Proceeding by semitones, and therefore including sharps as well as flats, such a scale is associated more with lament or elegy than is an ordinary diatonic scale] of almost echoless, dying tones just as easily roused as subdued, who, in order to become a personality, needs a strong life-development.\u201d\n\n===Meetings with Dickens===\nIn June 1847, Andersen paid his first visit to England and enjoyed a triumphal social success during the summer. The [[Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington|Countess of Blessington]] invited him to her parties where intellectual people could meet, and it was at one such party that he met [[Charles Dickens]] for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda, about which Andersen wrote in his diary: \"We had come to the veranda, I was so happy to see and speak to England's now-living writer whom I love the most.\"<ref name=\"dickens\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=3704 |title=H.C.

In the [[Victorian era]] there was a growing sympathy for children and an idealisation of the innocence of childhood.\n\nTen years later, Andersen visited England again, primarily to meet Dickens. He extended a brief visit to Dickens' home at [[Gads Hill Place]] into a five-week stay, to the distress of Dickens' family. After Andersen was told to leave, Dickens gradually stopped all correspondence between them, to the great disappointment and confusion of Andersen, who had quite enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered.<ref name=\"dickens\"/>\n\n===Love life===\n[[File:Hans Christian Andersen 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz Hanfstaengl|Hanfstaengl]] portrait of Andersen dated July 1860]]\nIn Andersen's early life, his private journal records his [[Celibacy|refusal to have sexual relations]].<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Lepage | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1689053,00.html | title = Bedtime stories | newspaper = The Guardian | date =18 January 2006| accessdate = 19 July 2006 }}</ref><ref name=Garfield>Recorded using \"special Greek symbols\".{{cite web|url=http://www.patriciagarfield.com/publications/anderson_2004IASD.pdf |title=The Dreams of Hans Christian Andersen |date=21 June 2004 |accessdate=20 July 2006 |last=Garfield |first=Patricia |page=29 }}</ref>\n\nAndersen often fell in love with unattainable women, and many of his stories are interpreted as references.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hastings|first=Waller|title=Hans Christian Andersen|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|publisher=Northern State University|accessdate=15 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123053333/http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|archivedate=23 November 2007|date=4 April 2003}}</ref>  At one point, he wrote in his diary: \"Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee!

A small pouch containing a long letter from Voigt was found on Andersen's chest when he died, several decades after he first fell in love with her, and after he presumably fell in love with others. Other disappointments in love included Sophie \u00d8rsted, the daughter of the physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]], and Louise Collin, the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin. One of his stories, \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\", was written as an expression of his passion for [[Jenny Lind]] and became the inspiration for her nickname, the \"Swedish Nightingale\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://altomhistorie.dk/artikler/h-c-andersen-og-jenny-lind/|title=H.C.

When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal.

At fourteen, he moved to [[Copenhagen]] to seek employment as an actor. Having an excellent soprano voice, he was accepted into the [[Royal Danish Theatre]], but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet. Taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.\n\n[[File:H.C. Andersens Barndomshjemmet2.JPG|thumb|left|Andersen's childhood home in Odense]]\nJonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, held great affection for Andersen and sent him to a [[grammar school]] in [[Slagelse]], persuading [[Frederick VI of Denmark|King Frederick VI]] to pay part of the youth's education.<ref>[http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/cultural/hans-christian-andersen-281.html Hans Christian Andersen - Childhood and Education].

Its protagonist meets characters ranging from [[Saint Peter]] to a talking cat. Andersen followed this success with a theatrical piece, ''Love on St. Nicholas Church Tower'', and a short volume of poems. Although he made little progress writing and publishing immediately thereafter, in 1833 he received a small travel grant from the king, thus enabling him to set out on the first of many journeys through Europe. At [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], near [[Le Locle]], Switzerland, Andersen wrote the story \"Agnete and the Merman\". He spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of [[Sestri Levante]] the same year, inspiring the title of \"The Bay of Fables\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andersenfestival.it |title=Andersen Festival, Sestri Levante|publisher=Andersen Festival|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> In October 1834, he arrived in [[Rome]].

Initially his original fairy tales were not met with recognition, due partly to the difficulty of translating them. In 1835, Andersen published the first two installments of his ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.|Fairy Tales]]'' ({{lang-da|Eventyr}}; lit. \"fantastic tales\"). More stories, completing the first volume, were published in 1837. The collection comprises nine tales, including \"[[The Tinderbox]]\", \"[[The Princess and the Pea]]\", \"[[Thumbelina]]\", \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" and \"[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]\". The quality of these stories was not immediately recognized, and they sold poorly. At the same time, Andersen enjoyed more success with two novels, ''O.T.''

Its popularity peaked in 1845, after which it was seldom sung.<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/>\n\nAndersen returned to the fairy tale genre in 1838 with another collection, ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children (1838)|Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First Booklet]]'' ({{lang|da|Eventyr, fortalte for B\u00f8rn. Ny Samling}}), which consists of \"The Daisy\", \"[[The Steadfast Tin Soldier]]\", and \"[[The Wild Swans]]\".  He went on to publish \"New Fairy Tales (1844). First Volume. First Collection\", which contained \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\" and \"[[The Ugly Duckling]]\".  After that came \"New Fairy Tales (1845). First Volume. Second Collection\" in which was found \"[[The Snow Queen]]\".  \"[[The Little Match Girl]]\" appeared in December 1845 in the \"Dansk Folkekalender (1846)\" and also in \"New Fairy Tales (1848). Second Volume. Second Collection\".\n\n1845 saw a breakthrough for Andersen with the publication of four translations of his fairy tales. \"The Little Mermaid\" appeared in the periodical ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]'', followed by a second volume, ''Wonderful Stories for Children''. Two other volumes enthusiastically received were ''A Danish Story Book'' and ''Danish Fairy Tales and Legends''. A review that appeared in the London journal ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athen\u00e6um]]'' (February 1846) said of ''Wonderful Stories'', \"This is a book full of life and fancy; a book for grandfathers no less than grandchildren, not a word of which will be skipped by those who have it once in hand.\"<ref name=\"Wullschl\u00e4ger 2002\"/>\n\nAndersen would continue to write fairy tales and published them in installments until 1872.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/who-was-hans-christian-andersen|title=Who Was Hans Christian Andersen?|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Travelogues===\nIn 1851, he published to wide acclaim ''In Sweden'', a volume of travel sketches. A keen traveller, Andersen published several other long [[travel literature|travelogues]]: ''Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831'', ''A Poet's Bazaar'', ''In Spain'' and ''A Visit to Portugal in 1866''. (The last describes his visit with his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] friends Jorge and Jose O'Neill, who were his fellows in the mid-1820s while living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen took heed of some of the contemporary conventions about travel writing, but always developed the genre to suit his own purposes. Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of the sights he saw with more philosophical passages on topics such as being an author, immortality, and the nature of fiction in the literary travel report. Some of the travelogues, such as ''In Sweden'', even contain fairy-tales.\n\nIn the 1840s, Andersen's attention returned to the stage, but with little success. He had better fortune with the publication of the ''Picture-Book without Pictures'' (1840). A second series of fairy tales began in 1838 and a third in 1845. Andersen was now celebrated throughout Europe, although his native [[Denmark]] still showed some resistance to his pretensions.\n\nBetween 1845 and 1864, H. C. Andersen lived at [[Nyhavn 67]], Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque now stands.<ref name=\"Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725103354/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 July 2008 |title=Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen |publisher=Visitcopenhagen.com |accessdate=2 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Kierkegaard===\nIn \u2018Andersen as a Novelist\u2019, Kierkegaard remarks that Andersen is characterized as, \u201c...a possibility of a personality, wrapped up in such a web of arbitrary moods and moving through an elegiac duo-decimal scale [i.e., a chromatic scale. Proceeding by semitones, and therefore including sharps as well as flats, such a scale is associated more with lament or elegy than is an ordinary diatonic scale] of almost echoless, dying tones just as easily roused as subdued, who, in order to become a personality, needs a strong life-development.\u201d\n\n===Meetings with Dickens===\nIn June 1847, Andersen paid his first visit to England and enjoyed a triumphal social success during the summer. The [[Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington|Countess of Blessington]] invited him to her parties where intellectual people could meet, and it was at one such party that he met [[Charles Dickens]] for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda, about which Andersen wrote in his diary: \"We had come to the veranda, I was so happy to see and speak to England's now-living writer whom I love the most.\"<ref name=\"dickens\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=3704 |title=H.C.

In the [[Victorian era]] there was a growing sympathy for children and an idealisation of the innocence of childhood.\n\nTen years later, Andersen visited England again, primarily to meet Dickens. He extended a brief visit to Dickens' home at [[Gads Hill Place]] into a five-week stay, to the distress of Dickens' family. After Andersen was told to leave, Dickens gradually stopped all correspondence between them, to the great disappointment and confusion of Andersen, who had quite enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered.<ref name=\"dickens\"/>\n\n===Love life===\n[[File:Hans Christian Andersen 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz Hanfstaengl|Hanfstaengl]] portrait of Andersen dated July 1860]]\nIn Andersen's early life, his private journal records his [[Celibacy|refusal to have sexual relations]].<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Lepage | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1689053,00.html | title = Bedtime stories | newspaper = The Guardian | date =18 January 2006| accessdate = 19 July 2006 }}</ref><ref name=Garfield>Recorded using \"special Greek symbols\".{{cite web|url=http://www.patriciagarfield.com/publications/anderson_2004IASD.pdf |title=The Dreams of Hans Christian Andersen |date=21 June 2004 |accessdate=20 July 2006 |last=Garfield |first=Patricia |page=29 }}</ref>\n\nAndersen often fell in love with unattainable women, and many of his stories are interpreted as references.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hastings|first=Waller|title=Hans Christian Andersen|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|publisher=Northern State University|accessdate=15 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123053333/http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|archivedate=23 November 2007|date=4 April 2003}}</ref>  At one point, he wrote in his diary: \"Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee!

A small pouch containing a long letter from Voigt was found on Andersen's chest when he died, several decades after he first fell in love with her, and after he presumably fell in love with others. Other disappointments in love included Sophie \u00d8rsted, the daughter of the physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]], and Louise Collin, the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin. One of his stories, \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\", was written as an expression of his passion for [[Jenny Lind]] and became the inspiration for her nickname, the \"Swedish Nightingale\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://altomhistorie.dk/artikler/h-c-andersen-og-jenny-lind/|title=H.C.

When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal.

When their plans go wrong they lament that \"the best laid plans of mice\" don't always work out.\n\nThe [[Monty Python]] sketch 'Word Association' references the first line of the poem, and replaces the simple word \"We\" with \"Wee sleekit cowerin' timorous beastie\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montypython.net/scripts/word-ass.php|title=Monty Python: Word Association|website=www.montypython.net}}</ref>\n\n[[Tom Clancy]]'s President [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] quotes Burns' famous line, \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley\" in the 2013 novel ''Command Authority''.\n\nThe ''[[Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' season 5 episode 9 \"Best Laid Plans\" takes its name from this poem.\n\nNetflix\u2019s series Atypical season 3 episode 1 \u201cBest Laid Plans\u201d takes its name from the poem.\n\nNetflix's series [[Narcos]] season 3 episode 6 \u201cBest Laid Plans\u201d references the poem\n\n== See also ==\n* [[To a Louse]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikisource}}\n* McGown, George William Thompson.

The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.\"\n\nThe first stanza of the poem is read by [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] in the beginning of the 2007 remaster of \"One Brown Mouse\" by [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]. Anderson adds the line \"But a mouse is a mouse, for all that\" at the end of the stanza, which is a reference to another of Burns's songs, \"[[Is There for Honest Poverty]]\", commonly known as \"A Man's a Man for A' That\".\n\nThe first line is also featured in [[Michael Morpurgo]]'s \"Private Peaceful\", as the narrator Tommo remembers learning it in class after seeing a mouse in his trench.\n\n[[Sharon Olds]]'s poem \"Sleekit Cowrin{{'\"}} also references this poem.\n\nIn [[Douglas Adams]]'s ''[[Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series, mice are the physical protrusions into our dimension of a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings who commissioned construction of the Earth to find the Question to the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe, and Everything.  When their plans go wrong they lament that \"the best laid plans of mice\" don't always work out.\n\nThe [[Monty Python]] sketch 'Word Association' references the first line of the poem, and replaces the simple word \"We\" with \"Wee sleekit cowerin' timorous beastie\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montypython.net/scripts/word-ass.php|title=Monty Python: Word Association|website=www.montypython.net}}</ref>\n\n[[Tom Clancy]]'s President [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] quotes Burns' famous line, \"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley\" in the 2013 novel ''Command Authority''.\n\nThe ''[[Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' season 5 episode 9 \"Best Laid Plans\" takes its name from this poem.\n\nNetflix\u2019s series Atypical season 3 episode 1 \u201cBest Laid Plans\u201d takes its name from the poem.\n\nNetflix's series [[Narcos]] season 3 episode 6 \u201cBest Laid Plans\u201d references the poem\n\n== See also ==\n* [[To a Louse]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikisource}}\n* McGown, George William Thompson.
