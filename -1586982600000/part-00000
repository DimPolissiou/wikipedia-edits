The Kingdom of Albania was declared in late February 1272. The kingdom extended from the region of Durazzo (Dyrrhachium, modern [[Durr\u00ebs]]) south along the coast to [[Butrint]]. A major attempt to advance further in direction of Constantinople failed at the [[Siege of Berat (1280\u20131281)]]. A Byzantine counteroffensive soon ensued, which drove the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] out of the interior by 1281. The [[Sicilian Vespers]] further weakened the position of Charles, and the Kingdom was soon reduced by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] to a small area around Durazzo. The Angevins held out here, however, until 1368, when the city was captured by [[Karl Thopia]]. In 1392 Karl Thopia's son surrendered the city and his domains to the [[Republic of Venice]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n [[File:ShepherdByzempire1265.jpg|thumb|left|Map depicting Southeastern Europe in 1265.]]During the conflict between the [[Despotate of Epirus]] and the [[Empire of Nicaea]] in 1253, lord [[Golem of Kruja]] was initially allied with Epirus. Golem's troops had occupied the [[Kostur]] area trying to prevent the Nicaean forces of [[John Vatatzes]] from entering [[Devol (Albania)|Devoll]]. Vatatzes managed to convince Golem to switch sides and a new treaty was signed between the parties where Vatatzes promised to guarantee Golem's autonomy. The same year Despot of Epirus [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas|Michael II]] signed a peace treaty with Nicaea acknowledging their authority over west Macedonia and Albania. The fortress of [[Kruj\u00eb]] was surrendered to Nicaea, while the Nicean emperor acknowledged the old privileges and also granted new ones. The same privileges were confirmed later by his successor [[Theodore II Laskaris]].<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 202</ref>\n\nThe Nicaeans took control of [[Durr\u00ebs]] from Michael II in 1256. During the winter of 1256\u201357, [[George Akropolites]] tried to reinstall Byzantine authority in the area of [[Principality of Albania|Arbanon]]. Autonomy was thus banished and a new administration was imposed. This was in contrast to what the Nicaeans had promised before. The local Albanian leaders revolted and on hearing the news, Michael II also denounced the peace treaty with the Nicaea. With the support of Albanian forces he attacked the cities of [[Dibra]], [[Ohrid]] and [[Prilep]]. In the meantime [[Manfred of Sicily]] profited from the situation and launched an invasion into Albania. His forces, led by Philip Chinard, captured Durr\u00ebs, [[Berat]], [[Vlor\u00eb]], Spinarizza and their surroundings and the southern coastline of Albania from Vlor\u00eb to [[Butrint]].<ref name=\"Setton1\">Setton (1976), p. 81</ref> Facing a war in two fronts, despot Michael II came to terms with Manfred and became his ally. He recognized Manfred's authority over the captured regions which were ceded as a dowry gift following the marriage of his daughter Helena to Manfred.<ref name=\"Setton1\" /><ref>Ducellier (1999), p. 791-792</ref>\n\nFollowing the defeat of Michael II's and Manfred's forces in the [[Battle of Pelagonia]], the new Nicaean forces continued their advance by capturing all of Manfred's domains in Albania, with the exception of Durr\u00ebs. However, in September 1261, Manfred organized a new expedition and managed to capture all his dominions in Albania and he kept them until his death in 1266.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 205</ref> Manfred respected the old autonomy and privileges of the local nobility and their regions. He also integrated Albanian nobles into his administration, as was the case with [[Andrea Vrana]] who was the general captain and governor of Durr\u00ebs and the neighboring region of Arbanon. Albanian troops were also used by Manfred in his campaigns in [[Italy]]. Manfred appointed [[Philippe Chinard]] as the general-governor of his dominions in Albania. Initially based in Corfu, Chinard moved his headquarters to [[Kanin\u00eb Castle|Kanina]], the dominant center of the Vlor\u00eb region. There he married a relative of Michael II.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 205-206</ref>\n\n===Creation===\n[[File:Palazzo Reale di Napoli - Carlo I d'Angi\u00f2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of [[Charles I of Naples]] at the Royal Palace. Charles established ''Regnum Albaniae'' after he conquered part the [[Despotate of Epirus]].]]\nAfter defeating Manfred's forces in the [[Battle of Benevento]] in 1266, the [[Treaty of Viterbo]] of 1267 was signed, with [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] acquiring rights on Manfred's dominions in Albania,<ref name=\"Ducellier\">Ducellier (1999), p. 793</ref><ref>Nicol (2010), p. 12</ref> together with rights he gained in the Latin dominions in the Despotate of Epirus and in the Morea.<ref>Jacobi (1999), p. 533</ref> Upon hearing the news of Manfred's death in the battle of Benevento, Michael II conspired and managed to kill Manfred's governor Philippe Chinard, with the help of Chinard's wife, but he could not capture Manfred's domains. Local noblemen and commanders refused to surrender Manfred's domains in Albania to Michael II. They gave the same negative response to Charles' envoy, [[Gazo Chinard]] in 1267, when following the articles of the Treaty of Viterbo, he asked for them to surrender Manfred's dominions in Albania.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 206</ref>\n\nAfter the failure of the [[Eighth Crusade]], Charles of Anjou returned his attention to Albania. He began contacting local Albanian leaders through local catholic clergy. Two local Catholic priests, namely John from Durr\u00ebs and Nicola from Arbanon, acted as negotiators between Charles of Anjou and the local noblemen. During 1271 they made several trips between Albania and Italy eventually succeeding in their mission.<ref name=\"Anamali1\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 207</ref> On 21 February 1272,<ref name=\"Ducellier\" /> a delegation of Albanian noblemen and citizens from Durr\u00ebs made their way to Charles' court. Charles signed a treaty with them and was proclaimed King of Albania \"by common consent of the bishops, counts, barons, soldiers and citizens\" promising to protect them and to honor the privileges they had from Byzantine Empire.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 15</ref> The treaty declared the union between the Kingdom of Albania (Latin: ''Regnum Albanie'') with the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] under King Charles of Anjou (''Carolus I, dei gratia rex Siciliae et Albaniae'').<ref name=\"Anamali1\" /> He appointed [[Gazo Chinard]] as his Vicar-General and hoped to take up his expedition against Constantinople again. Throughout 1272 and 1273 he sent huge provisions to the towns of Durr\u00ebs and Vlor\u00eb. This alarmed the Byzantine Emperor, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], who began sending letters to local Albanian nobles, trying to convince them to stop their support for Charles of Anjou and to switch sides. The Albanian nobles sent those letter to Charles who praised them for their loyalty. Then, Michael VIII's hopes of stopping the advance of Charles were laid on the influence of [[Pope Gregory X]]. Gregory had high hopes of reconciling Europe, unifying the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin]] churches, and launching a new crusade: to that end, he announced the [[Second Council of Lyon|Council of Lyon]], to be held in 1274, and worked to arrange the election of an Emperor, so he ordered Charles to stop his operations.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 15-17</ref>\n\nCharles of Anjou imposed a military rule on Kingdom of Albania. The autonomy and privileges promised in the treaty were \"de facto\" abolished and new taxes were imposed. Lands were confiscated in favor of Anjou nobles and Albanian nobles were excluded from their governmental tasks. In an attempt to enforce his rule and local loyalty, Charles I, took as hostages the sons of local noblemen. This created a general discontent in the country and several Albanian noblemen began contacting Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII who promised them, to acknowledge their old privileges.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 208-210</ref>\n\n===Byzantine offensive===\nAs Charles I's intentions for a new offensive were stopped by the Pope and there was a general discontent within Albania, Michael VIII caught the occasion and began a campaign in Albania in late 1274. Byzantine forces helped by local Albanian noblemen captured the important city of [[Berat]] and later on [[Butrint]]. On November 1274, the local governor reported to Charles I that the Albanian and Byzantine forces had besieged Durr\u00ebs. The Byzantine offensive continued and captured the port-city of Spinarizza. Thus Durr\u00ebs alongside the Kruj\u00eb and Vlora regions became the only domains in mainland Albania which were still under Charles I's control, but they were landlocked and isolated from each other. They could communicate with each other only by sea but the Byzantine fleet based in Spinarizza and Butrint kept them under constant pressure. Charles also managed to keep the island of Corfu.<ref name=\"Anamali\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 201</ref><ref>Nicol (2010), p. 18</ref>\n\nMichael VIII also scored another important diplomatic victory on Charles I by agreeing to unite the two churches in the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1274. Enthusiastic from the results of the council, Pope Gregory X,  forbade any attempt by Charles on Michael VIII's forces. Under these circumstances Charles of Anjou was forced to sign a truce with Michael VIII in 1276.<ref name=\"Anamali\" />\n\n===Angevin counteroffensive===\n[[File:Berat Albania 15.jpg|thumb|The entrance of the citadel of Berat, with the 13th-century Byzantine church of the Holy Trinity.]]The Byzantine presence in Butrint alarmed [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]] the Despot of Epirus. He contacted Charles of Anjou and his vassal [[William II of Villehardouin]] who was at that time the [[Principality of Achaea|prince of Achaea]]. Nikephoros I promised to make an [[Homage (feudal)|oath of homage]] to Charles of Anjou in return for some land property in Achaia. In 1278 Nikephoros I's troops captured the city of Butrint. In March 1279 Nikephoros I declared himself a vassal of Charles of Anjou and surrendered to him the castles of Sopot and Butrint. As a pledge, Nikephoros I delivered his own son to the Angevin [[castellan]] of Vlor\u00eb to be held as hostage. Ambassadors were exchanged in this occasion, but Charles did not wait for the formalities to end; instead he ordered his captain and vicar-general at Corfu to capture not only Butrint, but everything that once belonged to Manfred and now were under the Despotate of Epirus.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 18-23</ref>\n\nAt the same time Charles began creating a network of alliances in the area in the brick of the new offensive, which would have pointed first to [[Thessalon\u00edki]] and later to [[Constantinople]]. He entered in alliance with the kings of Serbia and Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Nicol2\">Nicol (2010), p. 25</ref> He also tried to get the support of the local Albanian nobles. After continuous requests from other Albanian nobles, he liberated from Neapolitan prisons a number of Albanian nobles who were arrested before being accused of collaborating with Byzantine forces. Among them were [[Muzaka family|Gjin Muzaka]], Dhimit\u00ebr Zogu and Guljem Blinishti. Gjin Muzaka especially was important to Charles' plans because the Muzaka family territories were around city of Berat. They were liberated, but were ordered to send their sons as hostages in Naples.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 211</ref>\n[[File:PopeNicholasIIICameo.jpg|thumb|148x148px|Pope Nicholas III]]\nOn August 1279, Charles of Anjou appointed [[Hugo de Sully]] as ''Captain and Vicar-General of Albania, Durr\u00ebs, Vlor\u00eb, Sopot, Butrint and Corfu''. In the following months a great Angevin counteroffensive was prepared.<ref name=\"Nicol2\" /> A lot of materials and men including Saracen archers and siege engineers were sent to de Sully, who had captured Spinarizza from Byzantine forces making it his headquarters.<ref name=\"Setton\">Setton (1976), p. 136</ref> The first goal of the expedition was the recapture of the city of Berat, which had been under Byzantine control since 1274. However, Charles' preparations were restrained by [[Pope Nicholas III]] who had forbidden Charles from attacking the Byzantine Empire. However, Pope Nicholas III died on August 1280 and for more than six months the Pope's seat was vacant. This gave Charles an opportunity to move on. During Autumn 1280 he gave the order to Hugo de Sully to move on.<ref>Nicol (1992), p. 206</ref> In December 1280 Angevin forces captured the surroundings of Berat and [[Siege of Berat (1280\u20131281)|besieged its castle]].<ref name=\"Setton\" />\n\n===Byzantine counteroffensive===\n{{See also|Siege of Berat (1280-81)}}\n\nThe Byzantine Emperor was hoping for the Pope to stop his Latin adversaries. In fact after the death in 1276 of Pope Gregory X, the main supporter of the union of the churches, his successors maintained the same course and this restricted Charles' movements. However, in February 1281 Charles of Anjou achieved a diplomatic victory by imposing a [[Pope Martin IV|French Pope]], as the head of the Catholic Church. The Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII was excommunicated by the new Pope and Charles' expedition against him blessed as a new crusade.<ref name=\"Nicol2\" />\n[[File:Ardenica Monastery (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|The Ardenica monastery, built by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] in 1282 after his victory against the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Siege of Berat (1280\u20131281)|Siege of Berat]]]]\nThe situation was very complicated for Michael VIII; however, he sent help to the besieged garrison. The Byzantine army which also included Turkish mercenaries arrived near Berat in March 1281. They were under orders to avoid pitched battle and to focus on ambushes and raids.<ref name=\"Bartusis\">Bartusis (1997), p. 63</ref> They managed to defeat Angevin forces by capturing first their commander [[Hugo de Sully]] in an ambush. This spread panic throughout his army, routing them from the battlefield. The Angevin army lost the major part of its forces and only a small part found refuge in the Kanin\u00eb castle, which was in Angevin hands.<ref>Setton (1976), p. 137</ref> The Byzantine army continued its advance further into the territory. They besieged the Angevin bases of Vlor\u00eb, Kanin\u00eb, and Durr\u00ebs but could not capture them. The Albanian nobles in the region of Kruj\u00eb allied themselves with the Byzantine Emperor and he granted them a charter of privileges for their city and bishopric.<ref name=\"Nicol1\">Nicol (2010), p. 27</ref>\n\n===Charles' preparations and Sicilian Vespers===\n\n====Treaty of Orvieto====\n{{Main|Treaty of Orvieto}}\n\nThe failure of Hugo de Sully's expedition convinced Charles of Anjou that an invasion of the Byzantine Empire by land was not feasible,<ref name=\"Bartusis\" /> and he thus considered a naval expedition against Byzantium. He found an ally in [[Venice Republic|Venice]] and in July 1281, the [[Treaty of Orvieto]] formalized this collaboration. Its stated purpose was the dethronement of Michael VIII in favor of the titular Latin emperor [[Philip of Courtenay]] and the forcible establishment of the Union of the Churches, bringing the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] under the authority of the Pope. Its principal motivation, however, was to re-establish the Latin Empire, under Angevin domination, and to restore Venetian commercial privileges in Constantinople.<ref>Nicol (1992), p. 208-209</ref>\n[[File:Charles 2 of Naples.jpg|thumb|146x146px|[[Charles II of Naples]]]]\nUnder the terms of the treaty, Philip and Charles were to supply 8,000 troops and cavalry, and sufficient ships to transport them to Constantinople. Philip, the [[Doge of Venice]] [[Giovanni Dandolo]], and Charles himself or Charles' son, [[Charles II of Naples|Charles, Prince of Salerno]], were to personally accompany the expedition. In practice, Charles would have supplied almost all of the troops, Philip having little or no resources of his own. The Venetians would supply forty [[galley]]s as escorts for the invasion fleet, which was to sail from [[Brindisi]] no later than April 1283. Upon Philip's restoration to the throne, he was to confirm the concessions of the Treaty of Viterbo and the privileges granted to Venice at the [[Partitio Romaniae|founding]] of the Latin Empire, including recognition of the Doge as ''dominator'' of \"one-fourth and one-eighth of the Latin Empire.\"<ref name=\"Nicol3\">Nicol (1992), p. 208</ref>\n\nA second document was also drawn up to organize a [[Vanguard (military tactics)|vanguard]] to precede the main expedition of 1283. Charles and Philip were to supply fifteen ships and ten transports with about 300 men and horses. The Venetians were to provide fifteen warships for seven months of the year. These forces would make war against Michael VIII and \"other occupiers\" of the Latin Empire (presumably the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]), and would meet in [[Corfu]] by 1 May 1282, paving the way for the next year's invasion.<ref name=\"Nicol3\" />\n\nThe two treaties were signed by Charles and Philip on 3 July 1281, and were ratified by the Doge of Venice on 2 August 1281.<ref name=\"Nicol3\" />\n\n====Sicilian Vespers====\n{{Main|Sicilian Vespers}}\n[[File:Francesco Hayez 023.jpg|thumb|184x184px|[[Sicilian Vespers|Sicilian vespers]] (1846), by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]\nOn Easter Monday 30 March 1282, in Sicily the local people began attacking French forces in an uprising which would become known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. The massacre went on for weeks throughout the island and they also destroyed the Angevin fleet gathered in the harbor of [[Messina]] which Charles had intended to use in the new expedition against Byzantium. Charles tried to suppress the uprising, but on 30 of August 1282, [[Peter III of Aragon]] landed in Sicily, it was clear that Charles had no more chances of attacking Byzantium.<ref>Setton (1976), p. 140</ref> In September 1282, the Angevin house forever lost Sicily. His son [[Charles II of Naples]] was captured by the Aragonese army in the [[Battle of the Gulf of Naples]] and was still a prisoner when his father, Charles of Anjou, died on 7 January 1285. Upon his death Charles left all of his domains to his son, who at the time was held by the Catalans. He was kept as prisoner up to 1289, when he was finally released.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 33.</ref>\n\n===Restoration===\n\n====Loss of Durr\u00ebs====\nThe Angevin resistance continued for some years in Kanin\u00eb, Durr\u00ebs and Vlor\u00eb. However Durr\u00ebs fell in Byzantine hands in 1288 and in the same year Byzantine Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] renewed the privileges that his predecessor had granted to the Albanians in the Kruj\u00eb region.<ref name=\"Nicol1\" /> Kanin\u00eb castle was the last to fall to the Byzantines probably in 1294, while Corfu and Butrint remained in Angevin hands at least up to 1292.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 28</ref> In 1296 Serbian king [[Stephen Milutin]] took possession of Durr\u00ebs. In 1299 Andronikos II Palaiologos married his daughter [[Simonis Palaiologina|Simonis]] to  Milutin and the lands he had conquered were considered as a dowry gift.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 67-68</ref>\n\n====Recapture of Durr\u00ebs====\n[[File:Kingdom of Albania in 1368 AD.png|thumb|right|309x309px|Kingdom of Albania in 1368 AD before being captured by [[Karl Thopia]]. Even before the city of Durr\u00ebs was captured, it was landlocked by his principality. Declaring himself as Angevin descendant, with the capture of Durr\u00ebs in 1368 Karl Thopia created the [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Princedom of Albania]]]]\nAlthough the Albanian territories were lost, the notion and rights of the Kingdom of Albania continued for the Angevins for a long time after Charles of Anjou's death. The Kingdom was inherited by Charles II after the death of his father in 1285. In August 1294, Charles II passed his rights on Albania to his son [[Philip I, Prince of Taranto]]. In November 1294, Philip I was married to the daughter of the Epirote Despot Nikephoros I, renewing the old alliance between the two states.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 44-47</ref> His plans of recovering old Angevin domains were paused for a while when in 1299 Philip of Taranto became a prisoner of [[Frederick III of Sicily]] in the [[Battle of Falconaria]]. However, after his release in 1302, he claimed his rights on the Albanian kingdom and began preparations to recover it. He gained the support of local Albanian Catholics who preferred a Catholic Italian power as their protector instead of  the Orthodox Serbs and Greeks, as well as the support of [[Pope Benedict XI]]. In the summer of 1304, Serbs were expelled from the city of Durr\u00ebs by its citizens and local nobles, who in September submitted themselves to Angevin rule. Philip and his father Charles II renewed the old privileges that Charles of Anjou had promised to the citizens and nobility of Durr\u00ebs. In 1305, further extensive exemptions from dues and taxes were granted to the citizens of Durr\u00ebs and the local nobles from Charles II.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 68</ref>\n\nThe territory of the Kingdom of Albania under Philip of Taranto was restricted to roughly the modern [[Durr\u00ebs District]]. In an attempt to resolve the tensions between the house of Anjou and the Aragonese, the Kingdom of Albania and the lands in [[Principality of Achaea|Achaea]] under Angevin dominion were offered in exchange for the [[Kingdom of Trinacria]] ruled by [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick II]]. These negotiations lasted some years but were abandoned in 1316.<ref>Abulafia (1996), ''Intercultural contacts in the medieval Mediterranean'', pp.1-13</ref>\n\n===Duchy of Durazzo===\nUpon the death of Philip of Taranto in 1332, there were various claims on his domains within the Angevin family. The rights of the Duchy of Durazzo (Durr\u00ebs) and the Kingdom of Albania together were given to [[John of Gravina]] with a sum of 5,000&nbsp;pounds of gold.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 99</ref> After his death in 1336, his dominions in Albania passed to his son [[Charles, Duke of Durazzo]].\n\nDuring this period there were different Albanian noble families who began consolidating their power and domains. One of them was the [[Thopia family]] whose domains were in central Albania. The Serbs were pressing hard in their direction and the Albanian nobles found a natural ally in the Angevins.<ref name=\"Nicol\">Nicol (2010), p. 128</ref> Alliance with Albanian leaders was also crucial to the safety of the Kingdom of Albania, especially during the 1320s and 1330s. Most prominent among these leaders were the Thopias, ruling in an area between the rivers Mat and Shkumbin,<ref>Norris (1993), p.36</ref> and the [[Muzaka family]] in the territory between the rivers Shkumbin and Vlor\u00eb.<ref>Fine (1994), p. 290</ref> They saw the Angevins as protectors of their domains and made alliances. During 1336\u20131337 Charles had various successes against Serb forces in central Albania.<ref>Abulafia (1996), ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume VI: c. 1300-c. 1415'', p. 495</ref>\n\n====Last decades====\n[[File:Karl Topia, by Kostandin Shpataraku, Ardenica Monastery.png|thumb|[[Karl Topia]]|199x199px]]The pressure of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Kingdom]] on the Kingdom of Albania grew especially under the leadership of [[Stefan Du\u0161an]]. Although the fate of city of Durr\u00ebs, the capital of the Kingdom, is unknown, by 1346 all Albania was reported to be under the rule of Dushan.<ref name=\"Nicol\" /> In 1348, Charles, Duke of Durazzo, was decapitated by his cousin [[Philip II, Prince of Taranto]], who also inherited his rights on the Kingdom of Albania. Meanwhile, in Albania, after the death of Du\u0161an, his empire began to disintegrate and, in central Albania, the Thopia family under [[Karl Topia]], claimed rights to the Kingdom of Albania. In fact [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]] was married to  [[Helen of Anjou]] and Karl Topia was recognized as Count of Albania.<ref>Nicolle (1988), p.37</ref> Karl Thopia took Durr\u00ebs from the Angevins in 1368 with the consensus of its citizens. In 1376 [[Louis of \u00c9vreux, Duke of Durazzo]] who had gained the rights on the Albanian Kingdom from his second wife, attacked and conquered the city, but in 1383, Thopia took once again control of the city.<ref>Fine (1994), p. 384</ref>\n\nIn 1385 the city of Durr\u00ebs was captured by [[Bal\u0161a II]]. Topia called for [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] help and Bal\u0161a's forces were defeated in the [[Battle of Savra]]. Topia recaptured the city of Durr\u00ebs the same year and held it until his death in 1388. Afterwards, the city of Durr\u00ebs was inherited by his son [[Gjergj, Lord of Durr\u00ebs]]. In 1392 Gjergj surrendered the city of Durr\u00ebs and his domains to the Republic of Venice.<ref>O'Connell (2009), p.23</ref>\n\n==Government==\nThe kingdom of Albania was a distinct entity from the Kingdom of Naples. The kingdom had the nature of a military oriented political structure. It had its own structure and organs of government which was located in Durr\u00ebs.<ref name=\"Lala1\">Lala (2008), p.21</ref> At the head of this governmental body was the captain-general who had the status of a viceroy. These persons usually had the title of ''capitaneus et vicarius generalis'' and were the head of the army also, while the local forces were commanded by persons who held the title ''marescallus in partibus Albaniae''.<ref name=\"Lala1\" />\n\nThe royal resources, especially income from salt production and trade, were paid to the ''thesaurius'' of Albania. The port of Durr\u00ebs and sea trade were essential to the kingdom. The port was under the command of ''prothontius'' and the Albanian fleet had its own captain. Other offices were created and functioned under the authority of the viceroy.<ref name=\"Lala1\" />\n\nWith the attrition of the territory of the kingdom, the persons appointed as captain-generals began losing their powers, becoming more like governors of Durr\u00ebs, than representatives of the king.<ref name=\"Lala1\" />\n\nThe role of local Albanian lords became more and more important to the fate of the kingdom and the Angevins integrated them into their military structure especially in the second phase of the kingdom. When Philip of Taranto returned in 1304, one Albanian noble, [[Gulielm Blinishti]], was appointed head of Angevin army in the Kingdom of Albania with the title ''marascallum regnie Albaniae''.<ref>Lala (2008), p.138</ref> He was succeeded in 1318 by [[Muzaka family|Andrea I Muzaka]].<ref>Lala (2008), p.136.</ref> From 1304 on, other western titles of nobility were bestowed by the Angevins upon the local Albanian lords.<ref>Castellan (2002), p. 25</ref><ref>Pollo (1974), 54</ref>\n\nAlthough the Angevins tried to install a centralized state apparatus, they left great autonomy to the Albanians cities. In fact, in 1272 it was Charles of Anjou himself who recognized the old privileges of Durr\u00ebs' community.\n\n==Religion==\nHistorically the territory where the Kingdom of Albania lay was subject to different metropolitan powers such as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Antivari]], Durr\u00ebs, [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Ohrid]] and [[Nicopolis (titular see, Epirus)|Nicopolis]], where [[Catholicism]], [[Greek Orthodox|Greek]], [[Serbian Orthodox|Serbian]] and [[Bulgarian Orthodox|Bulgarian]] Churches applied their power interchangeably or sometimes even together. The presence of the kingdom reinforced the influence of Catholicism and the conversion to its rite, not only in the region of Durr\u00ebs but also in other parts of the country.<ref>Lala (2008), p.52</ref>\n\nThe Archbishopric of Durr\u00ebs was one of the primary bishoprics in Albania and before the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism (1054)]], it had 15 episcopal sees under its authority. After the split it remained under the authority of Eastern Church while there were continuous, but fruitless efforts from the Roman church to convert it to the Latin rite. However, things changed after the [[Fourth Crusade|fall of Byzantine Empire in 1204]]. In 1208, a Catholic archdeacon was elected for the archbishopric of Durr\u00ebs. After the reconquest of Durr\u00ebs by the Despotate of Epirus in 1214, the Latin Archbishop of Durr\u00ebs was replaced by an Orthodox archbishop. After his death in 1225, various nearby metropolitan powers fought over the vacant seat. At last a Nicean archbishop was appointed in 1256 but he could not effectively run its office since, in 1258, the city was captured by Manfred.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 54-55</ref>\n\nAfter the creation of Kingdom of Albania in 1272, a Catholic political structure was a good basis for the papal plans of spreading Catholicism in the Balkans. This plan found also the support of [[Helen of Anjou]], a spouse of King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]] and cousin of Charles of Anjou, as Queen consort of the Serbian Kingdom, who was at that time ruling territories in North Albania. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule in North Albania and in Serbia.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 91-95</ref> New bishoprics were created especially in North Albania, with the help of Helen of Anjou.<ref>Lala (2008) p. 155</ref>\n\nDurr\u00ebs became again a Catholic archbishopric in 1272. Other territories of the Kingdom of Albania became Catholic centers as well. Butrint in the south, although dependent on Corfu, became Catholic and remained as such during 14th century. The same happened to Vlor\u00eb and Kruj\u00eb as soon as the Kingdom of Albania was created.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 147-148</ref>\n\nA new wave of Catholic dioceses, churches and monasteries were founded, a number of different religious orders began spreading into the country, and papal missionaries also reached the territories of the Kingdom of Albania. Those who were not Catholic in Central and North Albania converted and a great number of Albanian clerics and monks were present in the Dalmatian Catholic institutions.<ref name=\"Lala\">Lala (2008), p. 146</ref>\n\nHowever, in Durr\u00ebs the Byzantine rite continued to exist for a while after Angevin conquest. This double-line of authority created some confusion in the local population and a contemporary visitor of the country described Albanians as ''nor they are entirely Catholic or entirely schismatic''. In order to fight this religious ambiguity, in 1304, [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were ordered by [[Pope Benedict XI]] to enter the country and to instruct the locals in the Latin rite. Dominican priests were also ordered as bishops in Vlor\u00eb and Butrint.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 149-153</ref>\n\nAmong the Catholic orders operating during that period in Albania, one could mention the [[Franciscan order]], [[Carmelites]], [[Cistercians]] and [[Premonstratensians]]. Also from time to time, the local bishops were appointed from different orders as different popes had their favorites among them.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 154</ref>\n\nKruj\u00eb became an important center for the spread of Catholicism. Its bishopric had been Catholic since 1167. It was under direct dependence from the pope and it was the pope himself who consecrated the bishop.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 157</ref> Local Albanian nobles maintained good relations with the Papacy. Its influence became so great, that it began to nominate local bishops.\n\nThe Catholic cause had a drawback while Stephan Dushan ruled in Albania. The Catholic rite was called ''Latin heresy'' and [[Du\u0161an's Code|Dushan's code]] contained harsh measures against them. However, the persecutions of local catholic Albanians did not begin in 1349 when the Code was promulgated, but much earlier, at least since the beginning of 14th century. Under these circumstances the relations between local Catholic Albanians and the papal curia became very close.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 118-119</ref>\n\nBetween 1350 and 1370, the spread of Catholicism in Albania reached its peak. At that period there were around seventeen Catholic bishoprics in the country, which acted not only as centers for Catholic reform within Albania, but also as centers for missionary activity in the neighboring areas, with the permission of the pope.<ref name=\"Lala\" />\n\n==Society==\nWhile the Byzantine [[Pronoia]] was the dominant form in the country, the Angevins introduced the [[Manorialism|Western type of feudalism]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries, pronoiars earned a great number of privileges and attributes, taking power away from the central authority. The benefit earned by the pronoiars from their land increased. Pronoiars began to collect land taxes for themselves which was an attribute of the state. They also began to exercise administrative authorities which replaced the state's, such as the ability to gather workers, guards, soldiers, and sometimes their own judges. In the 13th century, it was common for pronoiars to arrogate their own right to trial, initially for petty issues and then for serious crimes, taking away central authority from the main prerogatives to the practice of sovereignty.<ref name=\"Anamali220\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 220.</ref>\n\nBy the 14th century, the pronoia had reached the status of feudal possession. It could now be passed on to succession, split, and sold. The pronoia increasingly rarely fulfilled the military needs of the state.<ref name=\"Anamali220\"/> Alongside the pronoiars were landowners who owned large tracts of land worked by farmers. The landownership also included pronoiars from Durr\u00ebs, [[Shkod\u00ebr]], and [[Drisht]]. Citizens of Durr\u00ebs owned property and grazing land in the nearby mountain of Temali. The splitting, inheritance, and selling of the property was a common occurrence.<ref name=\"Anamali221\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 221.</ref>\n\nThe feudal possessions in Albania, as in the West and the Byzantine Empire, were made up of two parts: the land of the peasants and the land which was directly owned by the lords of the land. The peasant's land was not centralized, but was split into many small plots, often far from each other. The lord's land was continually expanded along the same lines that the aristocracy strengthened.<ref name=\"Anamali221\"/>\n\nLand was also centralized under religious institutions, including monasteries and bishoprics. Unlike the 12th century, where the area under control was donated by the central authority, after the 12th century, most donors of land to the monasteries and bishoprics were small and large landowners.<ref name=\"Anamali221\"/> By the beginning of the 14th century, monasteries and bishoprics had been able to collect large sums of land funds.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), pp. 221-222.</ref> The income of the monasteries came mainly from agricultural products, but a small part also came from craftwork and other activities. A central source of income to the church were from taxes gathered in kind and in cash. A good of portion went to Rome or Constantinople. The delivery of bonds was one of the causes of friction between the local clergy and the Pope in Rome or the Patriarch in Constantinople.<ref name=\"Anamali222\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 222.</ref>\n\nIn an effort to find additional means of finance, especially in times of war, the central authority imposed high taxes on the population. The pyramid of society depended upon the work of the farmers. Besides the main category of farmers, categories of farmers included \"free\" farmer and \"foreign\" farmers. They were deprived of land and any form of possession and were therefore not registered, placing them in a feud for the quality of wages. Eventually, they received a piece of land for which they paid their duties, and were fused with the main category of farmers.<ref name=\"Anamali222\"/>\n\nThe feudal duties of the peasant were not the same for all the Albanian areas but differed according to the terrain. The systems of payment in kind or in cash also changed accordingly, but the strengthening of the nobility against the central authority in the 13th century caused the payments in cash to increase compared to payments in kind. From the 12th to the 14th century, the vertical shift of power to the nobles was deepened. Not only were the plains brought under the control of the nobles, but also mountainous areas. The feudal possessions also began to include communal areas such as forests, pastures, and fisheries. This evolution took place during the period of Byzantine decline and saw the conversion of the pronoia into an estate very similar to the feudal one.<ref name=\"Anamali223\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 223.</ref>\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the population under the lords' rule was made up of agricultural workers. Contemporary sources reveal that in large parts of Albania, the village population had fallen to the status of serfdom. An anonymous traveler in 1308 revealed that farmers in the regions of [[K\u00eblcyr\u00eb]], Tomorric\u00eb, Stefaniak\u00eb, Kunav\u00eb, and Pult\u00eb of Dibra worked the lands and vineyards of their respective lords, turned over their products, and performed household work for them. The Byzantine historian [[Kantakouzenos]], testifies that the power of the lords of these areas depended mostly on livestock which were present in large numbers.<ref name=\"Anamali224\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 224.</ref>\n\n===Cities===\nDuring the 13th century, many cities in Albania made the move from being primarily military strongholds to becoming urban centers. Unable to contain the development inside the city walls, many cities expanded outside them. Quarters outside the walls began to form, called ''proastion'' and ''suburbium'' and became important economic centers. In these quarters, trade took place and shops along with workshops were centered here. Eventually, many of these quarters too were surrounded by walls to protect them. In order to secure a supply of water, cisterns in open, safe spaces were used to gather water. In some unique cases, water was also gathered from nearby rivers.<ref name=\"Anamali225\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 225.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 14th century, the population of the cities grew greatly. Durr\u00ebs is estimated to have had 25,000 inhabitants. The city became a center which attracted inhabitants from the rural areas.<ref name=\"Anamali225\"/> Durr\u00ebs is known to have had a large number of inhabitants who came from the surrounding villages. Those farmers who migrated to the city were often forced to pay a fixed payment or to make up for this payment by working in a commune. Along with the farmers came noblemen from the surrounding areas, who either migrated permanently or spent a large amount of time in the cities to look after their economic interests. Many had possessions, stores, and houses in the city. The movement of noblemen to urban areas became normal and they were eventually integrated into the city become citizens  and often taking government positions.<ref name=\"Anamali226\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 226.</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nThe spread of Catholicism affected the architecture of religious buildings, with a new [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, mainly in the Center and North Albania. These areas were attached to the Catholic church and thus had greater Western connections. Both the Catholic and Orthodox churches operated in Durr\u00ebs and the surrounding areas, and therefore both Western and Byzantine architectural styles were followed.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 314</ref> Western architecture could also be found in areas where Western rulers had possessions. Churches built in this form were built in Upper and Central Albania and were characterized by an emphasis on an East-West longitudinal axis with circular or rectangular [[apse]]s. Among the most notable architectural monuments of this period include the Church of [[Shirgj Monastery]] near the village of Shirgj near Shkod\u00ebr, the Church of Saint Mary in [[Vau i Dej\u00ebs]], and the Church of [[Rubik, Albania|Rubik]].<ref name=\"Anamali 315\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 315</ref> The former two churches were built in the 13th century AD while the latter in the 12th century AD. Most of the churches built in this period were decorated with murals.<ref name=\"Anamali 315\"/>\n\n==List of rulers==\n{{commons category}}\n\n===Kings of Albania===\n* [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I]] 1272\u20131285\n* [[Charles II of Naples|Charles II]] 1285\u20131294\n\nCharles surrendered his rights to Albania to his son Philip in 1294.

The Kingdom of Albania was declared in late February 1272. The kingdom extended from the region of Durazzo (Dyrrhachium, modern [[Durr\u00ebs]]) south along the coast to [[Butrint]]. A major attempt to advance further in direction of Constantinople failed at the [[Siege of Berat (1280\u20131281)]]. A Byzantine counteroffensive soon ensued, which drove the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] out of the interior by 1281. The [[Sicilian Vespers]] further weakened the position of Charles, and the Kingdom was soon reduced by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] to a small area around Durazzo. The Angevins held out here, however, until 1368, when the city was captured by [[Karl Thopia]]. In 1392 Karl Thopia's son surrendered the city and his domains to the [[Republic of Venice]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n [[File:ShepherdByzempire1265.jpg|thumb|left|Map depicting Southeastern Europe in 1265.]]During the conflict between the [[Despotate of Epirus]] and the [[Empire of Nicaea]] in 1253, lord [[Golem of Kruja]] was initially allied with Epirus. Golem's troops had occupied the [[Kostur]] area trying to prevent the Nicaean forces of [[John Vatatzes]] from entering [[Devol (Albania)|Devoll]]. Vatatzes managed to convince Golem to switch sides and a new treaty was signed between the parties where Vatatzes promised to guarantee Golem's autonomy. The same year Despot of Epirus [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas|Michael II]] signed a peace treaty with Nicaea acknowledging their authority over west Macedonia and Albania. The fortress of [[Kruj\u00eb]] was surrendered to Nicaea, while the Nicean emperor acknowledged the old privileges and also granted new ones. The same privileges were confirmed later by his successor [[Theodore II Laskaris]].<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 202</ref>\n\nThe Nicaeans took control of [[Durr\u00ebs]] from Michael II in 1256. During the winter of 1256\u201357, [[George Akropolites]] tried to reinstall Byzantine authority in the area of [[Principality of Albania|Arbanon]]. Autonomy was thus banished and a new administration was imposed. This was in contrast to what the Nicaeans had promised before. The local Albanian leaders revolted and on hearing the news, Michael II also denounced the peace treaty with the Nicaea. With the support of Albanian forces he attacked the cities of [[Dibra]], [[Ohrid]] and [[Prilep]]. In the meantime [[Manfred of Sicily]] profited from the situation and launched an invasion into Albania. His forces, led by Philip Chinard, captured Durr\u00ebs, [[Berat]], [[Vlor\u00eb]], Spinarizza and their surroundings and the southern coastline of Albania from Vlor\u00eb to [[Butrint]].<ref name=\"Setton1\">Setton (1976), p. 81</ref> Facing a war in two fronts, despot Michael II came to terms with Manfred and became his ally. He recognized Manfred's authority over the captured regions which were ceded as a dowry gift following the marriage of his daughter Helena to Manfred.<ref name=\"Setton1\" /><ref>Ducellier (1999), p. 791-792</ref>\n\nFollowing the defeat of Michael II's and Manfred's forces in the [[Battle of Pelagonia]], the new Nicaean forces continued their advance by capturing all of Manfred's domains in Albania, with the exception of Durr\u00ebs. However, in September 1261, Manfred organized a new expedition and managed to capture all his dominions in Albania and he kept them until his death in 1266.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 205</ref> Manfred respected the old autonomy and privileges of the local nobility and their regions. He also integrated Albanian nobles into his administration, as was the case with [[Andrea Vrana]] who was the general captain and governor of Durr\u00ebs and the neighboring region of Arbanon. Albanian troops were also used by Manfred in his campaigns in [[Italy]]. Manfred appointed [[Philippe Chinard]] as the general-governor of his dominions in Albania. Initially based in Corfu, Chinard moved his headquarters to [[Kanin\u00eb Castle|Kanina]], the dominant center of the Vlor\u00eb region. There he married a relative of Michael II.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 205-206</ref>\n\n===Creation===\n[[File:Palazzo Reale di Napoli - Carlo I d'Angi\u00f2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of [[Charles I of Naples]] at the Royal Palace. Charles established ''Regnum Albaniae'' after he conquered part the [[Despotate of Epirus]].]]\nAfter defeating Manfred's forces in the [[Battle of Benevento]] in 1266, the [[Treaty of Viterbo]] of 1267 was signed, with [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] acquiring rights on Manfred's dominions in Albania,<ref name=\"Ducellier\">Ducellier (1999), p. 793</ref><ref>Nicol (2010), p. 12</ref> together with rights he gained in the Latin dominions in the Despotate of Epirus and in the Morea.<ref>Jacobi (1999), p. 533</ref> Upon hearing the news of Manfred's death in the battle of Benevento, Michael II conspired and managed to kill Manfred's governor Philippe Chinard, with the help of Chinard's wife, but he could not capture Manfred's domains. Local noblemen and commanders refused to surrender Manfred's domains in Albania to Michael II. They gave the same negative response to Charles' envoy, [[Gazo Chinard]] in 1267, when following the articles of the Treaty of Viterbo, he asked for them to surrender Manfred's dominions in Albania.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 206</ref>\n\nAfter the failure of the [[Eighth Crusade]], Charles of Anjou returned his attention to Albania. He began contacting local Albanian leaders through local catholic clergy. Two local Catholic priests, namely John from Durr\u00ebs and Nicola from Arbanon, acted as negotiators between Charles of Anjou and the local noblemen. During 1271 they made several trips between Albania and Italy eventually succeeding in their mission.<ref name=\"Anamali1\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 207</ref> On 21 February 1272,<ref name=\"Ducellier\" /> a delegation of Albanian noblemen and citizens from Durr\u00ebs made their way to Charles' court. Charles signed a treaty with them and was proclaimed King of Albania \"by common consent of the bishops, counts, barons, soldiers and citizens\" promising to protect them and to honor the privileges they had from Byzantine Empire.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 15</ref> The treaty declared the union between the Kingdom of Albania (Latin: ''Regnum Albanie'') with the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] under King Charles of Anjou (''Carolus I, dei gratia rex Siciliae et Albaniae'').<ref name=\"Anamali1\" /> He appointed [[Gazo Chinard]] as his Vicar-General and hoped to take up his expedition against Constantinople again. Throughout 1272 and 1273 he sent huge provisions to the towns of Durr\u00ebs and Vlor\u00eb. This alarmed the Byzantine Emperor, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], who began sending letters to local Albanian nobles, trying to convince them to stop their support for Charles of Anjou and to switch sides. The Albanian nobles sent those letter to Charles who praised them for their loyalty. Then, Michael VIII's hopes of stopping the advance of Charles were laid on the influence of [[Pope Gregory X]]. Gregory had high hopes of reconciling Europe, unifying the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin]] churches, and launching a new crusade: to that end, he announced the [[Second Council of Lyon|Council of Lyon]], to be held in 1274, and worked to arrange the election of an Emperor, so he ordered Charles to stop his operations.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 15-17</ref>\n\nCharles of Anjou imposed a military rule on Kingdom of Albania. The autonomy and privileges promised in the treaty were \"de facto\" abolished and new taxes were imposed. Lands were confiscated in favor of Anjou nobles and Albanian nobles were excluded from their governmental tasks. In an attempt to enforce his rule and local loyalty, Charles I, took as hostages the sons of local noblemen. This created a general discontent in the country and several Albanian noblemen began contacting Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII who promised them, to acknowledge their old privileges.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 208-210</ref>\n\n===Byzantine offensive===\nAs Charles I's intentions for a new offensive were stopped by the Pope and there was a general discontent within Albania, Michael VIII caught the occasion and began a campaign in Albania in late 1274. Byzantine forces helped by local Albanian noblemen captured the important city of [[Berat]] and later on [[Butrint]]. On November 1274, the local governor reported to Charles I that the Albanian and Byzantine forces had besieged Durr\u00ebs. The Byzantine offensive continued and captured the port-city of Spinarizza. Thus Durr\u00ebs alongside the Kruj\u00eb and Vlora regions became the only domains in mainland Albania which were still under Charles I's control, but they were landlocked and isolated from each other. They could communicate with each other only by sea but the Byzantine fleet based in Spinarizza and Butrint kept them under constant pressure. Charles also managed to keep the island of Corfu.<ref name=\"Anamali\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 201</ref><ref>Nicol (2010), p. 18</ref>\n\nMichael VIII also scored another important diplomatic victory on Charles I by agreeing to unite the two churches in the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1274. Enthusiastic from the results of the council, Pope Gregory X,  forbade any attempt by Charles on Michael VIII's forces. Under these circumstances Charles of Anjou was forced to sign a truce with Michael VIII in 1276.<ref name=\"Anamali\" />\n\n===Angevin counteroffensive===\n[[File:Berat Albania 15.jpg|thumb|The entrance of the citadel of Berat, with the 13th-century Byzantine church of the Holy Trinity.]]The Byzantine presence in Butrint alarmed [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]] the Despot of Epirus. He contacted Charles of Anjou and his vassal [[William II of Villehardouin]] who was at that time the [[Principality of Achaea|prince of Achaea]]. Nikephoros I promised to make an [[Homage (feudal)|oath of homage]] to Charles of Anjou in return for some land property in Achaia. In 1278 Nikephoros I's troops captured the city of Butrint. In March 1279 Nikephoros I declared himself a vassal of Charles of Anjou and surrendered to him the castles of Sopot and Butrint. As a pledge, Nikephoros I delivered his own son to the Angevin [[castellan]] of Vlor\u00eb to be held as hostage. Ambassadors were exchanged in this occasion, but Charles did not wait for the formalities to end; instead he ordered his captain and vicar-general at Corfu to capture not only Butrint, but everything that once belonged to Manfred and now were under the Despotate of Epirus.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 18-23</ref>\n\nAt the same time Charles began creating a network of alliances in the area in the brick of the new offensive, which would have pointed first to [[Thessalon\u00edki]] and later to [[Constantinople]]. He entered in alliance with the kings of Serbia and Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Nicol2\">Nicol (2010), p. 25</ref> He also tried to get the support of the local Albanian nobles. After continuous requests from other Albanian nobles, he liberated from Neapolitan prisons a number of Albanian nobles who were arrested before being accused of collaborating with Byzantine forces. Among them were [[Muzaka family|Gjin Muzaka]], Dhimit\u00ebr Zogu and Guljem Blinishti. Gjin Muzaka especially was important to Charles' plans because the Muzaka family territories were around city of Berat. They were liberated, but were ordered to send their sons as hostages in Naples.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 211</ref>\n[[File:PopeNicholasIIICameo.jpg|thumb|148x148px|Pope Nicholas III]]\nOn August 1279, Charles of Anjou appointed [[Hugo de Sully]] as ''Captain and Vicar-General of Albania, Durr\u00ebs, Vlor\u00eb, Sopot, Butrint and Corfu''. In the following months a great Angevin counteroffensive was prepared.<ref name=\"Nicol2\" /> A lot of materials and men including Saracen archers and siege engineers were sent to de Sully, who had captured Spinarizza from Byzantine forces making it his headquarters.<ref name=\"Setton\">Setton (1976), p. 136</ref> The first goal of the expedition was the recapture of the city of Berat, which had been under Byzantine control since 1274. However, Charles' preparations were restrained by [[Pope Nicholas III]] who had forbidden Charles from attacking the Byzantine Empire. However, Pope Nicholas III died on August 1280 and for more than six months the Pope's seat was vacant. This gave Charles an opportunity to move on. During Autumn 1280 he gave the order to Hugo de Sully to move on.<ref>Nicol (1992), p. 206</ref> In December 1280 Angevin forces captured the surroundings of Berat and [[Siege of Berat (1280\u20131281)|besieged its castle]].<ref name=\"Setton\" />\n\n===Byzantine counteroffensive===\n{{See also|Siege of Berat (1280-81)}}\n\nThe Byzantine Emperor was hoping for the Pope to stop his Latin adversaries. In fact after the death in 1276 of Pope Gregory X, the main supporter of the union of the churches, his successors maintained the same course and this restricted Charles' movements. However, in February 1281 Charles of Anjou achieved a diplomatic victory by imposing a [[Pope Martin IV|French Pope]], as the head of the Catholic Church. The Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII was excommunicated by the new Pope and Charles' expedition against him blessed as a new crusade.<ref name=\"Nicol2\" />\n[[File:Ardenica Monastery (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|The Ardenica monastery, built by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] in 1282 after his victory against the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Siege of Berat (1280\u20131281)|Siege of Berat]]]]\nThe situation was very complicated for Michael VIII; however, he sent help to the besieged garrison. The Byzantine army which also included Turkish mercenaries arrived near Berat in March 1281. They were under orders to avoid pitched battle and to focus on ambushes and raids.<ref name=\"Bartusis\">Bartusis (1997), p. 63</ref> They managed to defeat Angevin forces by capturing first their commander [[Hugo de Sully]] in an ambush. This spread panic throughout his army, routing them from the battlefield. The Angevin army lost the major part of its forces and only a small part found refuge in the Kanin\u00eb castle, which was in Angevin hands.<ref>Setton (1976), p. 137</ref> The Byzantine army continued its advance further into the territory. They besieged the Angevin bases of Vlor\u00eb, Kanin\u00eb, and Durr\u00ebs but could not capture them. The Albanian nobles in the region of Kruj\u00eb allied themselves with the Byzantine Emperor and he granted them a charter of privileges for their city and bishopric.<ref name=\"Nicol1\">Nicol (2010), p. 27</ref>\n\n===Charles' preparations and Sicilian Vespers===\n\n====Treaty of Orvieto====\n{{Main|Treaty of Orvieto}}\n\nThe failure of Hugo de Sully's expedition convinced Charles of Anjou that an invasion of the Byzantine Empire by land was not feasible,<ref name=\"Bartusis\" /> and he thus considered a naval expedition against Byzantium. He found an ally in [[Venice Republic|Venice]] and in July 1281, the [[Treaty of Orvieto]] formalized this collaboration. Its stated purpose was the dethronement of Michael VIII in favor of the titular Latin emperor [[Philip of Courtenay]] and the forcible establishment of the Union of the Churches, bringing the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] under the authority of the Pope. Its principal motivation, however, was to re-establish the Latin Empire, under Angevin domination, and to restore Venetian commercial privileges in Constantinople.<ref>Nicol (1992), p. 208-209</ref>\n[[File:Charles 2 of Naples.jpg|thumb|146x146px|[[Charles II of Naples]]]]\nUnder the terms of the treaty, Philip and Charles were to supply 8,000 troops and cavalry, and sufficient ships to transport them to Constantinople. Philip, the [[Doge of Venice]] [[Giovanni Dandolo]], and Charles himself or Charles' son, [[Charles II of Naples|Charles, Prince of Salerno]], were to personally accompany the expedition. In practice, Charles would have supplied almost all of the troops, Philip having little or no resources of his own. The Venetians would supply forty [[galley]]s as escorts for the invasion fleet, which was to sail from [[Brindisi]] no later than April 1283. Upon Philip's restoration to the throne, he was to confirm the concessions of the Treaty of Viterbo and the privileges granted to Venice at the [[Partitio Romaniae|founding]] of the Latin Empire, including recognition of the Doge as ''dominator'' of \"one-fourth and one-eighth of the Latin Empire.\"<ref name=\"Nicol3\">Nicol (1992), p. 208</ref>\n\nA second document was also drawn up to organize a [[Vanguard (military tactics)|vanguard]] to precede the main expedition of 1283. Charles and Philip were to supply fifteen ships and ten transports with about 300 men and horses. The Venetians were to provide fifteen warships for seven months of the year. These forces would make war against Michael VIII and \"other occupiers\" of the Latin Empire (presumably the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]), and would meet in [[Corfu]] by 1 May 1282, paving the way for the next year's invasion.<ref name=\"Nicol3\" />\n\nThe two treaties were signed by Charles and Philip on 3 July 1281, and were ratified by the Doge of Venice on 2 August 1281.<ref name=\"Nicol3\" />\n\n====Sicilian Vespers====\n{{Main|Sicilian Vespers}}\n[[File:Francesco Hayez 023.jpg|thumb|184x184px|[[Sicilian Vespers|Sicilian vespers]] (1846), by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]\nOn Easter Monday 30 March 1282, in Sicily the local people began attacking French forces in an uprising which would become known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. The massacre went on for weeks throughout the island and they also destroyed the Angevin fleet gathered in the harbor of [[Messina]] which Charles had intended to use in the new expedition against Byzantium. Charles tried to suppress the uprising, but on 30 of August 1282, [[Peter III of Aragon]] landed in Sicily, it was clear that Charles had no more chances of attacking Byzantium.<ref>Setton (1976), p. 140</ref> In September 1282, the Angevin house forever lost Sicily. His son [[Charles II of Naples]] was captured by the Aragonese army in the [[Battle of the Gulf of Naples]] and was still a prisoner when his father, Charles of Anjou, died on 7 January 1285. Upon his death Charles left all of his domains to his son, who at the time was held by the Catalans. He was kept as prisoner up to 1289, when he was finally released.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 33.</ref>\n\n===Restoration===\n\n====Loss of Durr\u00ebs====\nThe Angevin resistance continued for some years in Kanin\u00eb, Durr\u00ebs and Vlor\u00eb. However Durr\u00ebs fell in Byzantine hands in 1288 and in the same year Byzantine Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] renewed the privileges that his predecessor had granted to the Albanians in the Kruj\u00eb region.<ref name=\"Nicol1\" /> Kanin\u00eb castle was the last to fall to the Byzantines probably in 1294, while Corfu and Butrint remained in Angevin hands at least up to 1292.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 28</ref> In 1296 Serbian king [[Stephen Milutin]] took possession of Durr\u00ebs. In 1299 Andronikos II Palaiologos married his daughter [[Simonis Palaiologina|Simonis]] to  Milutin and the lands he had conquered were considered as a dowry gift.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 67-68</ref>\n\n====Recapture of Durr\u00ebs====\n[[File:Kingdom of Albania in 1368 AD.png|thumb|right|309x309px|Kingdom of Albania in 1368 AD before being captured by [[Karl Thopia]]. Even before the city of Durr\u00ebs was captured, it was landlocked by his principality. Declaring himself as Angevin descendant, with the capture of Durr\u00ebs in 1368 Karl Thopia created the [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Princedom of Albania]]]]\nAlthough the Albanian territories were lost, the notion and rights of the Kingdom of Albania continued for the Angevins for a long time after Charles of Anjou's death. The Kingdom was inherited by Charles II after the death of his father in 1285. In August 1294, Charles II passed his rights on Albania to his son [[Philip I, Prince of Taranto]]. In November 1294, Philip I was married to the daughter of the Epirote Despot Nikephoros I, renewing the old alliance between the two states.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 44-47</ref> His plans of recovering old Angevin domains were paused for a while when in 1299 Philip of Taranto became a prisoner of [[Frederick III of Sicily]] in the [[Battle of Falconaria]]. However, after his release in 1302, he claimed his rights on the Albanian kingdom and began preparations to recover it. He gained the support of local Albanian Catholics who preferred a Catholic Italian power as their protector instead of  the Orthodox Serbs and Greeks, as well as the support of [[Pope Benedict XI]]. In the summer of 1304, Serbs were expelled from the city of Durr\u00ebs by its citizens and local nobles, who in September submitted themselves to Angevin rule. Philip and his father Charles II renewed the old privileges that Charles of Anjou had promised to the citizens and nobility of Durr\u00ebs. In 1305, further extensive exemptions from dues and taxes were granted to the citizens of Durr\u00ebs and the local nobles from Charles II.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 68</ref>\n\nThe territory of the Kingdom of Albania under Philip of Taranto was restricted to roughly the modern [[Durr\u00ebs District]]. In an attempt to resolve the tensions between the house of Anjou and the Aragonese, the Kingdom of Albania and the lands in [[Principality of Achaea|Achaea]] under Angevin dominion were offered in exchange for the [[Kingdom of Trinacria]] ruled by [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick II]]. These negotiations lasted some years but were abandoned in 1316.<ref>Abulafia (1996), ''Intercultural contacts in the medieval Mediterranean'', pp.1-13</ref>\n\n===Duchy of Durazzo===\nUpon the death of Philip of Taranto in 1332, there were various claims on his domains within the Angevin family. The rights of the Duchy of Durazzo (Durr\u00ebs) and the Kingdom of Albania together were given to [[John of Gravina]] with a sum of 5,000&nbsp;pounds of gold.<ref>Nicol (2010), p. 99</ref> After his death in 1336, his dominions in Albania passed to his son [[Charles, Duke of Durazzo]].\n\nDuring this period there were different Albanian noble families who began consolidating their power and domains. One of them was the [[Thopia family]] whose domains were in central Albania. The Serbs were pressing hard in their direction and the Albanian nobles found a natural ally in the Angevins.<ref name=\"Nicol\">Nicol (2010), p. 128</ref> Alliance with Albanian leaders was also crucial to the safety of the Kingdom of Albania, especially during the 1320s and 1330s. Most prominent among these leaders were the Thopias, ruling in an area between the rivers Mat and Shkumbin,<ref>Norris (1993), p.36</ref> and the [[Muzaka family]] in the territory between the rivers Shkumbin and Vlor\u00eb.<ref>Fine (1994), p. 290</ref> They saw the Angevins as protectors of their domains and made alliances. During 1336\u20131337 Charles had various successes against Serb forces in central Albania.<ref>Abulafia (1996), ''The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume VI: c. 1300-c. 1415'', p. 495</ref>\n\n====Last decades====\n[[File:Karl Topia, by Kostandin Shpataraku, Ardenica Monastery.png|thumb|[[Karl Topia]]|199x199px]]The pressure of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Kingdom]] on the Kingdom of Albania grew especially under the leadership of [[Stefan Du\u0161an]]. Although the fate of city of Durr\u00ebs, the capital of the Kingdom, is unknown, by 1346 all Albania was reported to be under the rule of Dushan.<ref name=\"Nicol\" /> In 1348, Charles, Duke of Durazzo, was decapitated by his cousin [[Philip II, Prince of Taranto]], who also inherited his rights on the Kingdom of Albania. Meanwhile, in Albania, after the death of Du\u0161an, his empire began to disintegrate and, in central Albania, the Thopia family under [[Karl Topia]], claimed rights to the Kingdom of Albania. In fact [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]] was married to  [[Helen of Anjou]] and Karl Topia was recognized as Count of Albania.<ref>Nicolle (1988), p.37</ref> Karl Thopia took Durr\u00ebs from the Angevins in 1368 with the consensus of its citizens. In 1376 [[Louis of \u00c9vreux, Duke of Durazzo]] who had gained the rights on the Albanian Kingdom from his second wife, attacked and conquered the city, but in 1383, Thopia took once again control of the city.<ref>Fine (1994), p. 384</ref>\n\nIn 1385 the city of Durr\u00ebs was captured by [[Bal\u0161a II]]. Topia called for [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] help and Bal\u0161a's forces were defeated in the [[Battle of Savra]]. Topia recaptured the city of Durr\u00ebs the same year and held it until his death in 1388. Afterwards, the city of Durr\u00ebs was inherited by his son [[Gjergj, Lord of Durr\u00ebs]]. In 1392 Gjergj surrendered the city of Durr\u00ebs and his domains to the Republic of Venice.<ref>O'Connell (2009), p.23</ref>\n\n==Government==\nThe kingdom of Albania was a distinct entity from the Kingdom of Naples. The kingdom had the nature of a military oriented political structure. It had its own structure and organs of government which was located in Durr\u00ebs.<ref name=\"Lala1\">Lala (2008), p.21</ref> At the head of this governmental body was the captain-general who had the status of a viceroy. These persons usually had the title of ''capitaneus et vicarius generalis'' and were the head of the army also, while the local forces were commanded by persons who held the title ''marescallus in partibus Albaniae''.<ref name=\"Lala1\" />\n\nThe royal resources, especially income from salt production and trade, were paid to the ''thesaurius'' of Albania. The port of Durr\u00ebs and sea trade were essential to the kingdom. The port was under the command of ''prothontius'' and the Albanian fleet had its own captain. Other offices were created and functioned under the authority of the viceroy.<ref name=\"Lala1\" />\n\nWith the attrition of the territory of the kingdom, the persons appointed as captain-generals began losing their powers, becoming more like governors of Durr\u00ebs, than representatives of the king.<ref name=\"Lala1\" />\n\nThe role of local Albanian lords became more and more important to the fate of the kingdom and the Angevins integrated them into their military structure especially in the second phase of the kingdom. When Philip of Taranto returned in 1304, one Albanian noble, [[Gulielm Blinishti]], was appointed head of Angevin army in the Kingdom of Albania with the title ''marascallum regnie Albaniae''.<ref>Lala (2008), p.138</ref> He was succeeded in 1318 by [[Muzaka family|Andrea I Muzaka]].<ref>Lala (2008), p.136.</ref> From 1304 on, other western titles of nobility were bestowed by the Angevins upon the local Albanian lords.<ref>Castellan (2002), p. 25</ref><ref>Pollo (1974), 54</ref>\n\nAlthough the Angevins tried to install a centralized state apparatus, they left great autonomy to the Albanians cities. In fact, in 1272 it was Charles of Anjou himself who recognized the old privileges of Durr\u00ebs' community.\n\n==Religion==\nHistorically the territory where the Kingdom of Albania lay was subject to different metropolitan powers such as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Antivari]], Durr\u00ebs, [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Ohrid]] and [[Nicopolis (titular see, Epirus)|Nicopolis]], where [[Catholicism]], [[Greek Orthodox|Greek]], [[Serbian Orthodox|Serbian]] and [[Bulgarian Orthodox|Bulgarian]] Churches applied their power interchangeably or sometimes even together. The presence of the kingdom reinforced the influence of Catholicism and the conversion to its rite, not only in the region of Durr\u00ebs but also in other parts of the country.<ref>Lala (2008), p.52</ref>\n\nThe Archbishopric of Durr\u00ebs was one of the primary bishoprics in Albania and before the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism (1054)]], it had 15 episcopal sees under its authority. After the split it remained under the authority of Eastern Church while there were continuous, but fruitless efforts from the Roman church to convert it to the Latin rite. However, things changed after the [[Fourth Crusade|fall of Byzantine Empire in 1204]]. In 1208, a Catholic archdeacon was elected for the archbishopric of Durr\u00ebs. After the reconquest of Durr\u00ebs by the Despotate of Epirus in 1214, the Latin Archbishop of Durr\u00ebs was replaced by an Orthodox archbishop. After his death in 1225, various nearby metropolitan powers fought over the vacant seat. At last a Nicean archbishop was appointed in 1256 but he could not effectively run its office since, in 1258, the city was captured by Manfred.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 54-55</ref>\n\nAfter the creation of Kingdom of Albania in 1272, a Catholic political structure was a good basis for the papal plans of spreading Catholicism in the Balkans. This plan found also the support of [[Helen of Anjou]], a spouse of King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]] and cousin of Charles of Anjou, as Queen consort of the Serbian Kingdom, who was at that time ruling territories in North Albania. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule in North Albania and in Serbia.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 91-95</ref> New bishoprics were created especially in North Albania, with the help of Helen of Anjou.<ref>Lala (2008) p. 155</ref>\n\nDurr\u00ebs became again a Catholic archbishopric in 1272. Other territories of the Kingdom of Albania became Catholic centers as well. Butrint in the south, although dependent on Corfu, became Catholic and remained as such during 14th century. The same happened to Vlor\u00eb and Kruj\u00eb as soon as the Kingdom of Albania was created.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 147-148</ref>\n\nA new wave of Catholic dioceses, churches and monasteries were founded, a number of different religious orders began spreading into the country, and papal missionaries also reached the territories of the Kingdom of Albania. Those who were not Catholic in Central and North Albania converted and a great number of Albanian clerics and monks were present in the Dalmatian Catholic institutions.<ref name=\"Lala\">Lala (2008), p. 146</ref>\n\nHowever, in Durr\u00ebs the Byzantine rite continued to exist for a while after Angevin conquest. This double-line of authority created some confusion in the local population and a contemporary visitor of the country described Albanians as ''nor they are entirely Catholic or entirely schismatic''. In order to fight this religious ambiguity, in 1304, [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were ordered by [[Pope Benedict XI]] to enter the country and to instruct the locals in the Latin rite. Dominican priests were also ordered as bishops in Vlor\u00eb and Butrint.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 149-153</ref>\n\nAmong the Catholic orders operating during that period in Albania, one could mention the [[Franciscan order]], [[Carmelites]], [[Cistercians]] and [[Premonstratensians]]. Also from time to time, the local bishops were appointed from different orders as different popes had their favorites among them.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 154</ref>\n\nKruj\u00eb became an important center for the spread of Catholicism. Its bishopric had been Catholic since 1167. It was under direct dependence from the pope and it was the pope himself who consecrated the bishop.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 157</ref> Local Albanian nobles maintained good relations with the Papacy. Its influence became so great, that it began to nominate local bishops.\n\nThe Catholic cause had a drawback while Stephan Dushan ruled in Albania. The Catholic rite was called ''Latin heresy'' and [[Du\u0161an's Code|Dushan's code]] contained harsh measures against them. However, the persecutions of local catholic Albanians did not begin in 1349 when the Code was promulgated, but much earlier, at least since the beginning of 14th century. Under these circumstances the relations between local Catholic Albanians and the papal curia became very close.<ref>Lala (2008), p. 118-119</ref>\n\nBetween 1350 and 1370, the spread of Catholicism in Albania reached its peak. At that period there were around seventeen Catholic bishoprics in the country, which acted not only as centers for Catholic reform within Albania, but also as centers for missionary activity in the neighboring areas, with the permission of the pope.<ref name=\"Lala\" />\n\n==Society==\nWhile the Byzantine [[Pronoia]] was the dominant form in the country, the Angevins introduced the [[Manorialism|Western type of feudalism]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries, pronoiars earned a great number of privileges and attributes, taking power away from the central authority. The benefit earned by the pronoiars from their land increased. Pronoiars began to collect land taxes for themselves which was an attribute of the state. They also began to exercise administrative authorities which replaced the state's, such as the ability to gather workers, guards, soldiers, and sometimes their own judges. In the 13th century, it was common for pronoiars to arrogate their own right to trial, initially for petty issues and then for serious crimes, taking away central authority from the main prerogatives to the practice of sovereignty.<ref name=\"Anamali220\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 220.</ref>\n\nBy the 14th century, the pronoia had reached the status of feudal possession. It could now be passed on to succession, split, and sold. The pronoia increasingly rarely fulfilled the military needs of the state.<ref name=\"Anamali220\"/> Alongside the pronoiars were landowners who owned large tracts of land worked by farmers. The landownership also included pronoiars from Durr\u00ebs, [[Shkod\u00ebr]], and [[Drisht]]. Citizens of Durr\u00ebs owned property and grazing land in the nearby mountain of Temali. The splitting, inheritance, and selling of the property was a common occurrence.<ref name=\"Anamali221\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 221.</ref>\n\nThe feudal possessions in Albania, as in the West and the Byzantine Empire, were made up of two parts: the land of the peasants and the land which was directly owned by the lords of the land. The peasant's land was not centralized, but was split into many small plots, often far from each other. The lord's land was continually expanded along the same lines that the aristocracy strengthened.<ref name=\"Anamali221\"/>\n\nLand was also centralized under religious institutions, including monasteries and bishoprics. Unlike the 12th century, where the area under control was donated by the central authority, after the 12th century, most donors of land to the monasteries and bishoprics were small and large landowners.<ref name=\"Anamali221\"/> By the beginning of the 14th century, monasteries and bishoprics had been able to collect large sums of land funds.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), pp. 221-222.</ref> The income of the monasteries came mainly from agricultural products, but a small part also came from craftwork and other activities. A central source of income to the church were from taxes gathered in kind and in cash. A good of portion went to Rome or Constantinople. The delivery of bonds was one of the causes of friction between the local clergy and the Pope in Rome or the Patriarch in Constantinople.<ref name=\"Anamali222\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 222.</ref>\n\nIn an effort to find additional means of finance, especially in times of war, the central authority imposed high taxes on the population. The pyramid of society depended upon the work of the farmers. Besides the main category of farmers, categories of farmers included \"free\" farmer and \"foreign\" farmers. They were deprived of land and any form of possession and were therefore not registered, placing them in a feud for the quality of wages. Eventually, they received a piece of land for which they paid their duties, and were fused with the main category of farmers.<ref name=\"Anamali222\"/>\n\nThe feudal duties of the peasant were not the same for all the Albanian areas but differed according to the terrain. The systems of payment in kind or in cash also changed accordingly, but the strengthening of the nobility against the central authority in the 13th century caused the payments in cash to increase compared to payments in kind. From the 12th to the 14th century, the vertical shift of power to the nobles was deepened. Not only were the plains brought under the control of the nobles, but also mountainous areas. The feudal possessions also began to include communal areas such as forests, pastures, and fisheries. This evolution took place during the period of Byzantine decline and saw the conversion of the pronoia into an estate very similar to the feudal one.<ref name=\"Anamali223\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 223.</ref>\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the population under the lords' rule was made up of agricultural workers. Contemporary sources reveal that in large parts of Albania, the village population had fallen to the status of serfdom. An anonymous traveler in 1308 revealed that farmers in the regions of [[K\u00eblcyr\u00eb]], Tomorric\u00eb, Stefaniak\u00eb, Kunav\u00eb, and Pult\u00eb of Dibra worked the lands and vineyards of their respective lords, turned over their products, and performed household work for them. The Byzantine historian [[Kantakouzenos]], testifies that the power of the lords of these areas depended mostly on livestock which were present in large numbers.<ref name=\"Anamali224\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 224.</ref>\n\n===Cities===\nDuring the 13th century, many cities in Albania made the move from being primarily military strongholds to becoming urban centers. Unable to contain the development inside the city walls, many cities expanded outside them. Quarters outside the walls began to form, called ''proastion'' and ''suburbium'' and became important economic centers. In these quarters, trade took place and shops along with workshops were centered here. Eventually, many of these quarters too were surrounded by walls to protect them. In order to secure a supply of water, cisterns in open, safe spaces were used to gather water. In some unique cases, water was also gathered from nearby rivers.<ref name=\"Anamali225\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 225.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 14th century, the population of the cities grew greatly. Durr\u00ebs is estimated to have had 25,000 inhabitants. The city became a center which attracted inhabitants from the rural areas.<ref name=\"Anamali225\"/> Durr\u00ebs is known to have had a large number of inhabitants who came from the surrounding villages. Those farmers who migrated to the city were often forced to pay a fixed payment or to make up for this payment by working in a commune. Along with the farmers came noblemen from the surrounding areas, who either migrated permanently or spent a large amount of time in the cities to look after their economic interests. Many had possessions, stores, and houses in the city. The movement of noblemen to urban areas became normal and they were eventually integrated into the city become citizens  and often taking government positions.<ref name=\"Anamali226\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 226.</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nThe spread of Catholicism affected the architecture of religious buildings, with a new [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, mainly in the Center and North Albania. These areas were attached to the Catholic church and thus had greater Western connections. Both the Catholic and Orthodox churches operated in Durr\u00ebs and the surrounding areas, and therefore both Western and Byzantine architectural styles were followed.<ref>Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 314</ref> Western architecture could also be found in areas where Western rulers had possessions. Churches built in this form were built in Upper and Central Albania and were characterized by an emphasis on an East-West longitudinal axis with circular or rectangular [[apse]]s. Among the most notable architectural monuments of this period include the Church of [[Shirgj Monastery]] near the village of Shirgj near Shkod\u00ebr, the Church of Saint Mary in [[Vau i Dej\u00ebs]], and the Church of [[Rubik, Albania|Rubik]].<ref name=\"Anamali 315\">Anamali & Prifti (2002), p. 315</ref> The former two churches were built in the 13th century AD while the latter in the 12th century AD. Most of the churches built in this period were decorated with murals.<ref name=\"Anamali 315\"/>\n\n==List of rulers==\n{{commons category}}\n\n===Kings of Albania===\n* [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I]] 1272\u20131285\n* [[Charles II of Naples|Charles II]] 1285\u20131294\n\nCharles surrendered his rights to Albania to his son Philip in 1294.

{"title_page": "History of Canada", "text_new": "{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{History of Canada sidebar}}\nThe '''history of Canada''' covers the period from the arrival of [[Paleo-Indians]] thousands of years ago to the present day. Prior to [[History of colonialism|European colonization]], the lands encompassing preseurgaynt-day [[Canada]] were inhabited for millennia by [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]], with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization. Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first [[European colonization of the Americas|European arrivals]] and have been discovered through [[List of archaeological periods (North America)|archeological]] investigations.\n\nStarting in the late 15th century, [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] and [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places within North America in what constitutes present-day Canada. The colony of [[New France]] was claimed in 1534 with permanent settlements beginning in 1608. France ceded nearly all its North American possessions to the United Kingdom in 1763 after the French defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The now British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] was divided into [[The Canadas|Upper and Lower Canada]] in 1791 and [[Act of Union 1840|reunified]] in 1841. In 1867, the [[Province of Canada]] was joined with two other British colonies of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], forming a self-governing entity named Canada. The new country [[Territorial evolution of Canada|expanded by incorporating other parts]] of [[British North America]], finishing with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1949.\n\nAlthough [[responsible government]] had existed in Canada since 1848, Britain continued to set its foreign and defence policies until the end of the [[First World War]]. The passing of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931 recognized that Canada had become co-equal with the United Kingdom. After the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] was [[Patriation|patriated]] in 1982'','' the final vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament were removed. Canada currently consists of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] and is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]].\n\nOver centuries, elements of Indigenous, French, British and more recent [[History of immigration to Canada|immigrant]] customs have combined to form a [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] that has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the [[History of the United States|United States]]. Since the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Canadians]] have supported multilateralism abroad and [[socioeconomic development]] domestically.\n\n==Pre-colonization==\n{{See also|Timeline of Canadian history|List of years in Canada}}\n\n===Indigenous peoples ===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Canada}}\n{{see|Technological and industrial history of Canada#The Stone Age: Fire (14,000 BC \u2013 AD 1600)}}\n[[File:Glacial lakes.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Lakes]] are estimated to have been formed at the end of the [[last glacial period]] (about 10,000 years ago), when the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] receded.]]\n[[List of archaeological periods (North America)|Archeological]] and [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous genetic]] evidence indicate that North and South America were the last continents into which [[early human migrations|humans migrated]].<ref name=\"Ph.D.2011\">{{cite book |first=David M. |last=Lawrence |title=Beringia and the Peopling of the New World |editor-first=Alfred J. |editor-last=Andrea Ph.D. |work=World History Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEqaIGsT8SsC&pg=PA99 |year=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-930-6 |page=99}}</ref> During the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], 50,000\u201317,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move gradually across the Bering land bridge ([[Beringia]]), from [[Siberia]] into northwest North America.<ref name=Goebel>{{cite journal |title=The Late Pleistocene Dispersal of Modern Humans in the Americas |first=Ted |last=Goebel |first2=Michael R. |last2=Waters |first3=Dennis H. |last3=O'Rourke |url=http://www.centerfirstamericans.com/cfsa-publications/Science2008.pdf  |year=2008 |doi=10.1126/science.1153569 |accessdate=February 5, 2010 |pmid=18339930 |volume=319 |issue=5869 |journal=Science |pages=1497\u2013502 |bibcode=2008Sci...319.1497G|citeseerx=10.1.1.398.9315 }}</ref> At that point, they were blocked by the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] that covered most of Canada, confining them to Alaska and the Yukon for thousands of years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Graeme |last=Wynn |title=Canada And Arctic North America: An Environmental History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxGFaFvo2oMC&pg=PA20 |year=2007 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-437-0 |page=20}}<br />{{cite book|author=Laurel Sefton MacDowell|title=An Environmental History of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM9TCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|year=2012|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2104-9|page=14}}<br />{{cite journal |author=Guy Gugliotta |title=When Did Humans Come to the Americas? |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-did-humans-come-to-the-americas-4209273/?all |journal=Smithsonian Magazine |date=February 2013 |access-date=June 25, 2015 }}</ref> The exact dates and routes of the peopling of the Americas are the subject of an ongoing debate.<ref name=\"Madsen2004\">{{cite book |first=Daryl W. |last=Fedje |display-authors=etal |title=Late Wisconsin Environments and Archaeological Visibility on the Northern Northwest Coast |editor-first=David B. |editor-last=Madsen |work=Entering America: Northeast Asia and Beringia Before the Last Glacial Maximum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2EVCRfBzAC&pg=PA125 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Utah Press |isbn=978-0-87480-786-8 |page=125}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction |work=Unearthing the Law: Archaeological Legislation on Lands in Canada |publisher=Parks Canada |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 9, 2010 |quote=Canada's oldest known home is a cave in Yukon occupied not 12,000 years ago as at U.S. sites, but at least 20,000 years ago |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103401/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |archivedate=April 24, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nBy 16,000 years ago the [[Last Glacial Maximum|glacial melt]] allowed people to move by land south and east out of Beringia, and into Canada.<ref>{{cite book |first=E.

The Progressives refused to join the government, but did help the Liberals defeat non-confidence motions. King faced a delicate balancing act of reducing tariffs enough to please the Prairie-based Progressives, but not too much to alienate his vital support in industrial Ontario and Quebec, which needed tariffs to compete with American imports. King and Conservative leader [[Arthur Meighen]] sparred constantly and bitterly in Commons debates.<ref>Dawson (1958) ch 14, 15</ref> The Progressives gradually weakened. Their effective and passionate leader, [[Thomas Crerar]], resigned to return to his grain business, and was replaced by the more placid [[Robert Forke]]. The socialist reformer [[J.&nbsp;S. Woodsworth]] gradually gained influence and power among the Progressives, and he reached an accommodation with King on policy matters.<ref>Bruce Hutchison, ''The Incredible Canadian'' (1952), pp. 76\u201378.</ref>\n\nIn 1926 Prime Minister Mackenzie King advised the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], [[Julian H.G.

Wages fell as did prices. Worst hit were areas dependent on primary industries such as farming, mining and logging, as prices fell and there were few alternative jobs. Most families had moderate losses and little hardship, though they too became pessimistic and their debts became heavier as prices fell.

He says the:\n:interpretive schemes that dominated Canadian historical writing through the middle decades of the twentieth century were built on the assumption that history had a discernible direction and flow. Canada was moving towards a goal in the nineteenth century; whether this endpoint was the construction of a transcontinental, commercial, and political union, the development of parliamentary government, or the preservation and resurrection of French Canada, it was certainly a Good Thing. Thus the rebels of 1837 were quite literally on the wrong track. They lost because they ''had'' to lose; they were not simply overwhelmed by superior force, they were justly chastised by the God of History.<ref>Allan Greer, \"1837\u201338: Rebellion reconsidered\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' (1995) 76#1 pp 1\u201318, quotation on page 3.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Canada provinces map|border=none|align=right|prefix =History of|the=the|map=Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|caption=History by province or territory}}\n*{{Portal-inline|Canada}}\n* ''[[Canada's Story]]''\n* [[Events of National Historic Significance (Canada)]]\n* [[Heritage Minutes]]\n* [[Historiography of Canada]]\n* [[History of Canadian women]]\n* [[History of Canadian sports]]\n* [[History of Education in Canada]]\n* [[History Trek]], Canadian History web portal designed for children\n* [[National Historic Sites of Canada]]\n* [[Persons of National Historic Significance]]\n{{Clear right}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{main|Bibliography of Canadian history}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* For an annotated bibliography and evaluation of major books, see  ''Canada: A Reader\u2019s Guide,'' (2nd ed., 2000) by J.

Prior to [[History of colonialism|European colonization]], the lands encompassing present-day [[Canada]] were inhabited for millennia by [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]], with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization. Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first [[European colonization of the Americas|European arrivals]] and have been discovered through [[List of archaeological periods (North America)|archeological]] investigations.\n\nStarting in the late 15th century, [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] and [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places within North America in what constitutes present-day Canada. The colony of [[New France]] was claimed in 1534 with permanent settlements beginning in 1608. France ceded nearly all its North American possessions to the United Kingdom in 1763 after the French defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The now British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] was divided into [[The Canadas|Upper and Lower Canada]] in 1791 and [[Act of Union 1840|reunified]] in 1841. In 1867, the [[Province of Canada]] was joined with two other British colonies of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], forming a self-governing entity named Canada. The new country [[Territorial evolution of Canada|expanded by incorporating other parts]] of [[British North America]], finishing with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1949.\n\nAlthough [[responsible government]] had existed in Canada since 1848, Britain continued to set its foreign and defence policies until the end of the [[First World War]]. The passing of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931 recognized that Canada had become co-equal with the United Kingdom. After the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] was [[Patriation|patriated]] in 1982'','' the final vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament were removed. Canada currently consists of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] and is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]].\n\nOver centuries, elements of Indigenous, French, British and more recent [[History of immigration to Canada|immigrant]] customs have combined to form a [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] that has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the [[History of the United States|United States]]. Since the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Canadians]] have supported multilateralism abroad and [[socioeconomic development]] domestically.\n\n==Pre-colonization==\n{{See also|Timeline of Canadian history|List of years in Canada}}\n\n===Indigenous peoples ===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Canada}}\n{{see|Technological and industrial history of Canada#The Stone Age: Fire (14,000 BC \u2013 AD 1600)}}\n[[File:Glacial lakes.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Lakes]] are estimated to have been formed at the end of the [[last glacial period]] (about 10,000 years ago), when the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] receded.]]\n[[List of archaeological periods (North America)|Archeological]] and [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous genetic]] evidence indicate that North and South America were the last continents into which [[early human migrations|humans migrated]].<ref name=\"Ph.D.2011\">{{cite book |first=David M. |last=Lawrence |title=Beringia and the Peopling of the New World |editor-first=Alfred J. |editor-last=Andrea Ph.D. |work=World History Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEqaIGsT8SsC&pg=PA99 |year=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-930-6 |page=99}}</ref> During the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], 50,000\u201317,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move gradually across the Bering land bridge ([[Beringia]]), from [[Siberia]] into northwest North America.<ref name=Goebel>{{cite journal |title=The Late Pleistocene Dispersal of Modern Humans in the Americas |first=Ted |last=Goebel |first2=Michael R. |last2=Waters |first3=Dennis H. |last3=O'Rourke |url=http://www.centerfirstamericans.com/cfsa-publications/Science2008.pdf  |year=2008 |doi=10.1126/science.1153569 |accessdate=February 5, 2010 |pmid=18339930 |volume=319 |issue=5869 |journal=Science |pages=1497\u2013502 |bibcode=2008Sci...319.1497G|citeseerx=10.1.1.398.9315 }}</ref> At that point, they were blocked by the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] that covered most of Canada, confining them to Alaska and the Yukon for thousands of years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Graeme |last=Wynn |title=Canada And Arctic North America: An Environmental History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxGFaFvo2oMC&pg=PA20 |year=2007 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-437-0 |page=20}}<br />{{cite book|author=Laurel Sefton MacDowell|title=An Environmental History of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM9TCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|year=2012|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2104-9|page=14}}<br />{{cite journal |author=Guy Gugliotta |title=When Did Humans Come to the Americas? |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-did-humans-come-to-the-americas-4209273/?all |journal=Smithsonian Magazine |date=February 2013 |access-date=June 25, 2015 }}</ref> The exact dates and routes of the peopling of the Americas are the subject of an ongoing debate.<ref name=\"Madsen2004\">{{cite book |first=Daryl W. |last=Fedje |display-authors=etal |title=Late Wisconsin Environments and Archaeological Visibility on the Northern Northwest Coast |editor-first=David B. |editor-last=Madsen |work=Entering America: Northeast Asia and Beringia Before the Last Glacial Maximum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2EVCRfBzAC&pg=PA125 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Utah Press |isbn=978-0-87480-786-8 |page=125}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction |work=Unearthing the Law: Archaeological Legislation on Lands in Canada |publisher=Parks Canada |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 9, 2010 |quote=Canada's oldest known home is a cave in Yukon occupied not 12,000 years ago as at U.S. sites, but at least 20,000 years ago |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103401/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |archivedate=April 24, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nBy 16,000 years ago the [[Last Glacial Maximum|glacial melt]] allowed people to move by land south and east out of Beringia, and into Canada.<ref>{{cite book |first=E.

He contracted [[smallpox]] in 1863 during a 1863 to 1864 epidemic in Washington, D.C. \n\nThroughout his life he experienced periods of [[depression (mood)|depression]], which could be genetic, due to life experiences or trauma, or both. Lincoln took [[blue mass]] pills, which contained [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Based on his behavior and physical condition while taking the pills and after he quit taking them, Lincoln may have suffered from [[mercury poisoning]].

His hands trembled when he was under stress. Taking the medicine made Lincoln feel \"cross\".

When he stopped taking the medicine, and during a period of profound personal and professional stress, he \"behaves like a saint\".<ref name=\"Blue pills - poisoning\" />{{efn|In 1865, speaking with the Washington correspondent of the ''[[Pittsburgh Chronicle]]'', Mrs. Lincoln described an instance in which her husband's \"usual medicine,\" the mercury-based blue pills made him terribly ill prior to his [[Second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|second inauguration]]. He was very pale, anxious, and bedridden for days.<ref name=\"CDNC\" /> The correspondent recorded the interview as follows: Mrs. Lincoln \"recalled the fact that her husband had been very ill, for several days, from the effects of a dose of blue pills taken shortly before his second inauguration.\" She said he was not well, and appearing to require his usual medicine, blue pills, she sent to the drug store in which Harrold was employed last and got a dose and gave them to him at night before going to bed, and that next morning his pallor terrified her. 'His face,' said she, pointing to the bed beside which she sat, 'was white as that pillow-case, as it lay just there,' she exclaimed, laying her hand on the pillow\u2014'white, and such a deadly white; as he tried to rise he sank back again quite overcome!' She described his anxiety to be up, there was so much to do, and her persistence and his oppressive languor in keeping him in bed for several days; said he and she both thought it so strange that the pills should affect him in that way; they had never done so before, and both concluded they would get no more medicine there, as the attendant evidently did not understand making up prescriptions.\"<ref name=\"CDNC\">California Digital Newspaper Collection \u2013 Late Atlantic Intelligence, Sacramento Daily Union, Volume 29, Number 4497, 21 August 1865</ref>}} Lincoln may also had long-term effects as the result of mercury poisoning, such as nerve damage that affected his gait.<ref name=\"Blue pills - poisoning\" />\n\nShortly after his 1861 inauguration, Lincoln had a sudden and disquieting outburst of rage during a White House conversation.

She described his anxiety to be up, there was so much to do, and her persistence and his oppressive languor in keeping him in bed for several days; said he and she both thought it so strange that the pills should affect him in that way; they had never done so before, and both concluded they would get no more medicine there, as the attendant evidently did not understand making up prescriptions.\"<ref name=\"CDNC\">California Digital Newspaper Collection \u2013 Late Atlantic Intelligence, Sacramento Daily Union, Volume 29, Number 4497, 21 August 1865</ref>}} Lincoln may also had long-term effects as the result of mercury poisoning, such as nerve damage that affected his gait.<ref name=\"Blue pills - poisoning\" />\n\nShortly after his 1861 inauguration, Lincoln had a sudden and disquieting outburst of rage during a White House conversation. Finding that the blue mass pills made him \"cross\", Lincoln stopped taking them about August 1861 (5 months after his March inauguration).

My son was hired two months ago by WWE creative, and will begin working with the company in January. He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day. He will be working long hours, in a thankless, difficult job, for entry level money \u2013 the way it should be. There has also been talk of my daughter joining WWE as a backstage interviewer. I certainly hope that turns out to be the case \u2013 but as of now, as far as I know, it's just talk.|url=https://www.facebook.com/RealMickFoley/posts/1186283561401780:0|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Foley, Dewey|Dewey Foley}}\n|Creative assistant\n|-\n|{{sort|Koskey, Ed|Ed Koskey}}<ref name=\"report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/42333-report-news-and-notes-on-changes-within-wwe-creative/|title=Report: News and notes on changes within WWE creative|last=Martin | first=Adam|date=2013-06-30|accessdate=2016-10-28|publisher=WrestleView}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Koskey, Edward|Edward Koskey}}\n|Lead writer for ''[[SmackDown]]''<ref name=\"pwinsider.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=129307|title=WWE WRITING SHUFFLE &#124; PWInsider.com|website=www.pwinsider.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sort|Baeckstrom, Jonathan|Jonathan Baeckstrom}}\n|{{sort|Baeckstrom, Jonathan|Jonathan Baeckstrom}}\n|Lead writer for ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''<ref name=\"pwinsider.com\"/>\n|-\n|{{sort|Belcastro, Joseph|Joseph Belcastro}}\n|{{sort|Belcastro, Joseph|Joseph Belcastro}}\n|Lead writer for ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]''<br>Promo trainer<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.solowrestling.com/new/66136-sawyer-fulton--en-exclusiva-estoy-seguro-de-que-wwe-tenia-cero-planes-para-mi-despues-de-la-lesion|title=Sawyer Fulton, en exclusiva: 'Estoy seguro de que WWE ten\u00eda cero planes para m\u00ed despu\u00e9s de la lesi\u00f3n'|last=[[SoloWrestling]]|date=November 28, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 28, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sortname|Ranjin|Singh|dab=wrestling}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/ranjinsingh|title=Ranjin Singh|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Kapoor, David|David Kapoor}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/2009/10/06/ranjin-singh/|title=Ranjin Singh|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2016-12-23|date=October 6, 2009}}</ref>\n|Senior VP of Creative<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailysmark.com/podcast/ZAgH0W-episode-90-kaz-byke|title=Episode 90: Kaz Byke|website=The Daily Smark|accessdate=March 27, 2019}}</ref><!-- Podcast with former writer Kazeem Famuyide -->\n|-\n|{{sort|Ward, Ryan|Ryan Ward}}<ref name=\"report\"/>\n|{{sort|Ward, Ryan|Ryan Ward}}\n|Writer for ''[[SmackDown]]''<br>Inactive<ref name=\"pwinsider.com\"/>\n|}\n\n===Music department===\n{{See also|WWE Music Group}}<!--This list should be followed according to wwe.com-->\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:65%;\"\n|-\n!width=15%|Name\n!width=25%|Notes\n|-\n|{{sort|Lawi, Neil|Neil Lawi}}<ref>{{cite web |title=WWE Launches The WWE Music Group, Neil Lawi Named General Manager |url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/company-news/2006/03-27-2006c |website=www.corporate.wwe.com |accessdate=10 August 2018 }}</ref>\n|Senior VP/GM of [[WWE Music Group]]\n|-\n|{{sort|Williams, Josiah|Josiah Williams}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wrestle-and-flow-josiah-williams-joins-wwe-universe|title=Wrestle and Flow's Josiah Williams joins WWE|author=WWE.com Staff|publisher=WWE.com|date=2019-04-06|accessdate=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n|On-Air Digital Talent\n|}\n\n===Producers===\n[[File:Michael PS Hayes.png|thumb|175px|[[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]]]]<!--This list should be followed according to wwe.com-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:65%;\"\n|-\n!width=19%|Ring name\n!width=19%|Real name\n!width=27%|Notes\n|-\n|{{sortname|Adam|Pearce}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/adam-pearce-road-wwe|title=How Adam Pearce became a coach at the WWE Performance Center|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Pearce, Adam|Adam Pearce}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/93838/samoa-joenxt-thoughts-another-new-wwe-signing-taz-lana-owens-vs-cena-and-much-more.html?p=1|title=SAMOA JOE-NXT THOUGHTS, ANOTHER NEW WWE SIGNING, TAZ, LANA, OWENS VS.

He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day. He will be working long hours, in a thankless, difficult job, for entry level money \u2013 the way it should be. There has also been talk of my daughter joining WWE as a backstage interviewer. I certainly hope that turns out to be the case \u2013 but as of now, as far as I know, it's just talk.|url=https://www.facebook.com/RealMickFoley/posts/1186283561401780:0|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Foley, Dewey|Dewey Foley}}\n|Creative assistant\n|-\n|{{sort|Koskey, Ed|Ed Koskey}}<ref name=\"report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/42333-report-news-and-notes-on-changes-within-wwe-creative/|title=Report: News and notes on changes within WWE creative|last=Martin | first=Adam|date=2013-06-30|accessdate=2016-10-28|publisher=WrestleView}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Koskey, Edward|Edward Koskey}}\n|Lead writer for ''[[SmackDown]]''<ref name=\"pwinsider.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=129307|title=WWE WRITING SHUFFLE &#124; PWInsider.com|website=www.pwinsider.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sort|Baeckstrom, Jonathan|Jonathan Baeckstrom}}\n|{{sort|Baeckstrom, Jonathan|Jonathan Baeckstrom}}\n|Lead writer for ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''<ref name=\"pwinsider.com\"/>\n|-\n|{{sort|Belcastro, Joseph|Joseph Belcastro}}\n|{{sort|Belcastro, Joseph|Joseph Belcastro}}\n|Lead writer for ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]''<br>Promo trainer<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.solowrestling.com/new/66136-sawyer-fulton--en-exclusiva-estoy-seguro-de-que-wwe-tenia-cero-planes-para-mi-despues-de-la-lesion|title=Sawyer Fulton, en exclusiva: 'Estoy seguro de que WWE ten\u00eda cero planes para m\u00ed despu\u00e9s de la lesi\u00f3n'|last=[[SoloWrestling]]|date=November 28, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 28, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{sortname|Ranjin|Singh|dab=wrestling}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/ranjinsingh|title=Ranjin Singh|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Kapoor, David|David Kapoor}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/2009/10/06/ranjin-singh/|title=Ranjin Singh|publisher=Gerweck.net|accessdate=2016-12-23|date=October 6, 2009}}</ref>\n|Senior VP of Creative<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailysmark.com/podcast/ZAgH0W-episode-90-kaz-byke|title=Episode 90: Kaz Byke|website=The Daily Smark|accessdate=March 27, 2019}}</ref><!-- Podcast with former writer Kazeem Famuyide -->\n|-\n|{{sort|Ward, Ryan|Ryan Ward}}<ref name=\"report\"/>\n|{{sort|Ward, Ryan|Ryan Ward}}\n|Writer for ''[[SmackDown]]''<br>Inactive<ref name=\"pwinsider.com\"/>\n|}\n\n===Music department===\n{{See also|WWE Music Group}}<!--This list should be followed according to wwe.com-->\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:65%;\"\n|-\n!width=15%|Name\n!width=25%|Notes\n|-\n|{{sort|Lawi, Neil|Neil Lawi}}<ref>{{cite web |title=WWE Launches The WWE Music Group, Neil Lawi Named General Manager |url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/company-news/2006/03-27-2006c |website=www.corporate.wwe.com |accessdate=10 August 2018 }}</ref>\n|Senior VP/GM of [[WWE Music Group]]\n|-\n|{{sort|Williams, Josiah|Josiah Williams}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wrestle-and-flow-josiah-williams-joins-wwe-universe|title=Wrestle and Flow's Josiah Williams joins WWE|author=WWE.com Staff|publisher=WWE.com|date=2019-04-06|accessdate=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n|On-Air Digital Talent\n|}\n\n===Producers===\n[[File:Michael PS Hayes.png|thumb|175px|[[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]]]]<!--This list should be followed according to wwe.com-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:65%;\"\n|-\n!width=19%|Ring name\n!width=19%|Real name\n!width=27%|Notes\n|-\n|{{sortname|Adam|Pearce}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/adam-pearce-road-wwe|title=How Adam Pearce became a coach at the WWE Performance Center|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}</ref>\n|{{sort|Pearce, Adam|Adam Pearce}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/93838/samoa-joenxt-thoughts-another-new-wwe-signing-taz-lana-owens-vs-cena-and-much-more.html?p=1|title=SAMOA JOE-NXT THOUGHTS, ANOTHER NEW WWE SIGNING, TAZ, LANA, OWENS VS.
