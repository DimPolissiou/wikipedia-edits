Before the start of the [[2006-07 ECHL season|2006-07 season]], Salmon Kings' Vice President of Hockey Operations and General Manager, [[Dan Belisle]] signed an affiliation agreement with the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and it's [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate, the [[Manitoba Moose]] on July 18, 2006.  Through the affiliation agreement, the Canucks assigned goaltender [[Julien Ellis]]; forwards [[Marc Andre-Bernier]], [[F.P. Guenette]] and defenseman [[Patrick Coulombe]], while the Moose assigned defensemen [[Matt Kelly (ice hockey)|Matt Kelly]] and forward [[Shaun Heshka]]. Along with this move, Dan Belisle also signed [[Wes Goldie]], [[Milan Gajic]], [[Kiel McLeod]] and [[Mike Stutzel]] to ECHL contracts to play for the Salmon Kings.  Through these moves the Salmon Kings hoped to become a powerhouse in its third season.  However, under their new head coach [[Tony MacAuley]], the team struggled through the first half of the season, which caused Belisle to fire MacAuley, after three months behind the bench.  Dan Belisle would then hire assistant coach [[Mark Morrison (ice hockey b. 1963)|Mark Morrison]] to become the fourth head coach in Salmon Kings' history.  Belisle's other mid-season move included a big trade with the [[Pensacola Ice Pilots]], and traded [[Adam Taylor]], and David Wrigley, for [[Jordan Krestanovich]] and his brother, [[Derek Krestanovich]].  Through these mid-season moves, the Salmon Kings started to respond going on a late season run and finished their remaining regular season games on a nine-game winning streak.  With the nine-game winning streak, the Salmon Kings completed their season with a 36-32-1-3 record and finished 7th overall in the National Conference to play against the [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]] in their first playoff appearance. The Salmon Kings would eventually win Game 1 by a score of 3-2, but the Aces managed to win their next 4 out of 5 games to win the series 4-2. One of the season highlights for the Salmon Kings, was forward Wes Goldie who led the team and the National Conference with 41 goals.\n\n==Standings==\n\n===Division standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30%\" | West Division\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GP\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | W\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | L\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | OTL\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | SOL\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pts\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GF\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GA\n|-\n|align=left| [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]] ([[St. Louis Blues|STL]]) ||72||49||16|| 3|| 4||'''105'''||270||176\n|-\n|align=left| [[Idaho Steelheads]] ([[Dallas Stars|DAL]]) ||72||42||24|| 2|| 4||'''90'''||240||208\n|-bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n|align=left| [[Victoria Salmon Kings]] ([[Vancouver Canucks|VAN]]) ||72||36||32|| 1|| 3|| '''76'''||239||249\n|-\n|align=left| [[Phoenix RoadRunners]] ([[Phoenix Coyotes|PHX]]) ||72||27||40|| 2|| 3||'''59'''||201||255\n|-\n|align=left| [[Utah Grizzlies]] (Independent) ||72||22||42|| 4|| 4||'''52'''||184||294\n|}\n\n===Conference standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"40%\" | National Conference\n! width=\"5%\" | GP\n! width=\"5%\" | W\n! width=\"5%\" | L\n! width=\"5%\" | OTL\n! width=\"5%\" | SOL\n! width=\"7.5%\" | PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\" | GF\n! width=\"7.5%\" | GA\n|-\n|align=left| [[Las Vegas Wranglers]] ([[Calgary Flames|CGY]]) ||72||46||12|| 6|| 8|| '''106'''||231||187\n|-\n|align=left| [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]] ([[St. Louis Blues|STL]]) ||72||49||16|| 3|| 4||'''105'''||270||176\n|-\n|align=left| [[Bakersfield Condors (1998\u20132015)|Bakersfield Condors]] (Independent) ||72||41||19|| 3|| 9||'''94'''||270||236\n|-\n|align=left| [[Idaho Steelheads]] ([[Dallas Stars|DAL]]) ||72||42||24|| 2|| 4||'''90'''||240||208\n|-\n|align=left| [[Stockton Thunder]] ([[Edmonton Oilers|EDM]]) ||72||38||24|| 5|| 5||'''86'''||225||197\n|-\n|align=left| [[Fresno Falcons]] ([[San Jose Sharks|SJ]]) ||72||34||29|| 5|| 4||'''77'''||195||197\n|-bgcolor=#bbffbb\n|align=left| [[Victoria Salmon Kings]] ([[Vancouver Canucks|VAN]]) ||72||36||32|| 1|| 3|| '''76'''||239||249\n|-\n|align=left| [[Phoenix RoadRunners]] ([[Phoenix Coyotes|PHX]]) ||72||27||40|| 2|| 3||'''59'''||201||255\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n|align=left| [[Long Beach Ice Dogs]] ([[Boston Bruins|BOS]]) ||72||27||42|| 0|| 3||'''57'''||209||267\n|-\n|align=left| [[Utah Grizzlies]] (Independent) ||72||22||42|| 4|| 4||'''52'''||184||294\n|}\n\n==Schedule and results==\n\n===Regular season===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" width=90% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"background:#00004D; color:#B5A642;\" | 2006\u201307 Game log\n|-\n| colspan=11 |\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=100%\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"background:#B5A642; color:#00004D;\" | October: 1\u20133\u20130\u20131 (Home: 1\u20131\u20130\u20131 ; Road: 0\u20132\u20130\u20130)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n! # !!

Before the start of the [[2006-07 ECHL season|2006-07 season]], Salmon Kings' Vice President of Hockey Operations and General Manager, [[Dan Belisle]] signed an affiliation agreement with the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and it's [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate, the [[Manitoba Moose]] on July 18, 2006.  Through the affiliation agreement, the Canucks assigned goaltender [[Julien Ellis]]; forwards [[Marc Andre-Bernier]], [[F.P. Guenette]] and defenseman [[Patrick Coulombe]], while the Moose assigned defensemen [[Matt Kelly (ice hockey)|Matt Kelly]] and forward [[Shaun Heshka]]. Along with this move, Dan Belisle also signed [[Wes Goldie]], [[Milan Gajic]], [[Kiel McLeod]] and [[Mike Stutzel]] to ECHL contracts to play for the Salmon Kings.  Through these moves the Salmon Kings hoped to become a powerhouse in its third season.  However, under their new head coach [[Tony MacAuley]], the team struggled through the first half of the season, which caused Belisle to fire MacAuley, after three months behind the bench.  Dan Belisle would then hire assistant coach [[Mark Morrison (ice hockey b. 1963)|Mark Morrison]] to become the fourth head coach in Salmon Kings' history.  Belisle's other mid-season move included a big trade with the [[Pensacola Ice Pilots]], and traded [[Adam Taylor]], and David Wrigley, for [[Jordan Krestanovich]] and his brother, [[Derek Krestanovich]].  Through these mid-season moves, the Salmon Kings started to respond going on a late season run and finished their remaining regular season games on a nine-game winning streak.  With the nine-game winning streak, the Salmon Kings completed their season with a 36-32-1-3 record and finished 7th overall in the National Conference to play against the [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]] in their first playoff appearance. The Salmon Kings would eventually win Game 1 by a score of 3-2, but the Aces managed to win their next 4 out of 5 games to win the series 4-2. One of the season highlights for the Salmon Kings, was forward Wes Goldie who led the team and the National Conference with 41 goals.\n\n==Standings==\n\n===Division standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30%\" | West Division\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GP\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | W\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | L\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | OTL\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | SOL\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pts\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GF\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GA\n|-\n|align=left| [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]] ([[St. Louis Blues|STL]]) ||72||49||16|| 3|| 4||'''105'''||270||176\n|-\n|align=left| [[Idaho Steelheads]] ([[Dallas Stars|DAL]]) ||72||42||24|| 2|| 4||'''90'''||240||208\n|-bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n|align=left| [[Victoria Salmon Kings]] ([[Vancouver Canucks|VAN]]) ||72||36||32|| 1|| 3|| '''76'''||239||249\n|-\n|align=left| [[Phoenix RoadRunners]] ([[Phoenix Coyotes|PHX]]) ||72||27||40|| 2|| 3||'''59'''||201||255\n|-\n|align=left| [[Utah Grizzlies]] (Independent) ||72||22||42|| 4|| 4||'''52'''||184||294\n|}\n\n===Conference standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"40%\" | National Conference\n! width=\"5%\" | GP\n! width=\"5%\" | W\n! width=\"5%\" | L\n! width=\"5%\" | OTL\n! width=\"5%\" | SOL\n! width=\"7.5%\" | PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\" | GF\n! width=\"7.5%\" | GA\n|-\n|align=left| [[Las Vegas Wranglers]] ([[Calgary Flames|CGY]]) ||72||46||12|| 6|| 8|| '''106'''||231||187\n|-\n|align=left| [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]] ([[St. Louis Blues|STL]]) ||72||49||16|| 3|| 4||'''105'''||270||176\n|-\n|align=left| [[Bakersfield Condors (1998\u20132015)|Bakersfield Condors]] (Independent) ||72||41||19|| 3|| 9||'''94'''||270||236\n|-\n|align=left| [[Idaho Steelheads]] ([[Dallas Stars|DAL]]) ||72||42||24|| 2|| 4||'''90'''||240||208\n|-\n|align=left| [[Stockton Thunder]] ([[Edmonton Oilers|EDM]]) ||72||38||24|| 5|| 5||'''86'''||225||197\n|-\n|align=left| [[Fresno Falcons]] ([[San Jose Sharks|SJ]]) ||72||34||29|| 5|| 4||'''77'''||195||197\n|-bgcolor=#bbffbb\n|align=left| [[Victoria Salmon Kings]] ([[Vancouver Canucks|VAN]]) ||72||36||32|| 1|| 3|| '''76'''||239||249\n|-\n|align=left| [[Phoenix RoadRunners]] ([[Phoenix Coyotes|PHX]]) ||72||27||40|| 2|| 3||'''59'''||201||255\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n|align=left| [[Long Beach Ice Dogs]] ([[Boston Bruins|BOS]]) ||72||27||42|| 0|| 3||'''57'''||209||267\n|-\n|align=left| [[Utah Grizzlies]] (Independent) ||72||22||42|| 4|| 4||'''52'''||184||294\n|}\n\n==Schedule and results==\n\n===Regular season===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" width=90% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"background:#00004D; color:#B5A642;\" | 2006\u201307 Game log\n|-\n| colspan=11 |\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=100%\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"background:#B5A642; color:#00004D;\" | October: 1\u20133\u20130\u20131 (Home: 1\u20131\u20130\u20131 ; Road: 0\u20132\u20130\u20130)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n! # !!

A typical Blue Man production employs 7\u20139 full-time Blue Men who are selected by audition. In addition to the stage show, Blue Man Group has toured nationally and internationally, appeared on various TV programs as both characters and performers, released multiple studio albums, contributed to a number of [[film score]]s, performed with orchestras around the United States, and appeared in ad campaigns.\n\n==History==\nBlue Man Group grew out of a collaboration between three close friends, [[Chris Wink]], Matt Goldman and Phil Stanton, on [[Manhattan]]\u2019s [[Lower East Side]] in 1987. Its first public appearance was a celebration of the end of the 1980s. The three men wore blue masks and led a street procession that included the burning of a Rambo doll and a piece of the Berlin Wall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Welch|first=Liz|year=2008|title=The Blue Man Group (Cover Story)|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080801/how-we-did-it-the-blue-man-group.html|journal=Inc|volume=30.8|pages=110\u2013112|via=}}</ref> MTV's [[Kurt Loder]], who covered the event, drew attention to the strange Blue Men\u2014and what began as creative \"disturbances\" on the streets of the city became a series of small shows at downtown clubs, and eventually a full performance at the [[Astor Place Theatre]] in 1991.\n\nIn July 2017, Blue Man Group was bought by [[Cirque du Soleil]], who announced that they would expand the concept.<ref name=\"Deb 2017\">{{Cite journal|last=Deb|first=Sopan|year=2017|title=Blue Man Group Is Bought by Cirque du Soleil, With Plans to Expand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/theater/cirque-du-soleil-buys-blue-man-group.html|journal=The New York Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nThere are a number of different themes found in various Blue Man performances. These themes include:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite AV media |year=2006 |title=Blue Man Group: Inside the Tube |publisher=[[PBS]]}}</ref>\n* ''Science'' and ''technology'', especially the topics of [[plumbing]], [[fractals]], human [[Visual perception|sight]], [[DNA]], and the [[Internet]].\n* ''[[Information overload]]'' and ''[[information pollution]]'', such as when the audience is asked to choose one of three simultaneous streams of information to read.\n* ''[[Innocence]]'', as when the Blue Men appear to be surprised and perplexed by common artifacts of modern society or by audience reactions.\n* ''[[Self-conscious]]'' and ''na\u00efve'' imitation of cultural norms, such as attempting to stage an elegant dinner for an audience member with [[Twinkie]]s; or following the Rock Concert Instruction Manual with the expectation that following a series of instructions is all it takes to put on a rock concert.\n* ''The Outsider''.  Blue Men always appear as a group of three. This is because<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> not only are Blue Men viewed as outsiders to the rest of the world, but three is the smallest group possible when endeavoring to create a community. Many of the Blue Man skits involve one of the three Blue Men performing in a manner inconsistent with the other two.\n* ''Rooftops'', or otherwise climbing to the top. There are a number of references, both in visual pieces and in lyrics from the Complex tour, that have a common theme of getting to the roof. This theme is a metaphor for the advice Stanton, Wink, and Goldman drew from [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Bill Moyers]]'s [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program ''[[The Power of Myth]]''  and represents \"following your bliss\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nThe members of Blue Man Group met in 1986 while participating in an underground production of French symbolist writer [[Alfred Jarry]]\u2019s ''[[Ubu Roi]]'', an absurdist work which inspired many themes which the trio have continued to revisit in their work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> The main character of Ubu Roi\u2019s exaggerated childishness is arguably the inspiration behind some of the group\u2019s most enduring themes, such as their displays of naivete in the face of a complex web of modern social norms. Most memorably, we may think of their iconic \u201cstreet meat\u201d bit, in which they are unleashed onto the streets of New York, hungry for the city\u2019s world-renowned halal cart kebabs. However, their mimes to strange men for \u201cstreet meat\u201d are misconstrued, and the boys are met with quite a different kind of delight. \n\nRingleader Chris Wink has pointed to a further influence from Jarry\u2013 he is said to have biked the streets of Paris at night painted green, in homage to his favorite elixir, [[absinthe]]. Blue Man Group decided to paint themselves blue following this example, but with a twist of social activism. They chose to be Blue Men in honor of the blue of our oceans. One may say that, as humans with mortal life-spans, taking on this identity draws attention to the threatened futurity of the ocean\u2019s complex and vital ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> \n\nJarry is not the only figure to influence Blue Man Group\u2013 Wink has described himself as an artistic magpie, mining history for visionaries who explored the absurd.  The group see themselves as inheritors of the ethos of Greek cynic philosopher [[Diogenes]], who made his life his art, believing that virtue was better expressed through action than through theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> Diogenes\u2019 actions took the form of burlesques of \u201crational\u201d behavior and cultural practices, and radical rejections of received ideas of human decency.

Although it contained some of the music from their stage productions, it was chiefly a collection of full-length instrumentals featuring new instruments.\n\nIn 2002, the group participated in [[Moby]]'s [[Area2]] tour, giving a more rock-oriented performance than in the theatrical shows.  Songs developed during this tour appeared on 2003's album ''[[The Complex (album)|The Complex]]''.\n\nUnlike ''Audio'', ''The Complex'', released in 2003, featured a variety of vocalists and guests including [[Tracy Bonham]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[Gavin Rossdale]] and [[Venus Hum]]. The record spawned its own 2003 tour, \"How to Be a Megastar,\" the first headlined by Blue Man Group.  The tour deconstructed the traditional [[rock concert]] experience into its often clich\u00e9d parts and was chronicled in a 2004 DVD release. The tour featured Tracy Bonham and Venus Hum as supporting acts. The DVD included a [[surround sound]] mix of some of the studio recordings.\n\nBlue Man Group launched its second tour, \"How to Be a Megastar Tour 2.0\", on September 26, 2006. It featured some new material as well as material from the original Complex Rock Tour, and featured Tracy Bonham as opening act and vocalist. DJ/[[VJ (video performance artist)|VJ]] [[Mike Relm]] was the opening act for the tour's second leg, which ended April 22, 2007 in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. The third leg of the tour began in May 2007 and included performances in [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], and [[Monterrey]], Mexico; [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina; [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil; and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], Chile. The fourth leg, using \"2.1\" in its title, included more U.S. and Canada dates. The tour visited France, [[Korea]], Canada, Germany, and a few other European countries through 2008. From August 19\u201323, it visited Taipei, Taiwan to promote its [[2009 Summer Deaflympics]], with most of the show's dialogue accompanied by subtitles. After [[Typhoon Morakot (2009)|Typhoon Morakot]] hit the island in mid-August, the group held an extra show to benefit flood victims.\n\nBlue Man Group performed with Ricky Martin at the [[2007 Latin Grammy Awards]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latingrammy.com/en/node/21589|title=Ricky Martin e Blue Man Group|website=Latin GRAMMYs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref> and again with Michael Telo at the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latingrammy.com/en/node/49681|title=Michel Telo y Blue Man Group|website=Latin GRAMMYs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, they collaborated on the track \"No More Heroes\" with Dutch DJ and producer [[Ti\u00ebsto]] for the remixed version of the ''[[Elements of Life]]'' album.\n\nAnnounced in 2009, Blue Man Group began performing for the first time at sea on Norwegian Cruise Line's ship ''Epic''.  From July 2010 to March 2015, ''Epic'' alternated 7-Day Eastern and Western Caribbean sailings from Miami with nightly Blue Man Group shows.\n\nA Blue Man Group national tour in 2010 visited various cities in the United States, Canada and Latin America.

A typical Blue Man production employs 7\u20139 full-time Blue Men who are selected by audition. In addition to the stage show, Blue Man Group has toured nationally and internationally, appeared on various TV programs as both characters and performers, released multiple studio albums, contributed to a number of [[film score]]s, performed with orchestras around the United States, and appeared in ad campaigns.\n\n==History==\nBlue Man Group grew out of a collaboration between three close friends, [[Chris Wink]], Matt Goldman and Phil Stanton, on [[Manhattan]]\u2019s [[Lower East Side]] in 1987. Its first public appearance was a celebration of the end of the 1980s. The three men wore blue masks and led a street procession that included the burning of a Rambo doll and a piece of the Berlin Wall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Welch|first=Liz|year=2008|title=THE BLUE MAN GROUP (Cover Story)|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080801/how-we-did-it-the-blue-man-group.html|journal=Inc|volume=30.8|pages=110\u2013112|via=}}</ref> MTV's [[Kurt Loder]], who covered the event, drew attention to the strange Blue Men\u2014and what began as creative \"disturbances\" on the streets of the city became a series of small shows at downtown clubs, and eventually a full performance at the [[Astor Place Theatre]] in 1991.\n\nIn July 2017, Blue Man Group was bought by [[Cirque du Soleil]], who announced that they would expand the concept.<ref name=\"Deb 2017\">{{Cite journal|last=Deb|first=Sopan|year=2017|title=Blue Man Group Is Bought by Cirque du Soleil, With Plans to Expand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/theater/cirque-du-soleil-buys-blue-man-group.html|journal=New York Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nThere are a number of different themes found in various Blue Man performances. These themes include:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite AV media |year=2006 |title=Blue Man Group: Inside the Tube |publisher=[[PBS]]}}</ref>\n* ''Science'' and ''technology'', especially the topics of [[plumbing]], [[fractals]], human [[Visual perception|sight]], [[DNA]], and the [[Internet]].\n* ''[[Information overload]]'' and ''[[information pollution]]'', such as when the audience is asked to choose one of three simultaneous streams of information to read.\n* ''[[Innocence]]'', as when the Blue Men appear to be surprised and perplexed by common artifacts of modern society or by audience reactions.\n* ''[[Self-conscious]]'' and ''na\u00efve'' imitation of cultural norms, such as attempting to stage an elegant dinner for an audience member with [[Twinkie]]s; or following the Rock Concert Instruction Manual with the expectation that following a series of instructions is all it takes to put on a rock concert.\n* ''The Outsider''.  Blue Men always appear as a group of three. This is because<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> not only are Blue Men viewed as outsiders to the rest of the world, but three is the smallest group possible when endeavoring to create a community. Many of the Blue Man skits involve one of the three Blue Men performing in a manner inconsistent with the other two.\n* ''Rooftops'', or otherwise climbing to the top. There are a number of references, both in visual pieces and in lyrics from the Complex tour, that have a common theme of getting to the roof. This theme is a metaphor for the advice Stanton, Wink, and Goldman drew from [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Bill Moyers]]'s [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program ''[[The Power of Myth]]''  and represents \"following your bliss\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nThe members of Blue Man Group met in 1986 while participating in an underground production of French symbolist writer [[Alfred Jarry]]\u2019s ''[[Ubu Roi]]'', an absurdist work which inspired many themes which the trio have continued to revisit in their work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> The main character of Ubu Roi\u2019s exaggerated childishness is arguably the inspiration behind some of the group\u2019s most enduring themes, such as their displays of naivete in the face of a complex web of modern social norms. Most memorably, we may think of their iconic \u201cstreet meat\u201d bit, in which they are unleashed onto the streets of New York, hungry for the city\u2019s world-renowned halal cart kebabs. However, their mimes to strange men for \u201cstreet meat\u201d are misconstrued, and the boys are met with quite a different kind of delight. \n\nRingleader Chris Wink has pointed to a further influence from Jarry\u2013 he is said to have biked the streets of Paris at night painted green, in homage to his favorite elixir, [[absinthe]]. Blue Man Group decided to paint themselves blue following this example, but with a twist of social activism. They chose to be Blue Men in honor of the blue of our oceans. One may say that, as humans with mortal life-spans, taking on this identity draws attention to the threatened futurity of the ocean\u2019s complex and vital ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> \n\nJarry is not the only figure to influence Blue Man Group\u2013 Wink has described himself as an artistic magpie, mining history for visionaries who explored the absurd.  The group see themselves as inheritors of the ethos of Greek cynic philosopher [[Diogenes]], who made his life his art, believing that virtue was better expressed through action than through theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> Diogenes\u2019 actions took the form of burlesques of \u201crational\u201d behavior and cultural practices, and radical rejections of received ideas of human decency. Famously, Diogenes masturbated openly in the market-place. When asked about his actions, he said,  \"If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly.\u201d Though Blue Man Group\u2019s shows are generally family-friendly (save for the raunchy \u201cstreet meat\u201d piece), this naive logic would not be out of place in a Blue Man Group show. The group\u2019s music is heavily indebted to Italian Futurist composer [[Luigi Russolo]], who was known for his rejection of traditional melodic music and instruments in favor of [[Intonarumori]], experimental instruments which mimic the sounds of industrial life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> Blue Man Group\u2019s instruments, often made of materials like pipes, are thoroughly within this tradition. Other examples, which illustrate the diversity of their influences, include theologian and alchemist [[Giordano Bruno]], picaresque satirist [[Tobias Smollett]], and proto-Expressionist dramatist [[Georg B\u00fcchner]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n\n==Theatrical productions==\n[[File:Astor-playhouse.jpg|thumb|[[Astor Place Theatre]] with marquee for the group]]\n[[File:Skulptur Marlene-Dietrich-Platz 4 (Tierg) Buddy B\u00e4r.jpg|thumb|[[United Buddy Bears|Blue Man Group-Buddy Bears]], in [[Mitte|Berlin-Mitte]]]]\n\n===Current theatrical productions===\n'''United States'''\n* [[New York City]] at the [[Astor Place Theatre]] (1991 \u2013 present)\n* [[Boston]] at the [[Charles Playhouse]] (1995 \u2013 present)\n* [[Chicago]] at the [[Briar Street Theater]] (1997 \u2013 present)\n* [[Orlando]] at the [[Blue Man Group Sharp Aquos Theatre|Blue Man Group Theatre]] at [[Universal CityWalk Orlando|CityWalk]] at the [[Universal Orlando Resort]] (June 6, 2007\u2013present)\n* [[Las Vegas]] at the [[Luxor (hotel)|Luxor]] Hotel and Casino (November 18, 2015 \u2013 present)\n\n'''Germany'''\n* [[Berlin]] at the Bluemax Theater (February 1, 2006\u2013present)\n\n'''Touring shows'''\n* World Tour (March 29, 2016 \u2013 present) \u2013 a celebration of life in full color\n* Speechless Tour \u2013 (September 12, 2019  \u2013 present)\n\n===Previous theatrical productions===\n'''United States'''\n* Live at Luxor in Las Vegas (March 10, 2000 \u2013 September 15, 2005)\n* \"How to be a Megastar\" national arena \"rock concert\" tour (2003)\n* Las Vegas, Nevada at The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino (October 10, 2005 \u2013 September 30, 2012)<ref name=\"recruit\">Ogunnaike, Lola.

Although it contained some of the music from their stage productions, it was chiefly a collection of full-length instrumentals featuring new instruments.\n\nIn 2002, the group participated in [[Moby]]'s [[Area2]] tour, giving a more rock-oriented performance than in the theatrical shows.  Songs developed during this tour appeared on 2003's album ''[[The Complex (album)|The Complex]]''.\n\nUnlike ''Audio'', ''The Complex'', released in 2003, featured a variety of vocalists and guests including [[Tracy Bonham]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[Gavin Rossdale]] and [[Venus Hum]]. The record spawned its own 2003 tour, \"How to Be a Megastar,\" the first headlined by Blue Man Group.  The tour deconstructed the traditional [[rock concert]] experience into its often clich\u00e9d parts and was chronicled in a 2004 DVD release. The tour featured Tracy Bonham and Venus Hum as supporting acts. The DVD included a [[surround sound]] mix of some of the studio recordings.\n\nBlue Man Group launched its second tour, \"How to Be a Megastar Tour 2.0\", on September 26, 2006. It featured some new material as well as material from the original Complex Rock Tour, and featured Tracy Bonham as opening act and vocalist. DJ/[[VJ (video performance artist)|VJ]] [[Mike Relm]] was the opening act for the tour's second leg, which ended April 22, 2007 in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. The third leg of the tour began in May 2007 and included performances in [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], and [[Monterrey]], Mexico; [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina; [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil; and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], Chile. The fourth leg, using \"2.1\" in its title, included more U.S. and Canada dates. The tour visited France, [[Korea]], Canada, Germany, and a few other European countries through 2008. From August 19\u201323, it visited Taipei, Taiwan to promote its [[2009 Summer Deaflympics]], with most of the show's dialogue accompanied by subtitles. After [[Typhoon Morakot (2009)|Typhoon Morakot]] hit the island in mid-August, the group held an extra show to benefit flood victims.\n\nBlue Man Group performed with Ricky Martin at the [[2007 Latin Grammy Awards]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latingrammy.com/en/node/21589|title=Ricky Martin e Blue Man Group|website=Latin GRAMMYs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref> and again with Michael Telo at the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latingrammy.com/en/node/49681|title=Michel Telo y Blue Man Group|website=Latin GRAMMYs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, they collaborated on the track \"No More Heroes\" with Dutch DJ and producer [[Ti\u00ebsto]] for the remixed version of the ''[[Elements of Life]]'' album.\n\nAnnounced in 2009, Blue Man Group began performing for the first time at sea on Norwegian Cruise Line's ship ''Epic''.  From July 2010 to March 2015, ''Epic'' alternated 7-Day Eastern and Western Caribbean sailings from Miami with nightly Blue Man Group shows.\n\nA Blue Man Group national tour in 2010 visited various cities in the United States, Canada and Latin America.

Secondly, the world trade practices that currently exist promote the unequal [[distribution of wealth]] between nations. Lastly, buying products from producers in developing countries at a fair price is a more efficient way of promoting sustainable development than traditional charity and aid.\n\nFair trade labelling organizations commonly use a definition of ''fair trade'' developed by [[FINE]], an informal association of four international fair trade networks: [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA). Specifically, fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade.

The nature of fair trade makes it a global phenomenon, therefore, there are diverse motives for understanding group formation related to fair trade. The social transformation caused by the fair trade movement also varies around the world.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Fair Trade from the Ground Up|last=Linton|first=April|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-295-99172-6|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Young women soil testing.jpg|thumb|Three young Nicaraguan women demonstrate to visiting US buyers and consumers the use of organic soil testing methods.|alt=Teaching organic soil testing in Nicaragua.]]\n\nA study of coffee growers in Guatemala illustrates the effect of fair trade practices on growers. In this study, thirty-four farmers were interviewed. Of those thirty-four growers, twenty-two had an understanding of fair trade based on internationally recognized definitions, for example, describing fair trade in market and economical terms or knowing what the social premium is and how their cooperative has used it. Three growers explained a deep understanding of fair trade, showing a knowledge of both fair market principles and how fair trade affects them socially. Nine growers had erroneous or no knowledge of Fair Trade.<ref name=\":2\" /> The three growers who had a deeper knowledge of the social implications of fair trade all have responsibilities within their cooperatives. One is a manager, one is in charge of the wet mill, and one is his group's treasurer. These farmers did not have a pattern in terms of years of education, age, or years of membership in the cooperative; their answers to the questions, \"Why did you join?\" differentiate them from other members and explain why they have such an extensive knowledge of fair trade. These farmers cited switching to organic farming, wanting to raise money for social projects, and more training offered as reasons for joining the cooperative, other than receiving a better price for their coffee.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMany farmers around the world are unaware of fair trade practices that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage. Coffee is one of the most highly traded commodities in the world, yet the farmers who grow it typically earn less than $2 a day.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fair Trade Awareness and Engagement: A Coffee Farmer's Perspective|last = Fergus|first = Andrew|date = 2014|journal = Journal of the Center of Business Ethics, Bentley University|doi = 10.1111/basr.12037|pmid = |last2 = Gray |volume=119 |issue = 3|pages=359\u2013384}}</ref> When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Mart\u00edn de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that they have heard about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their [[cooperatives]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSome producers also profit from the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers feel like they have control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAs far as farmers' satisfaction with the fair trade system, the growers want consumers to know that fair trade has provided important support to their families and their cooperative. Overall, farmers are satisfied with the current fair trade system, but some farmers, such as the Mazaronquiari group from CAC Pangoa, desire yet a higher price for their products in order to live a higher quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social premium ===\nA component of trade is the social premium that buyers of fair trade goods pay to the producers or producer-groups of such goods. An important factor of the fair trade social premium is that the producers or producer-groups decide where and how it is spent. These premiums usually go towards socioeconomic development, wherever the producers or producer-groups see fit. Within producer-groups, the decisions about how the social premium will be spent is handled democratically, with transparency and participation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nProducers and producer-groups spend this social premium to support socioeconomic development in a variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These public goods include environment initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFarmers' organisations that use their social premium for public goods often finance educational scholarships. For example, Costa Rican coffee co-operative, Coocaf\u00e9, has supported hundreds of children and youth at school and university through the financing of scholarships from funding from their fair trade social premium. In terms of education, the social premium can be used to build and furnish schools too.<ref>{{Cite book|title = 50 Reasons to Buy Fair Trade|last = Litvinoff|first = Miles|publisher = Pluto Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-7453-2584-2|location = |pages = |last2 = Madeley|first2 = John|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/50reasonstobuyfa0000litv}}</ref>\n\n== Organizations Promoting Fair Trade ==\nMost of the fair trade import organizations are members of, or certified by one of several national or international federations. These federations coordinate, promote, and facilitate the work of fair trade organizations. The following are some of the largest:\n*[[FLO International]] (Fairtrade International), created in 1997, is an association of three producer networks and twenty national labeling initiatives that develop Fairtrade standards, license buyers, label usage and market the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fair trade Certification Mark]] in consuming countries. The Fairtrade International labeling system is the largest and most widely recognized standard setting and certification body for [[Fairtrade labeling|labeled Fair trade]]. Formerly named Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, it changed its name to Fairtrade International in 2009, when its producer certification and standard setting activities were separated into two separate, but connected entities. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.<ref name=\"FLOCERT\" /> Fairtrade International, the non-profit arm, oversees standards development and licensing organization activity. Only products from certain developing countries are eligible for certification, and for some products such as coffee and cocoa, certification is restricted to cooperatives. Cooperatives and large estates with hired labor may be certified for bananas, tea and other crops.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fair trade | contribution = Generic standards | contribution-url = http://www.fairtrade.net/generic_standards.html}}</ref>\n* [[Fair Trade USA]]<ref>{{Citation | title = Fair trade | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/ | place = US}}</ref> is an independent, nonprofit organization that sets standards, certifies, and labels products that promote sustainable livelihoods for farmers and workers and protect the environment.

In 2004 WFTO launched the FTO Mark which identifies registered fair trade organizations (as opposed to the FLO system, which labels products).\n* The [[Network of European Worldshops]] (NEWS!), created in 1994, is the umbrella network of 15 national [[worldshop]] associations in 13 different countries all over Europe.\n* The [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA), created in 1990, is a network of European [[alternative trading organization]]s which import products from some 400 economically disadvantaged producer groups in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. EFTA's goal is to promote fair trade and to make fair trade importing more efficient and effective. The organization also publishes yearly various publications on the evolution of the fair trade market. EFTA currently has eleven members in nine different countries.\n\nIn 1998, the first four federations listed above joined together as [[FINE]], an informal association whose goal is to harmonize fair trade standards and guidelines, increase the quality and efficiency of fair trade monitoring systems, and advocate fair trade politically.\n* Additional certifiers include IMO (Fair for Life, Social and Fair Trade labels), Eco-Social and Fair Trade USA.\n* The [[Fair Trade Federation]] (FTF), created in 1994, is an association of Canadian and American fair trade wholesalers, importers, and retailers. The organization links its members to fair trade producer groups while acting as a clearinghouse for information on fair trade and providing resources and networking opportunities to its members. Members self-certify adherence to defined fair trade principles for 100% of their purchasing/business. Those who sell products certifiable by Fairtrade International must be 100% certified by FI to join FTF.\n\nStudent groups have also been increasingly active in the past years promoting fair trade products.<ref name=\"fairtradecampaigns.org\">{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/universities/ |title=Universities &#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}</ref> Although hundreds of independent student organizations are active worldwide, most groups in North America are either affiliated with United Students for Fair Trade (USA, the Canadian Student Fair Trade Network (Canada), or Fair Trade Campaigns<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/|title=Fair Trade Campaigns|website=fairtradecampaigns.org}}</ref> (USA), which also houses Fair Trade Universities<ref name=\"fairtradecampaigns.org\" /> and Fair Trade Schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/schools/ |title=Schools &#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}</ref>\n\nThe involvement of church organizations has been and continues to be an integral part of the Fair Trade movement:\n* [[Ten Thousand Villages]]<ref name=\"tenthousandvillages.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tenthousandvillages.com/|title=Fair Trade Handmade Gifts & Crafts from International Artisans - Ten Thousand Villages|website=www.tenthousandvillages.com}}</ref> is affiliated with the Mennonite Central Committee<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tenthousandvillages.com/about-history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Ten Thousand Villages |accessdate=2013-05-01}}</ref>\n* SERRV<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serrv.org/|title=Fair Trade Home Decor, Jewelry, Baskets, Gifts, Food: Shop Serrv|website=SERRV}}</ref> is partnered with Catholic Relief Services<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crs.org/|title=Home|website=CRS}}</ref> and Lutheran World Relief<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lwr.org/|title=Lutheran World Relief - Lutheran World Relief|website=www.lwr.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serrv.org/category/our-story |title=Our Story |publisher=SERRV |accessdate=2013-05-01}}</ref>\n* Village Markets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagemarkets.org/|title=Village Markets - Empowering People to Work Their Way Out of Poverty Through Fair Trade|website=www.villagemarkets.org|access-date=2012-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326071810/http://www.villagemarkets.org/|archive-date=2012-03-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> is a Lutheran Fair Trade organization connecting mission sites around the world with churches in the United States<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.villagemarkets.org/fundraisers |title=Fair Trade in Your Church! |publisher=Villagemarkets.org |accessdate=2013-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602155330/http://www.villagemarkets.org/fundraisers |archive-date=2013-06-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelutheran.org/article/article.cfm?article_id=10300&key=106089998 |title='God's love is what they pass on' : Fair trade is a mission for a Wittenberg University grad, students and faculty |publisher=The Lutheran |date=2012-03-29 |access-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116021920/http://www.thelutheran.org/article/article.cfm?article_id=10300&key=106089998 |archive-date=2013-01-16 |df= }}</ref>\n* Catholic Relief Services has their own Fair Trade mission in CRS Fair Trade<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crsfairtrade.org/|title=Home - CRS Ethical Trade|website=CRS Ethical Trade}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crsfairtrade.org/what-is-fair-trade/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730101755/http://www.crsfairtrade.org/what-is-fair-trade/ |archive-date=2014-07-30 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of fair trade}}\nThe first attempts to commercialize fair trade goods in Northern markets were initiated in the 1940s and 1950s by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs).

Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against neo-imperialism: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The slogan at the time, \"Trade not Aid\", gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the developing world.<ref>{{cite web | archivedate = October 22, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141022065406/http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10&Itemid=17&limit=1&limitstart=1 | url = http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10&Itemid=17&limit=1&limitstart=1 |title= Where did it all begin?| accessdate = 24 June 2009 | date = 7 June 2009|publisher= WFTO}}</ref>\n\nThe year 1965 saw the creation of the first [[Alternative Trading Organization]] (ATO): that year, British NGO [[Oxfam]] launched \"Helping-by-Selling\", a program which sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the UK and from mail-order catalogues.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = One Village | place = Charlbury, UK |url= http://onevillage.org/fairtrade-history.htm |title = Fair trade history | last = Scott | first = Roy | date=2003-03-07 |accessdate= 2013-05-01}}</ref>\n\nBy 1968, the oversized newsprint publication, the [[Whole Earth Catalog]], was connecting thousands of specialized merchants, artisans, and scientists directly with consumers who were interested in supporting independent producers, with the goal of bypassing corporate retail and department stores. The Whole Earth Catalog sought to balance the international free market by allowing direct purchasing of goods produced primarily in US and Canada, but also in Central and South America.\n\nIn 1969, the first [[worldshop]] opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods produced under fair trade terms in \"underdeveloped regions\". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, Germany, and other Western European countries.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from Angola and Nicaragua in worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes, and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world's market.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}\n\n=== Handicrafts vs. agricultural goods ===\nIn the early 1980s, [[Alternative Trading Organizations]] faced major challenges: the novelty of some fair trade products began to wear off, demand reached a plateau, and some handicrafts began to look \"tired and old fashioned\" in the marketplace. The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, several fair trade supporters during this period were worried by the contemporary effect on small farmers of structural reforms in the agricultural sector as well as the fall in [[commodity]] prices. Many of them came to believe it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and remedies usable in the ongoing crisis in the industry.\n\nIn the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a much-needed, renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations a complement to the handicrafts market. The first fair trade agricultural products were tea and coffee, quickly followed by: dried fruits, cocoa, sugar, fruit juices, rice, spices and nuts. While in 1992, a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm, in 2002 handcrafts amounted to 25% of fair trade sales while commodity food lines were up at 69%.<ref>Nicholls, A. & Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.</ref>\n\n=== Rise of labeling initiatives ===\n[[File:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]]<!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at [[:File:Oldftlogos2.jpg]] for rationale -->Sales of fair trade products only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade certification]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0743-0167(02)00051-7 | last = Renard | first = M-C | year= 2003| title = Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions | url = |journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=19 | pages =87\u201396}}</ref> The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.\n\nA solution was found in 1988, when the first Fairtrade certification initiative, [[Stichting Max Havelaar|Max Havelaar]], was created in the Netherlands under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans Van Der Hoff]], and Dutch development NGO [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the worldshops and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the supply chain.\n\nThe concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America. In 1997, a process of convergence among labelling organizations \u2013 or \"LIs\" (for \"Labeling Initiatives\") \u2013 led to the creation of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers, and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/tasks.html | title = Main Tasks | work = Fair trade | accessdate = 27 January 2009 | year=2006 | publisher = FLO International}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, FLO launched for the first time an International Fairtrade Certification Mark. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade, and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. At present, the certification mark is used in over 50 countries and on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine, [[Football (ball)|footballs]], etc.\n\nWith the rise of ethical labeling, consumers are able to take moral responsibility for their economic decisions and actions. This supports the notion of fair trade practices as \"moral economies.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> The presence of labeling give consumers the feeling of \"doing the right thing\" with a simple purchase.\n\nThese labeling practices place the burden of getting certification on the producers in the Global South, furthering inequality between the Global North and the Global South.

Farmers are more likely to identify with [[organic farming]] than fair trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods.<ref name=\":0\" /> Fair trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Product certification ==\n{{Main|Fair trade certification}}\n''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to the FLO product labeling system, see [[Fairtrade certification]]''\n[[File:Fairtrade Certification Mark.svg|thumb|200px|International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]\nFairtrade labelling (usually simply Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is a certification system designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body ([[FLO International]]) and a certification body ([[FLO-CERT]]), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met. For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade Certification Mark or the [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the international Fair trade standards set by FLO International. The supply chain must also have been monitored by FLO-CERT, to ensure the integrity of the labelled product.\n\nFairtrade certification purports to guarantee not only fair prices, but also the principles of [[ethical purchasing]]. These principles include adherence to ILO agreements such as those banning child and [[slave labour]], guaranteeing a safe workplace and the right to unionise, adherence to the [[United Nations]] charter of [[human rights]], a fair price that covers the cost of production and facilitates social development, and protection and conservation of the environment. The Fairtrade certification system also attempts to promote long-term business relationships between buyers and sellers, crop prefinancing, and greater transparency throughout the supply chain and more.\n\nThe Fairtrade certification system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine. Companies offering products that meet the Fairtrade standards may apply for licences to use one of the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products. The International Fairtrade Certification Mark was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with the exception of the United States). The Fair Trade Certified Mark is still used to identify Fairtrade goods in the United States.\n\nThere is widespread confusion because the fair trade industry standards provided by Fairtrade International (The Fairtrade Labelling Organization) use the word \"producer\" in many different senses, often in the same specification document. Sometimes it refers to farmers, sometimes to the primary cooperatives they belong to, to the secondary cooperatives that the primary cooperatives belong to, or to the tertiary cooperatives that the secondary cooperatives may belong to<ref>[http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

Called the FTO Mark,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/the-fairtrade-marks.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): The Fairtrade Marks |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}</ref> it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and seeks to guarantee that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour, and the environment. The FTO Mark offers Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable standards which inform consumers, business partners, governments, and donors of the applicable trading standard. in 2014 the Fairtrade Program Mark was introduced to create new sales opportunities, initially for cocoa, sugar and cotton producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fairtrade-sourcing-programs.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}</ref> It has the same round logo alongside the word '''FAIRTRADE''' in black and underneath the program title in '''<span style=\"color:turquoise\">turquoise</span>'''.\n\n== Alternative trading organizations ==\n{{Main|Alternative trading organization}}\n[[File:Cafedirectcoffeeshop.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cafedirect]] coffee shop on [[Regent Street]] in central London.]]\n\nAn alternative trading organization (ATO) is usually a non-governmental organization (NGO) or mission-driven business aligned with the Fair Trade movement, aiming \"to contribute to the alleviation of poverty in developing regions of the world by establishing a system of trade that allows marginalized producers in developing regions to gain access to developed markets\".<ref name=\"European Fair 1998 p.23 & 25\">European Fair Trade Association (1998). Fair Trade Yearbook: Towards 2000. p.23 & 25</ref> Alternative trading organizations have Fair Trade at the core of their mission and activities, using it as a development tool to support disadvantaged producers and to [[poverty reduction|reduce poverty]], and combine their marketing with awareness-raising and campaigning.\n\nAlternative trading organizations are often, but not always, based in political and religious groups, though their secular purpose precludes sectarian identification and evangelical activity. Philosophically, the grassroots political-action agenda of these organizations associates them with progressive political causes active since the 1960s: foremost, a belief in [[collective action]] and commitment to moral principles based on social, economic and [[trade justice]].\n\nAccording to EFTA, the defining characteristic of alternative trading organizations is that of equal partnership and respect \u2013 partnership between the developing region producers and importers, shops, labelling organizations, and consumers. Alternative trade \"humanizes\" the trade process \u2013 making the producer-consumer chain as short as possible so that consumers become aware of the culture, identity, and conditions in which producers live. All actors are committed to the principle of alternative trade, the need for advocacy in their working relations and the importance of awareness-raising and advocacy work.<ref name=\"European Fair 1998 p.23 & 25\" /> Examples of such organisations are Ten Thousand Villages, Greenheart Shop, [[Equal Exchange]] and SERRV International in the US and [[Equal Exchange Trading]], [[Traidcraft]], Oxfam Trading, [[Twin Trading]] and Alter Eco in Europe as well as Siem Fair Trade Fashion in Australia.\n\n== Universities ==\nThe concept of a Fair Trade school or Fair Trade university emerged from the [[United Kingdom]], where the Fairtrade Foundation now maintains a list of colleges and schools that comply with the needed requirements to be labeled such a university. In order to be considered a Fair Trade University, a school or university must have established a Fairtrade School Steering Group. They must have a written and implemented a school-wide Fair Trade Policy. The school or university must be dedicated to selling and using Fair Trade products. They have to learn and educate about Fair Trade issues. Finally, the Fairtrade Foundation requires that schools promote Fair Trade not only within the school, but throughout the wider community.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA Fair Trade University is one that develops all aspects of Fair Trade practices in their coursework. In 2007, the Director of the Environmental Studies program at the [[University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh]], David Barnhill, started a push to become the first Fair Trade University. This push received positive reactions from faculty and students. To begin the process, the University as a whole agreed that it would need support from four institutional groups\u2014faculty, staff, support staff, and students\u2014to maximize support and educational efforts. The University officially endorsed the Earth Charter and created a Campus Sustainability Plan to align with the efforts of becoming a Fair Trade University.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe University of Wisconsin- Oshkosh also offers many courses in many different disciplines that implement fair trade learning. They offer a business course with a trip to [[Peru]] to visit coffee farmers, an environmental science class that discusses fair trade as a way for cleaner food systems, an English course that focuses on the [[Earth Charter]] and the application of fair trade principles, and several upper-level anthropology courses make fair trade the center of the class.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title = Sustainability in Higher Education|last = Feldman|first = James|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-262-01949-1|location = |pages = 241\u2013248|last2 = Barnhill|jstor = j.ctt9qf6bw.26}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 2010, the [[University of California, San Diego]] became the second Fair Trade University in the United States. The University of California at San Diego understood the efforts of the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK, but they recognized they wanted to be more detailed about how their declaration as a Fair Trade University would make an actual change in the way on-campus franchises do business with the university. They also required constant assessment and improvement. The main premise of being a Fair Trade University for the University of California at San Diego is the promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of Fair Trade Certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as buying from local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFair Trade Universities have been successful because they are a \"feel good\" movement. The movement also has an established history, making it a true movement rather just a fad. Thirdly, Fair Trade Universities are effective because they raise awareness about an issue and offer a solution. The solution is an easy one for college students to handle, just paying about five cents more for a cup of coffee or tea can make a real difference.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Worldshops ==\n{{Main|Worldshop}}\n[[File:Oxfam shop on Drury Lane.jpg|thumb|[[Oxfam#Shops|Oxfam shop]] on [[Drury Lane]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]]]\nWorldshops or fair trade shops are specialized retail outlets offering and promoting fair trade products. Worldshops also typically organize various educational fair trade activities and play an active role in trade justice and other North-South political campaigns. Worldshops are often [[not-for-profit]] organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks. Although the movement emerged in Europe and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in North America, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWorldshops' aim is to make trade as direct and fair with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a [[developing country]] and consumers in [[industrialisation|industrialized]] countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees substinence and guarantees positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain. A web movement has begun in the 2000s to provide fair trade items at fair prices to the consumers. One popular one is Fair Trade a Day<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fairtradeaday.com/|title=fairtradeday.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705004023/http://fairtradeaday.com/|archive-date=2018-07-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> where a different fair trade item is featured each day.\n\n== World wide ==\nEvery year the sales of Fair Trade products grow close to 30% and in 2004 were worth over $500 million USD.

Most Fair Trade coffee is ''[[Coffea arabica]],'' a type of coffee known to be grown at high altitudes. A lot of emphasis is put on the quality of the coffee when dealing in Fair Trade markets because Fair Trade markets are usually specialized markets that appeal to customers who are motivated by taste rather than price. The Fair Trade movement fixated on coffee first because it is a highly traded commodity for most producing countries and almost half the world's coffee is produced by smallholder farmers.<ref name=\":2\" /> While initially sold at small scale, currently multinationals like Starbucks and Nestl\u00e9 use fair trade coffee.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement|url = http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/1/94|journal = Social Problems|date = 2012-02-01|issn = 0037-7791|pages = 94\u2013116|volume = 59|issue = 1|doi = 10.1525/sp.2012.59.1.94|first = Daniel|last = Jaffee}}</ref>\n\nInternationally recognized Fair Trade coffee standards have been outlined by FLO and are as follows: small producers are grouped in democratic cooperatives or groups, buyers and sellers establish long-term, stable relationships, buyers must pay the producers at least the minimum Fair Trade price or when the market price is higher, they must pay the market price, and finally, buyers must also pay a social premium of 20 cents per pound of coffee to the producers. The current minimum Fair Trade price for high-grade, washed Arabica coffee $1.40 per pound; the price increases to $1.70 per pound if the coffee is also organic.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Locations ====\nThe largest sources of fair trade coffee are Uganda and Tanzania, followed by Latin American countries such as Guatemala and Costa Rica.<ref name=\"Raynolds, Laura 2000\" /> As of 1999, major importers of fair trade coffee included Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. There is a North/South divide between fair trade consumers and producers. North American countries are not yet among the top importers of fair trade coffee.<ref name=\"Raynolds, Laura 2000\" />\n\n==== Labour ====\nStarbucks began to purchase more fair trade coffee in 2001 because of charges of labor rights violations in Central American plantations.

Small growers dominate the production of coffee, especially in Latin American countries such as Peru. Coffee is the fastest expanding fairly traded commodity, and an increasing number of producers are small farmers that own their own land and work in cooperatives. Even the incomes of growers of fair trade coffee beans depend on the market value of coffee where it is consumed, so farmers of fair trade coffee do not necessarily live above the poverty line or get completely fair prices for their commodity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ransom, David.

Increased productivity requires technological innovations, and the coffee agroecosystem has been changing rapidly. In the nineteenth century in Latin America, coffee plantations slowly began replacing sugarcane and subsistence crops. Coffee crops became more managed; they were put into rows and unshaded, meaning diversity of the forest was decreased and [[Coffea]] trees were shorter. As plant and tree diversity decreased, so did animal diversity. Unshaded plantations allow for a higher density of Coffea trees, but negative effects include less protection from wind and more easily eroded soil. Technified coffee plantations also use chemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.<ref name=\"Rice, Robert A 1999\" />\n\nFair trade certified commodities must adhere to sustainable agro-ecological practices, including reduction of chemical fertilizer use, prevention of erosion, and protection of forests. Coffee plantations are more likely to be fair trade certified if they use traditional farming practices with shading and without chemicals. This protects the biodiversity of the ecosystem and ensures that the land will be usable for farming in the future and not just for short-term planting.<ref name=\"Raynolds, Laura 2000\" /> In the United States, 85% of fair trade certified coffee is also organic.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">DeCarlo, Jacqueline. Fair Trade: A Beginner's Guide. Oxford, England: Oneworld, 2007</ref>\n\n==== Consumer attitudes ====\nConsumers typically have positive attitudes for products that are ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often are not willing to pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say they would be willing to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pelsmacker | first1 = De | last2 = Patrick | last3 = Driesen | first3 = Liesbeth | last4 = Rayp | first4 = Glenn | year = 2005| title = Do Consumers Care about Ethics?

In Africa in particular, governments tax cocoa as their main source of revenue. Cocoa is a permanent crop, which means that it occupies land for long periods of time and does not need to be replanted after each harvest.<ref name=\"Willer and Yussefi 2008\">Willer, Helga; Yussefi-Menzler, Minou und Sorensen, Neil, (Hrsg.) (2008) \"The World of Organic Agriculture \u2013 Statistics and Emerging Trends 2008.\" IFOAM, Bonn and FiBL, Frick</ref>\n\n==== Locations ====\nCocoa is farmed in the tropical regions of West Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. In Latin America, cocoa is produced in Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. Much of the cocoa produced in Latin America is an organic and regulated by an [[Internal control]] system. Bolivia has fair trade cooperatives that permit a fair share of money for cocoa producers. African cocoa-producing countries include Cameroon, Madagascar, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.<ref name=\"Willer and Yussefi 2008\" /> C\u00f4te d'Ivoire exports over a third of the world's cocoa beans.<ref name=\"Brown, Michael Barratt 2007\">Brown, Michael Barratt. \"'Fair Trade' with Africa.\" Review of African Political Economy 34.112 (2007): 267-77</ref> Southeast Asia accounts for about 14% of the world's cocoa production. Major cocoa-producing countries are Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldcocoafoundation.org/our-work/where-we-work/ |title=Where We Work |publisher=World Cocoa Foundation |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}</ref>\n\n==== Labour ====\nOne suggestion for the reason that laborers in Africa are marginalized in world trade is because the colonial division of labor kept Africa from developing its own industries. Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.<ref name=\"Brown, Michael Barratt 2007\" /> Most cocoa comes from small family-run farms in West Africa. These farms have little market access and thus rely on middlemen to bring their products to market. Sometimes middlemen are unfair to farmers. Farmers do not get a fair price for their product despite relying on cocoa sales for the majority of their income.<ref name=\"Houston, Holly 2012\">Houston, Holly, and Terry Wyer. \"Why Sustainable Cocoa Farming Matters for Rural Development.\" Center for Strategic and International Studies, 6 Sept. 2012.</ref> One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an [[Agricultural cooperative]]. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Michael K | year = 2004 | title = Reading fairtrade: political ecological imaginary and the moral economy of fairtrade foods | url = | journal = Political Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 7| pages = 891\u2013915 | doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2004.05.013}}</ref> One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. In reality, much of this money goes to community projects such as water wells rather than to individual farmers. Nevertheless, cooperatives such as fair trade-endorsed [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in Ghana are often the only Licensed Buying Companies that will give farmers a fair price and not cheat them or rig sales.<ref name=\"Berlan, Amanda 2008\">{{cite book | last1 = Berlan | first1 = Amanda | year = 2008 | title = Making or Marketing a Difference?

These arrangements are not always assured and fair trade organizations can't always buy all of the cocoa available to them from cooperatives.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==== Marketing ====\nThe marketing of fair trade cocoa to European consumers often portrays the cocoa farmers as dependent on western purchases for their livelihood and well-being. Showing African cocoa producers in this way is problematic because it is reminiscent of the imperialistic view that Africans cannot live happily without the help of westerners. It puts the balance of power in favor of the consumers rather than the producers.<ref name=\"Berlan, Amanda 2008\" />\n\nConsumers often aren't willing to pay the extra price for fair trade cocoa because they do not know what fair trade is. Activist groups are vital in educating consumers about the unethical aspects of unfair trade and promoting demand for fairly traded commodities. Activism and ethical consumption not only promote fair trade but also act against powerful corporations such as [[Mars, Incorporated]] that refuse to acknowledge the use of forced child labor in the harvesting of their cocoa.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" />\n\n==== Sustainability ====\nSmallholding farmers not only frequently lack access to markets, they lack access to resources that lead to sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and lack of knowledge about modern farming techniques.<ref name=\"Houston, Holly 2012\" /> One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the amount of time it takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. A solution to this is to change the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.\n\n==== Cocoa companies ====\nFollowing are chocolate companies that use all or some fair trade cocoa in their chocolate:\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alter Eco]] <ref name=\"Huffington Post 2017\">{{cite web | title=A Deep Dive into Ethical Label Claims | website=HuffPost | date=April 24, 2017 | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-deep-dive-into-ethical-label-claims_us_58fe3d8ee4b0f02c3870ed2e | access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Ben & Jerry's]] <ref>{{cite web | title=Fair trade for college students | website=The Collegian | date=November 7, 2017 | url=http://www.stmaryscollegian.com/fair-trade-for-college-students/ | access-date=November 13, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113222420/http://www.stmaryscollegian.com/fair-trade-for-college-students/ | archive-date=November 13, 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Cadbury]]\n* [[Chocolove]] <ref>{{cite web | title=Top Chocolate Bars For Valentines' | website=Consumer Reports | date=February 13, 2014 | url=https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/02/top-chocolate-bars-for-valentine-s-day/index.htm | language=id | access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Dagoba Chocolate]] <ref>{{cite book | last=Robbins | first=J. | title=No Happy Cows: Dispatches from the Frontlines of the Food Revolution | publisher=Red Wheel Weiser | series=EBL-Schweitzer | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-60925-579-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aft13dfj1dIC&pg=PA125 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=125}}</ref>\n* [[Divine Chocolate]] <ref name=\"Huffington Post 2017\"/><ref name=\"HuffPost 2017\">{{cite web | title=Of Gods and Goblins | website=HuffPost | date=October 26, 2017 | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/of-gods-and-goblins_us_59f20d25e4b06ae9067ab6e7 | access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Equal Exchange]] <ref name=\"HuffPost 2017\"/>\n* [[Gepa The Fair Trade Company|GEPA]]\n* [[Green & Black's]] <ref>{{cite book | last=Anderson | first=M. | title=A History of Fair Trade in Contemporary Britain: From Civil Society Campaigns to Corporate Compliance | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-137-31330-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgVaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA122 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=122}}</ref>\n* [[Guittard Chocolate Company]] <ref>{{cite web | title=Short List / Chocolat, Voil\u00e0! | website=Observer | url=http://observer.com/2015/11/french-artistry-and-american-entrepreneurial-spirit-the-guittard-chocolate-company/ | access-date=November 13, 2017| date=2015-11-25 }}</ref>\n* [[Theo Chocolate]] <ref name=\"Huffington Post 2017\"/><ref>{{cite web | last=Chang | first=Elizabeth | title=Your ethical chocolate might be only 20 percent 'ethical' | website=Washington Post | date=April 10, 2017 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/lifestyle/your-ethical-chocolate-might-be-only-20-percent-ethical/2193/ | access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n{{Div col end}}\n* [[Tony's Chocolonely]]\n\n==== Harkin-Engel Protocol ====\nThe [[Harkin-Engel Protocol]], also commonly known as the Cocoa Protocol, is an international agreement that was created to end some of the world's worst forms of child labor, as well as forced labor in the cocoa industry. It was first negotiated by Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Eliot Engel after watching a documentary that showed the cocoa industry's widespread issue of child slavery and trafficking. The parties involved agreed to a six-article plan:\n\n# Public statement of the need for and terms of an action plan\u2014The cocoa industry acknowledged the problem of forced child labor and will commit \"significant resources\" to address the problem.\n# Formation of multi-sectoral advisory groups\u2014By 1 October 2001, an advisory group will be formed to research labor practices.

By 2015, almost 75,000 cotton farmers in developing countries have obtained Fairtrade certification. The minimum price that Fair trade pays allows cotton farmers to sustain and improve their livelihoods.<ref name=\"Farmers' self-determination\">Singh Anup Kumar. in E+Z / D+C [http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/fairtrade-improving-cotton-farmers-lot-africa-and-india] February, 2015</ref> Fair trade textiles are frequently grouped with fair trade crafts and goods made by artisans in contrast to cocoa, coffee, sugar, tea, and honey, which are agricultural commodities.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==== Locations ====\nIndia, Pakistan and West Africa are the primary exporters of fair trade cotton, although many countries grow fair trade cotton.<ref name=\"Bassett, Thomas J 2010\">Bassett, Thomas J. \"Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa.\" Geoforum, 2010. 41(1): 44-55</ref><ref name=\"Littrell, M.

Dickson. \"Fair Trade Performance in a Competitive Market.\" Clothing and Textiles Research Journal 16.4 (1998): 176-89</ref> Textiles and clothing are exported from Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==== Labour ====\nLabour is different for textile production than for agricultural commodities because textile production takes place in a factory, not on a farm. Children provide a source of cheap labor, and [[child labor]] is prevalent in Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Fair trade cooperatives ensure fair and safe labor practices, including disallowing child labor.<ref name=\"Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000\">Grimes, Kimberly M., and B. Lynne Milgram. Artisans and Cooperatives: Developing Alternative Trade for the Global Economy. Tucson: University of Arizona, 2000.</ref> Fair trade textile producers are most often women in developing countries. They struggle with meeting the consumer tastes in North America and Europe. In Nepal, textiles were originally made for household and local use. In the 1990s, women began joining cooperatives and exporting their crafts for profit. Now handicrafts are Nepal's largest export. It is often difficult for women to balance textile production, domestic responsibilities, and agricultural work. Cooperatives foster the growth of democratic communities in which women have a voice despite being historically in underprivileged positions.<ref name=\"Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000\" /> For fair trade textiles and other crafts to be successful in western markets, [[World Fair Trade Organization]]s require a flexible workforce of artisans in need of stable income, links from consumers to artisans, and a market for quality ethnic products.<ref name=\"Littrell, M. A. 1998\" />\n\nHowever, making cotton and textiles fair trade does not always benefit laborers. Burkina Faso and Mali export the largest amount of cotton in Africa. Although many cotton plantations in these countries attained fair trade certification in the 1990s, participation in fair trade further ingrains existing power relations and inequalities that cause poverty in Africa rather than challenging them. Fair trade does not do much for farmers when it does not challenge the system that marginalizes producers. Despite not empowering farmers, the change to fair trade cotton has positive effects including female participation in cultivation.<ref name=\"Bassett, Thomas J 2010\" />\n\nTextiles and garments are intricate and require one individual operator, in contrast to the collective farming of coffee and cocoa beans. Textiles are not a straightforward commodity because to be fairly traded, there must be regulation in cotton cultivation, dyeing, stitching, and every other step in the process of textile production.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Fair trade textiles must not be confused with the sweat-free movement although the two movements intersect at the worker level.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nForced or unfair labor in textile production is not limited to developing countries. Charges of use of [[sweatshop]] labor are endemic in the United States. Immigrant women work long hours and receive less than minimum wage. In the United States, there is more of a stigma against child labor than forced labor in general. Consumers in the United States are willing to suspend the importation of textiles made with child labor in other countries but do not expect their exports to be suspended by other countries, even when produced using [[forced labor]].<ref>Bhagwati, Jagdish. \"Trade Liberalisation And 'Fair Trade' Demands: Addressing The Environmental And Labour Standards Issues.\" World Economy 18.6 (1995): 745-759</ref>\n\n====Clothing and textile companies====\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\nFollowing are companies that use fair trade production and/or distribution techniques for clothing and textiles:\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[American Apparel]] <ref name=\"IGI Global 2016\">{{cite book | title=Handbook of Research on Green Economic Development Initiatives and Strategies | publisher=IGI Global | series=Practice, Progress, and Proficiency in Sustainability | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-5225-0441-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VFWiDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA566 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=566}}</ref>\n* [[Association for Craft Producers]]<ref name=\"ACP\">{{cite web|title=ACP |url=http://acp.org.np/about/tbl_products#about-fair |website=Association for Craft Producers|publisher=ACP| access-date=May 23, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[BeGood Clothing]] <ref name=\"IGI Global 2016\"/><ref>{{cite web | title=The secrets of going sustainable: 'It's hard to go back to business as usual' | website=The Guardian | date=December 20, 2013 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/20/secrets-going-sustainable-business | access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Champa Craft]]\n* [[Cherie Amie]] <ref name=\"IGI Global 2016\"/>\n* [[Maggie's Organics]] <ref name=\"IGI Global 2016\"/>\n* [[MUD Jeans]] <ref>{{cite book | last=Muthu | first=S.S. | title=Roadmap to Sustainable Textiles and Clothing: Environmental and Social Aspects of Textiles and Clothing Supply Chain | publisher=Springer Singapore | series=Textile Science and Clothing Technology | year=2014 | isbn=978-981-287-110-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O_ssBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA224 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=224}}</ref>\n* [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] <ref>{{cite book | last=Burns | first=L.D. | last2=Mullet | first2=K.K. | last3=Bryant | first3=N.O. | title=The Business of Fashion: Designing, Manufacturing, and Marketing | publisher=Bloomsbury Academic | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-5013-1521-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYLNDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA262 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=262}}</ref>\n* [[Olibert\u00e9]] <ref>{{cite book | last=Black | first=K. | title=Magnifeco: Your Head-to-Toe Guide to Ethical Fashion and Non-toxic Beauty | publisher=New Society Publishers | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-55092-590-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1P54CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA172 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=172}}</ref>\n{{Div col end}}\n*[[The Ethical Olive]] https://web.archive.org/web/20180825202848/https://www.theethicalolive.com/\n\n=== Seafood ===\nWith increasing media scrutiny of the conditions of fishermen, particularly Southeast Asia, the lack of transparency and traceability in the [[seafood]] industry prompted new efforts.

Furthermore, the same year, the [[European Parliament]] adopted the \"Resolution on promoting fairness and solidarity in North South trade\" (OJ C 44, 14 February 1994), a resolution voicing its support for fair trade. In 1996, the [[Economic and Social Committee]] adopted an \"Opinion on the European 'Fair Trade' marking movement\". A year later, in 1997, the document was followed by a resolution adopted by the European Parliament, calling on the [[European Commission]] to support Fair Trade banana operators. The same year, the European Commission published a survey on \"Attitudes of EU consumers to Fair Trade bananas\", concluding that Fair Trade bananas would be commercially viable in several EU Member States.<ref name=\"FINE2006\">FINE (2006).

In 2000, public institutions in Europe started purchasing Fairtrade Certified coffee and tea.

In 2005, in the European Commission communication \"Policy Coherence for Development \u2013 Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals\", (COM(2005) 134 final, 12 April 2005), fair trade is mentioned as \"a tool for poverty reduction and sustainable development\".<ref name=\"FINE2006\" />\n\nOn July 6, 2006, the European Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on fair trade, recognizing the benefits achieved by the Fair Trade movement, suggesting the development of an EU-wide policy on Fair Trade, defining criteria that need to be fulfilled under fair trade to protect it from abuse and calling for greater support to Fair Trade (EP resolution \"Fair Trade and development\", 6 July 2006). \"This resolution responds to the impressive growth of Fair Trade, showing the increasing interest of European consumers in responsible purchasing,\" said [[European Green Party|Green]] MEP [[Frithjof Schmidt]] during the plenary debate.

After several months of discussions and legal challenges, the province of Groningen prevailed in a well-publicized judgement. Coen de Ruiter, director of the Max Havelaar Foundation, called the victory a landmark event: \"it provides governmental institutions the freedom in their purchasing policy to require suppliers to provide coffee that bears the fair trade criteria, so that a substantial and meaningful contribution is made in the fight against poverty through the daily cup of coffee\".<ref>Max Havelaar Foundation (2007).

The cooperatives incur costs in reaching fair trade political standards, and these are incurred on all production, even if only a small amount is sold at fair trade prices. The most successful cooperatives appear to spend a third of the extra price received on this: some less successful cooperatives spend more than they gain. While this appears to be agreed by proponents and critics of fair trade,<ref>e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua.

The rest is stated to be spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.\n\nAnecdotes state that farmers were paid more or less by traders than by fair trade cooperatives. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets,<ref>See Bowbrick, P, \"Are price reporting systems of any use?\", British Food Journal. 90(2) 65\u201369 March/April. 1988. Current international research on developing world market information systems is given at [http://www.sim2g.org/ sim2.org]</ref> and few appreciate the complexity of the different price packages which may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they pay less than traders at some times, more at others. Bassett (2009)<ref>Bassett, T. (2009). Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa. Geoforum.</ref> is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs they incur to produce fair trade. For instance, fair trade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, which resulted in a higher price per pound, but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.<ref>Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., & Villalobos, A. (2006). \"Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee\". ''Journal of Business Research'' 59(3), 322\u2013330.; Valkila, J. (2009).

Coffee and Crisis in Nicaragua. Geoforum.</ref>\n\n==== Effects of low barriers to entry ====\nA 2015 study concluded that the low barriers to entry in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through fair trade. They used data from Central America, to establish that the producer benefits were close to zero. This is because there is an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade is actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.<ref name=\"mitpressjournals.org\"/>\n\n=== Inefficient marketing system ===\nOne reason for high prices is that fair trade farmers have to sell through a [[monopsonist]] cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt \u2013 certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt<ref>Mendoza, R., & J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), p. 42.</ref> if they wish to retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. [[Brink Lindsey]] calls fair trade a \"misguided attempt to make up for market failures\" encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.<ref name=\"Brink\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517134810/http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-17 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Fair trade harms other farmers ===\n\n==== Overproduction argument ====\nCritics argue that fair trade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers.

As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The fair trade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-fair trade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Other ethical issues ===\n\n==== Secrecy ====\nUnder EU law ([[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|Directive 2005/29/EC]] on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) 'it contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs ... and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice ... [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.' [[Peter Griffiths (politician)| \t\nPeter Griffiths]] (2011)<ref name=\"EthicalObjections\" /> points to false claims that fair trade producers get higher prices, the almost universal failure to disclose the extra price charged for fair trade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the developing world, to disclose what this is spent on in the developing world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-fair trade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries.\n\n==== Unethical selling techniques ====\n[[Philip Booth (economist)|Philip Booth]] says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and some supporters of fair trade are bullying, misleading, and unethical.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&ID=437 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906121402/http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&ID=437 |archive-date=2009-09-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There are problems with the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect.

French author and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] correspondent [[Jean-Pierre Boris]] championed this view in his 2005 book ''Commerce in\u00e9quitable''.<ref>{{Citation | last = Boris | first = Jean-Pierre | year = 2005 | title = Commerce in\u00e9quitable | publisher = Hachette Litt\u00e9ratures | place = Paris}}</ref>\n\n=== Political objections ===\nThere have been largely political criticisms of fair trade from the left and the right. Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. French author Christian Jacquiau, in his book ''Les coulisses du commerce \u00e9quitable'', calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e., partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s, etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous (i.e. [[state monopoly|government monopoly]]) trading system. Jacquiau also supports significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the effect, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms.{{Sfn | Jacquiau | 2006}}{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. \"A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power in order to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth.\"<ref>Catherine S.

Secondly, the world trade practices that currently exist promote the unequal [[distribution of wealth]] between nations. Lastly, buying products from producers in developing countries at a fair price is a more efficient way of promoting sustainable development than traditional charity and aid.\n\nFair trade labelling organizations commonly use a definition of ''fair trade'' developed by [[FINE]], an informal association of four international fair trade networks: [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA). Specifically, fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade.

The nature of fair trade makes it a global phenomenon, therefore, there are diverse motives for understanding group formation related to fair trade. The social transformation caused by the fair trade movement also varies around the world.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Fair Trade from the Ground Up|last=Linton|first=April|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-295-99172-6|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Young women soil testing.jpg|thumb|Three young Nicaraguan women demonstrate to visiting US buyers and consumers the use of organic soil testing methods.|alt=Teaching organic soil testing in Nicaragua.]]\n\nA study of coffee growers in Guatemala illustrates the effect of fair trade practices on growers. In this study, thirty-four farmers were interviewed. Of those thirty-four growers, twenty-two had an understanding of fair trade based on internationally recognized definitions, for example, describing fair trade in market and economical terms or knowing what the social premium is and how their cooperative has used it. Three growers explained a deep understanding of fair trade, showing a knowledge of both fair market principles and how fair trade affects them socially. Nine growers had erroneous or no knowledge of Fair Trade.<ref name=\":2\" /> The three growers who had a deeper knowledge of the social implications of fair trade all have responsibilities within their cooperatives. One is a manager, one is in charge of the wet mill, and one is his group's treasurer. These farmers did not have a pattern in terms of years of education, age, or years of membership in the cooperative; their answers to the questions, \"Why did you join?\" differentiate them from other members and explain why they have such an extensive knowledge of fair trade. These farmers cited switching to organic farming, wanting to raise money for social projects, and more training offered as reasons for joining the cooperative, other than receiving a better price for their coffee.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMany farmers around the world are unaware of fair trade practices that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage. Coffee is one of the most highly traded commodities in the world, yet the farmers who grow it typically earn less than $2 a day.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fair Trade Awareness and Engagement: A Coffee Farmer's Perspective|last = Fergus|first = Andrew|date = 2014|journal = Journal of the Center of Business Ethics, Bentley University|doi = 10.1111/basr.12037|pmid = |last2 = Gray |volume=119 |issue = 3|pages=359\u2013384}}</ref> When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Mart\u00edn de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that they have heard about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their [[cooperatives]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSome producers also profit from the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers feel like they have control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAs far as farmers' satisfaction with the fair trade system, the growers want consumers to know that fair trade has provided important support to their families and their cooperative. Overall, farmers are satisfied with the current fair trade system, but some farmers, such as the Mazaronquiari group from CAC Pangoa, desire yet a higher price for their products in order to live a higher quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social premium ===\nA component of trade is the social premium that buyers of fair trade goods pay to the producers or producer-groups of such goods. An important factor of the fair trade social premium is that the producers or producer-groups decide where and how it is spent. These premiums usually go towards socioeconomic development, wherever the producers or producer-groups see fit. Within producer-groups, the decisions about how the social premium will be spent is handled democratically, with transparency and participation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nProducers and producer-groups spend this social premium to support socioeconomic development in a variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These public goods include environment initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers' salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFarmers' organisations that use their social premium for public goods often finance educational scholarships. For example, Costa Rican coffee co-operative, Coocaf\u00e9, has supported hundreds of children and youth at school and university through the financing of scholarships from funding from their fair trade social premium. In terms of education, the social premium can be used to build and furnish schools too.<ref>{{Cite book|title = 50 Reasons to Buy Fair Trade|last = Litvinoff|first = Miles|publisher = Pluto Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-7453-2584-2|location = |pages = |last2 = Madeley|first2 = John|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/50reasonstobuyfa0000litv}}</ref>\n\n== Organizations Promoting Fair Trade ==\nMost of the fair trade import organizations are members of, or certified by one of several national or international federations. These federations coordinate, promote, and facilitate the work of fair trade organizations. The following are some of the largest:\n*[[FLO International]] (Fairtrade International), created in 1997, is an association of three producer networks and twenty national labeling initiatives that develop Fairtrade standards, license buyers, label usage and market the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fair trade Certification Mark]] in consuming countries. The Fairtrade International labeling system is the largest and most widely recognized standard setting and certification body for [[Fairtrade labeling|labeled Fair trade]]. Formerly named Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, it changed its name to Fairtrade International in 2009, when its producer certification and standard setting activities were separated into two separate, but connected entities. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.<ref name=\"FLOCERT\" /> Fairtrade International, the non-profit arm, oversees standards development and licensing organization activity. Only products from certain developing countries are eligible for certification, and for some products such as coffee and cocoa, certification is restricted to cooperatives. Cooperatives and large estates with hired labor may be certified for bananas, tea and other crops.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fair trade | contribution = Generic standards | contribution-url = http://www.fairtrade.net/generic_standards.html}}</ref>\n* [[Fair Trade USA]]<ref>{{Citation | title = Fair trade | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/ | place = US}}</ref> is an independent, nonprofit organization that sets standards, certifies, and labels products that promote sustainable livelihoods for farmers and workers and protect the environment. Founded in 1998, Fair Trade USA currently partners with over 1,000 brands, as well as 1.3 million farmers and workers across the globe.<ref>{{Citation | year = 2014 | title = General media kit | publisher = Fair trade | place = US | url = http://fairtradeusa.org/sites/default/files/General%20Media%20Kit%202014.pdf}}</ref>\n* [[Global Goods Partners]] (GGP), a fair-trade nonprofit organization, founded in 2005, which provides support and U.S. market access to women-led cooperatives in the developing world. \n* [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (formerly the International Fair Trade Association) is a global association created in 1989 of fair trade producer cooperatives and associations, export marketing companies, importers, retailers, national, and regional fair trade networks and fair trade support organizations. In 2004 WFTO launched the FTO Mark which identifies registered fair trade organizations (as opposed to the FLO system, which labels products).\n* The [[Network of European Worldshops]] (NEWS!), created in 1994, is the umbrella network of 15 national [[worldshop]] associations in 13 different countries all over Europe.\n* The [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA), created in 1990, is a network of European [[alternative trading organization]]s which import products from some 400 economically disadvantaged producer groups in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. EFTA's goal is to promote fair trade and to make fair trade importing more efficient and effective. The organization also publishes yearly various publications on the evolution of the fair trade market. EFTA currently has eleven members in nine different countries.\n\nIn 1998, the first four federations listed above joined together as [[FINE]], an informal association whose goal is to harmonize fair trade standards and guidelines, increase the quality and efficiency of fair trade monitoring systems, and advocate fair trade politically.\n* Additional certifiers include IMO (Fair for Life, Social and Fair Trade labels), Eco-Social and Fair Trade USA.\n* The [[Fair Trade Federation]] (FTF), created in 1994, is an association of Canadian and American fair trade wholesalers, importers, and retailers. The organization links its members to fair trade producer groups while acting as a clearinghouse for information on fair trade and providing resources and networking opportunities to its members. Members self-certify adherence to defined fair trade principles for 100% of their purchasing/business. Those who sell products certifiable by Fairtrade International must be 100% certified by FI to join FTF.\n\nStudent groups have also been increasingly active in the past years promoting fair trade products.<ref name=\"fairtradecampaigns.org\">{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/universities/ |title=Universities &#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}</ref> Although hundreds of independent student organizations are active worldwide, most groups in North America are either affiliated with United Students for Fair Trade (USA, the Canadian Student Fair Trade Network (Canada), or Fair Trade Campaigns<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/|title=Fair Trade Campaigns|website=fairtradecampaigns.org}}</ref> (USA), which also houses Fair Trade Universities<ref name=\"fairtradecampaigns.org\" /> and Fair Trade Schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fairtradecampaigns.org/campaign-type/schools/ |title=Schools &#124; Campaign Types |publisher=Fair Trade Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}</ref>\n\nThe involvement of church organizations has been and continues to be an integral part of the Fair Trade movement:\n* [[Ten Thousand Villages]]<ref name=\"tenthousandvillages.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tenthousandvillages.com/|title=Fair Trade Handmade Gifts & Crafts from International Artisans - Ten Thousand Villages|website=www.tenthousandvillages.com}}</ref> is affiliated with the Mennonite Central Committee<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tenthousandvillages.com/about-history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Ten Thousand Villages |accessdate=2013-05-01}}</ref>\n* SERRV<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serrv.org/|title=Fair Trade Home Decor, Jewelry, Baskets, Gifts, Food: Shop Serrv|website=SERRV}}</ref> is partnered with Catholic Relief Services<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crs.org/|title=Home|website=CRS}}</ref> and Lutheran World Relief<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lwr.org/|title=Lutheran World Relief - Lutheran World Relief|website=www.lwr.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serrv.org/category/our-story |title=Our Story |publisher=SERRV |accessdate=2013-05-01}}</ref>\n* Village Markets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagemarkets.org/|title=Village Markets - Empowering People to Work Their Way Out of Poverty Through Fair Trade|website=www.villagemarkets.org|access-date=2012-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326071810/http://www.villagemarkets.org/|archive-date=2012-03-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> is a Lutheran Fair Trade organization connecting mission sites around the world with churches in the United States<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.villagemarkets.org/fundraisers |title=Fair Trade in Your Church! |publisher=Villagemarkets.org |accessdate=2013-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602155330/http://www.villagemarkets.org/fundraisers |archive-date=2013-06-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelutheran.org/article/article.cfm?article_id=10300&key=106089998 |title='God's love is what they pass on' : Fair trade is a mission for a Wittenberg University grad, students and faculty |publisher=The Lutheran |date=2012-03-29 |access-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116021920/http://www.thelutheran.org/article/article.cfm?article_id=10300&key=106089998 |archive-date=2013-01-16 |df= }}</ref>\n* Catholic Relief Services has their own Fair Trade mission in CRS Fair Trade<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crsfairtrade.org/|title=Home - CRS Ethical Trade|website=CRS Ethical Trade}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crsfairtrade.org/what-is-fair-trade/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730101755/http://www.crsfairtrade.org/what-is-fair-trade/ |archive-date=2014-07-30 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of fair trade}}\nThe first attempts to commercialize fair trade goods in Northern markets were initiated in the 1940s and 1950s by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs). Ten Thousand Villages, an NGO within the [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade [[supply chain]]s in developing countries.<ref>{{Citation | title = History | url = http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml | publisher = IFAT | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061215142239/http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml | archive-date = 2006-12-15 | df =  }}</ref> The products, almost exclusively handicrafts ranging from [[jute]] goods to [[cross-stitch]] work, were mostly sold in churches or fairs.

Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against neo-imperialism: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The slogan at the time, \"Trade not Aid\", gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the developing world.<ref>{{cite web | archivedate = October 22, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141022065406/http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10&Itemid=17&limit=1&limitstart=1 | url = http://www.wfto.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10&Itemid=17&limit=1&limitstart=1 |title= Where did it all begin?| accessdate = 24 June 2009 | date = 7 June 2009|publisher= WFTO}}</ref>\n\nThe year 1965 saw the creation of the first [[Alternative Trading Organization]] (ATO): that year, British NGO [[Oxfam]] launched \"Helping-by-Selling\", a program which sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the UK and from mail-order catalogues.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = One Village | place = Charlbury, UK |url= http://onevillage.org/fairtrade-history.htm |title = Fair trade history | last = Scott | first = Roy | date=2003-03-07 |accessdate= 2013-05-01}}</ref>\n\nBy 1968, the oversized newsprint publication, the [[Whole Earth Catalog]], was connecting thousands of specialized merchants, artisans, and scientists directly with consumers who were interested in supporting independent producers, with the goal of bypassing corporate retail and department stores. The Whole Earth Catalog sought to balance the international free market by allowing direct purchasing of goods produced primarily in US and Canada, but also in Central and South America.\n\nIn 1969, the first [[worldshop]] opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods produced under fair trade terms in \"underdeveloped regions\". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, Germany, and other Western European countries.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from Angola and Nicaragua in worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes, and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world's market.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}\n\n=== Handicrafts vs. agricultural goods ===\nIn the early 1980s, [[Alternative Trading Organizations]] faced major challenges: the novelty of some fair trade products began to wear off, demand reached a plateau, and some handicrafts began to look \"tired and old fashioned\" in the marketplace. The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, several fair trade supporters during this period were worried by the contemporary effect on small farmers of structural reforms in the agricultural sector as well as the fall in [[commodity]] prices. Many of them came to believe it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and remedies usable in the ongoing crisis in the industry.\n\nIn the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a much-needed, renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations a complement to the handicrafts market. The first fair trade agricultural products were tea and coffee, quickly followed by: dried fruits, cocoa, sugar, fruit juices, rice, spices and nuts. While in 1992, a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm, in 2002 handcrafts amounted to 25% of fair trade sales while commodity food lines were up at 69%.<ref>Nicholls, A. & Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.</ref>\n\n=== Rise of labeling initiatives ===\n[[File:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]]<!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at [[:File:Oldftlogos2.jpg]] for rationale -->Sales of fair trade products only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade certification]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0743-0167(02)00051-7 | last = Renard | first = M-C | year= 2003| title = Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions | url = |journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=19 | pages =87\u201396}}</ref> The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.\n\nA solution was found in 1988, when the first Fairtrade certification initiative, [[Stichting Max Havelaar|Max Havelaar]], was created in the Netherlands under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans Van Der Hoff]], and Dutch development NGO [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the worldshops and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the supply chain.\n\nThe concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America. In 1997, a process of convergence among labelling organizations \u2013 or \"LIs\" (for \"Labeling Initiatives\") \u2013 led to the creation of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers, and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/tasks.html | title = Main Tasks | work = Fair trade | accessdate = 27 January 2009 | year=2006 | publisher = FLO International}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, FLO launched for the first time an International Fairtrade Certification Mark. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade, and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. At present, the certification mark is used in over 50 countries and on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine, [[Football (ball)|footballs]], etc.\n\nWith the rise of ethical labeling, consumers are able to take moral responsibility for their economic decisions and actions. This supports the notion of fair trade practices as \"moral economies.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> The presence of labeling give consumers the feeling of \"doing the right thing\" with a simple purchase.\n\nThese labeling practices place the burden of getting certification on the producers in the Global South, furthering inequality between the Global North and the Global South. The process of securing certification is excessively burdensome and expensive. Northern consumers are able to just make a simple choice without these burdens and expenses.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Alternative production and consumption relations?: fair trade, the state, and cooperatives in the global South|journal = Journal of Contemporary African Studies|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 0258-9001|pages = 1\u201317|volume = 31|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/02589001.2012.752958|first = Michelle|last = Williams}}</ref>\n\n== Psychology ==\nConsumers of fair trade products usually make the intentional choice to purchase fair trade goods based on attitude, moral norms, perceived behavioral control, and social norms.

Farmers are more likely to identify with [[organic farming]] than fair trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods.<ref name=\":0\" /> Fair trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Product certification ==\n{{Main|Fair trade certification}}\n''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to the FLO product labeling system, see [[Fairtrade certification]]''\n[[File:Fairtrade Certification Mark.svg|thumb|200px|International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]\nFairtrade labelling (usually simply Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is a certification system designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body ([[FLO International]]) and a certification body ([[FLO-CERT]]), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met. For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade Certification Mark or the [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the international Fair trade standards set by FLO International. The supply chain must also have been monitored by FLO-CERT, to ensure the integrity of the labelled product.\n\nFairtrade certification purports to guarantee not only fair prices, but also the principles of [[ethical purchasing]]. These principles include adherence to ILO agreements such as those banning child and [[slave labour]], guaranteeing a safe workplace and the right to unionise, adherence to the [[United Nations]] charter of [[human rights]], a fair price that covers the cost of production and facilitates social development, and protection and conservation of the environment. The Fairtrade certification system also attempts to promote long-term business relationships between buyers and sellers, crop prefinancing, and greater transparency throughout the supply chain and more.\n\nThe Fairtrade certification system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine. Companies offering products that meet the Fairtrade standards may apply for licences to use one of the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products. The International Fairtrade Certification Mark was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with the exception of the United States). The Fair Trade Certified Mark is still used to identify Fairtrade goods in the United States.\n\nThere is widespread confusion because the fair trade industry standards provided by Fairtrade International (The Fairtrade Labelling Organization) use the word \"producer\" in many different senses, often in the same specification document.

The FTO Mark offers Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable standards which inform consumers, business partners, governments, and donors of the applicable trading standard. in 2014 the Fairtrade Program Mark was introduced to create new sales opportunities, initially for cocoa, sugar and cotton producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fairtrade-sourcing-programs.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}</ref> It has the same round logo alongside the word '''FAIRTRADE''' in black and underneath the program title in '''<span style=\"color:turquoise\">turquoise</span>'''.\n\n== Alternative trading organizations ==\n{{Main|Alternative trading organization}}\n[[File:Cafedirectcoffeeshop.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cafedirect]] coffee shop on [[Regent Street]] in central London.]]\n\nAn alternative trading organization (ATO) is usually a non-governmental organization (NGO) or mission-driven business aligned with the Fair Trade movement, aiming \"to contribute to the alleviation of poverty in developing regions of the world by establishing a system of trade that allows marginalized producers in developing regions to gain access to developed markets\".<ref name=\"European Fair 1998 p.23 & 25\">European Fair Trade Association (1998).

Philosophically, the grassroots political-action agenda of these organizations associates them with progressive political causes active since the 1960s: foremost, a belief in [[collective action]] and commitment to moral principles based on social, economic and [[trade justice]].\n\nAccording to EFTA, the defining characteristic of alternative trading organizations is that of equal partnership and respect \u2013 partnership between the developing region producers and importers, shops, labelling organizations, and consumers. Alternative trade \"humanizes\" the trade process \u2013 making the producer-consumer chain as short as possible so that consumers become aware of the culture, identity, and conditions in which producers live. All actors are committed to the principle of alternative trade, the need for advocacy in their working relations and the importance of awareness-raising and advocacy work.<ref name=\"European Fair 1998 p.23 & 25\" /> Examples of such organisations are Ten Thousand Villages, Greenheart Shop, [[Equal Exchange]] and SERRV International in the US and [[Equal Exchange Trading]], [[Traidcraft]], Oxfam Trading, [[Twin Trading]] and Alter Eco in Europe as well as Siem Fair Trade Fashion in Australia.\n\n== Universities ==\nThe concept of a Fair Trade school or Fair Trade university emerged from the [[United Kingdom]], where the Fairtrade Foundation now maintains a list of colleges and schools that comply with the needed requirements to be labeled such a university. In order to be considered a Fair Trade University, a school or university must have established a Fairtrade School Steering Group. They must have a written and implemented a school-wide Fair Trade Policy. The school or university must be dedicated to selling and using Fair Trade products. They have to learn and educate about Fair Trade issues. Finally, the Fairtrade Foundation requires that schools promote Fair Trade not only within the school, but throughout the wider community.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA Fair Trade University is one that develops all aspects of Fair Trade practices in their coursework. In 2007, the Director of the Environmental Studies program at the [[University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh]], David Barnhill, started a push to become the first Fair Trade University. This push received positive reactions from faculty and students. To begin the process, the University as a whole agreed that it would need support from four institutional groups\u2014faculty, staff, support staff, and students\u2014to maximize support and educational efforts. The University officially endorsed the Earth Charter and created a Campus Sustainability Plan to align with the efforts of becoming a Fair Trade University.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe University of Wisconsin- Oshkosh also offers many courses in many different disciplines that implement fair trade learning. They offer a business course with a trip to [[Peru]] to visit coffee farmers, an environmental science class that discusses fair trade as a way for cleaner food systems, an English course that focuses on the [[Earth Charter]] and the application of fair trade principles, and several upper-level anthropology courses make fair trade the center of the class.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title = Sustainability in Higher Education|last = Feldman|first = James|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-262-01949-1|location = |pages = 241\u2013248|last2 = Barnhill|jstor = j.ctt9qf6bw.26}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 2010, the [[University of California, San Diego]] became the second Fair Trade University in the United States. The University of California at San Diego understood the efforts of the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK, but they recognized they wanted to be more detailed about how their declaration as a Fair Trade University would make an actual change in the way on-campus franchises do business with the university. They also required constant assessment and improvement. The main premise of being a Fair Trade University for the University of California at San Diego is the promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of Fair Trade Certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as buying from local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFair Trade Universities have been successful because they are a \"feel good\" movement. The movement also has an established history, making it a true movement rather just a fad. Thirdly, Fair Trade Universities are effective because they raise awareness about an issue and offer a solution. The solution is an easy one for college students to handle, just paying about five cents more for a cup of coffee or tea can make a real difference.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Worldshops ==\n{{Main|Worldshop}}\n[[File:Oxfam shop on Drury Lane.jpg|thumb|[[Oxfam#Shops|Oxfam shop]] on [[Drury Lane]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]]]\nWorldshops or fair trade shops are specialized retail outlets offering and promoting fair trade products. Worldshops also typically organize various educational fair trade activities and play an active role in trade justice and other North-South political campaigns. Worldshops are often [[not-for-profit]] organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks. Although the movement emerged in Europe and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in North America, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWorldshops' aim is to make trade as direct and fair with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a [[developing country]] and consumers in [[industrialisation|industrialized]] countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees substinence and guarantees positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain. A web movement has begun in the 2000s to provide fair trade items at fair prices to the consumers. One popular one is Fair Trade a Day<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fairtradeaday.com/|title=fairtradeday.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705004023/http://fairtradeaday.com/|archive-date=2018-07-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> where a different fair trade item is featured each day.\n\n== World wide ==\nEvery year the sales of Fair Trade products grow close to 30% and in 2004 were worth over $500 million USD.

The first is the Australia and New Zealand member of FLO International, which unites Fairtrade producer and labelling initiatives across Europe, Asia, Latin America, North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The second, is the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), of over 450 worldwide members, to which FTAANZ is one. Fairtrade (one word) refers to FLO certified commodity and associated products. Fair trade (two words) encompasses the wider Fair Trade movement, including the Fairtrade commodities and other artisan craft products.\n\n==Commodities ==\nFair trade commodities are goods that have been exchanged from where they were grown or made to where they are purchased, and have been certified by a fair trade certification organization, such as [[Fair Trade USA]] or [[World Fair Trade Organization]]. Such organizations are typically overseen by Fairtrade International. Fairtrade International sets international fair trade standards and supports fair trade producers and cooperatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/about_us.html |title=Fairtrade International (FLO): Fairtrade International |publisher=Fairtrade.net |date=2017-09-17 |accessdate=2017-11-13}}</ref> Sixty percent of the fair trade market revolves around food products such as coffee, tea, cocoa, honey, and bananas.<ref name=\"Raynolds, Laura 2000\">Raynolds, Laura. \"Re-embedding Global Agriculture: The International Organic and Fair Trade Movements.\" Agriculture and Human Values 17.3 (2000): 297-309.

Most Fair Trade coffee is ''[[Coffea arabica]],'' a type of coffee known to be grown at high altitudes. A lot of emphasis is put on the quality of the coffee when dealing in Fair Trade markets because Fair Trade markets are usually specialized markets that appeal to customers who are motivated by taste rather than price. The Fair Trade movement fixated on coffee first because it is a highly traded commodity for most producing countries and almost half the world's coffee is produced by smallholder farmers.<ref name=\":2\" /> While initially sold at small scale, currently multinationals like Starbucks and Nestl\u00e9 use fair trade coffee.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement|url = http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/1/94|journal = Social Problems|date = 2012-02-01|issn = 0037-7791|pages = 94\u2013116|volume = 59|issue = 1|doi = 10.1525/sp.2012.59.1.94|first = Daniel|last = Jaffee}}</ref>\n\nInternationally recognized Fair Trade coffee standards have been outlined by FLO and are as follows: small producers are grouped in democratic cooperatives or groups, buyers and sellers establish long-term, stable relationships, buyers must pay the producers at least the minimum Fair Trade price or when the market price is higher, they must pay the market price, and finally, buyers must also pay a social premium of 20 cents per pound of coffee to the producers. The current minimum Fair Trade price for high-grade, washed Arabica coffee $1.40 per pound; the price increases to $1.70 per pound if the coffee is also organic.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Locations ====\nThe largest sources of fair trade coffee are Uganda and Tanzania, followed by Latin American countries such as Guatemala and Costa Rica.<ref name=\"Raynolds, Laura 2000\" /> As of 1999, major importers of fair trade coffee included Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. There is a North/South divide between fair trade consumers and producers. North American countries are not yet among the top importers of fair trade coffee.<ref name=\"Raynolds, Laura 2000\" />\n\n==== Labour ====\nStarbucks began to purchase more fair trade coffee in 2001 because of charges of labor rights violations in Central American plantations. Several competitors, including Nestl\u00e9, followed suit.<ref name=\"Jaffee, Daniel 2012 pp. 94-116\">Jaffee, Daniel: \"Weak Coffee: Certification and Co-Optation in the Fair Trade Movement.\" Social Problems, Vol. 59, No. 1 (February 2012), pp. 94-116</ref> Large corporations that sell non-fair trade coffee take 55% of what consumers pay for coffee while only 10% goes to the producers. Small growers dominate the production of coffee, especially in Latin American countries such as Peru. Coffee is the fastest expanding fairly traded commodity, and an increasing number of producers are small farmers that own their own land and work in cooperatives. Even the incomes of growers of fair trade coffee beans depend on the market value of coffee where it is consumed, so farmers of fair trade coffee do not necessarily live above the poverty line or get completely fair prices for their commodity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ransom, David. The No-nonsense Guide to Fair Trade. Oxford: New Internationalist Publications, 2001</ref>\n\nUnsustainable farming practices can harm plantation owners and laborers. Unsustainable practices such as using chemicals and unshaded growing are risky. Small growers who put themselves at economic risk by not having diverse farming practices could lose money and resources due to fluctuating coffee prices, pest problems, or policy shifts.<ref name=\"Rice, Robert A 1999\">Rice, Robert A (1999). \"A Place Unbecoming: The Coffee Farm of Northern Latin America.\" Geographical Review: 89(4): 554-579.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of Fairtrade is questionable; workers on Fairtrade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the Fairtrade system.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2014/05/agriculture-ethiopia-and-uganda?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/notsofairtrade|accessdate=3 July 2014|title=Agriculture in Ethiopia and Uganda: Not so fair trade|work=[[The Economist]]}}</ref>\n\n==== Sustainability ====\nAs coffee becomes one of the most important export crops in certain regions such as northern Latin America, nature and agriculture are transformed. Increased productivity requires technological innovations, and the coffee agroecosystem has been changing rapidly. In the nineteenth century in Latin America, coffee plantations slowly began replacing sugarcane and subsistence crops. Coffee crops became more managed; they were put into rows and unshaded, meaning diversity of the forest was decreased and [[Coffea]] trees were shorter. As plant and tree diversity decreased, so did animal diversity. Unshaded plantations allow for a higher density of Coffea trees, but negative effects include less protection from wind and more easily eroded soil. Technified coffee plantations also use chemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.<ref name=\"Rice, Robert A 1999\" />\n\nFair trade certified commodities must adhere to sustainable agro-ecological practices, including reduction of chemical fertilizer use, prevention of erosion, and protection of forests. Coffee plantations are more likely to be fair trade certified if they use traditional farming practices with shading and without chemicals. This protects the biodiversity of the ecosystem and ensures that the land will be usable for farming in the future and not just for short-term planting.<ref name=\"Raynolds, Laura 2000\" /> In the United States, 85% of fair trade certified coffee is also organic.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">DeCarlo, Jacqueline. Fair Trade: A Beginner's Guide. Oxford, England: Oneworld, 2007</ref>\n\n==== Consumer attitudes ====\nConsumers typically have positive attitudes for products that are ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often are not willing to pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say they would be willing to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pelsmacker | first1 = De | last2 = Patrick | last3 = Driesen | first3 = Liesbeth | last4 = Rayp | first4 = Glenn | year = 2005| title = Do Consumers Care about Ethics?

In Africa in particular, governments tax cocoa as their main source of revenue. Cocoa is a permanent crop, which means that it occupies land for long periods of time and does not need to be replanted after each harvest.<ref name=\"Willer and Yussefi 2008\">Willer, Helga; Yussefi-Menzler, Minou und Sorensen, Neil, (Hrsg.) (2008) \"The World of Organic Agriculture \u2013 Statistics and Emerging Trends 2008.\" IFOAM, Bonn and FiBL, Frick</ref>\n\n==== Locations ====\nCocoa is farmed in the tropical regions of West Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. In Latin America, cocoa is produced in Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. Much of the cocoa produced in Latin America is an organic and regulated by an [[Internal control]] system. Bolivia has fair trade cooperatives that permit a fair share of money for cocoa producers. African cocoa-producing countries include Cameroon, Madagascar, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.<ref name=\"Willer and Yussefi 2008\" /> C\u00f4te d'Ivoire exports over a third of the world's cocoa beans.<ref name=\"Brown, Michael Barratt 2007\">Brown, Michael Barratt. \"'Fair Trade' with Africa.\" Review of African Political Economy 34.112 (2007): 267-77</ref> Southeast Asia accounts for about 14% of the world's cocoa production. Major cocoa-producing countries are Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldcocoafoundation.org/our-work/where-we-work/ |title=Where We Work |publisher=World Cocoa Foundation |date= |accessdate=2017-11-13}}</ref>\n\n==== Labour ====\nOne suggestion for the reason that laborers in Africa are marginalized in world trade is because the colonial division of labor kept Africa from developing its own industries. Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.<ref name=\"Brown, Michael Barratt 2007\" /> Most cocoa comes from small family-run farms in West Africa. These farms have little market access and thus rely on middlemen to bring their products to market. Sometimes middlemen are unfair to farmers. Farmers do not get a fair price for their product despite relying on cocoa sales for the majority of their income.<ref name=\"Houston, Holly 2012\">Houston, Holly, and Terry Wyer. \"Why Sustainable Cocoa Farming Matters for Rural Development.\" Center for Strategic and International Studies, 6 Sept. 2012.</ref> One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an [[Agricultural cooperative]]. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Michael K | year = 2004 | title = Reading fairtrade: political ecological imaginary and the moral economy of fairtrade foods | url = | journal = Political Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 7| pages = 891\u2013915 | doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2004.05.013}}</ref> One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. In reality, much of this money goes to community projects such as water wells rather than to individual farmers. Nevertheless, cooperatives such as fair trade-endorsed [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in Ghana are often the only Licensed Buying Companies that will give farmers a fair price and not cheat them or rig sales.<ref name=\"Berlan, Amanda 2008\">{{cite book | last1 = Berlan | first1 = Amanda | year = 2008 | title = Making or Marketing a Difference? An Anthropological Examination of the Marketing of Fair Trade Cocoa from Ghana | url = | journal = Research in Economic Anthropology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 171\u201394 | doi = 10.1016/S0190-1281(08)28008-X | isbn = 978-1-84855-058-2 }}</ref> Farmers in cooperatives are frequently their own bosses and get bonuses per bag of cocoa beans. These arrangements are not always assured and fair trade organizations can't always buy all of the cocoa available to them from cooperatives.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==== Marketing ====\nThe marketing of fair trade cocoa to European consumers often portrays the cocoa farmers as dependent on western purchases for their livelihood and well-being. Showing African cocoa producers in this way is problematic because it is reminiscent of the imperialistic view that Africans cannot live happily without the help of westerners. It puts the balance of power in favor of the consumers rather than the producers.<ref name=\"Berlan, Amanda 2008\" />\n\nConsumers often aren't willing to pay the extra price for fair trade cocoa because they do not know what fair trade is. Activist groups are vital in educating consumers about the unethical aspects of unfair trade and promoting demand for fairly traded commodities. Activism and ethical consumption not only promote fair trade but also act against powerful corporations such as [[Mars, Incorporated]] that refuse to acknowledge the use of forced child labor in the harvesting of their cocoa.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" />\n\n==== Sustainability ====\nSmallholding farmers not only frequently lack access to markets, they lack access to resources that lead to sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and lack of knowledge about modern farming techniques.<ref name=\"Houston, Holly 2012\" /> One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the amount of time it takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. A solution to this is to change the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.\n\n==== Cocoa companies ====\nFollowing are chocolate companies that use all or some fair trade cocoa in their chocolate:\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alter Eco]] <ref name=\"Huffington Post 2017\">{{cite web | title=A Deep Dive into Ethical Label Claims | website=HuffPost | date=April 24, 2017 | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-deep-dive-into-ethical-label-claims_us_58fe3d8ee4b0f02c3870ed2e | access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Ben & Jerry's]] <ref>{{cite web | title=Fair trade for college students | website=The Collegian | date=November 7, 2017 | url=http://www.stmaryscollegian.com/fair-trade-for-college-students/ | access-date=November 13, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113222420/http://www.stmaryscollegian.com/fair-trade-for-college-students/ | archive-date=November 13, 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Cadbury]]\n* [[Chocolove]] <ref>{{cite web | title=Top Chocolate Bars For Valentines' | website=Consumer Reports | date=February 13, 2014 | url=https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/02/top-chocolate-bars-for-valentine-s-day/index.htm | language=id | access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Dagoba Chocolate]] <ref>{{cite book | last=Robbins | first=J. | title=No Happy Cows: Dispatches from the Frontlines of the Food Revolution | publisher=Red Wheel Weiser | series=EBL-Schweitzer | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-60925-579-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aft13dfj1dIC&pg=PA125 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=125}}</ref>\n* [[Divine Chocolate]] <ref name=\"Huffington Post 2017\"/><ref name=\"HuffPost 2017\">{{cite web | title=Of Gods and Goblins | website=HuffPost | date=October 26, 2017 | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/of-gods-and-goblins_us_59f20d25e4b06ae9067ab6e7 | access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Equal Exchange]] <ref name=\"HuffPost 2017\"/>\n* [[Gepa The Fair Trade Company|GEPA]]\n* [[Green & Black's]] <ref>{{cite book | last=Anderson | first=M. | title=A History of Fair Trade in Contemporary Britain: From Civil Society Campaigns to Corporate Compliance | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-137-31330-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgVaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA122 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=122}}</ref>\n* [[Guittard Chocolate Company]] <ref>{{cite web | title=Short List / Chocolat, Voil\u00e0! | website=Observer | url=http://observer.com/2015/11/french-artistry-and-american-entrepreneurial-spirit-the-guittard-chocolate-company/ | access-date=November 13, 2017| date=2015-11-25 }}</ref>\n* [[Theo Chocolate]] <ref name=\"Huffington Post 2017\"/><ref>{{cite web | last=Chang | first=Elizabeth | title=Your ethical chocolate might be only 20 percent 'ethical' | website=Washington Post | date=April 10, 2017 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/lifestyle/your-ethical-chocolate-might-be-only-20-percent-ethical/2193/ | access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n{{Div col end}}\n* [[Tony's Chocolonely]]\n\n==== Harkin-Engel Protocol ====\nThe [[Harkin-Engel Protocol]], also commonly known as the Cocoa Protocol, is an international agreement that was created to end some of the world's worst forms of child labor, as well as forced labor in the cocoa industry.

By 2015, almost 75,000 cotton farmers in developing countries have obtained Fairtrade certification. The minimum price that Fair trade pays allows cotton farmers to sustain and improve their livelihoods.<ref name=\"Farmers' self-determination\">Singh Anup Kumar. in E+Z / D+C [http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/fairtrade-improving-cotton-farmers-lot-africa-and-india] February, 2015</ref> Fair trade textiles are frequently grouped with fair trade crafts and goods made by artisans in contrast to cocoa, coffee, sugar, tea, and honey, which are agricultural commodities.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==== Locations ====\nIndia, Pakistan and West Africa are the primary exporters of fair trade cotton, although many countries grow fair trade cotton.<ref name=\"Bassett, Thomas J 2010\">Bassett, Thomas J. \"Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa.\" Geoforum, 2010. 41(1): 44-55</ref><ref name=\"Littrell, M. A. 1998\">Littrell, M. A., and M. A. Dickson. \"Fair Trade Performance in a Competitive Market.\" Clothing and Textiles Research Journal 16.4 (1998): 176-89</ref> Textiles and clothing are exported from Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==== Labour ====\nLabour is different for textile production than for agricultural commodities because textile production takes place in a factory, not on a farm. Children provide a source of cheap labor, and [[child labor]] is prevalent in Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Fair trade cooperatives ensure fair and safe labor practices, including disallowing child labor.<ref name=\"Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000\">Grimes, Kimberly M., and B. Lynne Milgram. Artisans and Cooperatives: Developing Alternative Trade for the Global Economy. Tucson: University of Arizona, 2000.</ref> Fair trade textile producers are most often women in developing countries. They struggle with meeting the consumer tastes in North America and Europe. In Nepal, textiles were originally made for household and local use. In the 1990s, women began joining cooperatives and exporting their crafts for profit. Now handicrafts are Nepal's largest export. It is often difficult for women to balance textile production, domestic responsibilities, and agricultural work. Cooperatives foster the growth of democratic communities in which women have a voice despite being historically in underprivileged positions.<ref name=\"Grimes, Kimberly M. 2000\" /> For fair trade textiles and other crafts to be successful in western markets, [[World Fair Trade Organization]]s require a flexible workforce of artisans in need of stable income, links from consumers to artisans, and a market for quality ethnic products.<ref name=\"Littrell, M. A. 1998\" />\n\nHowever, making cotton and textiles fair trade does not always benefit laborers. Burkina Faso and Mali export the largest amount of cotton in Africa. Although many cotton plantations in these countries attained fair trade certification in the 1990s, participation in fair trade further ingrains existing power relations and inequalities that cause poverty in Africa rather than challenging them. Fair trade does not do much for farmers when it does not challenge the system that marginalizes producers. Despite not empowering farmers, the change to fair trade cotton has positive effects including female participation in cultivation.<ref name=\"Bassett, Thomas J 2010\" />\n\nTextiles and garments are intricate and require one individual operator, in contrast to the collective farming of coffee and cocoa beans. Textiles are not a straightforward commodity because to be fairly traded, there must be regulation in cotton cultivation, dyeing, stitching, and every other step in the process of textile production.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Fair trade textiles must not be confused with the sweat-free movement although the two movements intersect at the worker level.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nForced or unfair labor in textile production is not limited to developing countries. Charges of use of [[sweatshop]] labor are endemic in the United States. Immigrant women work long hours and receive less than minimum wage. In the United States, there is more of a stigma against child labor than forced labor in general. Consumers in the United States are willing to suspend the importation of textiles made with child labor in other countries but do not expect their exports to be suspended by other countries, even when produced using [[forced labor]].<ref>Bhagwati, Jagdish. \"Trade Liberalisation And 'Fair Trade' Demands: Addressing The Environmental And Labour Standards Issues.\" World Economy 18.6 (1995): 745-759</ref>\n\n====Clothing and textile companies====\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\nFollowing are companies that use fair trade production and/or distribution techniques for clothing and textiles:\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[American Apparel]] <ref name=\"IGI Global 2016\">{{cite book | title=Handbook of Research on Green Economic Development Initiatives and Strategies | publisher=IGI Global | series=Practice, Progress, and Proficiency in Sustainability | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-5225-0441-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VFWiDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA566 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=566}}</ref>\n* [[Association for Craft Producers]]<ref name=\"ACP\">{{cite web|title=ACP |url=http://acp.org.np/about/tbl_products#about-fair |website=Association for Craft Producers|publisher=ACP| access-date=May 23, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[BeGood Clothing]] <ref name=\"IGI Global 2016\"/><ref>{{cite web | title=The secrets of going sustainable: 'It's hard to go back to business as usual' | website=The Guardian | date=December 20, 2013 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/20/secrets-going-sustainable-business | access-date=November 13, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Champa Craft]]\n* [[Cherie Amie]] <ref name=\"IGI Global 2016\"/>\n* [[Maggie's Organics]] <ref name=\"IGI Global 2016\"/>\n* [[MUD Jeans]] <ref>{{cite book | last=Muthu | first=S.S. | title=Roadmap to Sustainable Textiles and Clothing: Environmental and Social Aspects of Textiles and Clothing Supply Chain | publisher=Springer Singapore | series=Textile Science and Clothing Technology | year=2014 | isbn=978-981-287-110-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O_ssBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA224 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=224}}</ref>\n* [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] <ref>{{cite book | last=Burns | first=L.D. | last2=Mullet | first2=K.K. | last3=Bryant | first3=N.O. | title=The Business of Fashion: Designing, Manufacturing, and Marketing | publisher=Bloomsbury Academic | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-5013-1521-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EYLNDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA262 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=262}}</ref>\n* [[Olibert\u00e9]] <ref>{{cite book | last=Black | first=K. | title=Magnifeco: Your Head-to-Toe Guide to Ethical Fashion and Non-toxic Beauty | publisher=New Society Publishers | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-55092-590-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1P54CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA172 | access-date=November 13, 2017 | page=172}}</ref>\n{{Div col end}}\n*[[The Ethical Olive]] https://web.archive.org/web/20180825202848/https://www.theethicalolive.com/\n\n=== Seafood ===\nWith increasing media scrutiny of the conditions of fishermen, particularly Southeast Asia, the lack of transparency and traceability in the [[seafood]] industry prompted new efforts.

The cooperatives incur costs in reaching fair trade political standards, and these are incurred on all production, even if only a small amount is sold at fair trade prices. The most successful cooperatives appear to spend a third of the extra price received on this: some less successful cooperatives spend more than they gain. While this appears to be agreed by proponents and critics of fair trade,<ref>e.g. Utting-Chamorro, K (2005). Does Fairtrade make a difference? The case of small coffee producers in Nicaragua. Development in Practice, Volume 15, Numbers 3 and 4, June 2005, Berndt, C.E. (2007). Is Fair Trade in coffee production fair and useful? Evidence from Costa Rica and Guatemala and implications for policy. Washington DC.: Mercatus 65 Policy Series, Policy Comment 11, Mercatus Centre, George Mason University.</ref> there is a dearth of economic studies setting out the actual revenues and what the money was spent on. FLO figures<ref name=\"Labelling\">{{cite web |publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International |title=Annual Report 2009\u20132010 |year= 2010 |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |url= http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/resources/FLO_Annual-Report-2009_komplett_double_web.pdf }}</ref> are that 40% of the money reaching the [[developing world]] is spent on 'business and production' which would include these costs, as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is stated to be spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.\n\nAnecdotes state that farmers were paid more or less by traders than by fair trade cooperatives. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets,<ref>See Bowbrick, P, \"Are price reporting systems of any use?\", British Food Journal. 90(2) 65\u201369 March/April. 1988. Current international research on developing world market information systems is given at [http://www.sim2g.org/ sim2.org]</ref> and few appreciate the complexity of the different price packages which may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they pay less than traders at some times, more at others. Bassett (2009)<ref>Bassett, T. (2009). Slim pickings: Fairtrade cotton in West Africa. Geoforum.</ref> is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs they incur to produce fair trade. For instance, fair trade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, which resulted in a higher price per pound, but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.<ref>Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., & Villalobos, A. (2006). \"Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee\". ''Journal of Business Research'' 59(3), 322\u2013330.; Valkila, J. (2009). Fair Trade organic coffee production in Nicaragua \u2013 Sustainable development or a poverty trap? ''Ecological Economics'' 68 3018\u201325; Wilson, B. R. (2009). Indebted to Fair Trade? Coffee and Crisis in Nicaragua. Geoforum.</ref>\n\n==== Effects of low barriers to entry ====\nA 2015 study concluded that the low barriers to entry in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through fair trade. They used data from Central America, to establish that the producer benefits were close to zero. This is because there is an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade is actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.<ref name=\"mitpressjournals.org\"/>\n\n=== Inefficient marketing system ===\nOne reason for high prices is that fair trade farmers have to sell through a [[monopsonist]] cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt \u2013 certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt<ref>Mendoza, R., & J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), p. 42.</ref> if they wish to retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. [[Brink Lindsey]] calls fair trade a \"misguided attempt to make up for market failures\" encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.<ref name=\"Brink\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517134810/http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/groundsforcomplaint.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-17 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Fair trade harms other farmers ===\n\n==== Overproduction argument ====\nCritics argue that fair trade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fair trade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on increasing yields and quality.

As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The fair trade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-fair trade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Other ethical issues ===\n\n==== Secrecy ====\nUnder EU law ([[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|Directive 2005/29/EC]] on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offence of Unfair Trading is committed if (a) 'it contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct', (b) 'it omits material information that the average consumer needs ... and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise' or (c) 'fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice ... [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.' [[Peter Griffiths (politician)| \t\nPeter Griffiths]] (2011)<ref name=\"EthicalObjections\" /> points to false claims that fair trade producers get higher prices, the almost universal failure to disclose the extra price charged for fair trade products, to disclose how much of this actually reaches the developing world, to disclose what this is spent on in the developing world, to disclose how much, if any, reaches farmers, and to disclose the harm that Fairtrade does to non-fair trade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries.\n\n==== Unethical selling techniques ====\n[[Philip Booth (economist)|Philip Booth]] says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and some supporters of fair trade are bullying, misleading, and unethical.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&ID=437 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906121402/http://www.iea.org.uk/record.jsp?type=book&ID=437 |archive-date=2009-09-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There are problems with the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect.

They may make transparent corporate vulnerabilities that activists can exploit.

French author and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] correspondent [[Jean-Pierre Boris]] championed this view in his 2005 book ''Commerce in\u00e9quitable''.<ref>{{Citation | last = Boris | first = Jean-Pierre | year = 2005 | title = Commerce in\u00e9quitable | publisher = Hachette Litt\u00e9ratures | place = Paris}}</ref>\n\n=== Political objections ===\nThere have been largely political criticisms of fair trade from the left and the right. Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. French author Christian Jacquiau, in his book ''Les coulisses du commerce \u00e9quitable'', calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e., partnerships with mass retailers, [[multinational corporation]]s, etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous (i.e. [[state monopoly|government monopoly]]) trading system. Jacquiau also supports significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the effect, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms.{{Sfn | Jacquiau | 2006}}{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. \"A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power in order to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth.\"<ref>Catherine S.

In one of the Philippines' biggest corporate failures, PAL was forced to downsize its international operations by completely cutting flights to [[Europe]] and [[Middle East]], cutting virtually all domestic flights except routes operated from Manila, reducing the size of its fleet, and laying off thousands of employees. The airline was placed under [[receivership]] in 1998, and gradually restored operations to many destinations. After PAL's exit from receivership in 2007, PAL embarked on a frequent revamp of management. However, PAL's vision to re-establish itself as one of Asia's premier carriers, is still the matter of greatest importance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |title=PAL aims to be a five star airline in five years |newspaper=Manila Bulletin |accessdate=January 16, 2016 |author=Sionil, Fil C. |date=December 7, 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208105404/http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |archivedate=February 8, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n== Corporate management ==\n[[File:Manilajf9595 34.JPG|thumb|The Philippine Airlines logo shown on the PNB Financial Headquarters from Roxas Boulevard]]\n[[File:Philippine_Airlines_Building.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to the Philippine Airlines head office at the PNB Financial Headquarters along Macapagal Boulevard in Pasay City]]\n\nPhilippine Airlines is owned by PAL Holdings ({{Pse|PAL}}), a [[holding company]] responsible for the airline's operations.

of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft from five families (excluding PAL Express fleet): [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]], [[Airbus A320neo family|Airbus A321neo]], [[Airbus A330]], its flagship [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]], and [[Boeing 777]]. There were 72 aircraft registered in the PAL fleet.<ref name=\"CAPA\"/>\n\n== Branding ==\n=== Logo ===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Philippine Airlines logo has gone under four incarnations in the entire length of its operations.  The first logo incorporated a blue oval with \"PAL\" superimposed in white letters, a four-pointed star whose points intersect behind the \"A\" in the PAL initials, and a wing whose position varied depending on the location of the logo (the wing points to the right if located on the left side of the plane, left if on the right side). A variant of this logo used a globe instead in the blue oval with the PAL initials superimposed.  This logo would be in use from the 1950s until the mid-1960s, when it would be replaced by a second logo.\n\nThe second logo adopted a blue triangle (with the bottom point missing) and a red triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle; this was meant to evoke a vertically-displayed [[Flag of the Philippines|national flag]] (the white being formed by the negative space between the two triangles' tips). In the mid-1970s, a third logo, which removed the circle and simplified the shapes, was introduced. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo, which remained the official PAL logo until 1986, when it would be replaced by the current logo.\n\nThe current PAL logo features the same two blue and red sailed triangles used in the second and third logos. However, an eight-rayed yellow sunburst that is shaped like a [[Sail]]boat was superimposed on top of the blue triangle, and a new [[Helvetica]] typeface was used.\n\n<gallery heights=\"65\" mode=\"packed\">\nPAL50.png|1950-1960\nPAL60.png|1960-1970\nPAL-70.png|1970-1986\n</gallery>\n\n=== Livery ===\n[[File:RP-C8785.jpg|thumb|213x213px|RP-C8785, an [[Airbus A330-343]] operated by Philippine Airlines arrives in [[Francisco Bangoy International Airport]] from [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] as PR1812.]]\n\nPAL [[livery|liveries]] have undergone many incarnations.  The first PAL aircraft bore a simple white-top, silver-bottom livery separated by solid straight cheatlines, with a small Philippine flag superimposed on the tail. The name \"Philippine Air Lines\" was superimposed in the upper forward portion of the fuselage and the PAL logo was located at the back. Later variants of the livery, especially on PAL jet aircraft, made use of an extended Philippine flag as cheatlines, with the PAL logo superimposed on the tail.  By this time, the name \"Philippine Airlines\" was used in the livery.<ref>{{cite web|author=M.Oertle |url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Philippine-Airlines/BAC-111-518FG-One-Eleven/0451320/M/ |title='&#39;PAL BAC 111-518FG One-Eleven'&#39; |publisher=Airliners.net |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother variant of the original livery used by PAL is somewhat similar to the current livery.  However, it uses PAL's third logo on the tail with blue, white and red cheatlines running the center of the fuselage.  Later on, the bottom half of the fuselage was also painted white.\n\nThe current \"Eurowhite\" livery, first used with the [[Short 360]], was adopted in 1986 following PAL's corporate rebranding.  This livery, (designed by [[Landor Associates]]) has the name \"Philippines\" superimposed on the forward portion of the fuselage in italics (using the PAL logo typeface),  while the tail is painted with the logo and the Philippine flag is visible near the rear of the aircraft.  The PAL logo is also painted on the [[wingtip device|winglets]] of aircraft that have them. The name \"Philippines\", instead of \"Philippine Airlines\", is to denote that PAL is the primary flag carrier of the Philippines. However, this sometimes leads to confusion that a PAL plane, especially when chartered by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] for official or state visits, is in fact the [[Air transports of heads of state and government|official air transport of the Philippine head of state]].

Cebu-philippines.net. Retrieved on October 20, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Labor issues===\nPAL has a history of labor relations problems. On June 15, 1998, PAL retrenched 5,000 of its employees, including more than 1,400 flight attendants and stewards to allegedly reduce costs and alleviate financial downturn in airline industry as consequence of Asian financial crisis. Represented by Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), the retrenched employees particularly the 1,400 cabin crews seek remedy for their problem through judicial process and filed a complaint on the grounds of unfair labor practice and illegal retrenchment.\n\nIt took a decade before it was finally settled. It passed the Labor Arbiter to the National Labor Relations Commission then to the Court of Appeals and, finally, to the Supreme Court. The Philippine Highest Tribunal favored the aggrieved party and on July 22, 2008, in its 32-page decision ordered PAL to  \"reinstate the cabin crew personnel who were covered by the retrenchment of and demotion scheme of June 15, 1998 made effective on July 15, 1998, without loss of seniority right and other privileges, and to pay them full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other monetary benefits computed from the time of their separation up to time of actual reinstatement, provided that with respect to those who have received their respective separation pay, the amount of payments shall be deducted from their backwages.\" The Supreme Court further explained that there was a failure on the part of PAL to substantiate its claims of actual and imminent substantial losses. Although the Asian financial fiasco severely affected the airline, PAL defense of bankruptcy and rehabilitation are untenable; hence, the retrenchment policy is not justified.<ref>Fonbuena, C.

This came to an end in 1995 through the passage of Executive Order No. 219 that permits entry of new airlines in the industry. The liberalization and deregulation of Philippine airline industry have brought competition in the domestic air transport industry resulting to lower airfare, improvement in the quality of service and efficiency in the industry in general. At present, three airlines are competing in international and major domestic routes: PAL, Cebu Pacific and PAL Express (formerly known as Air Philippines) and two airlines are serving minor and short-distance routes: Philippines AirAsia, Cebgo (formerly SEAIR and Tiger Airways) and other small airlines.<ref>Manuela Jr., W.

In one of the Philippines' biggest corporate failures, PAL was forced to downsize its international operations by completely cutting flights to [[Europe]] and [[Middle East]], cutting virtually all domestic flights except routes operated from Manila, reducing the size of its fleet, and laying off thousands of employees. The airline was placed under [[receivership]] in 1998, and gradually restored operations to many destinations. After PAL's exit from receivership in 2007, PAL embarked on a frequent revamp of management. However, PAL's vision to re-establish itself as one of Asia's premier carriers, is still the matter of greatest importance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |title=PAL aims to be a five star airline in five years |newspaper=Manila Bulletin |accessdate=January 16, 2016 |author=Sionil, Fil C. |date=December 7, 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208105404/http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |archivedate=February 8, 2016  }}</ref>\n\n== Corporate management ==\n[[File:Manilajf9595 34.JPG|thumb|The Philippine Airlines logo shown on the PNB Financial Headquarters from Roxas Boulevard]]\n[[File:Philippine_Airlines_Building.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to the Philippine Airlines head office at the PNB Financial Headquarters along Macapagal Boulevard in Pasay City]]\n\nPhilippine Airlines is owned by PAL Holdings ({{Pse|PAL}}), a [[holding company]] responsible for the airline's operations.

of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft from five families (excluding PAL Express fleet): [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]], [[Airbus A320neo family|Airbus A321neo]], [[Airbus A330]], its flagship [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]], and [[Boeing 777]]. There were 72 aircraft registered in the PAL fleet.<ref name=\"CAPA\"/>\n\n== Branding ==\n=== Logo ===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Philippine Airlines logo has gone under four incarnations in the entire length of its operations.  The first logo incorporated a blue oval with \"PAL\" superimposed in white letters, a four-pointed star whose points intersect behind the \"A\" in the PAL initials, and a wing whose position varied depending on the location of the logo (the wing points to the right if located on the left side of the plane, left if on the right side). A variant of this logo used a globe instead in the blue oval with the PAL initials superimposed.  This logo would be in use from the 1950s until the mid-1960s, when it would be replaced by a second logo.\n\nThe second logo adopted a blue triangle (with the bottom point missing) and a red triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle; this was meant to evoke a vertically-displayed [[Flag of the Philippines|national flag]] (the white being formed by the negative space between the two triangles' tips). In the mid-1970s, a third logo, which removed the circle and simplified the shapes, was introduced. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo, which remained the official PAL logo until 1986, when it would be replaced by the current logo.\n\nThe current PAL logo features the same two blue and red sailed triangles used in the second and third logos. However, an eight-rayed yellow sunburst that is shaped like a [[Sail]]boat was superimposed on top of the blue triangle, and a new [[Helvetica]] typeface was used.\n\n<gallery heights=\"65\" mode=\"packed\">\nPAL50.png|1950-1960\nPAL60.png|1960-1970\nPAL-70.png|1970-1986\n</gallery>\n\n=== Livery ===\n[[File:RP-C8785.jpg|thumb|213x213px|RP-C8785, an [[Airbus A330-343]] operated by Philippine Airlines arrives in [[Francisco Bangoy International Airport]] from [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] as PR1812.]]\n\nPAL [[livery|liveries]] have undergone many incarnations.  The first PAL aircraft bore a simple white-top, silver-bottom livery separated by solid straight cheatlines, with a small Philippine flag superimposed on the tail. The name \"Philippine Air Lines\" was superimposed in the upper forward portion of the fuselage and the PAL logo was located at the back. Later variants of the livery, especially on PAL jet aircraft, made use of an extended Philippine flag as cheatlines, with the PAL logo superimposed on the tail.  By this time, the name \"Philippine Airlines\" was used in the livery.<ref>{{cite web|author=M.Oertle |url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Philippine-Airlines/BAC-111-518FG-One-Eleven/0451320/M/ |title='&#39;PAL BAC 111-518FG One-Eleven'&#39; |publisher=Airliners.net |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother variant of the original livery used by PAL is somewhat similar to the current livery.  However, it uses PAL's third logo on the tail with blue, white and red cheatlines running the center of the fuselage.  Later on, the bottom half of the fuselage was also painted white.\n\nThe current \"Eurowhite\" livery, first used with the [[Short 360]], was adopted in 1986 following PAL's corporate rebranding.  This livery, (designed by [[Landor Associates]]) has the name \"Philippines\" superimposed on the forward portion of the fuselage in italics (using the PAL logo typeface),  while the tail is painted with the logo and the Philippine flag is visible near the rear of the aircraft.  The PAL logo is also painted on the [[wingtip device|winglets]] of aircraft that have them. The name \"Philippines\", instead of \"Philippine Airlines\", is to denote that PAL is the primary flag carrier of the Philippines. However, this sometimes leads to confusion that a PAL plane, especially when chartered by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] for official or state visits, is in fact the [[Air transports of heads of state and government|official air transport of the Philippine head of state]].

Cebu-philippines.net. Retrieved on October 20, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Labor issues===\nPAL has a history of labor relations problems. On June 15, 1998, PAL retrenched 5,000 of its employees, including more than 1,400 flight attendants and stewards to allegedly reduce costs and alleviate financial downturn in airline industry as consequence of Asian financial crisis. Represented by Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), the retrenched employees particularly the 1,400 cabin crews seek remedy for their problem through judicial process and filed a complaint on the grounds of unfair labor practice and illegal retrenchment.\n\nIt took a decade before it was finally settled. It passed the Labor Arbiter to the National Labor Relations Commission then to the Court of Appeals and, finally, to the Supreme Court. The Philippine Highest Tribunal favored the aggrieved party and on July 22, 2008, in its 32-page decision ordered PAL to  \"reinstate the cabin crew personnel who were covered by the retrenchment of and demotion scheme of June 15, 1998 made effective on July 15, 1998, without loss of seniority right and other privileges, and to pay them full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other monetary benefits computed from the time of their separation up to time of actual reinstatement, provided that with respect to those who have received their respective separation pay, the amount of payments shall be deducted from their backwages.\" The Supreme Court further explained that there was a failure on the part of PAL to substantiate its claims of actual and imminent substantial losses. Although the Asian financial fiasco severely affected the airline, PAL defense of bankruptcy and rehabilitation are untenable; hence, the retrenchment policy is not justified.<ref>Fonbuena, C.

This came to an end in 1995 through the passage of Executive Order No. 219 that permits entry of new airlines in the industry. The liberalization and deregulation of Philippine airline industry have brought competition in the domestic air transport industry resulting to lower airfare, improvement in the quality of service and efficiency in the industry in general. At present, three airlines are competing in international and major domestic routes: PAL, Cebu Pacific and PAL Express (formerly known as Air Philippines) and two airlines are serving minor and short-distance routes: Philippines AirAsia, Cebgo (formerly SEAIR and Tiger Airways) and other small airlines.<ref>Manuela Jr., W.
