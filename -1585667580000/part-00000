They are rescued by [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]] and the ''Heart of Gold''. During a debate, Ford accidentally [[freeze (computing)|freezes]] Left Brain (Zaphod's second head who has been running the ship) and it seems they are doomed, until an immortal named [[Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged|Wowbagger]] brings them to safety. Angered by Wowbagger's insults, Zaphod promises to get Wowbagger killed, an idea to which Wowbagger, tired of immortality, has no objection; and so the group sets off in search of [[Thor (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Thor]], to see if he can kill Wowbagger.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]], assigned to destroy all humans, hears rumours of a colony of Earthmen, and he sets off to destroy them, while Arthur attempts to get Wowbagger to stop the Vogons.\n\nOn the Earth colony Nano, the excessively stereotypical [[Irish people|Irish]] leader [[Hillman Hunter (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Hillman Hunter]] is seeking applicants to be the planet's god, who would keep Hillman in charge due to divine providence. Meanwhile, Prostetnic Jeltz's son, [[Constant Mown]], is having rather \"un-Vogonly\" thoughts, including an enjoyment of poetry and sympathy for humans. Wowbagger and Random start arguing, and Wowbagger drugs and imprisons Random. Afterwards, Trillian and Wowbagger fight, but they share a kiss at the end of the argument. Random is less than impressed with her mother's and Wowbagger's actions, and complains about it to Ford. During this conversation, Random steals Ford's company [[credit card]].\n\nBack on Asgard, Zaphod has managed to gain access to Valhalla and finds his old acquaintance Thor. After some negotiations, Thor agrees to help Zaphod by becoming Nano's god and killing Wowbagger.\n\nThings on Nano are not going as planned, and Hillman is struggling to find his god and keep order among his own populace, as well as trying to control the Magratheans who built the planet. Hillman recalls creating a [[cult]] for the rich, which preached of a coming apocalypse, only for the Grebulons to create such an apocalypse. Having received an offer from Zaphod, Hillman and his followers relocated to their \"haven\", the planet Nano. However, many of the staff abandoned their rich employers and several rival religious groups also settled on the planet, the most prominent of these being the cheese-worshiping Tyromancers, led by [[Aseed (cheese worshiper)|Aseed]]. The Tyromancers and the Nanites enter into a war, and during one of the war's battles, the ''Heart of Gold'' and Thor suddenly arrive.\n\nWowbagger's ship lands on Nano and is met by the Tyromancers. Zaphod negotiates for Thor to be Nano's god and reveals that Aseed and Hillman are actually the same being from [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], both of whom made deals with Zaphod. It is revealed that this is what brought him to Earth, saving Arthur and the rest. With Wowbagger representing the Tyromancers for show and Thor representing the Nanites, the two meet in battle.\n\nThe battle begins, but Thor is unable to win because Wowbagger does not die, even when hit with the hammer [[Mj\u00f6llnir]]. A package for Random arrives through interstellar freight, containing the [[rubber band]]s involved in Wowbagger's becoming immortal, which Random believes may be able to hurt him. Using Mj\u00f6llnir, enhanced with the rubber bands, Thor sends Wowbagger into the air.\n\nThe Vogons approach with the intent of destroying Nano. Thor is able to deflect the Vogon missiles, but is seemingly killed by an experimental weapon called QUEST. Constant Mown disables the Vogon gunner, and uses the argument that their orders are to kill Earthlings and not Nanites (legally two distinct groups, with the latter being taxpaying citizens). Prostetnic Jeltz agrees to his argument, and is proud of his son's ability to follow law and bureaucracy. Zaphod and Hillman tell the people that Thor is Nano's martyr and that all commands he will issue shall henceforth come from Hillman, only for Hillman to be sliced in two by a piece of bomb debris.\n\nLuckily, Hillman's death is short, as the ''Heart of Gold'' medical bay restores him to full health, with only one minor change \u2013 he now has hooves rather than feet. Even though he now has control over the populace, he grows displeased upon finding himself swamped with civic paperwork. Zaphod sets off with Left Brain to work on his re-election campaign, and Ford has decided to stay behind and sample the best Nano has to offer, so he can write material for the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (fictional)|Guide]]''. Up in space, a very much alive Thor is pleased to learn of his rise back to fame, and the success of his \"martyrdom\" trick. Arthur finds the beach from his construct. To his displeasure, he finds that Vogons are going to destroy it.\n\n== Announcement ==\nThe announcement of ''And Another Thing\u2026'' was made on 16 September 2008. Although Colfer spoke of \"semi-outrage\" at the initial idea of another author contributing to the series, he came to regard the book as \"a wonderful opportunity to work with characters I have loved since childhood and give them something of my own voice while holding on to the spirit of Douglas Adams\".<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Adams' widow, Jane Belson, said that she \"could not think of a better person to transport [[Arthur Dent|Arthur]], [[Zaphod Beeblebrox|Zaphod]] and [[Marvin the Paranoid Android|Marvin]] to pastures new\" and gave the project her full support.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nWhen the announcement was made on the [[BBC Radio 4]]'s news show ''[[The Today Programme]]'', a special sketch starring [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] as Arthur Dent (whom he played in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|radio]] and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television series]]) was broadcast.

Angered by Wowbagger's insults, Zaphod promises to get Wowbagger killed, an idea to which Wowbagger, tired of immortality, has no objection; and so the group sets off in search of [[Thor (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Thor]], to see if he can kill Wowbagger.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]], assigned to destroy all humans, hears rumours of a colony of Earthmen, and he sets off to destroy them, while Arthur attempts to get Wowbagger to stop the Vogons.\n\nOn the Earth colony Nano, the excessively stereotypical [[Irish people|Irish]] leader [[Hillman Hunter (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Hillman Hunter]] is seeking applicants to be the planet's god, who would keep Hillman in charge due to divine providence. Meanwhile, Prostetnic Jeltz's son, [[Constant Mown]], is having rather \"un-Vogonly\" thoughts, including an enjoyment of poetry and sympathy for humans. Wowbagger and Random start arguing, and Wowbagger drugs and imprisons Random. Afterwards, Trillian and Wowbagger fight, but they share a kiss at the end of the argument. Random is less than impressed with her mother's and Wowbagger's actions, and complains about it to Ford. During this conversation, Random steals Ford's company [[credit card]].\n\nBack on Asgard, Zaphod has managed to gain access to Valhalla and finds his old acquaintance Thor. After some negotiations, Thor agrees to help Zaphod by becoming Nano's god and killing Wowbagger.\n\nThings on Nano are not going as planned, and Hillman is struggling to find his god and keep order among his own populace, as well as trying to control the Magratheans who built the planet. Hillman recalls creating a [[cult]] for the rich, which preached of a coming apocalypse, only for the Grebulons to create such an apocalypse. Having received an offer from Zaphod, Hillman and his followers relocated to their \"haven\", the planet Nano. However, many of the staff abandoned their rich employers and several rival religious groups also settled on the planet, the most prominent of these being the cheese-worshiping Tyromancers, led by [[Aseed (cheese worshiper)|Aseed]]. The Tyromancers and the Nanites enter into a war, and during one of the war's battles, the ''Heart of Gold'' and Thor suddenly arrive.\n\nWowbagger's ship lands on Nano and is met by the Tyromancers. Zaphod negotiates for Thor to be Nano's god and reveals that Aseed and Hillman are actually the same being from [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], both of whom made deals with Zaphod. It is revealed that this is what brought him to Earth, saving Arthur and the rest. With Wowbagger representing the Tyromancers for show and Thor representing the Nanites, the two meet in battle.\n\nThe battle begins, but Thor is unable to win because Wowbagger does not die, even when hit with the hammer [[Mj\u00f6llnir]]. A package for Random arrives through interstellar freight, containing the [[rubber band]]s involved in Wowbagger's becoming immortal, which Random believes may be able to hurt him. Using Mj\u00f6llnir, enhanced with the rubber bands, Thor sends Wowbagger into the air.\n\nThe Vogons approach with the intent of destroying Nano. Thor is able to deflect the Vogon missiles, but is seemingly killed by an experimental weapon called QUEST. Constant Mown disables the Vogon gunner, and uses the argument that their orders are to kill Earthlings and not Nanites (legally two distinct groups, with the latter being taxpaying citizens). Prostetnic Jeltz agrees to his argument, and is proud of his son's ability to follow law and bureaucracy. Zaphod and Hillman tell the people that Thor is Nano's martyr and that all commands he will issue shall henceforth come from Hillman, only for Hillman to be sliced in two by a piece of bomb debris.\n\nLuckily, Hillman's death is short, as the ''Heart of Gold'' medical bay restores him to full health, with only one minor change \u2013 he now has hooves rather than feet. Even though he now has control over the populace, he grows displeased upon finding himself swamped with civic paperwork. Zaphod sets off with Left Brain to work on his re-election campaign, and Ford has decided to stay behind and sample the best Nano has to offer, so he can write material for the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (fictional)|Guide]]''. Up in space, a very much alive Thor is pleased to learn of his rise back to fame, and the success of his \"martyrdom\" trick. Arthur finds the beach from his construct. To his displeasure, he finds that Vogons are going to destroy it.\n\n== Announcement ==\nThe announcement of ''And Another Thing\u2026'' was made on 16 September 2008. Although Colfer spoke of \"semi-outrage\" at the initial idea of another author contributing to the series, he came to regard the book as \"a wonderful opportunity to work with characters I have loved since childhood and give them something of my own voice while holding on to the spirit of Douglas Adams\".<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Adams' widow, Jane Belson, said that she \"could not think of a better person to transport [[Arthur Dent|Arthur]], [[Zaphod Beeblebrox|Zaphod]] and [[Marvin the Paranoid Android|Marvin]] to pastures new\" and gave the project her full support.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nWhen the announcement was made on the [[BBC Radio 4]]'s news show ''[[The Today Programme]]'', a special sketch starring [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] as Arthur Dent (whom he played in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|radio]] and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television series]]) was broadcast.

In this outing, Henry attempts to convince [[Emma Swan]] to remain in Storybrooke and Regina Mills devises a master plan with Jefferson that will force Emma into leaving forever while the events surrounding Snow White's attempted rescue of Prince Charming are revealed along with her plan to enlist the aid of her allies and defeat the Evil Queen once and for all.\n\nIt was co-written by [[Jane Espenson]] and [[David H. Goodman]], while [[Milan Cheylov]] served as director.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|episode|date=March 2019}}\n===Opening sequence===\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarves walk through the forest.\n\n===In the characters' past===\nIn the Enchanted Forest, in the hours after having captured Prince Charming ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) for betraying him after he refused to marry Abigail, King George ([[Alan Dale]]) decides that Charming will be beheaded. But as the blade prepares to fall on him, The Evil Queen ([[Lana Parrilla]]) turns the blade to water and then makes a deal with King George by trading Charming for all the riches he would have been paid if he had married Midas\u2019 daughter. The Evil Queen tells King George that he will be used to take down his one true love, Snow White ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]). Meanwhile, Snow White watches from a hill with the dwarves and Granny ([[Beverley Elliott]]). Red Riding Hood ([[Meghan Ory]]) appears and tells the group that The Queen is there, but despite the fact that her presence there might indicate that it may be a trap, the group decides to move in after King George anyway. Moments later, the Queen goes to see Charming in his cell where he tries to convince her to take his life instead of Snow White's, but she doesn't want his life. When Charming asks what her plan is, she laughs and closes the jail cell and walks away while holding a red apple up for him to see.\n\nHours later, Snow White, with help from the fairies from above, storms King George's castle, but when she arrives at Charming's cell, she is disappointed to find him showing only in a mirror there. They speak quickly, but before anything more is said, the Evil Queen interrupts and requests a parlay with no weapons. The entire group warns her not to go, but Snow White is determined to settle her dispute with the Queen without implicating the others. At the stable where Cora murdered her true love, Daniel, the Queen waits for Snow White, who walks up behind her. The Queen leads Snow White to the place where she ran down her runaway horse and saved her life and reveals to Snow White the burial site of Daniel. The Queen explains that she believes Daniel died because of Snow White breaking her promise, and cannot forgive Snow White despite already robbing Snow of her father. The Queen then gives Snow White an apple and makes a deal with her that if she eats the apple, she will be entombed in her own body, filled with nothing but regret, but Charming will live. However, if Snow White doesn't eat the apple, then Charming will die. Unfortunately, as Snow White eats the apple and collapses, Charming feels her soul in his cell now that she took the deal. As Snow White falls to the ground, the poisoned apple rolls down the hill and gets sucked into a portal leading to Jefferson's ([[Sebastian Stan]]) hand waiting in Storybrooke. As Red Riding Hood uses Snow White's scent to get to the barn, they notice she has no breath. Back at her palace, the Queen chuckles in her tower, saying that Snow's sacrifice is overrated.\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nIn the present day, Regina (Parrilla) and Henry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) eat dinner in silence when the doorbell rings, even though Regina wasn't expecting any company. Regina opens the door and finds [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) there, saying that Henry had invited her. As Regina turns around, she finds Henry is not there. Regina then looks back on the doorstep to see the townspeople who had gathered to take her away. Regina sees Henry waiting behind her with a rope, ready to tie Regina to her apple tree which had been planted in the center of the town. As Regina pleads for her life, Emma tells her that because Regina took away everyone's happiness, it's their turn to take away hers. David (Dallas) then gives Emma a sword which she swings at Regina's head. Regina wakes up and realizes that it was a nightmare. She then runs into Henry's room to check on him, but she doesn't realize he is not there and left his bed pillows to form the shape of his body.\n\nAs for Henry and Emma, Emma tells her son that she wants to leave Storybrooke right away, but Henry pleads with his mother and hijacks the steering wheel in order to convince her to return. The following morning, Emma returns to Mary Margaret's (Goodwin) apartment and discovers that Mary Margaret is upset for not having had the opportunity to say goodbye to her. When Emma explains she abducted Henry as well, Mary Margaret gets more furious and tells Emma to do what's best for Henry. As Emma questions her what that is, Mary Margaret tells Emma that she is the mother and she has to make that decision. Later that day, Henry goes to see August ([[Eion Bailey]]), who reveals to him that he is turning back into a wooden puppet, and thus, dropping himself off of Operation Cobra. Since he believes in the curse, Henry sees August's wooden arm, confirming his belief that the stories are true. At the same time, Emma talks with Archie ([[Raphael Sbarge]]), who tells her that Emma has no case against Regina and tells her Henry's been skipping school and has even endangered himself since her arrival, he makes her understand that the fighting between her and Regina will only hurt Henry. This emotional tug of war leads Emma to make her decision.\n\nElsewhere in Storybrooke, Regina sees that her apple tree is dying and goes to Mr. Gold ([[Robert Carlyle]]), who tells her the curse could be weakening. Regina wants to get rid of Emma, but knows that if Emma dies the curse will be broken. She tries to strike a deal with Mr. Gold, but he turns down the offer, telling her that once people start remembering who they are, they are going to be out for Regina's blood (just like in the nightmare Regina had). So the Mayor uses another ploy by leaving a white rabbit card on Paige's bicycle at school. Hours later, Jefferson goes to see Regina now that he received the message from Paige's bicycle. To Jefferson's surprise, Regina produces the hat that she kept when she was the Evil Queen back in the Enchanted Forest during their trip to Wonderland. It turns out that Regina wants Jefferson to go back with her to their land to get something to help her get rid of Emma. Jefferson only agrees if he can forget his double life and be reunited with his daughter and she agrees to his request. Regina and Jefferson then go into the cell where the hearts are kept. As Jefferson places the hat on the ground, the hat doesn't spin. Regina's attempts are not successful either, but when Regina, with tears in her eyes, produces the ring that her former love, Daniel, had given her, Jefferson tells her that it may have some magic and instructs her to drop the ring in the hat, which begins to spin slowly. A portal doesn't open, but Jefferson tells her that he can reach through and grab something from the other side, so Regina guides the hat to the location of the item. When Jefferson asks her what item she wanted to retrieve, Regina responded by telling him that they are looking for an apple. Jefferson then catches the apple that Snow White ate from the other side of the portal and gives it to Regina, who then tells Jefferson that she will not fulfill the deal until Emma takes a bite of the apple. Afterwards, Regina concocts a plan to get Emma to eat it by baking the apple into a turnover.\n\nThat afternoon, Emma goes to see Regina about Henry, telling her that she is leaving town. Emma wants to still be a part of Henry's life, so she would rather they would get along than not. Regina then gives Emma the poisoned turnover as a parting gift. Unfortunately, as Regina goes to Mr. Gold about how she has obtained the poisoned apple from the other world, Mr. Gold reminds her that all magic comes with a price. Regina retorts by telling him that he can pay it since it is his curse. Later that evening, Emma tells Henry that she is leaving, but Henry tries to get her to stay, only to have Emma tell him that this isn't a story. He stares at her in disbelief that she still doesn't believe in the curse, but Emma tells him that all Regina has ever done is fight for him.

In this outing, Henry attempts to convince [[Emma Swan]] to remain in Storybrooke and Regina Mills devises a master plan with Jefferson that will force Emma into leaving forever while the events surrounding Snow White's attempted rescue of Prince Charming are revealed along with her plan to enlist the aid of her allies and defeat the Evil Queen once and for all.\n\nIt was co-written by [[Jane Espenson]] and [[David H. Goodman]], while [[Milan Cheylov]] served as director.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|episode|date=March 2019}}\n===Opening sequence===\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarves walk through the forest.\n\n===In the characters' past===\nIn the Enchanted Forest, in the hours after having captured Prince Charming ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) for betraying him after he refused to marry Abigail, King George ([[Alan Dale]]) decides that Charming will be beheaded. But as the blade prepares to fall on him, The Evil Queen ([[Lana Parrilla]]) turns the blade to water and then makes a deal with King George by trading Charming for all the riches he would have been paid if he had married Midas\u2019 daughter. The Evil Queen tells King George that he will be used to take down his one true love, Snow White ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]). Meanwhile, Snow White watches from a hill with the dwarves and Granny ([[Beverley Elliott]]). Red Riding Hood ([[Meghan Ory]]) appears and tells the group that The Queen is there, but despite the fact that her presence there might indicate that it may be a trap, the group decides to move in after King George anyway. Moments later, the Queen goes to see Charming in his cell where he tries to convince her to take his life instead of Snow White's, but she doesn't want his life. When Charming asks what her plan is, she laughs and closes the jail cell and walks away while holding a red apple up for him to see.\n\nHours later, Snow White, with help from the fairies from above, storms King George's castle, but when she arrives at Charming's cell, she is disappointed to find him showing only in a mirror there. They speak quickly, but before anything more is said, the Evil Queen interrupts and requests a parlay with no weapons. The entire group warns her not to go, but Snow White is determined to settle her dispute with the Queen without implicating the others. At the stable where Cora murdered her true love, Daniel, the Queen waits for Snow White, who walks up behind her. The Queen leads Snow White to the place where she ran down her runaway horse and saved her life and reveals to Snow White the burial site of Daniel. The Queen explains that she believes Daniel died because of Snow White breaking her promise, and cannot forgive Snow White despite already robbing Snow of her father. The Queen then gives Snow White an apple and makes a deal with her that if she eats the apple, she will be entombed in her own body, filled with nothing but regret, but Charming will live. However, if Snow White doesn't eat the apple, then Charming will die. Unfortunately, as Snow White eats the apple and collapses, Charming feels her soul in his cell now that she took the deal. As Snow White falls to the ground, the poisoned apple rolls down the hill and gets sucked into a portal leading to Jefferson's ([[Sebastian Stan]]) hand waiting in Storybrooke. As Red Riding Hood uses Snow White's scent to get to the barn, they notice she has no breath. Back at her palace, the Queen chuckles in her tower, saying that Snow's sacrifice is overrated.\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nIn the present day, Regina (Parrilla) and Henry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) eat dinner in silence when the doorbell rings, even though Regina wasn't expecting any company. Regina opens the door and finds [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) there, saying that Henry had invited her. As Regina turns around, she finds Henry is not there. Regina then looks back on the doorstep to see the townspeople who had gathered to take her away. Regina sees Henry waiting behind her with a rope, ready to tie Regina to her apple tree which had been planted in the center of the town. As Regina pleads for her life, Emma tells her that because Regina took away everyone's happiness, it's their turn to take away hers. David (Dallas) then gives Emma a sword which she swings at Regina's head. Regina wakes up and realizes that it was a nightmare. She then runs into Henry's room to check on him, but she doesn't realize he is not there and left his bed pillows to form the shape of his body.\n\nAs for Henry and Emma, Emma tells her son that she wants to leave Storybrooke right away, but Henry pleads with his mother and hijacks the steering wheel in order to convince her to return. The following morning, Emma returns to Mary Margaret's (Goodwin) apartment and discovers that Mary Margaret is upset for not having had the opportunity to say goodbye to her. When Emma explains she abducted Henry as well, Mary Margaret gets more furious and tells Emma to do what's best for Henry. As Emma questions her what that is, Mary Margaret tells Emma that she is the mother and she has to make that decision. Later that day, Henry goes to see August ([[Eion Bailey]]), who reveals to him that he is turning back into a wooden puppet, and thus, dropping himself off of Operation Cobra. Since he believes in the curse, Henry sees August's wooden arm, confirming his belief that the stories are true. At the same time, Emma talks with Archie ([[Raphael Sbarge]]), who tells her that Emma has no case against Regina and tells her Henry's been skipping school and has even endangered himself since her arrival, he makes her understand that the fighting between her and Regina will only hurt Henry. This emotional tug of war leads Emma to make her decision.\n\nElsewhere in Storybrooke, Regina sees that her apple tree is dying and goes to Mr. Gold ([[Robert Carlyle]]), who tells her the curse could be weakening. Regina wants to get rid of Emma, but knows that if Emma dies the curse will be broken. She tries to strike a deal with Mr. Gold, but he turns down the offer, telling her that once people start remembering who they are, they are going to be out for Regina's blood (just like in the nightmare Regina had). So the Mayor uses another ploy by leaving a white rabbit card on Paige's bicycle at school. Hours later, Jefferson goes to see Regina now that he received the message from Paige's bicycle. To Jefferson's surprise, Regina produces the hat that she kept when she was the Evil Queen back in the Enchanted Forest during their trip to Wonderland. It turns out that Regina wants Jefferson to go back with her to their land to get something to help her get rid of Emma. Jefferson only agrees if he can forget his double life and be reunited with his daughter and she agrees to his request. Regina and Jefferson then go into the cell where the hearts are kept. As Jefferson places the hat on the ground, the hat doesn't spin. Regina's attempts are not successful either, but when Regina, with tears in her eyes, produces the ring that her former love, Daniel, had given her, Jefferson tells her that it may have some magic and instructs her to drop the ring in the hat, which begins to spin slowly. A portal doesn't open, but Jefferson tells her that he can reach through and grab something from the other side, so Regina guides the hat to the location of the item. When Jefferson asks her what item she wanted to retrieve, Regina responded by telling him that they are looking for an apple. Jefferson then catches the apple that Snow White ate from the other side of the portal and gives it to Regina, who then tells Jefferson that she will not fulfill the deal until Emma takes a bite of the apple. Afterwards, Regina concocts a plan to get Emma to eat it by baking the apple into a turnover.\n\nThat afternoon, Emma goes to see Regina about Henry, telling her that she is leaving town. Emma wants to still be a part of Henry's life, so she would rather they would get along than not. Regina then gives Emma the poisoned turnover as a parting gift. Unfortunately, as Regina goes to Mr. Gold about how she has obtained the poisoned apple from the other world, Mr. Gold reminds her that all magic comes with a price. Regina retorts by telling him that he can pay it since it is his curse. Later that evening, Emma tells Henry that she is leaving, but Henry tries to get her to stay, only to have Emma tell him that this isn't a story. He stares at her in disbelief that she still doesn't believe in the curse, but Emma tells him that all Regina has ever done is fight for him. As Henry sees the apple turnover on the counter, he tries to convince his mother not to eat it and tells her that he believes in her and proves it by taking a bite of the turnover. Unfortunately, Henry immediately collapses, falling into the same infamous [[sleeping curse]] as Snow White.\n\n==Production==\n\"An Apple Red as Blood\" was co-written by co-executive producer [[David H.

Americans, which are argued to coincide with metaphorical interpretations of the country's geopolitical environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitthedprk.org/cartoons-in-north-korea-the-squirrel-and-the-hedgehog/|title=Cartoons in North Korea: The Squirrel and the Hedgehog|website=Visit North Korea|language=English|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> But, this allegorical interpretation is never revealed in the series, and staff at the SEK Studio claimed that this allegorical interpretation is not true. They repeatedly alleged that this animation was created to teach [[love]], [[friendship]], and [[patriotism]] to children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tongilnews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=51748|title=\u5317\uc11c \uc778\uae30\ub044\ub294 '\ub2e4\ub78c\uc774\uc640 \uace0\uc2b4\ub3c4\uce58'\n|website=tongilnews|language=ko|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> But other SEK's staff said \"The weasels, mice and wolves symbolize foreign invaders (imperialists).\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unityinfo.co.kr/sub_read.html?uid=2930&section=sc5|title=\uc544\ub3d9\uc601\ud654 \ub2e4\ub78c\uc774\uc640 \uace0\uc2b4\ub3c4\uce58 -1977\ub144 \uc2dc\uc791 25\ubd80 \ubc29\uc601\n|website=unityinfo|language=ko|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n\nOverseas critics also think the messages the show portrays are violent and don't teach kids good moral behavior, mainly due to the use of weaponry and gore, not to mention the repeated use of vulgar slurs. It however has been praised for its animation as the series progressed, along with its unique military concept of storytelling.\n\n==Merchandise==\nNo official records of merchandise has been known, but brands of toothpaste and backpacks depicting the main characters have been sold in North Korean stores. There are also several statues in children's parks that are located in [[Pyongyang]].\n\n==Manga==\nAlongside the television show, a North Korean [[manga]] was released. There were several key differences between it and the television series, such as the character \"Lt. Fox Vixen\" originally being depicted as male. It's unknown why this change occurred, but it could be to acknowledge that the [[United States Armed Forces]] had allowed women to fight alongside male soldiers.\n\n==Reception==\nThe SEK Studio, the North Korean studios that produced this series, has also produced a number of stand-alone short cartoons with funny animal characters. Some of them are part of a large series named the ''[[Clever Raccoon Dog]] (\ub839\ub9ac\ud55c \ub108\uad6c\ub9ac)''. Unlike Squirrel and Hedgehog, they're focused primarily on road safety education, science, sport, summer volunteer work etc.\n\nThe series was released in English and Spanish by [[Mondo TV]], titled ''Brave Soldier'' and ''Soldados Valientes'' respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYXievo3ibiW175mSGjBLI7Af8InrIniE|title=SOLDADOS VALIENTES / BRAVE SOLDIER - ES - YouTube|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondotv.it/scheda-singola-brave-soldier.html|title=Mondo tv S.P.A - LIBRARY BRAVE SOLDIER|website=www.mondotv.it|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}</ref> The series' plot was changed in the dubs, so that subtle references to North Korea or blatant propaganda would end up removed. This translation is often criticized by the show's cult following for having generic voice actors and out of place audio dubbing. The second season was never dubbed due to licensing issues, as [[Mondo TV]] only owns the rights to the first selection of episodes.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Propaganda in North Korea]]\n* [[SEK Studio]]\n* \n* \n\n==References==\n<references responsive=\"0\" />\n\n[[Category:North Korean animation]]\n[[Category:1977 North Korean television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2012 North Korean television series endings]]\n[[Category:North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:Animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:1970s North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:1980s North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:1990s North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:2000s North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:2010s North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:Teen fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in television]]\n[[Category:1970s animated television series]]\n[[Category:1980s animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s animated television series]]\n[[Category:Propaganda cartoons]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Squirrel and Hedgehog\n| image                    = Squirrel and Hedgehog.jpg\n| image_upright            =\n| image_size               =\n| image_alt                =\n| caption                  = DVD cover\n| show_name_2              =\n| native_name              = <!-- {{Infobox name module|language|title}} or {{Infobox name module|title}} -->\n| genre                    =\n| creator                  =\n| based_on                 = <!-- {{based on|work|author}} -->\n| writer                   =\n| screenplay               =\n| story                    =\n| director                 = Kim Jun-Ok (Episode 1~4), Kim Yong-Chol, Kim Kwang-Song, Do Chol, O Sin-Hyok, Yun Yong-Gil, Ri Sok-Hun, Ri Chol\n| creative_director        =\n| presenter                = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| starring                 = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| judges                   = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list -->\n| voices                   = <!-- Organized by broadcast credit order, with new main cast added to the end of the list --> Won Jong-Suk\nKim Thae-Ryon\n| narrated                 =\n| theme_music_composer     = Kim Myong-Hui\n[[Pyongyang]] Ryulgok Secondary School\n| opentheme                = \"\ucca0\ubcbd\uc758 \ub3d9\uc0b0 \uafb8\ub824\ub098\uac00\uc790\" <small>(Let us fortify our Hill)</small>\n| endtheme                 =\n| composer                 =\n| country                  = [[North Korea]]\n| language                 = Korean\n| num_seasons              = <!-- Or num_series.

Americans, which are argued to coincide with metaphorical interpretations of the country's geopolitical environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitthedprk.org/cartoons-in-north-korea-the-squirrel-and-the-hedgehog/|title=Cartoons in North Korea: The Squirrel and the Hedgehog|website=Visit North Korea|language=English|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> But, this allegorical interpretation is never revealed in the series, and staff at the SEK Studio claimed that this allegorical interpretation is not true. They repeatedly alleged that this animation was created to teach [[love]], [[friendship]], and [[patriotism]] to children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tongilnews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=51748|title=\u5317\uc11c \uc778\uae30\ub044\ub294 '\ub2e4\ub78c\uc774\uc640 \uace0\uc2b4\ub3c4\uce58'\n|website=tongilnews|language=ko|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> But other SEK's staff said \"The weasels, mice and wolves symbolize foreign invaders (imperialists).\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unityinfo.co.kr/sub_read.html?uid=2930&section=sc5|title=\uc544\ub3d9\uc601\ud654 \ub2e4\ub78c\uc774\uc640 \uace0\uc2b4\ub3c4\uce58 -1977\ub144 \uc2dc\uc791 25\ubd80 \ubc29\uc601\n|website=unityinfo|language=ko|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>\n\nOverseas critics also think the messages the show portrays are violent and don't teach kids good moral behavior, mainly due to the use of weaponry and gore, not to mention the repeated use of vulgar slurs. It however has been praised for its animation as the series progressed, along with its unique military concept of storytelling.\n\n==Merchandise==\nNo official records of merchandise has been known, but brands of toothpaste and backpacks depicting the main characters have been sold in North Korean stores. There are also several statues in children's parks that are located in [[Pyongyang]].\n\n==Manga==\nAlongside the television show, a North Korean [[manga]] was released. There were several key differences between it and the television series, such as the character \"Lt. Fox Vixen\" originally being depicted as male. It's unknown why this change occurred, but it could be to acknowledge that the [[United States Armed Forces]] had allowed women to fight alongside male soldiers.\n\n==Reception==\nThe SEK Studio, the North Korean studios that produced this series, has also produced a number of stand-alone short cartoons with funny animal characters. Some of them are part of a large series named the ''[[Clever Raccoon Dog]] (\ub839\ub9ac\ud55c \ub108\uad6c\ub9ac)''. Unlike Squirrel and Hedgehog, they're focused primarily on road safety education, science, sport, summer volunteer work etc.\n\nThe series was released in English and Spanish by [[Mondo TV]], titled ''Brave Soldier'' and ''Soldados Valientes'' respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYXievo3ibiW175mSGjBLI7Af8InrIniE|title=SOLDADOS VALIENTES / BRAVE SOLDIER - ES - YouTube|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondotv.it/scheda-singola-brave-soldier.html|title=Mondo tv S.P.A - LIBRARY BRAVE SOLDIER|website=www.mondotv.it|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}</ref> The series' plot was changed in the dubs, so that subtle references to North Korea or blatant propaganda would end up removed. This translation is often criticized by the show's cult following for having generic voice actors and out of place audio dubbing. The second season was never dubbed due to licensing issues, as [[Mondo TV]] only owns the rights to the first selection of episodes.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Propaganda in North Korea]]\n* [[SEK Studio]]\n* [[Clever Raccoon Dog]]\n* [[Boy General]]\n\n==References==\n<references responsive=\"0\" />\n\n[[Category:North Korean animation]]\n[[Category:1977 North Korean television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2012 North Korean television series endings]]\n[[Category:North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:Animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:1970s North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:1980s North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:1990s North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:2000s North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:2010s North Korean television series]]\n[[Category:Teen fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in television]]\n[[Category:1970s animated television series]]\n[[Category:1980s animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s animated television series]]\n[[Category:Propaganda cartoons]]\n", "name_user": "84.15.186.182", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel_and_Hedgehog"}

Owing to its status as a powerful and influential company, Disney's business practices, executives and content have been heavily disapproved in the media, as well as by activist groups. Some of Disney's various business ventures, including television networks, theme parks, and product lines have also sparked controversy among groups of consumers and media outlets.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Best|first=Joel|last2=Lowney|first2=Kathleen S.|date=Summer 2009|title=The Disadvantage of a Good Reputation: Disney as a Target for Social Problems Claims|jstor=40220139|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|volume= 30|issue= 3|pages=431\u2013449}}</ref>\n\n==Company officials==\n{{Main|List of management of The Walt Disney Company}}\n\n===Michael Eisner===\n{{Main|Michael Eisner#\"Save Disney\" campaign and the ousting of Eisner}}\n\nIn 1977, [[Roy E. Disney]], the son of Disney co-founder [[Roy O. Disney]] and nephew of [[Walt Disney]], resigned as an executive due to disagreements with his colleagues' decisions at the time. As he claimed later, \"I just felt creatively the company was not going anywhere interesting. It was very stifling.\" However, he retained a seat on the board of directors. His resignation from the board in 1984, which occurred in the midst of a corporate takeover battle, was the beginning of a series of developments that led to the replacement of company president and CEO [[Ronald William Miller]] (married to Walt's daughter [[Diane Marie Disney]]) by [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Frank Wells]]. Roy soon returned to the company as vice-chairman of the board of directors and head of the animation department.\n\nHowever, Michael Eisner has been criticized for his management style. The book ''[[DisneyWar]]'' by [[James B. Stewart]] is an expos\u00e9 of Eisner's 20-year tenure as Chairman and CEO at [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Stewart describes some of the following:\n* The struggle to get ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' made in time and on budget despite the ambitions of [[Robert Zemeckis]] and [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] to make the film bigger and bolder\n* Eisner's tension with [[Frank Wells]] before Wells' death\n* Eisner's friendship-turned-rivalry with [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]]\n* Eisner's tension with [[Michael Ovitz]] during Ovitz's short-lived presidency\n* The purchase of the [[ABC Family]] channel and its content and the fallout resulting from Disney's inability to revive it\n* [[Hilary Duff]]'s decision to quit the [[Disney Channel]] because of low salary\n* Financing of the film ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''\n* [[Pixar]]'s decision not to renew its relationship with Disney\n* The hostile takeover attempt by [[Comcast]].\n\nIn 2003, Roy resigned from his positions as Disney vice chairman and chairman of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]], accusing Eisner of [[micromanagement]], flops with the ABC television network, timidity in the [[theme park]] business, turning The Walt Disney Company into a \"rapacious, soul-less\" company, and refusing to establish a clear succession plan, as well as a string of box-office movie flops starting in the year 2000.\n\nOn March 3, 2004, at Disney's annual shareholders' meeting, a surprising 43% of Disney's shareholders, predominantly rallied by former board members Roy Disney and [[Stanley Gold]], withheld their [[proxy voting|proxies]] to re-elect Eisner to the board. Disney's board then gave the chairmanship position to [[George J. Mitchell]]. However, the board did not immediately remove Eisner as chief executive.\n\nOn March 13, 2005, Eisner announced that he would step down as CEO one year before his contract expired. On September 30, Eisner resigned both as an executive and as a member of the board of directors, and, severing all formal ties with the company, he waived his contractual rights to perks such as the use of a corporate jet and an office at the company's [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] headquarters. Eisner's replacement was his longtime assistant, [[Robert Iger]].\n\n==Walt Disney Studios==\n===Walt Disney Animation Studios===\n====Ethnic and racial stereotyping====\nOver the years many scholars, film critics, and parent groups have been critical of Disney for the portrayal of non-whites in a stereotypical image which led to the speculation that [[Walt Disney]] was racist.<ref name=\"Gabler, Neal 2006\" /> For example, it is told that during a story meeting on ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' he referred to the scene when the dwarfs pile on top of each other as an (expletive) \"pile\" and that he used the term \"[[pickaninny]]\" whilst casting ''Song of the South''. The supposed insensitivity Disney and some of his employees showed in many cartoons including the short ''[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]'' where Mickey Mouse dresses in [[blackface]], the stereotypical \"Black\" Bird in the short ''[[Who Killed Cock Robin? (1935 film)|Who Killed Cock Robin]]'', the black servant centaurette Sunflower in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (then edited out of the successive releases), the film ''[[Song of the South]]'', which was accused to be an idealized version of slavery (even though the film takes place after the [[American Civil War]]), the depiction of Native \"Americans\" in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (considering though the source material, the comical nature of the animated film and the fact that they are inhabitants of the imaginary and fantastic [[Neverland]]), the cunning and manipulative Siamese cats Si and Am in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' and the jazzy black crows in ''[[Dumbo]]'' (although, in that particular instance, they were made intelligent, free spirited and sympathetic to Dumbo's plight, as they knew what it was like to be ostracized. Plus, they were created to be a satirical way to mock the [[Jim Crow laws]] in the [[Southern USA]] during the period the film was produced, in fact ''Dumbo'' is set in [[Florida]] in 1941).<ref name=\"Gabler, Neal 2006\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://floydnormancom.squarespace.com/blog/2019/4/27/black-crows-and-other-pc-nonsense|title=http://floydnormancom.squarespace.com/blog/2019/4/27/black-crows-and-other-pc-nonsense|website=MrFun's Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref> This appears to be a moot point, however, as many similar or even much more exaggerated gags and stereotypes existed in a number of cartoons from many other studios during that time, including [[Fleischer Studios]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]], and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]. ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' director [[Bob Clampett]] who directed the infamous [[Merrie Melodies]] shorts ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Tin Pan Alley Cats]]'', claimed that {{cquote|''Everybody, including blacks had a good time when these cartoons first came out. All the controversy developed in later years merely because of changing attitudes toward black civil rights that have happened since then''.}}\nAdditionally, despite Walt Disney's occasional slurs, the Disney studio hired several employees of all racial backgrounds, including [[Floyd Norman]] (African American), [[Cy Young (animator)|Cy Young]], [[Tyrus Wong]], [[Iwao Takamoto]], and [[Bob Kuwahara]] (Chinese/Japanese).<ref name=\"Gabler, Neal 2006\">Gabler, Neal (2006) ''Walt Disney, The Triumph of American Imagination'', Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York City, U.S.A</ref> Upon a home screening of ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', Walt Disney quoted \"That's the kind of film I wish I could make.\"<ref name=\"Gabler, Neal 2006\" /> Similar rumors persist about Walt Disney's alleged [[anti-Semitism]] and Nazi sympathies, in spite of the fact that the studio made anti-Nazi propaganda during [[World War II]] and hired a number of Jews as animators and songwriters during Walt's lifetime, including [[Art Babbitt]] and the [[Sherman Brothers]]. Once ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'''s crew found out that [[Christian Rub]], the voice of [[Geppetto]], was a Nazi sympathizer, they \"got even with him in the best way possible.\" They had Rub perform on a platform in the scene where Geppetto is inside Monstro's belly, and shook it violently, giving him \"a ride he never forgot.\"\n\nIn 1989, the African American actor [[Nick Stewart]] was called back to Disney to reprise his role of [[Br'er Bear]] for the [[Splash Mountain]] ride. Disney Historian Jim Korkis asked him if he thought it was at all degrading to play Br'er Bear in ''[[Song of the South]]'', regarding all the controversy of the portrayal of African Americans. Stewart laughed and replied \"Disney treated us like Kings.\" He concluded saying that the money he earned being Br'er Bear in ''Song of the South'' went towards a theatre for African American actors to play roles other than butlers and maids. He also said he was to do the same thing with the money from the Splash Mountain ride.\n\nSince its release in 1992, Disney's ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' has been accused of perpetuating negative racial and ethnic stereotypes of Arabs. In July 1993, Disney announced that it would alter a line in the film's opening song, \"Arabian Nights,\" written by [[Howard Ashman]] and [[Alan Menken]]. In the original film, the song featured the lyrics, \"Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home.\" After Arab-American groups complained that the line was derogatory to Middle Easterners, Disney amended the lyrics in later editions of the film to an alternate lyric written by Ashman: \"Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home.\" Menken approved the change before its adoption, as did the estate of Ashman, who had died before the film's completion. The [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] (ADC) further requested that the word \"barbaric\" be removed; however, Disney refused this, claiming that the word appeared in all versions of Ashman's text and it referred to the film's desert setting in the altered lyrics. Don Bustany, president of the ADC's Los Angeles chapter, argued that the existing alterations were \"nowhere near adequate, considering the racism depicted in ''Aladdin''...there still remains the very sleazy, burlesque character in the prologue and the scene where a merchant is going to cut off the hand of Princess Jasmine because she took an apple from his stand to give to a hungry child.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Fox |first=David J. |date=1993-07-10 |title=Disney Will Alter Song in 'Aladdin' |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-07-10-ca-11747-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>\n\nA March 1995 article published on the ADC's website further criticized ''Aladdin'' for depicting the film's protagonists, Aladdin and Jasmine, with light skin and [[Anglicization|Anglicized]] features, in contrast to dark-skinned merchants and palace guards who were cruel, greedy, and vicious while featuring Arab accents and distorted facial features.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=283 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405005650/http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=283 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-04-05 |title=Arab Stereotypes and American Educators |last1=Wingfield |first1=Marvin |last2=Karaman |first2=Bushra |date=March 1995 |website=American-Arab Anti-Discrimination League |access-date=2019-05-28 |quote=The film\u2019s light-skinned lead characters, Aladdin and Jasmine, have Anglicized features and Anglo-American accents.

While undetectable when played at the usual rate of 24 [[film frame]]s per second, the Laserdisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals.

The castle is displayed in the artwork for the cover for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on home video in 1990. Close examination of the cover artwork, as well as the poster for the film, shows an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear on the cover of the second releasing of the movie. There was also a widespread rumor in the early to mid-1990s that a clergyman is seen with an [[erection]] during a wedding scene, specifically, the scene in which a brainwashed Prince Eric is about to marry Ursula the sea witch in disguise.<ref name=\"Austin American-Statesman\">{{cite news|title=Sex Seen (by Some) in Films by Disney|last=Smith|first=Russell W.|date=September 8, 1995|newspaper=Austin American-Statesman|pages=d1}}</ref><ref name=\"Snopes2\" /><ref name=\"Recorder2\" /> The clergyman is a short man, dressed in bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. Because of the controversy, this scene was later altered in the film's 2006 Platinum Edition DVD release so that the clergyman is standing on a small platform box and that his knee is no longer visible underneath his robes. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.<ref name=\"Snopes2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/minister.asp |title=Little Mermaid Minister |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=July 15, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Recorder2\">{{cite news|title=Help the Needy; Help Yourself|last=Beck|first=Susan|date=January 5, 1996|publisher=The Recorder|pages=2}}</ref><ref name=\"March 1996\">{{cite magazine|title=When the Media Miss Real Messages in Subliminal Stories|last=Emery Jr.|first=C.

Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's five-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production.

Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled [[Film marketing|marketing]] and [[Film distributor|distribution]]. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a distribution fee. The lack of story and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=April 22, 2008 |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_504.html |title=Disney trying to patch things up with Pixar |publisher=Movies Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209231544/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_504.html |archivedate=December 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe two companies attempted to reach a new agreement in early 2004.

Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nDisagreements between [[Steve Jobs]] and then-Disney Chairman and CEO [[Michael Eisner]] made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been. They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney.<ref>{{cite magazine|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2004/01/62104|title=Pixar Says 'So Long' to Disney |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=January 29, 2004}}</ref> Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors. After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying ''Cars'' was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract to see how things would play out between the two companies.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |title=Steve Jobs's Sharp Turn with Cars |author=Grover, Ronald |magazine=[[Business Week]] |date=December 9, 2004 |accessdate=February 23, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311001731/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nPending the Disney acquisition of Pixar in 2006, the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', in case the acquisition fell through, to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels (in contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, ''Ratatouille'' was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee).

One notable example is ''[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]'' which, though released subtitled, had its subtitles altered to remove the political context of the story, had scenes trimmed and changed for violence and pacing, and had the soundtrack changed, removing the famous [[Wong Fei Hung]] theme. Other films that they have altered in this way include ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'', ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (theatrical release), ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'' and [[Jet Li]]'s ''[[Fist of Legend]]''.\n\n[[Peter Biskind]]'s book ''Down and Dirty Pictures'' details many of Weinstein's dishonest dealings with filmmakers.\n\nUnder the Weinsteins, Miramax had a history of buying the rights to [[Asian cinema|Asian films]], only to sit on them without releasing them for some years. One example of this is ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'', a 2002 [[Cinema of China|Chinese]] [[martial arts film]]. It languished in Miramax's vaults for two years before it was salvaged with the intervention of [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Another example is ''[[Tears of the Black Tiger]]'', a [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai film]] originally released in 2000. After changing the ending of the film, ''Tears of the Black Tiger'' sat in Miramax's vaults for five years until its rights were purchased by [[Magnolia Pictures]] in 2006.\n\nThe \"no cuts\" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing the Japanese anime film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' to make it more marketable. In response, [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], a producer at [[Studio Ghibli]], sent an authentic [[katana]] with a simple message: \"No cuts\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/14/japan.awardsandprizes|title=Interview: Hayao Miyazaki|last=Brooks|first=Xan|date=2005-09-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nOne reason for the delays and non-releases of films was an accounting scheme that the Weinsteins used to shift potential money-losing films to future [[fiscal year]]s and ensure they would receive annual bonuses from Disney,<ref name = \"Epstein\">{{cite magazine | last = Epstein | first = Edward Jay | title = The great illusionist | magazine = Slate | date = October 10, 2005 | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2127757/?nav=tap3 | accessdate = January 11, 2007}}</ref> while trying to bar retailers from legally exporting authentic DVDs of the films.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2003/12/61554 | work=Wired | title=Studio Warns Kung Fu Site | date=December 15, 2003}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the Weinsteins' actions, a number of Asian producers who sold their distribution rights to the company refused to do so for their subsequent films.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nDefenders of the company point out that, prior to Miramax, most of the films purchased by the company would have had little to no chance of achieving U.S. distribution other than by very small distributors with minimal marketing expertise and funds. They also state that the purpose of the company's aggressive re-editing technique was always to try to help the films find a broader American audience than they might otherwise find. \"I'm not cutting for fun\", Harvey Weinstein said in an interview. \"I'm cutting for the shit to work. All my life I served one master: the film. I love movies.\".<ref name=\"Mason\">{{cite magazine | last = Mason | first = Ian Garrick | title = When Harvey met Mickey | magazine = New Statesman | date = October 11, 2004 | URL = http://www3.sympatico.ca/ian.g.mason/Harvey_Weinstein.htm }}</ref>\n\nMiramax is also accused of ignoring their more artistic, less audience-friendly films, especially when directors refuse to re-cut them to make them less challenging. ''[[Dead Man]]'', which director [[Jim Jarmusch]] refused to re-cut, got a very limited release and critics have accused the Weinsteins of burying the film.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jim-jarmusch.net/films/dead_man/read_about_it/acid_western_-_jonathan_ros.html |accessdate=October 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307235637/http://www.jim-jarmusch.net/films/dead_man/read_about_it/acid_western_-_jonathan_ros.html |archivedate=March 7, 2009 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Rosenbaum\n | first = Jonathan\n | authorlink = Jonathan Rosenbaum\n | title = Dead Man\n | publisher = [[British Film Institute|BFI]]\n | series = BFI Modern Classics\n | year = 2008\n | isbn = 978-0-85170-806-5 }}</ref>\n\nMiramax was parodied in the [[Kevin Smith]] film ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' (2001), in which the studio attempted to adapt [[Jay and Silent Bob]]'s comic book characters, [[Bluntman and Chronic]], into a movie, thus resulting in the duo traveling to Hollywood to stop them from making the movie. According to Kevin Smith, this film is a direct response to the controversy surrounding his previous film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''.\n\n==Walt Disney Television==\n===American Broadcasting Company===\nOn February 9, 1996, The Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities/ABC, and renamed the broadcasting group '''ABC, Inc'''., although the network also continues to use '''American Broadcasting Companies''', such as on TV productions it owns.\n\nABC's relationship with Disney dates back to 1953 when Leonard Goldenson pledged enough money so that the \"Disneyland\" theme park could be completed. ABC continued to hold Disney notes and stock until 1960, and also had first call on the \"Disneyland\" television series in 1954. With this new relationship came an attempt at cross-promotion, with attractions based on ABC, shows at Disney [[Disney Parks and Resorts|parks]] and an annual soap festival at Walt Disney World (the former president of ABC, Inc., [[Robert Iger]], now heads Disney). In 1997, ABC aired a Saturday morning block called '''One Saturday Morning''', which changed to [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] in 2002. It featured a five-hour line-up of children's shows (mostly [[cartoons]]) for children ages 5\u201312, but it was changed to a four-hour line-up in 2005. Since then, it was aimed for children more in the age 10\u201316 range.\n\nDespite intense micro-managing on the part of Disney management, the flagship television network was slow to turn around. In 1999, the network was able to experience a brief bolster in ratings with the hit [[game show]] ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''. A new national phenomenon, ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', on CBS persuaded the schedulers at ABC to change ''Millionaire'''s slot over to the Wednesday Time slot at 8:00 to kill ''Survivor'' before it got ratings to hold. The first results were promising for CBS; they lost by only a few rating points. ABC tried to keep the strength running, so they tried an unprecedented strategy for ''Millionaire'' by airing the show four times a week during the next Fall season, in the process overexposing the show, as it appeared on the network sometimes five or six nights during a week. ABC's ratings fell dramatically as competitors introduced their own game shows and the public grew tired of the format. [[Alex Wallau]] took over as president in 2000. Despite the repeated overexposure of ''Millionaire'' and its switch to [[Television syndication|syndication]], ABC continued to find some success in dramas such as ''[[The Practice]]'' (which gave birth to a successful spinoff, ''[[Boston Legal]]'', in 2004), ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', and ''[[Once and Again]]''. ABC also had some moderately successful comedies including ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', ''[[Spin City]]'', ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'', ''[[According to Jim]]'', ''[[My Wife and Kids]]'' and ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]''.\n\nStill, one asset that ABC lacked in the early 2000s that most other networks had was popularity in [[reality television]]. ABC's briefly-lived reality shows ''[[Are You Hot?]]'' and ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!]]'' proved to be an embarrassment for the network. By the end of the 2003\u20132004 television season, ABC slumped to fourth place, becoming the first of the original \"Big Three\" networks to fall into such ratings.\n\n====ABC Daytime====\n{{Main|ABC Daytime}}\n*When [[Megan McTavish]] returned as [[head writer]] of ''[[All My Children]]'' in July 2003, she faced criticism for a story that depicted the rape of a lesbian character, [[Bianca Montgomery]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The show also faced opposition to its story of a transgender character in 2006.\n*''ABC Daytime'' scrapped a storyline on ''[[One Life to Live]]'' which was to depict a school shooting rampage on the day the [[Virginia Tech]] massacre occurred on April 17, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=3072097&page=1&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312|title=Daytime Drama Pulls Episodes Involving High School Hostage Situation|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}</ref>\n*The [[Writers Guild of America]] East filed arbitration suits against ''[[ABC Daytime]]'', claiming that they violated the strike-termination agreement by retaining replacement writers (those who choose Financial Core Status) who filled in during the strike on ''All My Children'' instead of bringing back the writers who had been on strike.\n*The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]] as a whole has been criticized for the cancellations of both ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and ''[[All My Children]]'' as well as the near-cancellation of its one remaining soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]''.\n\n\"The strike-termination agreement does not allow the retention of replacement writers in lieu of allowing striking writers to return to their jobs.

The extensive pre-broadcast controversy over the film has included disputes over the accuracy of its dramatization of key events, as well as calls by historians and from former Clinton and Bush administration officials for ABC to re-edit part of the film or not broadcast it at all.

The failure was primarily due to the acquisition being done by the strategic planning department of Disney, without consulting anyone at ABC. The original plan was to use the channel to essentially show re-runs of ABC programming, but this plan was completely impossible since ABC had no syndication rights to the majority of their own programs. During this time, the network did air same-season repeats of ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', ''[[Less Than Perfect]]'', ''[[Life with Bonnie]]'', and ''[[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]]'', almost all of which were [[ABC Studios|Touchstone Television]] productions (''The Bachelor'' is distributed by [[Time Warner]]'s [[Telepictures]]). But in trying to change the focus of the channel, Disney also canceled several Fox Family series, like ''[[State of Grace (television program)|State of Grace]]'', and cut back on the network's [[Television movies|TV movies]], which were among the few programs Fox Family was doing well with. The ratings tumbled further as the network became dependent on syndicated reruns and no original programs (save for original wrap-around segments around ''Bachelor'' repeats, and children's programming).\n<ref>{{cite news|work=Usatoday.com|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2001-12-03-family-channel.htm|date=December 3, 2001|title=Disney refocusing Family channel|first=Gary|last=Levin}}</ref>\n\nThe next major plan was to reposition the channel to market it to college students, young women, or to a more hip audience under the name '''XYZ''', a reverse reference to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Disney soon found that the channel could never be renamed as such. The original sale from CBN to Fox/Saban contained a (now disputed) stipulation that the channel contains the word \"Family\" in the name forever, no matter who owns the network. To create XYZ, the [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#The Family Channel|Family Channel]] would have had to cease to exist&nbsp;\u2014 terminating all existing cable TV contracts&nbsp;\u2014 and XYZ would have to be created as a completely new network. Cable companies would not be obligated to put XYZ in the spot vacated by the Family Channel.

Most critics of the network feel it has gone from a family friendly to \"too risqu\u00e9\", and shows like ''[[Greek (TV series)|Greek]]'' and ''[[The Secret Life of the American Teenager]]'' are far too racy for \"family viewers\". Critics feel that the executives at ABC Family are only after viewership numbers and are unconcerned about showing younger generations in questionable scenarios in series and films. The main focus of criticism is on teenage pregnancy or underage drinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/story/49573/teen-sex-on-abc-family-sparks-debate.html|title=Teen Sex on ABC Family Sparks Debate|author=Amelia Atlas|work=Newser}}</ref>\n\nDespite the channel's name including the word \"Family\", the channel's programming content standards had changed several years earlier after the sale of the channel by International Family Entertainment, and the channel had been airing even some acquired series and movies that contain profanity, violence and sexual content or dialogue after the sale, particularly since being purchased by The Walt Disney Company. ABC Family did air parental advisory tags at the beginning of some TV-14 rated programs, such as ''That '70s Show'' and some episodes of ''The Secret Life of the American Teenager''.\nIn 2015, a survey revealed that viewers who only watched the channel occasionally thought that the channel was entirely family-friendly.

Despite this, family-oriented shows and movies continue to air on the network.\n\n===Disney Channel===\n[[Disney Channel]] has come under heavy criticism in recent years.

This program was called ''[[The Decision (TV special)|The Decision]]'' and received criticism because ESPN ceded control of the hour to an outside source, and the person doing the interview was [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]], who was not an ESPN employee. This is in addition to the hours of hype preceding the special which was in the form of a three-hour ''[[SportsCenter]]'' telecast.\n\nThere was a [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]] scandal, which involved ''[[ESPN College Football]]'' analyst [[Craig James (running back)|Craig James]]. Through James, ESPN used its power to get head coach [[Mike Leach (American football coach)|Mike Leach]] fired because of how James's son, Adam, was treated following a concussion.\n\nESPN has also been accused of overpaying for sports broadcasting rights, and that [[Wall Street]] analysts have raised concerns that this could be a major drain on Disney as a whole, since the amount of money that can be recuperated from [[retransmission consent]] fees and advertising is limited; Disney still profits from the ESPN division but as of 2015 was cutting the network's higher-priced content to ensure long-term profitability.<ref>Crum, Rex (June 29, 2015).

Various tourist attractions and landmarks such as the [[Hollywood Sign]] and the beaches were located less than an hour away from the park.\n* Fans criticized the Paradise Pier area of the park because many of the attractions in this area were generic rides that guests do not expect to find at a Disney park.

Most of Walt's ideas for his planned city were eventually abandoned, and thus the residential areas were never built, causing some to cry foul. Most notably, [[Richard Foglesong]] argues in his book ''Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando'' that Disney has abused its powers by remaining in complete control of the District, and using its autonomy solely for commercial interests inside its self-contained resort instead of maintaining an actual city.<ref name=\"Foglesong\"/> And although Disney built an actual community, [[Celebration, Florida]], on their property in the 1990s, it was later de-annexed from the District and the company's control.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-03-28/business/DISNEYLAND28_1_walt-disney-disney-world-land-holdings | title=Disney sells some of its world | first=Scott | last=Powers | newspaper=Orlando Sentinel | date=March 28, 2006 | accessdate=March 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Disneyland Paris===\nIn May 1992, entertainment magazine [[The Hollywood Reporter]] reported that about 25% of [[Disneyland Paris|Euro Disney]]'s workforce&nbsp;\u2014 approximately 3,000 men and women{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}&nbsp;\u2014 had resigned their jobs due to unacceptable working conditions.

Euro Disney's stock price spiraled downwards and on July 23, 1992, the Resort announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million [[French franc]]s. During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy was such that it was decided to close [[Disney's Newport Bay Club]] hotel for the season.

On February 28, Litvack made an offer (without the consent of Eisner or Frank Wells) to split the debts between Euro Disney creditors and Disney. After the banks showed interest, Litvack informed Eisner and Wells. On March 14, the day before the annual [[shareholder]]s meeting, the banks capitulated to Disney's demands. The [[creditor]] banks bought US$500 million worth of Euro Disney shares, forgave 18 months of [[interest]] and deferred interest payments for three years. The Walt Disney Company invested US$750 million into Euro Disney and granted a five-year suspension of royalty payments. In June that same year, [[Saudi Arabian]] [[Prince Al-Waleed|Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] cut a deal whereby The Walt Disney Company bought 51% of a new US$1.1 billion share issue, the rest being offered to existing shareholders at below-market rates, with the Prince buying any that were not taken up by existing shareholders (up to a 24.5% holding).  Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal was alleged to be a financier of Al Qaeda by The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, also known as the 9/11 Commission.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/world/middleeast/pre-9-11-ties-haunt-saudis-as-new-accusations-surface.html</ref>\n\n[[Walt Disney Studios Park]], which was built in a desperate and rushed attempt to increase the resort's attendance, was also criticized for its lackluster theming, lack of quality attractions and bland environment since its opening. It was also Disney's smallest and least attended theme park. Efforts made to improve the park included the addition of several new attractions, a new themed land [[Toy Story Playland]] and re-theming of other areas. One of the new attractions, [[Crush's Coaster]], was also criticized for its long lines and wait times reaching up to two hours even on non-crowded days due to its popularity, despite being not capable of handling riders at a fast rate. About one hour before the official opening time of the park, guests were able to enter the park to wait in line for the ride, which had not been done before in any other Disney ride. Attempts to apply a [[Fastpass]] line in the ride have been proved to be more inefficient.\n\n===Hong Kong Disneyland Resort===\n{{Main|Hong Kong Disneyland}}\n\n====Overcrowding problems====\nJust before the grand opening, the park was criticized for underestimating the daily capacity limit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/09/07/business/disney.php?page=1|title=It's a small park: Hong Kong Disneyland faces overcrowding|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|year=2005|accessdate=December 31, 2008}}</ref> <!-- well exactly how much is the official limit, then?? opening paragraphs say 32,000! --> The problem became apparent on the charity preview day on September 4, 2005, when 30,000 locals visited the park.

Wait times at fast food outlets were at least 45 minutes in length, and wait times at rides were two hours in length.\n\nAlthough the community, and the park's biggest shareholder, the Hong Kong government, put pressure on the park to lower the capacity, the park insisted on keeping the limit and only agreed to relieve the capacity problem by extending the opening time by one hour or introducing more discounts during weekdays. However, the park said that local visitors tend to stay in the park for about nine hours per visit, implying that the mentioned practices would do little to solve the problem.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nDuring the Chinese New Year 2006, many visitors arrived at the park in the morning bearing valid tickets but were refused entry, because the park was already at capacity.

One of the biggest concerns is that unlike Disney's acquisition of Pixar, Marvel Entertainment, and Lucasfilm, the Disney/Fox deal is a [[horizontal integration]] (in which a company owns a direct competitor) in contrast to a [[vertical integration]] (in which two companies operate different stages for a specific finished product) like the mergers of [[AT&T]]-[[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] and [[Acquisition of NBC Universal by Comcast|Comcast-NBCUniversal]]. Given Disney's already powerful box market shares, a combined Disney/Fox would give it a 39% theatrical market share and would strengthen Disney's already leveraging power over theater owners in its favor without regard to the negative effects on their businesses.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ted|title=Disney-Fox Deal Lands at Uncertain Time for Antitrust Enforcement|url=https://variety.com/2017/politics/news/disney-fox-deal-antitrust-enforcement-1202637338/|magazine=Variety|date=December 14, 2017|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"KI\">{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Meg|last2=Peltz|first2=James F.|title=Massive Disney-Fox deal expected to get close antitrust scrutiny|url=http://beta.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-disney-fox-regulatory-concerns-20171214-story.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 14, 2017|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==''South Park'' controversy==\n{{see also|Band in China}}\n\nThe [[Jonas Brothers]] and the Disney Channel are parodied in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode entitled \"[[The Ring (South Park)|The Ring]]\" and play a prominent role in the episode's plot.

Due to other speculation on the orientation and personal activities of the Jonas brothers, the episode continued to create a running gag on the effect of the Jonas brothers on young girls of the \"tween\" period, often provoking the image that they, too, would become like Mickey Mouse, in most unwanted characteristics. The episode further illustrates the greed of corporate culture by portraying Mickey as capitalizing on religion for profit, while secretly mocking it in a particularly cruel tone: \"Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters!

Owing to its status as a powerful and influential company, Disney's business practices, executives and content have been heavily disapproved in the media, as well as by activist groups. Some of Disney's various business ventures, including television networks, theme parks, and product lines have also sparked controversy among groups of consumers and media outlets.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Best|first=Joel|last2=Lowney|first2=Kathleen S.|date=Summer 2009|title=The Disadvantage of a Good Reputation: Disney as a Target for Social Problems Claims|jstor=40220139|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|volume= 30|issue= 3|pages=431\u2013449}}</ref>\n\n==Company officials==\n{{Main|List of management of The Walt Disney Company}}\n\n===Michael Eisner===\n{{Main|Michael Eisner#\"Save Disney\" campaign and the ousting of Eisner}}\n\nIn 1977, [[Roy E. Disney]], the son of Disney co-founder [[Roy O. Disney]] and nephew of [[Walt Disney]], resigned as an executive due to disagreements with his colleagues' decisions at the time. As he claimed later, \"I just felt creatively the company was not going anywhere interesting. It was very stifling.\" However, he retained a seat on the board of directors. His resignation from the board in 1984, which occurred in the midst of a corporate takeover battle, was the beginning of a series of developments that led to the replacement of company president and CEO [[Ronald William Miller]] (married to Walt's daughter [[Diane Marie Disney]]) by [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Frank Wells]]. Roy soon returned to the company as vice-chairman of the board of directors and head of the animation department.\n\nHowever, Michael Eisner has been criticized for his management style. The book ''[[DisneyWar]]'' by [[James B. Stewart]] is an expos\u00e9 of Eisner's 20-year tenure as Chairman and CEO at [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Stewart describes some of the following:\n* The struggle to get ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' made in time and on budget despite the ambitions of [[Robert Zemeckis]] and [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] to make the film bigger and bolder\n* Eisner's tension with [[Frank Wells]] before Wells' death\n* Eisner's friendship-turned-rivalry with [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]]\n* Eisner's tension with [[Michael Ovitz]] during Ovitz's short-lived presidency\n* The purchase of the [[ABC Family]] channel and its content and the fallout resulting from Disney's inability to revive it\n* [[Hilary Duff]]'s decision to quit the [[Disney Channel]] because of low salary\n* Financing of the film ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''\n* [[Pixar]]'s decision not to renew its relationship with Disney\n* The hostile takeover attempt by [[Comcast]].\n\nIn 2003, Roy resigned from his positions as Disney vice chairman and chairman of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]], accusing Eisner of [[micromanagement]], flops with the ABC television network, timidity in the [[theme park]] business, turning The Walt Disney Company into a \"rapacious, soul-less\" company, and refusing to establish a clear succession plan, as well as a string of box-office movie flops starting in the year 2000.\n\nOn March 3, 2004, at Disney's annual shareholders' meeting, a surprising 43% of Disney's shareholders, predominantly rallied by former board members Roy Disney and [[Stanley Gold]], withheld their [[proxy voting|proxies]] to re-elect Eisner to the board. Disney's board then gave the chairmanship position to [[George J. Mitchell]]. However, the board did not immediately remove Eisner as chief executive.\n\nOn March 13, 2005, Eisner announced that he would step down as CEO one year before his contract expired. On September 30, Eisner resigned both as an executive and as a member of the board of directors, and, severing all formal ties with the company, he waived his contractual rights to perks such as the use of a corporate jet and an office at the company's [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] headquarters. Eisner's replacement was his longtime assistant, [[Robert Iger]].\n\n==Walt Disney Studios==\n===Walt Disney Animation Studios===\n====Ethnic and racial stereotyping====\nOver the years many scholars, film critics, and parent groups have been critical of Disney for the portrayal of non-whites in a stereotypical image which led to the speculation that [[Walt Disney]] was racist.<ref name=\"Gabler, Neal 2006\" /> For example, it is told that during a story meeting on ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' he referred to the scene when the dwarfs pile on top of each other as an (expletive) \"pile\" and that he used the term \"[[pickaninny]]\" whilst casting ''Song of the South''. The supposed insensitivity Disney and some of his employees showed in many cartoons including the short ''[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]'' where Mickey Mouse dresses in [[blackface]], the stereotypical \"Black\" Bird in the short ''[[Who Killed Cock Robin? (1935 film)|Who Killed Cock Robin]]'', the black servant centaurette Sunflower in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (then edited out of the successive releases), the film ''[[Song of the South]]'', which was accused to be an idealized version of slavery (even though the film takes place after the [[American Civil War]]), the depiction of Native \"Americans\" in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (considering though the source material, the comical nature of the animated film and the fact that they are inhabitants of the imaginary and fantastic [[Neverland]]), the cunning and manipulative Siamese cats Si and Am in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' and the jazzy black crows in ''[[Dumbo]]'' (although, in that particular instance, they were made intelligent, free spirited and sympathetic to Dumbo's plight, as they knew what it was like to be ostracized. Plus, they were created to be a satirical way to mock the [[Jim Crow laws]] in the [[Southern USA]] during the period the film was produced, in fact ''Dumbo'' is set in [[Florida]] in 1941).<ref name=\"Gabler, Neal 2006\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://floydnormancom.squarespace.com/blog/2019/4/27/black-crows-and-other-pc-nonsense|title=http://floydnormancom.squarespace.com/blog/2019/4/27/black-crows-and-other-pc-nonsense|website=MrFun's Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref> This appears to be a moot point, however, as many similar or even much more exaggerated gags and stereotypes existed in a number of cartoons from many other studios during that time, including [[Fleischer Studios]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]], and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]. ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' director [[Bob Clampett]] who directed the infamous [[Merrie Melodies]] shorts ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Tin Pan Alley Cats]]'', claimed that {{cquote|''Everybody, including blacks had a good time when these cartoons first came out. All the controversy developed in later years merely because of changing attitudes toward black civil rights that have happened since then''.}}\nAdditionally, despite Walt Disney's occasional slurs, the Disney studio hired several employees of all racial backgrounds, including [[Floyd Norman]] (African American), [[Cy Young (animator)|Cy Young]], [[Tyrus Wong]], [[Iwao Takamoto]], and [[Bob Kuwahara]] (Chinese/Japanese).<ref name=\"Gabler, Neal 2006\">Gabler, Neal (2006) ''Walt Disney, The Triumph of American Imagination'', Alfred A. Knopf Inc. New York City, U.S.A</ref> Upon a home screening of ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', Walt Disney quoted \"That's the kind of film I wish I could make.\"<ref name=\"Gabler, Neal 2006\" /> Similar rumors persist about Walt Disney's alleged [[anti-Semitism]] and Nazi sympathies, in spite of the fact that the studio made anti-Nazi propaganda during [[World War II]] and hired a number of Jews as animators and songwriters during Walt's lifetime, including [[Art Babbitt]] and the [[Sherman Brothers]]. Once ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'''s crew found out that [[Christian Rub]], the voice of [[Geppetto]], was a Nazi sympathizer, they \"got even with him in the best way possible.\" They had Rub perform on a platform in the scene where Geppetto is inside Monstro's belly, and shook it violently, giving him \"a ride he never forgot.\"\n\nIn 1989, the African American actor [[Nick Stewart]] was called back to Disney to reprise his role of [[Br'er Bear]] for the [[Splash Mountain]] ride. Disney Historian Jim Korkis asked him if he thought it was at all degrading to play Br'er Bear in ''[[Song of the South]]'', regarding all the controversy of the portrayal of African Americans. Stewart laughed and replied \"Disney treated us like Kings.\" He concluded saying that the money he earned being Br'er Bear in ''Song of the South'' went towards a theatre for African American actors to play roles other than butlers and maids. He also said he was to do the same thing with the money from the Splash Mountain ride.\n\nSince its release in 1992, Disney's ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' has been accused of perpetuating negative racial and ethnic stereotypes of Arabs. In July 1993, Disney announced that it would alter a line in the film's opening song, \"Arabian Nights,\" written by [[Howard Ashman]] and [[Alan Menken]]. In the original film, the song featured the lyrics, \"Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home.\" After Arab-American groups complained that the line was derogatory to Middle Easterners, Disney amended the lyrics in later editions of the film to an alternate lyric written by Ashman: \"Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home.\" Menken approved the change before its adoption, as did the estate of Ashman, who had died before the film's completion. The [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] (ADC) further requested that the word \"barbaric\" be removed; however, Disney refused this, claiming that the word appeared in all versions of Ashman's text and it referred to the film's desert setting in the altered lyrics. Don Bustany, president of the ADC's Los Angeles chapter, argued that the existing alterations were \"nowhere near adequate, considering the racism depicted in ''Aladdin''...there still remains the very sleazy, burlesque character in the prologue and the scene where a merchant is going to cut off the hand of Princess Jasmine because she took an apple from his stand to give to a hungry child.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Fox |first=David J. |date=1993-07-10 |title=Disney Will Alter Song in 'Aladdin' |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-07-10-ca-11747-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>\n\nA March 1995 article published on the ADC's website further criticized ''Aladdin'' for depicting the film's protagonists, Aladdin and Jasmine, with light skin and [[Anglicization|Anglicized]] features, in contrast to dark-skinned merchants and palace guards who were cruel, greedy, and vicious while featuring Arab accents and distorted facial features.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=283 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405005650/http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=283 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-04-05 |title=Arab Stereotypes and American Educators |last1=Wingfield |first1=Marvin |last2=Karaman |first2=Bushra |date=March 1995 |website=American-Arab Anti-Discrimination League |access-date=2019-05-28 |quote=The film\u2019s light-skinned lead characters, Aladdin and Jasmine, have Anglicized features and Anglo-American accents.

While undetectable when played at the usual rate of 24 [[film frame]]s per second, the Laserdisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals.

The castle is displayed in the artwork for the cover for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on home video in 1990. Close examination of the cover artwork, as well as the poster for the film, shows an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear on the cover of the second releasing of the movie. There was also a widespread rumor in the early to mid-1990s that a clergyman is seen with an [[erection]] during a wedding scene, specifically, the scene in which a brainwashed Prince Eric is about to marry Ursula the sea witch in disguise.<ref name=\"Austin American-Statesman\">{{cite news|title=Sex Seen (by Some) in Films by Disney|last=Smith|first=Russell W.|date=September 8, 1995|newspaper=Austin American-Statesman|pages=d1}}</ref><ref name=\"Snopes2\" /><ref name=\"Recorder2\" /> The clergyman is a short man, dressed in bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. Because of the controversy, this scene was later altered in the film's 2006 Platinum Edition DVD release so that the clergyman is standing on a small platform box and that his knee is no longer visible underneath his robes. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.<ref name=\"Snopes2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/minister.asp |title=Little Mermaid Minister |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=July 15, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Recorder2\">{{cite news|title=Help the Needy; Help Yourself|last=Beck|first=Susan|date=January 5, 1996|publisher=The Recorder|pages=2}}</ref><ref name=\"March 1996\">{{cite magazine|title=When the Media Miss Real Messages in Subliminal Stories|last=Emery Jr.|first=C.

Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled [[Film marketing|marketing]] and [[Film distributor|distribution]]. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a distribution fee. The lack of story and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=April 22, 2008 |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_504.html |title=Disney trying to patch things up with Pixar |publisher=Movies Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209231544/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_504.html |archivedate=December 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe two companies attempted to reach a new agreement in early 2004.

After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying ''Cars'' was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract to see how things would play out between the two companies.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |title=Steve Jobs's Sharp Turn with Cars |author=Grover, Ronald |magazine=[[Business Week]] |date=December 9, 2004 |accessdate=February 23, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311001731/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nPending the Disney acquisition of Pixar in 2006, the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', in case the acquisition fell through, to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels (in contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, ''Ratatouille'' was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee).

One notable example is ''[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]'' which, though released subtitled, had its subtitles altered to remove the political context of the story, had scenes trimmed and changed for violence and pacing, and had the soundtrack changed, removing the famous [[Wong Fei Hung]] theme. Other films that they have altered in this way include ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'', ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (theatrical release), ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'' and [[Jet Li]]'s ''[[Fist of Legend]]''.\n\n[[Peter Biskind]]'s book ''Down and Dirty Pictures'' details many of Weinstein's dishonest dealings with filmmakers.\n\nUnder the Weinsteins, Miramax had a history of buying the rights to [[Asian cinema|Asian films]], only to sit on them without releasing them for some years. One example of this is ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'', a 2002 [[Cinema of China|Chinese]] [[martial arts film]]. It languished in Miramax's vaults for two years before it was salvaged with the intervention of [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Another example is ''[[Tears of the Black Tiger]]'', a [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai film]] originally released in 2000. After changing the ending of the film, ''Tears of the Black Tiger'' sat in Miramax's vaults for five years until its rights were purchased by [[Magnolia Pictures]] in 2006.\n\nThe \"no cuts\" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing the Japanese anime film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' to make it more marketable. In response, [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], a producer at [[Studio Ghibli]], sent an authentic [[katana]] with a simple message: \"No cuts\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/14/japan.awardsandprizes|title=Interview: Hayao Miyazaki|last=Brooks|first=Xan|date=2005-09-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nOne reason for the delays and non-releases of films was an accounting scheme that the Weinsteins used to shift potential money-losing films to future [[fiscal year]]s and ensure they would receive annual bonuses from Disney,<ref name = \"Epstein\">{{cite magazine | last = Epstein | first = Edward Jay | title = The great illusionist | magazine = Slate | date = October 10, 2005 | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2127757/?nav=tap3 | accessdate = January 11, 2007}}</ref> while trying to bar retailers from legally exporting authentic DVDs of the films.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2003/12/61554 | work=Wired | title=Studio Warns Kung Fu Site | date=December 15, 2003}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the Weinsteins' actions, a number of Asian producers who sold their distribution rights to the company refused to do so for their subsequent films.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nDefenders of the company point out that, prior to Miramax, most of the films purchased by the company would have had little to no chance of achieving U.S. distribution other than by very small distributors with minimal marketing expertise and funds. They also state that the purpose of the company's aggressive re-editing technique was always to try to help the films find a broader American audience than they might otherwise find. \"I'm not cutting for fun\", Harvey Weinstein said in an interview. \"I'm cutting for the shit to work.

According to Kevin Smith, this film is a direct response to the controversy surrounding his previous film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''.\n\n==Walt Disney Television==\n===American Broadcasting Company===\nOn February 9, 1996, The Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities/ABC, and renamed the broadcasting group '''ABC, Inc'''., although the network also continues to use '''American Broadcasting Companies''', such as on TV productions it owns.\n\nABC's relationship with Disney dates back to 1953 when Leonard Goldenson pledged enough money so that the \"Disneyland\" theme park could be completed. ABC continued to hold Disney notes and stock until 1960, and also had first call on the \"Disneyland\" television series in 1954. With this new relationship came an attempt at cross-promotion, with attractions based on ABC, shows at Disney [[Disney Parks and Resorts|parks]] and an annual soap festival at Walt Disney World (the former president of ABC, Inc., [[Robert Iger]], now heads Disney). In 1997, ABC aired a Saturday morning block called '''One Saturday Morning''', which changed to [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] in 2002. It featured a five-hour line-up of children's shows (mostly [[cartoons]]) for children ages 5\u201312, but it was changed to a four-hour line-up in 2005. Since then, it was aimed for children more in the age 10\u201316 range.\n\nDespite intense micro-managing on the part of Disney management, the flagship television network was slow to turn around. In 1999, the network was able to experience a brief bolster in ratings with the hit [[game show]] ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''. A new national phenomenon, ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', on CBS persuaded the schedulers at ABC to change ''Millionaire'''s slot over to the Wednesday Time slot at 8:00 to kill ''Survivor'' before it got ratings to hold. The first results were promising for CBS; they lost by only a few rating points. ABC tried to keep the strength running, so they tried an unprecedented strategy for ''Millionaire'' by airing the show four times a week during the next Fall season, in the process overexposing the show, as it appeared on the network sometimes five or six nights during a week. ABC's ratings fell dramatically as competitors introduced their own game shows and the public grew tired of the format. [[Alex Wallau]] took over as president in 2000. Despite the repeated overexposure of ''Millionaire'' and its switch to [[Television syndication|syndication]], ABC continued to find some success in dramas such as ''[[The Practice]]'' (which gave birth to a successful spinoff, ''[[Boston Legal]]'', in 2004), ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', and ''[[Once and Again]]''. ABC also had some moderately successful comedies including ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', ''[[Spin City]]'', ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'', ''[[According to Jim]]'', ''[[My Wife and Kids]]'' and ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]''.\n\nStill, one asset that ABC lacked in the early 2000s that most other networks had was popularity in [[reality television]]. ABC's briefly-lived reality shows ''[[Are You Hot?]]'' and ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!]]'' proved to be an embarrassment for the network. By the end of the 2003\u20132004 television season, ABC slumped to fourth place, becoming the first of the original \"Big Three\" networks to fall into such ratings.\n\n====ABC Daytime====\n{{Main|ABC Daytime}}\n*When [[Megan McTavish]] returned as [[head writer]] of ''[[All My Children]]'' in July 2003, she faced criticism for a story that depicted the rape of a lesbian character, [[Bianca Montgomery]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The show also faced opposition to its story of a transgender character in 2006.\n*''ABC Daytime'' scrapped a storyline on ''[[One Life to Live]]'' which was to depict a school shooting rampage on the day the [[Virginia Tech]] massacre occurred on April 17, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=3072097&page=1&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312|title=Daytime Drama Pulls Episodes Involving High School Hostage Situation|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}</ref>\n*The [[Writers Guild of America]] East filed arbitration suits against ''[[ABC Daytime]]'', claiming that they violated the strike-termination agreement by retaining replacement writers (those who choose Financial Core Status) who filled in during the strike on ''All My Children'' instead of bringing back the writers who had been on strike.\n*The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]] as a whole has been criticized for the cancellations of both ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and ''[[All My Children]]'' as well as the near-cancellation of its one remaining soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]''.\n\n\"The strike-termination agreement does not allow the retention of replacement writers in lieu of allowing striking writers to return to their jobs.

Others, most notably ''[[The Washington Post]]'' television columnist, thought it was a [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] stunt for [[sweeps]], and indeed ''Nightline'' was the highest-rated program during that time period, and had about 30% more viewers than other ''Nightline'' programs that week.

The extensive pre-broadcast controversy over the film has included disputes over the accuracy of its dramatization of key events, as well as calls by historians and from former Clinton and Bush administration officials for ABC to re-edit part of the film or not broadcast it at all. According to the official statement released by ABC on September 7, 2006, the film is a dramatization, not a documentary, drawn from a variety of sources, including [[The 9/11 Commission Report]], other published materials, and from personal interviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wzzm13.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=60898 |title=Official ABC Statement on The Path to 9/11 |publisher=WZZM13.com |date=September 7, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe main source of the controversy stems from portions of the film concerned with the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] in the 1990s.

The failure was primarily due to the acquisition being done by the strategic planning department of Disney, without consulting anyone at ABC. The original plan was to use the channel to essentially show re-runs of ABC programming, but this plan was completely impossible since ABC had no syndication rights to the majority of their own programs. During this time, the network did air same-season repeats of ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', ''[[Less Than Perfect]]'', ''[[Life with Bonnie]]'', and ''[[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]]'', almost all of which were [[ABC Studios|Touchstone Television]] productions (''The Bachelor'' is distributed by [[Time Warner]]'s [[Telepictures]]). But in trying to change the focus of the channel, Disney also canceled several Fox Family series, like ''[[State of Grace (television program)|State of Grace]]'', and cut back on the network's [[Television movies|TV movies]], which were among the few programs Fox Family was doing well with. The ratings tumbled further as the network became dependent on syndicated reruns and no original programs (save for original wrap-around segments around ''Bachelor'' repeats, and children's programming).\n<ref>{{cite news|work=Usatoday.com|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2001-12-03-family-channel.htm|date=December 3, 2001|title=Disney refocusing Family channel|first=Gary|last=Levin}}</ref>\n\nThe next major plan was to reposition the channel to market it to college students, young women, or to a more hip audience under the name '''XYZ''', a reverse reference to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Disney soon found that the channel could never be renamed as such. The original sale from CBN to Fox/Saban contained a (now disputed) stipulation that the channel contains the word \"Family\" in the name forever, no matter who owns the network. To create XYZ, the [[History of Freeform (TV channel)#The Family Channel|Family Channel]] would have had to cease to exist&nbsp;\u2014 terminating all existing cable TV contracts&nbsp;\u2014 and XYZ would have to be created as a completely new network.

Most critics of the network feel it has gone from a family friendly to \"too risqu\u00e9\", and shows like ''[[Greek (TV series)|Greek]]'' and ''[[The Secret Life of the American Teenager]]'' are far too racy for \"family viewers\". Critics feel that the executives at ABC Family are only after viewership numbers and are unconcerned about showing younger generations in questionable scenarios in series and films. The main focus of criticism is on teenage pregnancy or underage drinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/story/49573/teen-sex-on-abc-family-sparks-debate.html|title=Teen Sex on ABC Family Sparks Debate|author=Amelia Atlas|work=Newser}}</ref>\n\nDespite the channel's name including the word \"Family\", the channel's programming content standards had changed several years earlier after the sale of the channel by International Family Entertainment, and the channel had been airing even some acquired series and movies that contain profanity, violence and sexual content or dialogue after the sale, particularly since being purchased by The Walt Disney Company. ABC Family did air parental advisory tags at the beginning of some TV-14 rated programs, such as ''That '70s Show'' and some episodes of ''The Secret Life of the American Teenager''.\nIn 2015, a survey revealed that viewers who only watched the channel occasionally thought that the channel was entirely family-friendly.

This program was called ''[[The Decision (TV special)|The Decision]]'' and received criticism because ESPN ceded control of the hour to an outside source, and the person doing the interview was [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]], who was not an ESPN employee. This is in addition to the hours of hype preceding the special which was in the form of a three-hour ''[[SportsCenter]]'' telecast.\n\nThere was a [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]] scandal, which involved ''[[ESPN College Football]]'' analyst [[Craig James (running back)|Craig James]].

Euro Disney's stock price spiraled downwards and on July 23, 1992, the Resort announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million [[French franc]]s. During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy was such that it was decided to close [[Disney's Newport Bay Club]] hotel for the season.

On February 28, Litvack made an offer (without the consent of Eisner or Frank Wells) to split the debts between Euro Disney creditors and Disney. After the banks showed interest, Litvack informed Eisner and Wells. On March 14, the day before the annual [[shareholder]]s meeting, the banks capitulated to Disney's demands. The [[creditor]] banks bought US$500 million worth of Euro Disney shares, forgave 18 months of [[interest]] and deferred interest payments for three years. The Walt Disney Company invested US$750 million into Euro Disney and granted a five-year suspension of royalty payments. In June that same year, [[Saudi Arabian]] [[Prince Al-Waleed|Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] cut a deal whereby The Walt Disney Company bought 51% of a new US$1.1 billion share issue, the rest being offered to existing shareholders at below-market rates, with the Prince buying any that were not taken up by existing shareholders (up to a 24.5% holding).

It was also Disney's smallest and least attended theme park. Efforts made to improve the park included the addition of several new attractions, a new themed land [[Toy Story Playland]] and re-theming of other areas. One of the new attractions, [[Crush's Coaster]], was also criticized for its long lines and wait times reaching up to two hours even on non-crowded days due to its popularity, despite being not capable of handling riders at a fast rate. About one hour before the official opening time of the park, guests were able to enter the park to wait in line for the ride, which had not been done before in any other Disney ride. Attempts to apply a [[Fastpass]] line in the ride have been proved to be more inefficient.\n\n===Hong Kong Disneyland Resort===\n{{Main|Hong Kong Disneyland}}\n\n====Overcrowding problems====\nJust before the grand opening, the park was criticized for underestimating the daily capacity limit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/09/07/business/disney.php?page=1|title=It's a small park: Hong Kong Disneyland faces overcrowding|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|year=2005|accessdate=December 31, 2008}}</ref> <!-- well exactly how much is the official limit, then?? opening paragraphs say 32,000! --> The problem became apparent on the charity preview day on September 4, 2005, when 30,000 locals visited the park.

The episode further illustrates the greed of corporate culture by portraying Mickey as capitalizing on religion for profit, while secretly mocking it in a particularly cruel tone: \"Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters!

It was formed in 1688 to control the powers of the Governor of Madras, [[Elihu Yale]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/02/stories/2003040200100300.htm The First Corporation - ''The Hindu'', 2 April 2003]</ref> The Corporation was created by a Royal Charter issued on 30 December 1687 by [[James II of England|King James II]] on the advice of the chairman of the [[East India Company]], [[Sir Josiah Child|Josiah Child]], on the model of Dutch Government in the East Indies.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/> The charter constituted the existing town of Fort St. George and all the territories belonging to the town, not exceeding a distance of ten miles from the Fort, into a Corporation. The Parliamentary Act of 1792 conferred the new Corporation power to levy municipal taxes in the city. The municipal administration also commenced from this act, making provision for the administration of the city. The Municipal Act continued to be amended, constantly introducing major changes in the constitution and powers of the Corporation from time to time.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/>\n\nPrior to the establishments of the corporation, the [[Governors of Madras|Governor of Madras]] or the Company's agent managed the affairs of the [[Fort St. George (India)|Fort St George]] and its residents with the assistance of a headman, an accountant, and the head of watch and ward. The Governor sat as Madras's [[Justice of the Peace]]. Taxes were introduced by Governor [[Streynsham Master]] (1678\u20131681). Complications arising out of these impositions and the growing expenses of an expanding town led to Sir Josiah drawing up plans for a more formal body of civic administration. The Corporation was inaugurated on 29 September 1688 with power to decide on petty cases, levy rates upon the inhabitants for building of schools, a town hall and a jail, when the new Mayor, 12 Aldermen and 60 Burgesses took their oaths.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/> The first members of the Corporation were representatives from diverse ethnicities. Nathaniel Higginson was the first Mayor, and he appointed representatives from the English, Scottish, French, Portuguese, and Indian mercantile communities as Aldermen. The post of the Mayor was held for one year at a time, the Mayor being elected by the Aldermen, whose term of office was for life.\n\nBy 1856, the duties of the Corporation became more clearly defined. In 1919, the Aldermen were re-styled as 'Councillors'. The title of 'Mayor' had been replaced by 'President', and P. Theagaraya Chetty was nominated as President, the first Indian to be so chosen. However, the office of Mayor was re-created in 1933, when Kumararajah [[M. A. Muthiah Chettiar]] made the transition from last President to first new Mayor. The mayoralty has remained thereafter.\n\nBy 1901, the Corporation had grown to encompass an area of 68&nbsp;sq&nbsp;km comprising 30 territorial divisions with a population of 540,000.<ref name=\"CC_HealthInfrastructure\">{{cite web\n | last =\n | first =\n | authorlink =\n | title = Bus Route Roads\n | work =\n | publisher = Corporation of Chennai\n | date =\n | url = http://www.chennaicorporation.gov.in/departments/roads/index.htm\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 16 Dec 2012}}</ref> In 1913, the Corporation moved to the newly constructed [[Ripon Building]], which was built on parts of the People's Park. The building was named after [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]] who, as [[Viceroy of India]] from 1880 to 1884, had introduced local government reforms. He is remembered in a statue in the Corporation precincts. The first native Indian to both govern the [[Madras Presidency]] and later serve as Mayor of erstwhile [[Madras]] was the Honourable [[K. Sriramulu Naidu]], who served during the 1930s and 1940s.

It was formed in 1688 to control the powers of the Governor of Madras, [[Elihu Yale]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/02/stories/2003040200100300.htm The First Corporation - ''The Hindu'', 2 April 2003]</ref> The Corporation was created by a Royal Charter issued on 30 December 1687 by [[James II of England|King James II]] on the advice of the chairman of the [[East India Company]], [[Sir Josiah Child|Josiah Child]], on the model of Dutch Government in the East Indies.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/> The charter constituted the existing town of Fort St. George and all the territories belonging to the town, not exceeding a distance of ten miles from the Fort, into a Corporation. The Parliamentary Act of 1792 conferred the new Corporation power to levy municipal taxes in the city. The municipal administration also commenced from this act, making provision for the administration of the city. The Municipal Act continued to be amended, constantly introducing major changes in the constitution and powers of the Corporation from time to time.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/>\n\nPrior to the establishments of the corporation, the [[Governors of Madras|Governor of Madras]] or the Company's agent managed the affairs of the [[Fort St. George (India)|Fort St George]] and its residents with the assistance of a headman, an accountant, and the head of watch and ward. The Governor sat as Madras's [[Justice of the Peace]]. Taxes were introduced by Governor [[Streynsham Master]] (1678\u20131681). Complications arising out of these impositions and the growing expenses of an expanding town led to Sir Josiah drawing up plans for a more formal body of civic administration. The Corporation was inaugurated on 29 September 1688 with power to decide on petty cases, levy rates upon the inhabitants for building of schools, a town hall and a jail, when the new Mayor, 12 Aldermen and 60 Burgesses took their oaths.<ref name=\"AboutCC\"/> The first members of the Corporation were representatives from diverse ethnicities. Nathaniel Higginson was the first Mayor, and he appointed representatives from the English, Scottish, French, Portuguese, and Indian mercantile communities as Aldermen. The post of the Mayor was held for one year at a time, the Mayor being elected by the Aldermen, whose term of office was for life.\n\nBy 1856, the duties of the Corporation became more clearly defined. In 1919, the Aldermen were re-styled as 'Councillors'. The title of 'Mayor' had been replaced by 'President', and P. Theagaraya Chetty was nominated as President, the first Indian to be so chosen. However, the office of Mayor was re-created in 1933, when Kumararajah [[M. A. Muthiah Chettiar]] made the transition from last President to first new Mayor. The mayoralty has remained thereafter.\n\nBy 1901, the Corporation had grown to encompass an area of 68&nbsp;sq&nbsp;km comprising 30 territorial divisions with a population of 540,000.<ref name=\"CC_HealthInfrastructure\">{{cite web\n | last =\n | first =\n | authorlink =\n | title = Bus Route Roads\n | work =\n | publisher = Corporation of Chennai\n | date =\n | url = http://www.chennaicorporation.gov.in/departments/roads/index.htm\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 16 Dec 2012}}</ref> In 1913, the Corporation moved to the newly constructed [[Ripon Building]], which was built on parts of the People's Park. The building was named after [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]] who, as [[Viceroy of India]] from 1880 to 1884, had introduced local government reforms. He is remembered in a statue in the Corporation precincts. The first native Indian to both govern the [[Madras Presidency]] and later serve as Mayor of erstwhile [[Madras]] was the Honourable [[K.

Fidelity is broadly classified as one of three categories: low, medium, and high. Specific descriptions of fidelity levels are subject to interpretation, but the following generalizations can be made:\n* Low \u2013 the minimum simulation required for a system to respond to accept inputs and provide outputs\n* Medium \u2013 responds automatically to stimuli, with limited accuracy\n* High \u2013 nearly indistinguishable or as close as possible to the real system\n\nHuman in the loop simulations can include a computer simulation as a so-called ''synthetic environment''.{{refn|name=\"environment\"|1=[[Thales Group|Thales]] defines synthetic environment as \"the counterpart to simulated models of sensors, platforms and other active objects\" for \"the simulation of the external factors that affect them\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thalesresearch.com/Default.aspx?tabid=181|website=Thalse|accessdate=2007-12-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621052423/http://thalesresearch.com/Default.aspx?tabid=181|archivedate=2006-06-21|title= Modelling, Simulation & Synthetic Environments}}</ref> while other vendors use the term for more visual, [[virtual reality]]-style simulators.<ref>{{cite web|title=Synthetic Environments|website=CAE|url= http://www.cae.com/www2004/Products_and_Services/Civil_Simulation_and_Training/Simulation_Equipment/Visual_Solutions/Synthetic_Environments/index.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080122060652/http://www.cae.com/www2004/Products_and_Services/Civil_Simulation_and_Training/Simulation_Equipment/Visual_Solutions/Synthetic_Environments/index.shtml|archivedate=2008-01-22}}</ref>}}\n\n''Simulation in failure analysis'' refers to simulation in which we create environment/conditions to identify the cause of equipment failure. This was the best and fastest method to identify the failure cause.\n\n==Computer simulation==\n{{Main|Computer simulation}}\nA computer simulation (or \"sim\") is an attempt to model a real-life or hypothetical situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works. By changing variables in the simulation, [[prediction]]s may be made about the behaviour of the system. It is a tool to virtually investigate the behaviour of the system under study.<ref name=\"definition\"/>\n\nComputer simulation has become a useful part of [[model (abstract)|modeling]] many natural systems in [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]],<ref>For a popular research project in the field of [[biochemistry]] where \"computer simulation is particularly well suited to address these questions\"[http://folding.stanford.edu/Pande/Main Folding@home - Main], see [[Folding@Home]].</ref> and human systems in [[economics]] and [[social science]] (e.g., [[computational sociology]]) as well as in [[engineering]] to gain insight into the operation of those systems. A good example of the usefulness of using computers to simulate can be found in the field of [[network traffic simulation]]. In such simulations, the [[model (abstract)|model]] behaviour will change each simulation according to the set of initial parameters assumed for the environment.\n\nTraditionally, the formal modeling of systems has been via a [[mathematical model]], which attempts to find analytical solutions enabling the prediction of the behaviour of the system from a set of parameters and initial conditions. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitution for, modeling systems for which simple [[closed-form solution|closed form analytic solutions]] are not possible. There are many different types of computer simulation, the common feature they all share is the attempt to generate a sample of representative [[scenario]]s for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states would be prohibitive or impossible.\n\nSeveral software packages exist for running computer-based simulation modeling (e.g. [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulation, [[stochastic|stochastic modeling]], multimethod modeling) that makes all the modeling almost effortless.\n\nModern usage of the term \"computer simulation\" may encompass virtually any computer-based representation.\n\n===Computer science===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Emulator]] -->\n\nIn [[computer science]], simulation has some specialized meanings: [[Alan Turing]] used the term \"simulation\" to refer to what happens when a [[Universal Turing machine|universal machine]] executes a state transition table (in modern terminology, a computer runs a program) that describes the state transitions, inputs and outputs of a subject discrete-state machine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.mit.edu/manoli/turing/www/turing.html|title=Universal Turing Machine|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>  The computer simulates the subject machine. Accordingly, in [[theoretical computer science]] the term ''[[simulation preorder|simulation]]'' is a relation between [[state transition system]]s, useful in the study of [[operational semantics]].\n\nLess theoretically, an interesting application of computer simulation is to simulate computers using computers. In [[computer architecture]], a type of simulator, typically called an ''[[emulator]]'', is often used to execute a program that has to run on some inconvenient type of computer (for example, a newly designed computer that has not yet been built or an obsolete computer that is no longer available), or in a tightly controlled testing environment (see ''[[Computer architecture simulator]]'' and ''[[Platform virtualization]]''). For example, simulators have been used to debug a [[microprogram]] or sometimes commercial application programs, before the program is downloaded to the target machine. Since the operation of the computer is simulated, all of the information about the computer's operation is directly available to the programmer, and the speed and execution of the simulation can be varied at will.\n\nSimulators may also be used to interpret [[fault tree]]s, or test [[VLSI]] logic designs before they are constructed. [[Symbolic simulation]] uses variables to stand for unknown values.\n\nIn the field of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], simulations of physical processes are often used in conjunction with [[evolutionary computation]] to optimize control strategies.\n\n==Simulation in education and training==\n{{Main|Adaptive educational hypermedia}}\n\nSimulation is extensively used for educational purposes. It is used for cases where it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a \"safe\" virtual environment yet living a [[lifelike experience]] (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system. \n\nSimulations in education are somewhat like training simulations. They focus on specific tasks. The term 'microworld' is used to refer to educational simulations which model some abstract concept rather than simulating a realistic object or environment, or in some cases model a real-world environment in a simplistic way so as to help a learner develop an understanding of the key concepts. Normally, a user can create some sort of construction within the microworld that will behave in a way consistent with the concepts being modeled. [[Seymour Papert]] was one of the first to advocate the value of microworlds, and the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] programming environment developed by Papert is one of the most well-known microworlds.\n\n[[Project Management Simulation]] is increasingly used to train students and professionals in the art and science of project management. Using simulation for [[project management]] training improves learning retention and enhances the learning process.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Davidovitch, L.|author2=A. Parush|author3=A.

These may, for example, take the form of civics simulations, in which participants assume roles in a simulated society, or international relations simulations in which participants engage in negotiations, alliance formation, trade, diplomacy, and the use of force. Such simulations might be based on fictitious political systems, or be based on current or historical events.

Virtual simulations allow users to interact with a virtual world. Virtual worlds operate on platforms of integrated software and hardware components. In this manner, the system can accept input from the user (e.g., body tracking, voice/sound recognition, physical controllers) and produce output to the user (e.g., visual display, aural display, haptic display) .<ref name=\"SW&CA\">{{cite book |author=Sherman, W.R. |author2=Craig, A.B. |title=Understanding Virtual Reality |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |location=San Francisco, CA |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-55860-353-0 }}</ref> Virtual Simulations use the aforementioned modes of interaction to produce a sense of [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] for the user.\n\n===Virtual simulation input hardware===\n[[File:Simuladormotocicleta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Motorcycle]] simulator of ''Bienal do Autom\u00f3vel'' exhibition, in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]].]]\nThere is a wide variety of input hardware available to accept user input for virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:\n\n'''Body tracking''': The [[motion capture]] method is often used to record the user's movements and translate the captured data into inputs for the virtual simulation. For example, if a user physically turns their head, the motion would be captured by the simulation hardware in some way and translated to a corresponding shift in view within the simulation.\n* [[Mo-cap suit|Capture suits]] and/or gloves may be used to capture movements of users body parts. The systems may have sensors incorporated inside them to sense movements of different body parts (e.g., fingers). Alternatively, these systems may have exterior tracking devices or marks that can be detected by external ultrasound, optical receivers or electromagnetic sensors. Internal inertial sensors are also available on some systems. The units may transmit data either wirelessly or through cables.\n* [[Eye tracker]]s can also be used to detect eye movements so that the system can determine precisely where a user is looking at any given instant.\n'''Physical controllers''': Physical controllers provide input to the simulation only through direct manipulation by the user. In virtual simulations, tactile feedback from physical controllers is highly desirable in a number of simulation environments.\n* [[Omnidirectional treadmill]]s can be used to capture the users locomotion as they walk or run.\n* High fidelity instrumentation such as instrument panels in virtual aircraft cockpits provides users with actual controls to raise the level of immersion. For example, pilots can use the actual [[global positioning system]] controls from the real device in a simulated cockpit to help them practice procedures with the actual device in the context of the integrated cockpit system.\n'''Voice/sound recognition''': This form of interaction may be used either to interact with agents within the simulation (e.g., virtual people) or to manipulate objects in the simulation (e.g., information). Voice interaction presumably increases the level of immersion for the user.\n* Users may use headsets with boom microphones, lapel microphones or the room may be equipped with strategically located microphones.\n\n====Current research into user input systems====\nResearch in future input systems holds a great deal of promise for virtual simulations. Systems such as [[brain\u2013computer interface]]s (BCIs) offer the ability to further increase the level of immersion for virtual simulation users. Lee, Keinrath, Scherer, Bischof, Pfurtscheller<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TNSRE.2007.906956 |pmid=18198704 |author=Leeb, R. |author2=Lee, F. |author3=Keinrath, C. |author4=Schere, R. |author5=Bischof, H. |author6=Pfurtscheller, G. |title=Brain-Computer Communication: Motivation, Aim, and Impact of Exploring a Virtual Apartment |journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=473\u2013481 |year=2007 |url=http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/vr/Projects/PRESENCCIA/Public/presenccia_pub/sharedDocuments/presenccia_publications/Publications/wp4/tug/0221.pdf}}</ref> proved that na\u00efve subjects could be trained to use a BCI to navigate a virtual apartment with relative ease. Using the BCI, the authors found that subjects were able to freely navigate the virtual environment with relatively minimal effort. It is possible that these types of systems will become standard input modalities in future virtual simulation systems.\n\n===Virtual simulation output hardware===\nThere is a wide variety of output hardware available to deliver a stimulus to users in virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:\n\n'''Visual display''': Visual displays provide the visual stimulus to the user.\n* Stationary displays can vary from a conventional desktop display to 360-degree wrap-around screens to stereo three-dimensional screens. Conventional desktop displays can vary in size from {{Convert|15|to|60|in}}. Wrap around screens is typically utilized in what is known as a [[cave automatic virtual environment]] (CAVE). Stereo three-dimensional screens produce three-dimensional images either with or without special glasses\u2014depending on the design.\n* [[Head-mounted display]]s (HMDs) have small displays that are mounted on headgear worn by the user. These systems are connected directly into the virtual simulation to provide the user with a more immersive experience. Weight, update rates and field of view are some of the key variables that differentiate HMDs. Naturally, heavier HMDs are undesirable as they cause fatigue over time. If the update rate is too slow, the system is unable to update the displays fast enough to correspond with a quick head turn by the user. Slower update rates tend to cause simulation sickness and disrupt the sense of immersion. Field of view or the angular extent of the world that is seen at a given moment [[field of view]] can vary from system to system and has been found to affect the user's sense of immersion.\n'''Aural display''': Several different types of audio systems exist to help the user hear and localize sounds spatially. Special software can be used to produce 3D audio effects [[3D audio]] to create the illusion that sound sources are placed within a defined three-dimensional space around the user.\n* Stationary conventional speaker systems may be used to provide dual or multi-channel surround sound. However, external speakers are not as effective as headphones in producing 3D audio effects.<ref name=\"SW&CA\"/>\n* Conventional headphones offer a portable alternative to stationary speakers. They also have the added advantages of masking real-world noise and facilitate more effective 3D audio sound effects.<ref name=\"SW&CA\"/> {{Dubious|Aural Display|date=September 2018|Conventional headphones bullet=This claim is dubious. Most Binaural 3D audio is not a simulation or aural reality. This is especially true when the audio is being created by the HRTF process. In this instance, it is an emulation of the amplification system that the Head Related Impulse Response was taken from. A new sound signal is convolved with the HRTF to make it sound as though it were being heard by the mannequin that was used in the recording. It is an emulation of that system.}}\n\n'''Haptic display''': These displays provide a sense of touch to the user ([[haptic technology]]). This type of output is sometimes referred to as force feedback.\n* Tactile tile displays use different types of actuators such as inflatable bladders, vibrators, low-frequency sub-woofers, pin actuators and/or thermo-actuators to produce sensations for the user.\n* End effector displays can respond to users inputs with resistance and force.<ref name=\"SW&CA\"/> These systems are often used in medical applications for remote surgeries that employ robotic instruments.<ref>Zahraee, A.H., Szewczyk, J., Paik, J.K., Guillaume, M. (2010). Robotic hand-held surgical device: evaluation of end-effector's kinematics and development of proof-of-concept prototypes. Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, Beijing, China.</ref>\n'''Vestibular display''': These displays provide a sense of motion to the user ([[motion simulator]]). They often manifest as motion bases for virtual vehicle simulation such as driving simulators or flight simulators. Motion bases are fixed in place but use actuators to move the simulator in ways that can produce the sensations pitching, yawing or rolling. The simulators can also move in such a way as to produce a sense of acceleration on all axes (e.g., the motion base can produce the sensation of falling).\n\n== Clinical healthcare simulators ==\n{{Main|Medical simulation}}\nMedical simulators are increasingly being developed and deployed to teach therapeutic and diagnostic procedures as well as medical concepts and decision making to personnel in the health professions.

Patients have been known to suffer injuries and even death due to management error, and lack of using best standards of care and training. According to Building a National Agenda for Simulation-Based Medical Education (Eder-Van Hook, Jackie, 2004), \"a health care provider's ability to react prudently in an unexpected situation is one of the most critical factors in creating a positive outcome in medical emergency, regardless of whether it occurs on the battlefield, freeway, or hospital emergency room.\" Eder-Van Hook (2004) also noted that medical errors kill up to 98,000 with an estimated cost between $37 and $50 million and $17 to $29 billion for preventable adverse events dollars per year.\n\nSimulation is being used to study patient safety, as well as train medical professionals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Groves|first=Patricia S.|last2=Bunch|first2=Jacinda L.|last3=Cram|first3=Ellen|last4=Farag|first4=Amany|last5=Manges|first5=Kirstin|last6=Perkhounkova|first6=Yelena|last7=Scott-Cawiezell|first7=Jill|date=2016-10-19|title=Priming Patient Safety Through Nursing Handoff Communication: A Simulation Pilot Study|journal=Western Journal of Nursing Research|volume=39|issue=11|language=en|pages=1394\u20131411|doi=10.1177/0193945916673358|pmid=28322631|issn=0193-9459}}</ref>  Studying patient safety and safety interventions in healthcare is challenging, because there is a lack of experimental control (i.e., patient complexity, system/process variances) to see if an intervention made a meaningful difference (Groves & Manges, 2017).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Groves|first=Patricia S.|last2=Manges|first2=Kirstin|date=2017-08-24|title=Understanding Nursing Handoffs: Safety Scholarship in Nursing|journal=Western Journal of Nursing Research|volume=39|issue=11|language=en|pages=1391\u20131393|doi=10.1177/0193945917727237|pmid=28835189|issn=0193-9459}}</ref> An example of innovative simulation to study patient safety is from nursing research.

The conclusion as reported in Nishisaki (2008) work, was that the simulation training improved resident participation in real cases; but did not sacrifice the quality of service.

Although modern simulation is thought to have its roots in training and the military, in the 20th century it also became a conduit for enterprises which were more hedonistic in nature.\n\n=== History of visual simulation in film and games ===\n\n==== Early history (1940s and 1950s) ====\nThe first simulation game may have been created as early as 1947 by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. This was a straightforward game that simulated a missile being fired at a target. The curve of the missile and its speed could be adjusted using several knobs. In 1958, a computer game called \"''[[Tennis for Two]]''\" was created by Willy Higginbotham which simulated a tennis game between two players who could both play at the same time using hand controls and was displayed on an oscilloscope.<ref>[http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm Welcome to PONG-Story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827183321/http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm |date=August 27, 2010 }}</ref>  This was one of the first electronic video games to use a graphical display.\n\n==== 1970s and early 1980s ====\n[[Computer-generated imagery]] was used in the film to simulate objects as early as 1972 in the [[A Computer Animated Hand]], parts of which were shown on the big screen in the 1976 film [[Futureworld]]. Many will remember the ''\"targeting computer\"'' that young Skywalker turns off in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.\n\nThe film ''[[Tron]]'' (1982) was the first film to use computer-generated imagery for more than a couple of minutes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tron.html |title=TRON - The 1982 Movie<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2009-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525083246/http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tron.html |archive-date=2009-05-25 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in technology in the 1980s caused 3D simulation to become more widely used and it began to appear in movies and in computer-based games such as Atari's ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' (1980) and [[Acornsoft]]'s ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' (1984), one of the first [[Wire-frame model|wire-frame 3D graphics games]] for [[home computer]]s.\n\n==== Pre-virtual cinematography era (early 1980s to 1990s) ====\nAdvances in technology in the 1980s made the computer more affordable and more capable than they were in previous decades,<ref>[http://homepages.vvm.com/~jhunt/compupedia/History%20of%20Computers/history_of_computers_1980.htm History of Computers 1980] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818073333/http://homepages.vvm.com/~jhunt/compupedia/History%20of%20Computers/history_of_computers_1980.htm |date=2009-08-18 }}</ref> which facilitated the rise of computer such as the Xbox gaming.

This technique represents a valuable tool used by engineers when evaluating the effect of capital investment in equipment and physical facilities like factory plants, warehouses, and distribution centers. Simulation can be used to predict the performance of an existing or planned system and to compare alternative solutions for a particular design problem.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00170-008-1686-z |author=Benedettini, O. |author2=Tjahjono, B. |title=Towards an improved tool to facilitate simulation modeling of complex manufacturing systems |journal=International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology |volume=43 |issue=1/2 |pages=191\u20139 |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nAnother important goal of [[Simulation in Manufacturing Systems]] is to quantify system performance. Common measures of system performance include the following:<ref>{{cite book |author=Banks, J. |author2=Carson J. |author3=Nelson B.L. |author4=Nicol, D. |title=Discrete-event system simulation |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |year=2005 |edition=4th |isbn=978-0-13-088702-3 }}</ref>\n* Throughput under average and peak loads;\n* System cycle time (how long it takes to produce one part);\n* Utilization of resource, labor, and machines;\n* Bottlenecks and choke points;\n* Queuing at work locations;\n* Queuing and delays caused by material-handling devices and systems;\n* WIP storages needs;\n* Staffing requirements;\n* Effectiveness of scheduling systems;\n* Effectiveness of control systems.\n\n==More examples of simulation==\n\n===Automobiles===\n[[File:Car racing simulator - SBR Racing, Construma, 2015.04.17.JPG|thumb|Car racing simulator]]\n[[File:Vehicle simulator.jpg|thumb|right|A soldier tests out a heavy-wheeled-vehicle driver simulator.]]\n\nAn automobile simulator provides an opportunity to reproduce the characteristics of real vehicles in a virtual environment. It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver to feel as if they are sitting in the cab of their own vehicle. Scenarios and events are replicated with sufficient reality to ensure that drivers become fully immersed in the experience rather than simply viewing it as an educational experience.\n\nThe simulator provides a constructive experience for the novice driver and enables more complex exercises to be undertaken by the more mature driver. For novice drivers, truck simulators provide an opportunity to begin their career by applying best practice. For mature drivers, simulation provides the ability to enhance good driving or to detect poor practice and to suggest the necessary steps for remedial action. For companies, it provides an opportunity to educate staff in the driving skills that achieve reduced maintenance costs, improved productivity and, most importantly, to ensure the safety of their actions in all possible situations.\n\n===Biomechanics===\nAn open-source simulation platform for creating dynamic mechanical models built from combinations of rigid and deformable bodies, joints, constraints, and various force actuators. It is specialized for creating biomechanical models of human anatomical structures, with the intention to study their function and eventually assist in the design and planning of medical treatment.\n\nA biomechanics simulator is used to analyze walking dynamics, study sports performance, simulate surgical procedures, analyze joint loads, design medical devices, and animate human and animal movement.\n\nA neuromechanical simulator that combines biomechanical and biologically realistic neural network simulation. It allows the user to test hypotheses on the neural basis of behavior in a physically accurate 3-D virtual environment.\n\n===City and urban===\n{{further|traffic simulation}}\nA city simulator can be a [[city-building game]] but can also be a tool used by urban planners to understand how cities are likely to evolve in response to various policy decisions. [[AnyLogic]] is an example of modern, large-scale urban simulators designed for use by urban planners. City simulators are generally [[Agent (economics)|agent]]-based simulations with explicit representations for [[land use]] and [[transportation]]. [[UrbanSim]] and [[Land Use Evolution and Impact Assessment Model|LEAM]] are examples of large-scale urban simulation models that are used by metropolitan planning agencies and military bases for land use and [[transportation planning]].\n\n===Classroom of the future===\nThe \"classroom of the future\" will probably contain several kinds of simulators, in addition to textual and visual learning tools. This will allow students to enter the clinical years better prepared, and with a higher skill level. The advanced student or postgraduate will have a more concise and comprehensive method of retraining\u2014or of incorporating new clinical procedures into their skill set\u2014and regulatory bodies and medical institutions will find it easier to assess the proficiency and [[Competence (human resources)|competency]] of individuals.\n\nThe classroom of the future will also form the basis of a clinical skills unit for continuing education of medical personnel; and in the same way that the use of periodic flight training assists airline pilots, this technology will assist practitioners throughout their career.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nThe simulator will be more than a \"living\" textbook, it will become an integral a part of the practice of medicine.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The simulator environment will also provide a standard platform for curriculum development in institutions of medical education.\n\n===Communication satellites===\nModern satellite communications systems ([[Satcom (satellite)|SATCOM]]) are often large and complex with many interacting parts and elements. In addition, the need for broadband connectivity on a moving vehicle has increased dramatically in the past few years for both commercial and military applications. To accurately predict and deliver high quality of service, SATCOM system designers have to factor in terrain as well as atmospheric and meteorological conditions in their planning. To deal with such complexity, system designers and operators increasingly turn towards computer models of their systems to simulate real-world operating conditions and gain insights into usability and requirements prior to final product sign-off. Modeling improves the understanding of the system by enabling the SATCOM system designer or planner to simulate real-world performance by injecting the models with multiple hypothetical atmospheric and environmental conditions. Simulation is often used in the training of civilian and military personnel. This usually occurs when it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations, they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a \"safe\" virtual environment yet living a lifelike experience (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system.\n\n===Digital Lifecycle===\n[[File:ugs-nx-5-engine-airflow-simulation.jpg|thumb|right|UGS | Simulation of airflow over an engine]]\n\nSimulation solutions are being increasingly integrated with CAx (CAD, CAM, CAE....) solutions and processes. The use of simulation throughout the product lifecycle, especially at the earlier concept and design stages, has the potential of providing substantial benefits. These benefits range from direct cost issues such as reduced prototyping and shorter time-to-market to better performing products and higher margins. However, for some companies, simulation has not provided the expected benefits.\n\nThe research firm Aberdeen Group has found that nearly all best-in-class manufacturers use simulation early in the design process as compared to 3 or 4 laggards who do not.\n\nThe successful use of simulation, early in the lifecycle, has been largely driven by increased integration of simulation tools with the entire CAD, CAM and PLM solution-set. Simulation solutions can now function across the extended enterprise in a [[NX 5#MultiCAD / MultiDiscipline Models|multi-CAD environment]], and include solutions for [[Teamcenter#Simulation Process Management|managing simulation data and processes]] and ensuring that simulation results are made part of the product lifecycle history. The ability to use simulation across the entire lifecycle has been enhanced through improved user interfaces such as [[NX 5#Tailorable UI|tailorable user interfaces]] and \"wizards\" which allow all appropriate PLM participants to take part in the simulation process.\n\n===Disaster preparedness===\nSimulation training has become a method for preparing people for disasters. Simulations can replicate emergency situations and track how learners respond thanks to a [[lifelike experience]]. Disaster preparedness simulations can involve training on how to handle [[terrorism]] attacks, natural disasters, [[pandemic]] outbreaks, or other life-threatening emergencies.\n\nOne organization that has used simulation training for disaster preparedness is CADE (Center for Advancement of Distance Education). CADE<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/sph/cade/ CADE]</ref> has used a video game to prepare emergency workers for multiple types of attacks. As reported by News-Medical.Net, \"The video game is the first in a series of simulations to address bioterrorism, pandemic flu, smallpox, and other disasters that emergency personnel must prepare for.<ref>News-Medical.: [http://www.news-medical.net/news/2005/10/27/14106.aspx \"Net article-.\"]</ref>\" Developed by a team from the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (UIC), the game allows learners to practice their emergency skills in a safe, controlled environment.\n\nThe Emergency Simulation Program (ESP) at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is another example of an organization that uses simulation to train for emergency situations. ESP uses simulation to train on the following situations: forest fire fighting, oil or chemical spill response, earthquake response, law enforcement, municipal firefighting, hazardous material handling, military training, and response to terrorist attack<ref name=\"straylightmm.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.straylightmm.com/ |title=Emergency Response Training<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2009-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030312001333/http://www.straylightmm.com/ |archive-date=2003-03-12 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  One feature of the simulation system is the implementation of \"Dynamic Run-Time Clock,\" which allows simulations to run a 'simulated' time frame, \"'speeding up' or 'slowing down' time as desired\"<ref name=\"straylightmm.com\"/>  Additionally, the system allows session recordings, picture-icon based navigation, file storage of individual simulations, multimedia components, and launch external applications.\n\nAt the University of Qu\u00e9bec in Chicoutimi, a research team at the outdoor research and expertise laboratory (Laboratoire d'Expertise et de Recherche en Plein Air \u2013 LERPA) specializes in using wilderness backcountry accident simulations to verify emergency response coordination.\n\nInstructionally, the benefits of emergency training through simulations are that learner performance can be tracked through the system. This allows the developer to make adjustments as necessary or alert the educator on topics that may require additional attention. Other advantages are that the learner can be guided or trained on how to respond appropriately before continuing to the next emergency segment\u2014this is an aspect that may not be available in the live environment. Some emergency training simulators also allow for immediate feedback, while other simulations may provide a summary and instruct the learner to engage in the learning topic again.\n\nIn a live-emergency situation, emergency responders do not have time to waste. Simulation-training in this environment provides an opportunity for learners to gather as much information as they can and practice their knowledge in a safe environment. They can make mistakes without risk of endangering lives and be given the opportunity to correct their errors to prepare for the real-life emergency.\n\n===Economics===\nIn [[economics]] and especially [[macroeconomics]], the effects of proposed policy actions, such as [[fiscal policy]] changes or [[monetary policy]] changes, are simulated to judge their desirability. A mathematical model of the economy, having been fitted to historical economic data, is used as a proxy for the actual economy; proposed values of [[government spending]], [[taxation]], [[open market operations]], etc. are used as inputs to the simulation of the model, and various variables of interest such as the [[inflation rate]], the [[unemployment rate]], the [[balance of trade]] deficit, the government [[budget deficit]], etc. are the outputs of the simulation. The simulated values of these variables of interest are compared for different proposed policy inputs to determine which set of outcomes is most desirable.\n\n===Engineering, technology, and processes===\n<!--If the above heading is changed, update #links in other articles that point to it.-->Simulation is an important feature in engineering systems or any system that involves many processes. For example, in [[electrical engineering]], delay lines may be used to simulate [[propagation delay]] and [[Phase (waves)#Phase shift|phase shift]] caused by an actual [[transmission line]]. Similarly, [[dummy load]]s may be used to simulate [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] without simulating propagation and is used in situations where propagation is unwanted. A simulator may imitate only a few of the operations and functions of the unit it simulates. ''Contrast with'': [[emulator|emulate]].<ref name=\"FS1037C\">[[Federal Standard 1037C]]</ref>\n\nMost engineering simulations entail mathematical modeling and computer-assisted investigation. There are many cases, however, where mathematical modeling is not reliable. Simulation of [[fluid dynamics]] problems often require both mathematical and physical simulations. In these cases the physical models require [[similitude (model)|dynamic similitude]]. Physical and chemical simulations have also direct realistic uses, rather than research uses; in [[chemical engineering]], for example, [[process simulation]]s are used to give the process parameters immediately used for operating chemical plants, such as oil refineries. Simulators are also used for plant operator training. It is called Operator Training Simulator (OTS) and has been widely adopted by many industries from chemical to oil&gas and to the power industry. This created a safe and realistic virtual environment to train board operators and engineers. [[MiMiC Simulation Software|Mimic]] is capable of providing high fidelity dynamic models of nearly all chemical plants for operator training and control system testing.\n\n===Ergonomics===\nErgonomic simulation involves the analysis of virtual products or manual tasks within a virtual environment. In the engineering process, the aim of ergonomics is to develop and to improve the design of products and work environments.<ref name=\"Reed, M. P. 2006\">Reed, M. P., Faraway, J., Chaffin, D.

SAE Technical Paper, 01-2365</ref> Ergonomic simulation utilizes an anthropometric virtual representation of the human, commonly referenced as a mannequin or Digital Human Models (DHMs), to mimic the postures, mechanical loads, and performance of a human operator in a simulated environment such as an airplane, automobile, or manufacturing facility.

Ergonomics software uses inverse kinematics (IK) capability for posing the DHMs.<ref name=\"Reed, M. P. 2006\"/>\n\nSoftware tools typically calculate biomechanical properties including individual muscle forces, joint forces and moments. Most of these tools employ standard ergonomic evaluation methods such as the NIOSH lifting equation and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). Some simulations also analyze physiological measures including metabolism, energy expenditure, and fatigue limits Cycle time studies, design and process validation, user comfort, reachability, and line of sight are other human-factors that may be examined in ergonomic simulation packages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/tecnomatix/assembly_planning/jack/index.shtml|title=Jack and Process Simulate Human|work=Siemens PLM Software|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508230912/http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/tecnomatix/assembly_planning/jack/index.shtml|archive-date=2013-05-06}}</ref>\n\nModeling and simulation of a task can be performed by manually manipulating the virtual human in the simulated environment.

Simulations are also often used to test a financial theory or the ability of a financial model.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=French|first1=Jordan|title=The one: A simulation of CAPM market returns|journal=The Journal of Wealth Management|volume=20|issue=1|pages=126\u2013147|doi=10.3905/jwm.2017.20.1.126|year=2017}}</ref>\n\nSimulations are frequently used in financial training to engage participants in experiencing various historical as well as fictional situations. There are stock market simulations, portfolio simulations, risk management simulations or models and forex simulations. Such simulations are typically based on [[stochastic asset model]]s. Using these simulations in a training program allows for the application of theory into a something akin to real life. As with other industries, the use of simulations can be technology or case-study driven.\n\n===Flight===\n{{Main|Flight simulation}}\n\n[[Flight Simulation|Flight Simulation Training Devices]] (FSTD) are used to train [[Aviator|pilots]] on the ground. In comparison to training in an actual [[aircraft]], simulation-based training allows for the training of maneuvers or situations that may be impractical (or even dangerous) to perform in the aircraft while keeping the pilot and instructor in a relatively low-risk environment on the ground. For example, electrical system failures, instrument failures, hydraulic system failures, and even flight control failures can be simulated without risk to the pilots or an aircraft.\n\nInstructors can also provide students with a higher concentration of training tasks in a given period of time than is usually possible in the aircraft. For example, conducting multiple [[instrument approach]]es in the actual aircraft may require significant time spent repositioning the aircraft, while in a simulation, as soon as one approach has been completed, the instructor can immediately preposition the simulated aircraft to an ideal (or less than ideal) location from which to begin the next approach.\n\nFlight simulation also provides an economic advantage over training in an actual aircraft. Once fuel, maintenance, and insurance costs are taken into account, the operating costs of an FSTD are usually substantially lower than the operating costs of the simulated aircraft. For some large transport category airplanes, the operating costs may be several times lower for the FSTD than the actual aircraft.\n\nSome people who use simulator software, especially flight simulator [[software]], build their own simulator at home. Some people\u2014to further the realism of their homemade simulator\u2014buy used cards and racks that run the same software used by the original machine. While this involves solving the problem of matching hardware and software\u2014and the problem that hundreds of cards plug into many different racks\u2014many still find that solving these problems is well worthwhile. Some are so serious about a realistic simulation that they will buy real aircraft parts, like complete nose sections of written-off [[aircraft]], at [[aircraft boneyard]]s. This permits people to simulate a hobby that they are unable to pursue in real life.\n\n===Marine===\nBearing resemblance to flight simulators, marine simulators train ships' personnel. The most common marine simulators include:\n* Ship's bridge simulators\n* Engine room simulators\n* Cargo handling simulators\n* Communication / [[GMDSS]] simulators\n* ROV simulators\n\nSimulators like these are mostly used within maritime colleges, training institutions, and navies. They often consist of a replication of a ships' bridge, with the operating console(s), and a number of screens on which the virtual surroundings are projected.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Military simulation}}\n[[Military]] simulations, also known informally as war games, are models in which theories of warfare can be tested and refined without the need for actual hostilities. They exist in many different forms, with varying degrees of realism. In recent times, their scope has widened to include not only military but also political and social factors (for example, the [[Nationlab|NationLab]] series of strategic exercises in Latin America).<ref>[[The Economist]] provides a current (as of 2012) survey of public projects attempting to simulate some theories in [http://www.economist.com/node/21553006 \"The science of civil war: What makes heroic strife\"].</ref> While many governments make use of simulation, both individually and collaboratively, little is known about the model's specifics outside professional circles.\n\n=== Network and distributed systems ===\nNetwork and distributed systems have been extensively simulated in other to understand the impact of new protocols and algorithms before their deployment in the actual systems. The simulation can focus on different levels ([[physical layer]], [[network layer]], [[application layer]]), and evaluate different metrics (network bandwidth, resource consumption, service time, dropped packets, system availability). Examples of simulation scenarios of network and distributed systems are:\n\n* [[Content delivery network|Content delivery networks]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filelis-Papadopoulos|first=Christos K.|last2=Endo|first2=Patricia Takako|last3=Bendechache|first3=Malika|last4=Svorobej|first4=Sergej|last5=Giannoutakis|first5=Konstantinos M.|last6=Gravvanis|first6=George A.|last7=Tzovaras|first7=Dimitrios|last8=Byrne|first8=James|last9=Lynn|first9=Theo|date=2020-01-01|title=Towards simulation and optimization of cache placement on large virtual content distribution networks|journal=Journal of Computational Science|volume=39|pages=101052|doi=10.1016/j.jocs.2019.101052|issn=1877-7503}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filelis-Papadopoulos|first=Christos K.|last2=Giannoutakis|first2=Konstantinos M.|last3=Gravvanis|first3=George A.|last4=Endo|first4=Patricia Takako|last5=Tzovaras|first5=Dimitrios|last6=Svorobej|first6=Sergej|last7=Lynn|first7=Theo|date=2019-04-01|title=Simulating large vCDN networks: A parallel approach|journal=Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory|volume=92|pages=100\u2013114|doi=10.1016/j.simpat.2019.01.001|issn=1569-190X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibn-Khedher|first=Hatem|last2=Abd-Elrahman|first2=Emad|last3=Kamal|first3=Ahmed E.|last4=Afifi|first4=Hossam|date=2017-06-19|title=OPAC: An optimal placement algorithm for virtual CDN|journal=Computer Networks|volume=120|pages=12\u201327|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2017.04.009|issn=1389-1286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Khedher|first=Hatem|last2=Abd-Elrahman|first2=Emad|last3=Afifi|first3=Hossam|last4=Marot|first4=Michel|date=2017|title=Optimal and Cost Efficient Algorithm for Virtual CDN Orchestration|journal=2017 IEEE 42nd Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)|location=Singapore|publisher=IEEE|volume=|pages=61\u201369|doi=10.1109/LCN.2017.115|isbn=978-1-5090-6523-3}}</ref>\n* Smart cities\n* Internet of things\n\n===Payment and securities settlement system===\nSimulation techniques have also been applied to payment and securities settlement systems. Among the main users are central banks who are generally responsible for the oversight of market infrastructure and entitled to contribute to the smooth functioning of the payment systems.\n\nCentral banks have been using payment system simulations to evaluate things such as the adequacy or sufficiency of liquidity available ( in the form of account balances and intraday credit limits) to participants (mainly banks) to allow efficient settlement of payments.<ref>Leinonen (ed.): Simulation studies of liquidity needs, risks and efficiency in payment networks (Bank of Finland Studies E:39/2007) [http://pss.bof.fi/Pages/Publications.aspx Simulation publications]</ref><ref>Neville Arjani: Examining the Trade-Off between Settlement Delay and Intraday Liquidity in Canada's LVTS: A Simulation Approach (Working Paper 2006\u201320, Bank of Canada) [http://pss.bof.fi/Pages/Publications.aspx Simulation publications]</ref> The need for liquidity is also dependent on the availability and the type of netting procedures in the systems, thus some of the studies have a focus on system comparisons.<ref>Johnson, K.; McAndrews, J.; Soram\u00e4ki, K. 'Economizing on Liquidity with Deferred Settlement Mechanisms' (Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, December 2004)</ref>\n\nAnother application is to evaluate risks related to events such as communication network breakdowns or the inability of participants to send payments (e.g. in case of possible bank failure).<ref>H. Leinonen (ed.): Simulation analyses and stress testing of payment networks (Bank of Finland Studies E:42/2009) [http://pss.bof.fi/Pages/Publications.aspx Simulation publications]</ref> This kind of analysis falls under the concepts of [[stress testing]] or [[scenario analysis]].\n\nA common way to conduct these simulations is to replicate the settlement logics of the real payment or securities settlement systems under analysis and then use real observed payment data. In case of system comparison or system development, naturally, also the other settlement logics need to be implemented.\n\nTo perform stress testing and scenario analysis, the observed data needs to be altered, e.g. some payments delayed or removed. To analyze the levels of liquidity, initial liquidity levels are varied. System comparisons (benchmarking) or evaluations of new netting algorithms or rules are performed by running simulations with a fixed set of data and varying only the system setups.\n\nAn inference is usually done by comparing the benchmark simulation results to the results of altered simulation setups by comparing indicators such as unsettled transactions or settlement delays.\n\n===Project management===\n{{Main|Project management simulation}}\nProject management simulation is simulation used for project management training and analysis. It is often used as a training simulation for project managers. In other cases, it is used for what-if analysis and for supporting decision-making in real projects. Frequently the simulation is conducted using software tools.\n\n===Robotics===\n{{Main|Robotics simulator}}\nA robotics simulator is used to create embedded applications for a specific (or not) robot without being dependent on the 'real' robot. In some cases, these applications can be transferred to the real robot (or rebuilt) without modifications. Robotics simulators allow reproducing situations that cannot be 'created' in the real world because of cost, time, or the 'uniqueness' of a resource. A simulator also allows fast robot prototyping. Many robot simulators feature [[physics engine]]s to simulate a robot's dynamics.\n\n===Production===\nSimulation of [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]] is used mainly to examine the effect of improvements or investments in a production system. Most often this is done using a static spreadsheet with process times and transportation times. For more sophisticated simulations [[Discrete Event Simulation]] (DES) is used with the advantages to simulate dynamics in the production system. A production system is very much dynamic depending on variations in manufacturing processes, assembly times, machine set-ups, breaks, breakdowns and small stoppages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ulf|first=Eriksson|title=Diffusion of Discrete Event Simulation in Swedish Industry|year=2005|publisher=Doktorsavhandlingar vid Chalmers tekniska h\u00f6gskola|location=Gothenburg|isbn=978-91-7291-577-0}}</ref>  There are lots of [[List of discrete event simulation software|software]] commonly used for discrete event simulation. They differ in usability and markets but do often share the same foundation.\n\n===Sales process===\n{{Main|Sales process engineering}}\nSimulations are useful in modeling the flow of transactions through business processes, such as in the field of [[sales process engineering]], to study and improve the flow of customer orders through various stages of completion (say, from an initial proposal for providing goods/services through order acceptance and installation). Such simulations can help predict the impact of how improvements in methods might impact variability, cost, labor time, and the number of transactions at various stages in the process. A full-featured computerized process simulator can be used to depict such models, as can simpler educational demonstrations using spreadsheet software, pennies being transferred between cups based on the roll of a die, or dipping into a tub of colored beads with a scoop.<ref name=\"Selden 1997\">{{cite book|title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop|author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|isbn=978-0-87389-418-0}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\nIn sports, [[computer simulation]]s are often done to predict the outcome of events and the performance of individual sportspeople. They attempt to recreate the event through models built from [[statistics]]. The increase in technology has allowed anyone with knowledge of programming the ability to run simulations of their models. The simulations are built from a series of mathematical [[algorithms]], or models, and can vary with accuracy. Accuscore, which is licensed by companies such as [[ESPN]], is a well-known simulation program for all major [[sports]]. It offers a detailed analysis of games through simulated betting lines, projected point totals and overall probabilities.\n\nWith the increased interest in [[fantasy sports]] simulation models that predict individual player performance have gained popularity. Companies like What If Sports and StatFox specialize in not only using their simulations for predicting game results but how well individual players will do as well. Many people use models to determine whom to start in their fantasy leagues.\n\nAnother way simulations are helping the sports field is in the use of [[biomechanics]]. Models are derived and simulations are run from data received from sensors attached to athletes and video equipment. [[Sports biomechanics]] aided by simulation models answer questions regarding training techniques such as the effect of fatigue on throwing performance (height of throw) and biomechanical factors of the upper limbs (reactive strength index; hand contact time).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14763141.2011.592544 |pmid=21936288 |author=Harrison, Andrew J |title=Throwing and catching movements exhibit post-activation potentiation effects following fatigue |journal=Sports Biomechanics |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=185\u2013196 |year=2011 }}</ref>\n\nComputer simulations allow their users to take models which before were too complex to run, and give them answers. Simulations have proven to be some of the best insights into both play performance and team predictability.\n\n===Space shuttle countdown===\n[[File:KSCFiringroom1.jpg|right|thumb|Firing Room 1 configured for [[Space Shuttle]] launches]]\nSimulation was used at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) to train and certify [[Space Shuttle]] engineers during simulated launch countdown operations. The Space Shuttle engineering community would participate in a launch countdown integrated simulation before each Shuttle flight. This simulation is a virtual simulation where real people interact with simulated Space Shuttle vehicle and Ground Support Equipment (GSE) hardware. The Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation, also known as S0044, involved countdown processes that would integrate many of the Space Shuttle vehicle and GSE systems. Some of the Shuttle systems integrated in the simulation are the main propulsion system, [[RS-25]], [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]], ground liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, [[external tank]], flight controls, navigation, and avionics.<ref>Sikora, E.A. (2010, July 27). Space Shuttle Main Propulsion System expert, John F. Kennedy Space Center. Interview.</ref>  The high-level objectives of the Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation are:\n* To demonstrate [[Firing room#Firing room|Firing Room]] final countdown phase operations.\n* To provide training for system engineers in recognizing, reporting and evaluating system problems in a time critical environment.\n* To exercise the launch team's ability to evaluate, prioritize and respond to problems in an integrated manner within a time critical environment.\n* To provide procedures to be used in performing failure/recovery testing of the operations performed in the final countdown phase.<ref>Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation. National Aeronautics and Space Administration KSC Document # RTOMI S0044, Revision AF05, 2009.</ref>\n\nThe Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation took place at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] [[Launch Control Center]] [[Firing room#Firing room|Firing Rooms]]. The firing room used during the simulation is the same control room where real launch countdown operations are executed. As a result, equipment used for real launch countdown operations is engaged. Command and control computers, application software, engineering plotting and trending tools, launch countdown procedure documents, launch commit criteria documents, hardware requirement documents, and any other items used by the engineering launch countdown teams during real launch countdown operations are used during the simulation.\nThe Space Shuttle vehicle hardware and related GSE hardware is simulated by [[mathematical models]] (written in Shuttle Ground Operations Simulator (SGOS) modeling language<ref>Shuttle Ground Operations Simulator (SGOS) Summary Description Manual. National Aeronautics and Space Administration KSC Document # KSC-LPS-SGOS-1000, Revision 3 CHG-A, 1995.</ref>) that behave and react like real hardware. During the Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation, engineers command and control hardware via real application software executing in the control consoles \u2013 just as if they were commanding real vehicle hardware. However, these real software applications do not interface with real Shuttle hardware during simulations. Instead, the applications interface with mathematical model representations of the vehicle and GSE hardware. Consequently, the simulations bypass sensitive and even dangerous mechanisms while providing engineering measurements detailing how the hardware would have reacted. Since these math models interact with the command and control application software, models and simulations are also used to debug and verify the functionality of application software.<ref>Math Model Main Propulsion System (MPS) Requirements Document, National Aeronautics and Space Administration KSC Document # KSCL-1100-0522, Revision 9, June 2009.</ref>\n\n===Satellite navigation===\nThe only true way to test [[GNSS]] receivers (commonly known as Sat-Nav's in the commercial world) is by using an RF Constellation Simulator. A receiver that may, for example, be used on an aircraft, can be tested under dynamic conditions without the need to take it on a real flight. The test conditions can be repeated exactly, and there is full control over all the test parameters. this is not possible in the 'real-world' using the actual signals. For testing receivers that will use the new [[Galileo (satellite navigation)]] there is no alternative, as the real signals do not yet exist.\n\n===Weather===\nPredicting weather conditions by extrapolating/interpolating previous data is one of the real use of simulation. Most of the weather forecasts use this information published by Weather bureaus. This kind of simulations helps in predicting and forewarning about extreme weather conditions like the path of an active hurricane/cyclone. [[Numerical weather prediction]] for forecasting involves complicated numeric computer models to predict weather accurately by taking many parameters into account.\n\n==Simulation games==\n{{Main|Simulation game}}\n[[Strategy game]]s\u2014both traditional and modern\u2014may be viewed as simulations of abstracted decision-making for the purpose of training military and political leaders (see [[History of Go]] for an example of such a tradition, or [[Kriegsspiel (wargame)|Kriegsspiel]] for a more recent example).\n\nMany other video games are simulators of some kind. Such games can simulate various aspects of reality, from [[business simulation game|business]], to [[Government simulation|government]], to [[Construction and management simulation games|construction]], to [[Vehicle simulation game|piloting vehicles]] (see above).\n\n==Historical usage==\nHistorically, the word had negative connotations:\n\n{{quote|text=\u2026therefore a general custom of simulation (which is this last degree) is a vice, using either of a natural falseness or fearfulness\u2026|sign=[[Francis Bacon]]|source=Of Simulation and Dissimulation, 1597}}\n\n{{quote|text=\u2026for Distinction Sake, a Deceiving by Words, is commonly called a Lye, and a Deceiving by Actions, Gestures, or Behavior, is called Simulation\u2026|sign=[[Robert South]]|source=South, 1697, p.525}}\n\nHowever, the connection between simulation and [[dissembling]] later faded out and is now only of linguistic interest.<ref>South, in the passage quoted, was speaking of the differences between a falsehood and an honestly mistaken statement; the difference being that in order for the statement to be a [[lie]] the [[truth]] must be known, and the opposite of the truth must have been knowingly uttered. And, from this, to the extent to which a '''lie''' involves deceptive ''words'', a '''simulation''' involves deceptive ''actions'', deceptive ''gestures'', or deceptive ''behavior''. Thus, it would seem, if a simulation is '''false''', then the truth must be known (in order for ''something other than the truth'' to be presented in its stead); and, for the '''simulation''' to ''simulate''. Because, otherwise, one would not know what to offer up in a simulation. Bacon's essay [http://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-7.html Of Simulation and Dissimulation] expresses somewhat similar views; it is also significant that [[Samuel Johnson]] thought so highly of South's definition, that he used it in the entry for simulation in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]''.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Brain-computer interface]]\n* [[Computational astrophysics]]\n* [[Computational chemistry]]\n* [[Computational physics]]\n* [[Computer experiment]]\n* [[Educational technology]]\n* [[Emulator]]\n* [[First-person (gaming)|First-person perspective]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* [[Grey box model]]\n* [[Illustris project]]\n* ''[[In silico]]''\n* [[Lie]]\n* [[Lifelike experience]]\n* [[List of computer simulation software]]\n* [[List of discrete event simulation software]]\n* [[Mathematical model]]\n* [[Merger simulation]]\n* [[Microarchitecture simulation]]\n* [[Mining simulator]]\n* [[Conceptual model|Model]]\n* [[Molecular dynamics]]\n* [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]\n* [[Network simulation]]\n* [[Pharmacokinetics simulation]]\n* [[Placebo]]\n* [[Planet Simulator]]\n* [[Project management simulation]]\n* [[Roleplay simulation]]\n* [[Rule-based modeling]]\n* [[Similitude (model)]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[Simulation language]]\n* [[System identification]]\n* [[Telepresence]]\n* [[Training simulation]]\n* [[UltraHLE]]\n* [[Virtual Reality]]\n* [[Web-based simulation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Simulation}}\n{{Wiktionary|simulation}}\n* [http://www.unice.fr/sg/resources/bibliographies.htm Bibliographies containing more references] to be found on the website of the journal [http://www.unice.fr/sg/ ''Simulation & Gaming''].\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Modeling and simulation]]\n[[Category:Simulation| ]]\n[[Category:Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics)]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{distinguish|Stimulation}}\n{{Redirect|Simulator}}\n\nA '''simulation''' is an approximate [[imitation]] of the operation of a process or system;<ref name=\"definition\">{{cite book|title=Discrete-Event System Simulation|author1=J.

Specific descriptions of fidelity levels are subject to interpretation, but the following generalizations can be made:\n* Low \u2013 the minimum simulation required for a system to respond to accept inputs and provide outputs\n* Medium \u2013 responds automatically to stimuli, with limited accuracy\n* High \u2013 nearly indistinguishable or as close as possible to the real system\n\nHuman in the loop simulations can include a computer simulation as a so-called ''synthetic environment''.{{refn|name=\"environment\"|1=[[Thales Group|Thales]] defines synthetic environment as \"the counterpart to simulated models of sensors, platforms and other active objects\" for \"the simulation of the external factors that affect them\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thalesresearch.com/Default.aspx?tabid=181|website=Thalse|accessdate=2007-12-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621052423/http://thalesresearch.com/Default.aspx?tabid=181|archivedate=2006-06-21|title= Modelling, Simulation & Synthetic Environments}}</ref> while other vendors use the term for more visual, [[virtual reality]]-style simulators.<ref>{{cite web|title=Synthetic Environments|website=CAE|url= http://www.cae.com/www2004/Products_and_Services/Civil_Simulation_and_Training/Simulation_Equipment/Visual_Solutions/Synthetic_Environments/index.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080122060652/http://www.cae.com/www2004/Products_and_Services/Civil_Simulation_and_Training/Simulation_Equipment/Visual_Solutions/Synthetic_Environments/index.shtml|archivedate=2008-01-22}}</ref>}}\n\n''Simulation in failure analysis'' refers to simulation in which we create environment/conditions to identify the cause of equipment failure. This was the best and fastest method to identify the failure cause.\n\n==Computer simulation==\n{{Main|Computer simulation}}\nA computer simulation (or \"sim\") is an attempt to model a real-life or hypothetical situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works. By changing variables in the simulation, [[prediction]]s may be made about the behaviour of the system. It is a tool to virtually investigate the behaviour of the system under study.<ref name=\"definition\"/>\n\nComputer simulation has become a useful part of [[model (abstract)|modeling]] many natural systems in [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]],<ref>For a popular research project in the field of [[biochemistry]] where \"computer simulation is particularly well suited to address these questions\"[http://folding.stanford.edu/Pande/Main Folding@home - Main], see [[Folding@Home]].</ref> and human systems in [[economics]] and [[social science]] (e.g., [[computational sociology]]) as well as in [[engineering]] to gain insight into the operation of those systems. A good example of the usefulness of using computers to simulate can be found in the field of [[network traffic simulation]]. In such simulations, the [[model (abstract)|model]] behaviour will change each simulation according to the set of initial parameters assumed for the environment.\n\nTraditionally, the formal modeling of systems has been via a [[mathematical model]], which attempts to find analytical solutions enabling the prediction of the behaviour of the system from a set of parameters and initial conditions. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitution for, modeling systems for which simple [[closed-form solution|closed form analytic solutions]] are not possible. There are many different types of computer simulation, the common feature they all share is the attempt to generate a sample of representative [[scenario]]s for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states would be prohibitive or impossible.\n\nSeveral software packages exist for running computer-based simulation modeling (e.g. [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulation, [[stochastic|stochastic modeling]], multimethod modeling) that makes all the modeling almost effortless.\n\nModern usage of the term \"computer simulation\" may encompass virtually any computer-based representation.\n\n===Computer science===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Emulator]] -->\n\nIn [[computer science]], simulation has some specialized meanings: [[Alan Turing]] used the term \"simulation\" to refer to what happens when a [[Universal Turing machine|universal machine]] executes a state transition table (in modern terminology, a computer runs a program) that describes the state transitions, inputs and outputs of a subject discrete-state machine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.mit.edu/manoli/turing/www/turing.html|title=Universal Turing Machine|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>  The computer simulates the subject machine. Accordingly, in [[theoretical computer science]] the term ''[[simulation preorder|simulation]]'' is a relation between [[state transition system]]s, useful in the study of [[operational semantics]].\n\nLess theoretically, an interesting application of computer simulation is to simulate computers using computers. In [[computer architecture]], a type of simulator, typically called an ''[[emulator]]'', is often used to execute a program that has to run on some inconvenient type of computer (for example, a newly designed computer that has not yet been built or an obsolete computer that is no longer available), or in a tightly controlled testing environment (see ''[[Computer architecture simulator]]'' and ''[[Platform virtualization]]''). For example, simulators have been used to debug a [[microprogram]] or sometimes commercial application programs, before the program is downloaded to the target machine. Since the operation of the computer is simulated, all of the information about the computer's operation is directly available to the programmer, and the speed and execution of the simulation can be varied at will.\n\nSimulators may also be used to interpret [[fault tree]]s, or test [[VLSI]] logic designs before they are constructed. [[Symbolic simulation]] uses variables to stand for unknown values.\n\nIn the field of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], simulations of physical processes are often used in conjunction with [[evolutionary computation]] to optimize control strategies.\n\n==Simulation in education and training==\n{{Main|Adaptive educational hypermedia}}\n\nSimulation is extensively used for educational purposes. It is used for cases where where it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a \"safe\" virtual environment yet living a [[lifelike experience]] (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system. \n\nSimulations in education are somewhat like training simulations. They focus on specific tasks. The term 'microworld' is used to refer to educational simulations which model some abstract concept rather than simulating a realistic object or environment, or in some cases model a real-world environment in a simplistic way so as to help a learner develop an understanding of the key concepts. Normally, a user can create some sort of construction within the microworld that will behave in a way consistent with the concepts being modeled. [[Seymour Papert]] was one of the first to advocate the value of microworlds, and the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] programming environment developed by Papert is one of the most well-known microworlds.\n\n[[Project Management Simulation]] is increasingly used to train students and professionals in the art and science of project management. Using simulation for [[project management]] training improves learning retention and enhances the learning process.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Davidovitch, L.|author2=A. Parush|author3=A.

These may, for example, take the form of civics simulations, in which participants assume roles in a simulated society, or international relations simulations in which participants engage in negotiations, alliance formation, trade, diplomacy, and the use of force. Such simulations might be based on fictitious political systems, or be based on current or historical events. An example of the latter would be [[Barnard College]]'s ''Reacting to the Past'' series of historical educational games.<ref>[http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/reacting/ \"Reacting to the Past Home Page\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416225730/http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/reacting/ |date=2009-04-16 }}.</ref> The [[National Science Foundation]] has also supported the creation of [[reacting games]] that address science and math education.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/reactingscience/ \"Reacting to the Past: STEM Games\"].</ref> In social media simulations, participants train communication with critics and other stakeholders in a private environment.\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing use of social simulations for staff training in aid and development agencies. The Carana simulation, for example, was first developed by the [[United Nations Development Programme]], and is now used in a very revised form by the [[World Bank]] for training staff to deal with fragile and conflict-affected countries.<ref>[http://paxsims.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/carana/ \"Carana,\" at 'PaxSims' blog, 27 January 2009].</ref>\n\nMilitary uses for simulation often involve aircraft or armoured fighting vehicles, but can also target small arms and other weapon systems training.

Virtual simulations allow users to interact with a virtual world. Virtual worlds operate on platforms of integrated software and hardware components. In this manner, the system can accept input from the user (e.g., body tracking, voice/sound recognition, physical controllers) and produce output to the user (e.g., visual display, aural display, haptic display) .<ref name=\"SW&CA\">{{cite book |author=Sherman, W.R. |author2=Craig, A.B. |title=Understanding Virtual Reality |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |location=San Francisco, CA |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-55860-353-0 }}</ref> Virtual Simulations use the aforementioned modes of interaction to produce a sense of [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] for the user.\n\n===Virtual simulation input hardware===\n[[File:Simuladormotocicleta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Motorcycle]] simulator of ''Bienal do Autom\u00f3vel'' exhibition, in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]].]]\nThere is a wide variety of input hardware available to accept user input for virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:\n\n'''Body tracking''': The [[motion capture]] method is often used to record the user's movements and translate the captured data into inputs for the virtual simulation. For example, if a user physically turns their head, the motion would be captured by the simulation hardware in some way and translated to a corresponding shift in view within the simulation.\n* [[Mo-cap suit|Capture suits]] and/or gloves may be used to capture movements of users body parts. The systems may have sensors incorporated inside them to sense movements of different body parts (e.g., fingers). Alternatively, these systems may have exterior tracking devices or marks that can be detected by external ultrasound, optical receivers or electromagnetic sensors. Internal inertial sensors are also available on some systems. The units may transmit data either wirelessly or through cables.\n* [[Eye tracker]]s can also be used to detect eye movements so that the system can determine precisely where a user is looking at any given instant.\n'''Physical controllers''': Physical controllers provide input to the simulation only through direct manipulation by the user. In virtual simulations, tactile feedback from physical controllers is highly desirable in a number of simulation environments.\n* [[Omnidirectional treadmill]]s can be used to capture the users locomotion as they walk or run.\n* High fidelity instrumentation such as instrument panels in virtual aircraft cockpits provides users with actual controls to raise the level of immersion. For example, pilots can use the actual [[global positioning system]] controls from the real device in a simulated cockpit to help them practice procedures with the actual device in the context of the integrated cockpit system.\n'''Voice/sound recognition''': This form of interaction may be used either to interact with agents within the simulation (e.g., virtual people) or to manipulate objects in the simulation (e.g., information). Voice interaction presumably increases the level of immersion for the user.\n* Users may use headsets with boom microphones, lapel microphones or the room may be equipped with strategically located microphones.\n\n====Current research into user input systems====\nResearch in future input systems holds a great deal of promise for virtual simulations. Systems such as [[brain\u2013computer interface]]s (BCIs) offer the ability to further increase the level of immersion for virtual simulation users. Lee, Keinrath, Scherer, Bischof, Pfurtscheller<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TNSRE.2007.906956 |pmid=18198704 |author=Leeb, R. |author2=Lee, F. |author3=Keinrath, C. |author4=Schere, R. |author5=Bischof, H. |author6=Pfurtscheller, G. |title=Brain-Computer Communication: Motivation, Aim, and Impact of Exploring a Virtual Apartment |journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=473\u2013481 |year=2007 |url=http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/vr/Projects/PRESENCCIA/Public/presenccia_pub/sharedDocuments/presenccia_publications/Publications/wp4/tug/0221.pdf}}</ref> proved that na\u00efve subjects could be trained to use a BCI to navigate a virtual apartment with relative ease. Using the BCI, the authors found that subjects were able to freely navigate the virtual environment with relatively minimal effort. It is possible that these types of systems will become standard input modalities in future virtual simulation systems.\n\n===Virtual simulation output hardware===\nThere is a wide variety of output hardware available to deliver a stimulus to users in virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:\n\n'''Visual display''': Visual displays provide the visual stimulus to the user.\n* Stationary displays can vary from a conventional desktop display to 360-degree wrap-around screens to stereo three-dimensional screens. Conventional desktop displays can vary in size from {{Convert|15|to|60|in}}. Wrap around screens is typically utilized in what is known as a [[cave automatic virtual environment]] (CAVE). Stereo three-dimensional screens produce three-dimensional images either with or without special glasses\u2014depending on the design.\n* [[Head-mounted display]]s (HMDs) have small displays that are mounted on headgear worn by the user. These systems are connected directly into the virtual simulation to provide the user with a more immersive experience. Weight, update rates and field of view are some of the key variables that differentiate HMDs. Naturally, heavier HMDs are undesirable as they cause fatigue over time. If the update rate is too slow, the system is unable to update the displays fast enough to correspond with a quick head turn by the user. Slower update rates tend to cause simulation sickness and disrupt the sense of immersion. Field of view or the angular extent of the world that is seen at a given moment [[field of view]] can vary from system to system and has been found to affect the user's sense of immersion.\n'''Aural display''': Several different types of audio systems exist to help the user hear and localize sounds spatially. Special software can be used to produce 3D audio effects [[3D audio]] to create the illusion that sound sources are placed within a defined three-dimensional space around the user.\n* Stationary conventional speaker systems may be used to provide dual or multi-channel surround sound. However, external speakers are not as effective as headphones in producing 3D audio effects.<ref name=\"SW&CA\"/>\n* Conventional headphones offer a portable alternative to stationary speakers. They also have the added advantages of masking real-world noise and facilitate more effective 3D audio sound effects.<ref name=\"SW&CA\"/> {{Dubious|Aural Display|date=September 2018|Conventional headphones bullet=This claim is dubious. Most Binaural 3D audio is not a simulation or aural reality. This is especially true when the audio is being created by the HRTF process. In this instance, it is an emulation of the amplification system that the Head Related Impulse Response was taken from. A new sound signal is convolved with the HRTF to make it sound as though it were being heard by the mannequin that was used in the recording. It is an emulation of that system.}}\n\n'''Haptic display''': These displays provide a sense of touch to the user ([[haptic technology]]). This type of output is sometimes referred to as force feedback.\n* Tactile tile displays use different types of actuators such as inflatable bladders, vibrators, low-frequency sub-woofers, pin actuators and/or thermo-actuators to produce sensations for the user.\n* End effector displays can respond to users inputs with resistance and force.<ref name=\"SW&CA\"/> These systems are often used in medical applications for remote surgeries that employ robotic instruments.<ref>Zahraee, A.H., Szewczyk, J., Paik, J.K., Guillaume, M. (2010). Robotic hand-held surgical device: evaluation of end-effector's kinematics and development of proof-of-concept prototypes. Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, Beijing, China.</ref>\n'''Vestibular display''': These displays provide a sense of motion to the user ([[motion simulator]]). They often manifest as motion bases for virtual vehicle simulation such as driving simulators or flight simulators. Motion bases are fixed in place but use actuators to move the simulator in ways that can produce the sensations pitching, yawing or rolling. The simulators can also move in such a way as to produce a sense of acceleration on all axes (e.g., the motion base can produce the sensation of falling).\n\n== Clinical healthcare simulators ==\n{{Main|Medical simulation}}\nMedical simulators are increasingly being developed and deployed to teach therapeutic and diagnostic procedures as well as medical concepts and decision making to personnel in the health professions.

Patients have been known to suffer injuries and even death due to management error, and lack of using best standards of care and training. According to Building a National Agenda for Simulation-Based Medical Education (Eder-Van Hook, Jackie, 2004), \"a health care provider's ability to react prudently in an unexpected situation is one of the most critical factors in creating a positive outcome in medical emergency, regardless of whether it occurs on the battlefield, freeway, or hospital emergency room.\" Eder-Van Hook (2004) also noted that medical errors kill up to 98,000 with an estimated cost between $37 and $50 million and $17 to $29 billion for preventable adverse events dollars per year.\n\nSimulation is being used to study patient safety, as well as train medical professionals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Groves|first=Patricia S.|last2=Bunch|first2=Jacinda L.|last3=Cram|first3=Ellen|last4=Farag|first4=Amany|last5=Manges|first5=Kirstin|last6=Perkhounkova|first6=Yelena|last7=Scott-Cawiezell|first7=Jill|date=2016-10-19|title=Priming Patient Safety Through Nursing Handoff Communication: A Simulation Pilot Study|journal=Western Journal of Nursing Research|volume=39|issue=11|language=en|pages=1394\u20131411|doi=10.1177/0193945916673358|pmid=28322631|issn=0193-9459}}</ref>  Studying patient safety and safety interventions in healthcare is challenging, because there is a lack of experimental control (i.e., patient complexity, system/process variances) to see if an intervention made a meaningful difference (Groves & Manges, 2017).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Groves|first=Patricia S.|last2=Manges|first2=Kirstin|date=2017-08-24|title=Understanding Nursing Handoffs: Safety Scholarship in Nursing|journal=Western Journal of Nursing Research|volume=39|issue=11|language=en|pages=1391\u20131393|doi=10.1177/0193945917727237|pmid=28835189|issn=0193-9459}}</ref> An example of innovative simulation to study patient safety is from nursing research.

Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. This was a straightforward game that simulated a missile being fired at a target. The curve of the missile and its speed could be adjusted using several knobs. In 1958, a computer game called \"''[[Tennis for Two]]''\" was created by Willy Higginbotham which simulated a tennis game between two players who could both play at the same time using hand controls and was displayed on an oscilloscope.<ref>[http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm Welcome to PONG-Story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827183321/http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm |date=August 27, 2010 }}</ref>  This was one of the first electronic video games to use a graphical display.\n\n==== 1970s and early 1980s ====\n[[Computer-generated imagery]] was used in the film to simulate objects as early as 1972 in the [[A Computer Animated Hand]], parts of which were shown on the big screen in the 1976 film [[Futureworld]].

This technique represents a valuable tool used by engineers when evaluating the effect of capital investment in equipment and physical facilities like factory plants, warehouses, and distribution centers. Simulation can be used to predict the performance of an existing or planned system and to compare alternative solutions for a particular design problem.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00170-008-1686-z |author=Benedettini, O. |author2=Tjahjono, B. |title=Towards an improved tool to facilitate simulation modeling of complex manufacturing systems |journal=International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology |volume=43 |issue=1/2 |pages=191\u20139 |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nAnother important goal of [[Simulation in Manufacturing Systems]] is to quantify system performance. Common measures of system performance include the following:<ref>{{cite book |author=Banks, J. |author2=Carson J. |author3=Nelson B.L. |author4=Nicol, D. |title=Discrete-event system simulation |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |year=2005 |edition=4th |isbn=978-0-13-088702-3 }}</ref>\n* Throughput under average and peak loads;\n* System cycle time (how long it takes to produce one part);\n* Utilization of resource, labor, and machines;\n* Bottlenecks and choke points;\n* Queuing at work locations;\n* Queuing and delays caused by material-handling devices and systems;\n* WIP storages needs;\n* Staffing requirements;\n* Effectiveness of scheduling systems;\n* Effectiveness of control systems.\n\n==More examples of simulation==\n\n===Automobiles===\n[[File:Car racing simulator - SBR Racing, Construma, 2015.04.17.JPG|thumb|Car racing simulator]]\n[[File:Vehicle simulator.jpg|thumb|right|A soldier tests out a heavy-wheeled-vehicle driver simulator.]]\n\nAn automobile simulator provides an opportunity to reproduce the characteristics of real vehicles in a virtual environment. It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver to feel as if they are sitting in the cab of their own vehicle. Scenarios and events are replicated with sufficient reality to ensure that drivers become fully immersed in the experience rather than simply viewing it as an educational experience.\n\nThe simulator provides a constructive experience for the novice driver and enables more complex exercises to be undertaken by the more mature driver. For novice drivers, truck simulators provide an opportunity to begin their career by applying best practice. For mature drivers, simulation provides the ability to enhance good driving or to detect poor practice and to suggest the necessary steps for remedial action. For companies, it provides an opportunity to educate staff in the driving skills that achieve reduced maintenance costs, improved productivity and, most importantly, to ensure the safety of their actions in all possible situations.\n\n===Biomechanics===\nAn open-source simulation platform for creating dynamic mechanical models built from combinations of rigid and deformable bodies, joints, constraints, and various force actuators. It is specialized for creating biomechanical models of human anatomical structures, with the intention to study their function and eventually assist in the design and planning of medical treatment.\n\nA biomechanics simulator is used to analyze walking dynamics, study sports performance, simulate surgical procedures, analyze joint loads, design medical devices, and animate human and animal movement.\n\nA neuromechanical simulator that combines biomechanical and biologically realistic neural network simulation. It allows the user to test hypotheses on the neural basis of behavior in a physically accurate 3-D virtual environment.\n\n===City and urban===\n{{further|traffic simulation}}\nA city simulator can be a [[city-building game]] but can also be a tool used by urban planners to understand how cities are likely to evolve in response to various policy decisions. [[AnyLogic]] is an example of modern, large-scale urban simulators designed for use by urban planners. City simulators are generally [[Agent (economics)|agent]]-based simulations with explicit representations for [[land use]] and [[transportation]]. [[UrbanSim]] and [[Land Use Evolution and Impact Assessment Model|LEAM]] are examples of large-scale urban simulation models that are used by metropolitan planning agencies and military bases for land use and [[transportation planning]].\n\n===Classroom of the future===\nThe \"classroom of the future\" will probably contain several kinds of simulators, in addition to textual and visual learning tools. This will allow students to enter the clinical years better prepared, and with a higher skill level. The advanced student or postgraduate will have a more concise and comprehensive method of retraining\u2014or of incorporating new clinical procedures into their skill set\u2014and regulatory bodies and medical institutions will find it easier to assess the proficiency and [[Competence (human resources)|competency]] of individuals.\n\nThe classroom of the future will also form the basis of a clinical skills unit for continuing education of medical personnel; and in the same way that the use of periodic flight training assists airline pilots, this technology will assist practitioners throughout their career.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nThe simulator will be more than a \"living\" textbook, it will become an integral a part of the practice of medicine.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The simulator environment will also provide a standard platform for curriculum development in institutions of medical education.\n\n===Communication satellites===\nModern satellite communications systems ([[Satcom (satellite)|SATCOM]]) are often large and complex with many interacting parts and elements. In addition, the need for broadband connectivity on a moving vehicle has increased dramatically in the past few years for both commercial and military applications. To accurately predict and deliver high quality of service, SATCOM system designers have to factor in terrain as well as atmospheric and meteorological conditions in their planning. To deal with such complexity, system designers and operators increasingly turn towards computer models of their systems to simulate real-world operating conditions and gain insights into usability and requirements prior to final product sign-off. Modeling improves the understanding of the system by enabling the SATCOM system designer or planner to simulate real-world performance by injecting the models with multiple hypothetical atmospheric and environmental conditions. Simulation is often used in the training of civilian and military personnel. This usually occurs when it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations, they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a \"safe\" virtual environment yet living a lifelike experience (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system.\n\n===Digital Lifecycle===\n[[File:ugs-nx-5-engine-airflow-simulation.jpg|thumb|right|UGS | Simulation of airflow over an engine]]\n\nSimulation solutions are being increasingly integrated with CAx (CAD, CAM, CAE....) solutions and processes. The use of simulation throughout the product lifecycle, especially at the earlier concept and design stages, has the potential of providing substantial benefits. These benefits range from direct cost issues such as reduced prototyping and shorter time-to-market to better performing products and higher margins. However, for some companies, simulation has not provided the expected benefits.\n\nThe research firm Aberdeen Group has found that nearly all best-in-class manufacturers use simulation early in the design process as compared to 3 or 4 laggards who do not.\n\nThe successful use of simulation, early in the lifecycle, has been largely driven by increased integration of simulation tools with the entire CAD, CAM and PLM solution-set. Simulation solutions can now function across the extended enterprise in a [[NX 5#MultiCAD / MultiDiscipline Models|multi-CAD environment]], and include solutions for [[Teamcenter#Simulation Process Management|managing simulation data and processes]] and ensuring that simulation results are made part of the product lifecycle history. The ability to use simulation across the entire lifecycle has been enhanced through improved user interfaces such as [[NX 5#Tailorable UI|tailorable user interfaces]] and \"wizards\" which allow all appropriate PLM participants to take part in the simulation process.\n\n===Disaster preparedness===\nSimulation training has become a method for preparing people for disasters. Simulations can replicate emergency situations and track how learners respond thanks to a [[lifelike experience]]. Disaster preparedness simulations can involve training on how to handle [[terrorism]] attacks, natural disasters, [[pandemic]] outbreaks, or other life-threatening emergencies.\n\nOne organization that has used simulation training for disaster preparedness is CADE (Center for Advancement of Distance Education). CADE<ref>[http://www.uic.edu/sph/cade/ CADE]</ref> has used a video game to prepare emergency workers for multiple types of attacks. As reported by News-Medical.Net, \"The video game is the first in a series of simulations to address bioterrorism, pandemic flu, smallpox, and other disasters that emergency personnel must prepare for.<ref>News-Medical.: [http://www.news-medical.net/news/2005/10/27/14106.aspx \"Net article-.\"]</ref>\" Developed by a team from the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (UIC), the game allows learners to practice their emergency skills in a safe, controlled environment.\n\nThe Emergency Simulation Program (ESP) at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is another example of an organization that uses simulation to train for emergency situations. ESP uses simulation to train on the following situations: forest fire fighting, oil or chemical spill response, earthquake response, law enforcement, municipal firefighting, hazardous material handling, military training, and response to terrorist attack<ref name=\"straylightmm.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.straylightmm.com/ |title=Emergency Response Training<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2009-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030312001333/http://www.straylightmm.com/ |archive-date=2003-03-12 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  One feature of the simulation system is the implementation of \"Dynamic Run-Time Clock,\" which allows simulations to run a 'simulated' time frame, \"'speeding up' or 'slowing down' time as desired\"<ref name=\"straylightmm.com\"/>  Additionally, the system allows session recordings, picture-icon based navigation, file storage of individual simulations, multimedia components, and launch external applications.\n\nAt the University of Qu\u00e9bec in Chicoutimi, a research team at the outdoor research and expertise laboratory (Laboratoire d'Expertise et de Recherche en Plein Air \u2013 LERPA) specializes in using wilderness backcountry accident simulations to verify emergency response coordination.\n\nInstructionally, the benefits of emergency training through simulations are that learner performance can be tracked through the system. This allows the developer to make adjustments as necessary or alert the educator on topics that may require additional attention. Other advantages are that the learner can be guided or trained on how to respond appropriately before continuing to the next emergency segment\u2014this is an aspect that may not be available in the live environment. Some emergency training simulators also allow for immediate feedback, while other simulations may provide a summary and instruct the learner to engage in the learning topic again.\n\nIn a live-emergency situation, emergency responders do not have time to waste. Simulation-training in this environment provides an opportunity for learners to gather as much information as they can and practice their knowledge in a safe environment. They can make mistakes without risk of endangering lives and be given the opportunity to correct their errors to prepare for the real-life emergency.\n\n===Economics===\nIn [[economics]] and especially [[macroeconomics]], the effects of proposed policy actions, such as [[fiscal policy]] changes or [[monetary policy]] changes, are simulated to judge their desirability. A mathematical model of the economy, having been fitted to historical economic data, is used as a proxy for the actual economy; proposed values of [[government spending]], [[taxation]], [[open market operations]], etc. are used as inputs to the simulation of the model, and various variables of interest such as the [[inflation rate]], the [[unemployment rate]], the [[balance of trade]] deficit, the government [[budget deficit]], etc. are the outputs of the simulation. The simulated values of these variables of interest are compared for different proposed policy inputs to determine which set of outcomes is most desirable.\n\n===Engineering, technology, and processes===\n<!--If the above heading is changed, update #links in other articles that point to it.-->Simulation is an important feature in engineering systems or any system that involves many processes. For example, in [[electrical engineering]], delay lines may be used to simulate [[propagation delay]] and [[Phase (waves)#Phase shift|phase shift]] caused by an actual [[transmission line]]. Similarly, [[dummy load]]s may be used to simulate [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] without simulating propagation and is used in situations where propagation is unwanted. A simulator may imitate only a few of the operations and functions of the unit it simulates. ''Contrast with'': [[emulator|emulate]].<ref name=\"FS1037C\">[[Federal Standard 1037C]]</ref>\n\nMost engineering simulations entail mathematical modeling and computer-assisted investigation. There are many cases, however, where mathematical modeling is not reliable. Simulation of [[fluid dynamics]] problems often require both mathematical and physical simulations. In these cases the physical models require [[similitude (model)|dynamic similitude]]. Physical and chemical simulations have also direct realistic uses, rather than research uses; in [[chemical engineering]], for example, [[process simulation]]s are used to give the process parameters immediately used for operating chemical plants, such as oil refineries. Simulators are also used for plant operator training. It is called Operator Training Simulator (OTS) and has been widely adopted by many industries from chemical to oil&gas and to the power industry. This created a safe and realistic virtual environment to train board operators and engineers. [[MiMiC Simulation Software|Mimic]] is capable of providing high fidelity dynamic models of nearly all chemical plants for operator training and control system testing.\n\n===Ergonomics===\nErgonomic simulation involves the analysis of virtual products or manual tasks within a virtual environment. In the engineering process, the aim of ergonomics is to develop and to improve the design of products and work environments.<ref name=\"Reed, M. P. 2006\">Reed, M. P., Faraway, J., Chaffin, D. B., & Martin, B. J. (2006). The HUMOSIM Ergonomics Framework: A new approach to digital human simulation for ergonomic analysis. SAE Technical Paper, 01-2365</ref> Ergonomic simulation utilizes an anthropometric virtual representation of the human, commonly referenced as a mannequin or Digital Human Models (DHMs), to mimic the postures, mechanical loads, and performance of a human operator in a simulated environment such as an airplane, automobile, or manufacturing facility. DHMs are recognized as evolving and valuable tool for performing proactive ergonomics analysis and design.<ref>Chaffin, D. B. (2007). Human motion simulation for vehicle and workplace design. Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing & Service Industries,17(5), 475\u2013484</ref> The simulations employ 3D-graphics and physics-based models to animate the virtual humans. Ergonomics software uses inverse kinematics (IK) capability for posing the DHMs.<ref name=\"Reed, M. P. 2006\"/>\n\nSoftware tools typically calculate biomechanical properties including individual muscle forces, joint forces and moments. Most of these tools employ standard ergonomic evaluation methods such as the NIOSH lifting equation and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). Some simulations also analyze physiological measures including metabolism, energy expenditure, and fatigue limits Cycle time studies, design and process validation, user comfort, reachability, and line of sight are other human-factors that may be examined in ergonomic simulation packages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/tecnomatix/assembly_planning/jack/index.shtml|title=Jack and Process Simulate Human|work=Siemens PLM Software|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508230912/http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/tecnomatix/assembly_planning/jack/index.shtml|archive-date=2013-05-06}}</ref>\n\nModeling and simulation of a task can be performed by manually manipulating the virtual human in the simulated environment. Some ergonomics [[simulation software]] permits interactive, [[real-time simulation]] and evaluation through actual human input via motion capture technologies. However, motion capture for ergonomics requires expensive equipment and the creation of props to represent the environment or product.\n\nSome applications of ergonomic simulation in include analysis of solid waste collection, disaster management tasks, interactive gaming,<ref>Bush, P.

[[Risk]]-adjusted [[net present value]], for example, is computed from well-defined but not always known (or fixed) inputs. By imitating the performance of the project under evaluation, simulation can provide a distribution of NPV over a range of [[discounts and allowances|discount rates]] and other variables. Simulations are also often used to test a financial theory or the ability of a financial model.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=French|first1=Jordan|title=The one: A simulation of CAPM market returns|journal=The Journal of Wealth Management|volume=20|issue=1|pages=126\u2013147|doi=10.3905/jwm.2017.20.1.126|year=2017}}</ref>\n\nSimulations are frequently used in financial training to engage participants in experiencing various historical as well as fictional situations. There are stock market simulations, portfolio simulations, risk management simulations or models and forex simulations. Such simulations are typically based on [[stochastic asset model]]s. Using these simulations in a training program allows for the application of theory into a something akin to real life. As with other industries, the use of simulations can be technology or case-study driven.\n\n===Flight===\n{{Main|Flight simulation}}\n\n[[Flight Simulation|Flight Simulation Training Devices]] (FSTD) are used to train [[Aviator|pilots]] on the ground. In comparison to training in an actual [[aircraft]], simulation-based training allows for the training of maneuvers or situations that may be impractical (or even dangerous) to perform in the aircraft while keeping the pilot and instructor in a relatively low-risk environment on the ground. For example, electrical system failures, instrument failures, hydraulic system failures, and even flight control failures can be simulated without risk to the pilots or an aircraft.\n\nInstructors can also provide students with a higher concentration of training tasks in a given period of time than is usually possible in the aircraft. For example, conducting multiple [[instrument approach]]es in the actual aircraft may require significant time spent repositioning the aircraft, while in a simulation, as soon as one approach has been completed, the instructor can immediately preposition the simulated aircraft to an ideal (or less than ideal) location from which to begin the next approach.\n\nFlight simulation also provides an economic advantage over training in an actual aircraft. Once fuel, maintenance, and insurance costs are taken into account, the operating costs of an FSTD are usually substantially lower than the operating costs of the simulated aircraft. For some large transport category airplanes, the operating costs may be several times lower for the FSTD than the actual aircraft.\n\nSome people who use simulator software, especially flight simulator [[software]], build their own simulator at home. Some people\u2014to further the realism of their homemade simulator\u2014buy used cards and racks that run the same software used by the original machine. While this involves solving the problem of matching hardware and software\u2014and the problem that hundreds of cards plug into many different racks\u2014many still find that solving these problems is well worthwhile. Some are so serious about a realistic simulation that they will buy real aircraft parts, like complete nose sections of written-off [[aircraft]], at [[aircraft boneyard]]s. This permits people to simulate a hobby that they are unable to pursue in real life.\n\n===Marine===\nBearing resemblance to flight simulators, marine simulators train ships' personnel. The most common marine simulators include:\n* Ship's bridge simulators\n* Engine room simulators\n* Cargo handling simulators\n* Communication / [[GMDSS]] simulators\n* ROV simulators\n\nSimulators like these are mostly used within maritime colleges, training institutions, and navies. They often consist of a replication of a ships' bridge, with the operating console(s), and a number of screens on which the virtual surroundings are projected.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Military simulation}}\n[[Military]] simulations, also known informally as war games, are models in which theories of warfare can be tested and refined without the need for actual hostilities. They exist in many different forms, with varying degrees of realism. In recent times, their scope has widened to include not only military but also political and social factors (for example, the [[Nationlab|NationLab]] series of strategic exercises in Latin America).<ref>[[The Economist]] provides a current (as of 2012) survey of public projects attempting to simulate some theories in [http://www.economist.com/node/21553006 \"The science of civil war: What makes heroic strife\"].</ref> While many governments make use of simulation, both individually and collaboratively, little is known about the model's specifics outside professional circles.\n\n=== Network and distributed systems ===\nNetwork and distributed systems have been extensively simulated in other to understand the impact of new protocols and algorithms before their deployment in the actual systems. The simulation can focus on different levels ([[physical layer]], [[network layer]], [[application layer]]), and evaluate different metrics (network bandwidth, resource consumption, service time, dropped packets, system availability). Examples of simulation scenarios of network and distributed systems are:\n\n* [[Content delivery network|Content delivery networks]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filelis-Papadopoulos|first=Christos K.|last2=Endo|first2=Patricia Takako|last3=Bendechache|first3=Malika|last4=Svorobej|first4=Sergej|last5=Giannoutakis|first5=Konstantinos M.|last6=Gravvanis|first6=George A.|last7=Tzovaras|first7=Dimitrios|last8=Byrne|first8=James|last9=Lynn|first9=Theo|date=2020-01-01|title=Towards simulation and optimization of cache placement on large virtual content distribution networks|journal=Journal of Computational Science|volume=39|pages=101052|doi=10.1016/j.jocs.2019.101052|issn=1877-7503}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filelis-Papadopoulos|first=Christos K.|last2=Giannoutakis|first2=Konstantinos M.|last3=Gravvanis|first3=George A.|last4=Endo|first4=Patricia Takako|last5=Tzovaras|first5=Dimitrios|last6=Svorobej|first6=Sergej|last7=Lynn|first7=Theo|date=2019-04-01|title=Simulating large vCDN networks: A parallel approach|journal=Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory|volume=92|pages=100\u2013114|doi=10.1016/j.simpat.2019.01.001|issn=1569-190X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibn-Khedher|first=Hatem|last2=Abd-Elrahman|first2=Emad|last3=Kamal|first3=Ahmed E.|last4=Afifi|first4=Hossam|date=2017-06-19|title=OPAC: An optimal placement algorithm for virtual CDN|journal=Computer Networks|volume=120|pages=12\u201327|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2017.04.009|issn=1389-1286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Khedher|first=Hatem|last2=Abd-Elrahman|first2=Emad|last3=Afifi|first3=Hossam|last4=Marot|first4=Michel|date=2017|title=Optimal and Cost Efficient Algorithm for Virtual CDN Orchestration|journal=2017 IEEE 42nd Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)|location=Singapore|publisher=IEEE|volume=|pages=61\u201369|doi=10.1109/LCN.2017.115|isbn=978-1-5090-6523-3}}</ref>\n* Smart cities\n* Internet of things\n\n===Payment and securities settlement system===\nSimulation techniques have also been applied to payment and securities settlement systems. Among the main users are central banks who are generally responsible for the oversight of market infrastructure and entitled to contribute to the smooth functioning of the payment systems.\n\nCentral banks have been using payment system simulations to evaluate things such as the adequacy or sufficiency of liquidity available ( in the form of account balances and intraday credit limits) to participants (mainly banks) to allow efficient settlement of payments.<ref>Leinonen (ed.): Simulation studies of liquidity needs, risks and efficiency in payment networks (Bank of Finland Studies E:39/2007) [http://pss.bof.fi/Pages/Publications.aspx Simulation publications]</ref><ref>Neville Arjani: Examining the Trade-Off between Settlement Delay and Intraday Liquidity in Canada's LVTS: A Simulation Approach (Working Paper 2006\u201320, Bank of Canada) [http://pss.bof.fi/Pages/Publications.aspx Simulation publications]</ref> The need for liquidity is also dependent on the availability and the type of netting procedures in the systems, thus some of the studies have a focus on system comparisons.<ref>Johnson, K.; McAndrews, J.; Soram\u00e4ki, K. 'Economizing on Liquidity with Deferred Settlement Mechanisms' (Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, December 2004)</ref>\n\nAnother application is to evaluate risks related to events such as communication network breakdowns or the inability of participants to send payments (e.g. in case of possible bank failure).<ref>H. Leinonen (ed.): Simulation analyses and stress testing of payment networks (Bank of Finland Studies E:42/2009) [http://pss.bof.fi/Pages/Publications.aspx Simulation publications]</ref> This kind of analysis falls under the concepts of [[stress testing]] or [[scenario analysis]].\n\nA common way to conduct these simulations is to replicate the settlement logics of the real payment or securities settlement systems under analysis and then use real observed payment data. In case of system comparison or system development, naturally, also the other settlement logics need to be implemented.\n\nTo perform stress testing and scenario analysis, the observed data needs to be altered, e.g. some payments delayed or removed. To analyze the levels of liquidity, initial liquidity levels are varied. System comparisons (benchmarking) or evaluations of new netting algorithms or rules are performed by running simulations with a fixed set of data and varying only the system setups.\n\nAn inference is usually done by comparing the benchmark simulation results to the results of altered simulation setups by comparing indicators such as unsettled transactions or settlement delays.\n\n===Project management===\n{{Main|Project management simulation}}\nProject management simulation is simulation used for project management training and analysis. It is often used as a training simulation for project managers. In other cases, it is used for what-if analysis and for supporting decision-making in real projects. Frequently the simulation is conducted using software tools.\n\n===Robotics===\n{{Main|Robotics simulator}}\nA robotics simulator is used to create embedded applications for a specific (or not) robot without being dependent on the 'real' robot. In some cases, these applications can be transferred to the real robot (or rebuilt) without modifications. Robotics simulators allow reproducing situations that cannot be 'created' in the real world because of cost, time, or the 'uniqueness' of a resource. A simulator also allows fast robot prototyping. Many robot simulators feature [[physics engine]]s to simulate a robot's dynamics.\n\n===Production===\nSimulation of [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]] is used mainly to examine the effect of improvements or investments in a production system. Most often this is done using a static spreadsheet with process times and transportation times. For more sophisticated simulations [[Discrete Event Simulation]] (DES) is used with the advantages to simulate dynamics in the production system. A production system is very much dynamic depending on variations in manufacturing processes, assembly times, machine set-ups, breaks, breakdowns and small stoppages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ulf|first=Eriksson|title=Diffusion of Discrete Event Simulation in Swedish Industry|year=2005|publisher=Doktorsavhandlingar vid Chalmers tekniska h\u00f6gskola|location=Gothenburg|isbn=978-91-7291-577-0}}</ref>  There are lots of [[List of discrete event simulation software|software]] commonly used for discrete event simulation. They differ in usability and markets but do often share the same foundation.\n\n===Sales process===\n{{Main|Sales process engineering}}\nSimulations are useful in modeling the flow of transactions through business processes, such as in the field of [[sales process engineering]], to study and improve the flow of customer orders through various stages of completion (say, from an initial proposal for providing goods/services through order acceptance and installation). Such simulations can help predict the impact of how improvements in methods might impact variability, cost, labor time, and the number of transactions at various stages in the process. A full-featured computerized process simulator can be used to depict such models, as can simpler educational demonstrations using spreadsheet software, pennies being transferred between cups based on the roll of a die, or dipping into a tub of colored beads with a scoop.<ref name=\"Selden 1997\">{{cite book|title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop|author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|isbn=978-0-87389-418-0}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\nIn sports, [[computer simulation]]s are often done to predict the outcome of events and the performance of individual sportspeople. They attempt to recreate the event through models built from [[statistics]]. The increase in technology has allowed anyone with knowledge of programming the ability to run simulations of their models. The simulations are built from a series of mathematical [[algorithms]], or models, and can vary with accuracy. Accuscore, which is licensed by companies such as [[ESPN]], is a well-known simulation program for all major [[sports]]. It offers a detailed analysis of games through simulated betting lines, projected point totals and overall probabilities.\n\nWith the increased interest in [[fantasy sports]] simulation models that predict individual player performance have gained popularity. Companies like What If Sports and StatFox specialize in not only using their simulations for predicting game results but how well individual players will do as well. Many people use models to determine whom to start in their fantasy leagues.\n\nAnother way simulations are helping the sports field is in the use of [[biomechanics]]. Models are derived and simulations are run from data received from sensors attached to athletes and video equipment. [[Sports biomechanics]] aided by simulation models answer questions regarding training techniques such as the effect of fatigue on throwing performance (height of throw) and biomechanical factors of the upper limbs (reactive strength index; hand contact time).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14763141.2011.592544 |pmid=21936288 |author=Harrison, Andrew J |title=Throwing and catching movements exhibit post-activation potentiation effects following fatigue |journal=Sports Biomechanics |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=185\u2013196 |year=2011 }}</ref>\n\nComputer simulations allow their users to take models which before were too complex to run, and give them answers. Simulations have proven to be some of the best insights into both play performance and team predictability.\n\n===Space shuttle countdown===\n[[File:KSCFiringroom1.jpg|right|thumb|Firing Room 1 configured for [[Space Shuttle]] launches]]\nSimulation was used at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) to train and certify [[Space Shuttle]] engineers during simulated launch countdown operations. The Space Shuttle engineering community would participate in a launch countdown integrated simulation before each Shuttle flight. This simulation is a virtual simulation where real people interact with simulated Space Shuttle vehicle and Ground Support Equipment (GSE) hardware. The Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation, also known as S0044, involved countdown processes that would integrate many of the Space Shuttle vehicle and GSE systems. Some of the Shuttle systems integrated in the simulation are the main propulsion system, [[RS-25]], [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]], ground liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, [[external tank]], flight controls, navigation, and avionics.<ref>Sikora, E.A. (2010, July 27). Space Shuttle Main Propulsion System expert, John F. Kennedy Space Center. Interview.</ref>  The high-level objectives of the Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation are:\n* To demonstrate [[Firing room#Firing room|Firing Room]] final countdown phase operations.\n* To provide training for system engineers in recognizing, reporting and evaluating system problems in a time critical environment.\n* To exercise the launch team's ability to evaluate, prioritize and respond to problems in an integrated manner within a time critical environment.\n* To provide procedures to be used in performing failure/recovery testing of the operations performed in the final countdown phase.<ref>Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation. National Aeronautics and Space Administration KSC Document # RTOMI S0044, Revision AF05, 2009.</ref>\n\nThe Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation took place at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] [[Launch Control Center]] [[Firing room#Firing room|Firing Rooms]]. The firing room used during the simulation is the same control room where real launch countdown operations are executed. As a result, equipment used for real launch countdown operations is engaged. Command and control computers, application software, engineering plotting and trending tools, launch countdown procedure documents, launch commit criteria documents, hardware requirement documents, and any other items used by the engineering launch countdown teams during real launch countdown operations are used during the simulation.\nThe Space Shuttle vehicle hardware and related GSE hardware is simulated by [[mathematical models]] (written in Shuttle Ground Operations Simulator (SGOS) modeling language<ref>Shuttle Ground Operations Simulator (SGOS) Summary Description Manual. National Aeronautics and Space Administration KSC Document # KSC-LPS-SGOS-1000, Revision 3 CHG-A, 1995.</ref>) that behave and react like real hardware. During the Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation, engineers command and control hardware via real application software executing in the control consoles \u2013 just as if they were commanding real vehicle hardware. However, these real software applications do not interface with real Shuttle hardware during simulations. Instead, the applications interface with mathematical model representations of the vehicle and GSE hardware. Consequently, the simulations bypass sensitive and even dangerous mechanisms while providing engineering measurements detailing how the hardware would have reacted. Since these math models interact with the command and control application software, models and simulations are also used to debug and verify the functionality of application software.<ref>Math Model Main Propulsion System (MPS) Requirements Document, National Aeronautics and Space Administration KSC Document # KSCL-1100-0522, Revision 9, June 2009.</ref>\n\n===Satellite navigation===\nThe only true way to test [[GNSS]] receivers (commonly known as Sat-Nav's in the commercial world) is by using an RF Constellation Simulator. A receiver that may, for example, be used on an aircraft, can be tested under dynamic conditions without the need to take it on a real flight. The test conditions can be repeated exactly, and there is full control over all the test parameters. this is not possible in the 'real-world' using the actual signals. For testing receivers that will use the new [[Galileo (satellite navigation)]] there is no alternative, as the real signals do not yet exist.\n\n===Weather===\nPredicting weather conditions by extrapolating/interpolating previous data is one of the real use of simulation. Most of the weather forecasts use this information published by Weather bureaus. This kind of simulations helps in predicting and forewarning about extreme weather conditions like the path of an active hurricane/cyclone. [[Numerical weather prediction]] for forecasting involves complicated numeric computer models to predict weather accurately by taking many parameters into account.\n\n==Simulation games==\n{{Main|Simulation game}}\n[[Strategy game]]s\u2014both traditional and modern\u2014may be viewed as simulations of abstracted decision-making for the purpose of training military and political leaders (see [[History of Go]] for an example of such a tradition, or [[Kriegsspiel (wargame)|Kriegsspiel]] for a more recent example).\n\nMany other video games are simulators of some kind. Such games can simulate various aspects of reality, from [[business simulation game|business]], to [[Government simulation|government]], to [[Construction and management simulation games|construction]], to [[Vehicle simulation game|piloting vehicles]] (see above).\n\n==Historical usage==\nHistorically, the word had negative connotations:\n\n{{quote|text=\u2026therefore a general custom of simulation (which is this last degree) is a vice, using either of a natural falseness or fearfulness\u2026|sign=[[Francis Bacon]]|source=Of Simulation and Dissimulation, 1597}}\n\n{{quote|text=\u2026for Distinction Sake, a Deceiving by Words, is commonly called a Lye, and a Deceiving by Actions, Gestures, or Behavior, is called Simulation\u2026|sign=[[Robert South]]|source=South, 1697, p.525}}\n\nHowever, the connection between simulation and [[dissembling]] later faded out and is now only of linguistic interest.<ref>South, in the passage quoted, was speaking of the differences between a falsehood and an honestly mistaken statement; the difference being that in order for the statement to be a [[lie]] the [[truth]] must be known, and the opposite of the truth must have been knowingly uttered. And, from this, to the extent to which a '''lie''' involves deceptive ''words'', a '''simulation''' involves deceptive ''actions'', deceptive ''gestures'', or deceptive ''behavior''. Thus, it would seem, if a simulation is '''false''', then the truth must be known (in order for ''something other than the truth'' to be presented in its stead); and, for the '''simulation''' to ''simulate''. Because, otherwise, one would not know what to offer up in a simulation. Bacon's essay [http://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-7.html Of Simulation and Dissimulation] expresses somewhat similar views; it is also significant that [[Samuel Johnson]] thought so highly of South's definition, that he used it in the entry for simulation in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]''.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Brain-computer interface]]\n* [[Computational astrophysics]]\n* [[Computational chemistry]]\n* [[Computational physics]]\n* [[Computer experiment]]\n* [[Educational technology]]\n* [[Emulator]]\n* [[First-person (gaming)|First-person perspective]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* [[Grey box model]]\n* [[Illustris project]]\n* ''[[In silico]]''\n* [[Lie]]\n* [[Lifelike experience]]\n* [[List of computer simulation software]]\n* [[List of discrete event simulation software]]\n* [[Mathematical model]]\n* [[Merger simulation]]\n* [[Microarchitecture simulation]]\n* [[Mining simulator]]\n* [[Conceptual model|Model]]\n* [[Molecular dynamics]]\n* [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]\n* [[Network simulation]]\n* [[Pharmacokinetics simulation]]\n* [[Placebo]]\n* [[Planet Simulator]]\n* [[Project management simulation]]\n* [[Roleplay simulation]]\n* [[Rule-based modeling]]\n* [[Similitude (model)]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[Simulation language]]\n* [[System identification]]\n* [[Telepresence]]\n* [[Training simulation]]\n* [[UltraHLE]]\n* [[Virtual Reality]]\n* [[Web-based simulation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Simulation}}\n{{Wiktionary|simulation}}\n* [http://www.unice.fr/sg/resources/bibliographies.htm Bibliographies containing more references] to be found on the website of the journal [http://www.unice.fr/sg/ ''Simulation & Gaming''].\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Modeling and simulation]]\n[[Category:Simulation| ]]\n[[Category:Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics)]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation"}
