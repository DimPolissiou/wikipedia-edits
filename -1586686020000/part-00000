Jews do not regard any of these as having been fulfilled by Jesus, and in some cases do not regard them as messianic prophecies at all. Old Testament prophecies about Jesus are either not thought to be prophecies by critical scholars (the verses make no claim of predicting anything) or do not explicitly refer to the Messiah.

Some passages, such as the Psalms of Lament (e.g., Pss. 22, 35, 69) and the songs of the Suffering\nServant of the Lord in the book of Isaiah (Isaiah 53), were taken to refer not just to any person who\nwas suffering, or even to Israel as a whole (cf. Isaiah 49:3), but to the future messiah of Israel.\n4.

Who Invented Christianity? A Suffering Messiah. Jewish Expectations of the Messiah|authorlink1=Bart D. Ehrman|quote=But doesn\u2019t the Bible constantly talk about the Messiah who would suffer? As it turns out, the answer is no. Since the beginning, Christians have frequently cited certain passages in the Old Testament as clear prophecies of the future suffering Messiah, passages such as Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22, in which someone suffers horribly, sometimes expressly for the sins of others. These passages, Christians have claimed, are clear statements about what the Messiah would be like. Jews who do not believe in Jesus, however, have always had a very effective response: the Messiah is never mentioned in these passages. You can check it out for yourself: read Isaiah 53 or Psalm 22 (I\u2019ll quote the relevant verses later in this chapter). The term \u201cMessiah\u201d never occurs in them. In Jewish tradition, these passages refer not to the Messiah but to someone else (or to lots of someone elses).}}</ref><ref name=\"Ehrman2011\">{{cite book|first=Bart D.|last=Ehrman|title=Forged: Writing in the Name of God--Why the Bible's Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are|url=https://archive.org/details/forged_ehrm_2011_000_10544376|url-access=registration|date=22 March 2011|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0-06-207863-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/forged_ehrm_2011_000_10544376/page/n176 163]|quote=The truth, of course, is that Jews throughout history have been no more illiterate, blind, or stupid than Christians. The typical response of Jews to the Christian claims that Jesus fulfilled prophecy is that the scriptural passages that Christians cite are either not speaking of a future messiah or are not making predictions at all.

Furthermore, Ezekiel (622-570 BCE) wrote in the seventh century BCE, four century after this subject of the biblical narration, nevertheless adopting a prophecy that is by its nature usually referred to future happenings. Therefore, as the \"stick of Judah\" stands for the House of Judah, and the \"stick of Joseph\" stands for his tribe (verse 19), the expression \"David my servant shall be king over them\" (verse 24) may be read as a prophecy about a person of the House of David, which would have ruled over one nation in one land, gathered upon the mountains of Israel on evey side of the earth.\n\nThe narration continues as follows: \n{{quote|\"I will make a covenant of peace with them, an everlasting covenant.

The Sanctuary (Hebrew ''miqdash'') points rather to the Temple, in particular the renewed Temple, which will occupy Ezekiel's attention in the last chapters of [[Ezekiel 40|40]][[Ezekiel 48|\u201348]].\n\nChristianity believes that Ezekiel's Temple is more glorious than the Tabernacle of Moses (Exodus 25-40) and the Temple of Solomon ({{bibleverse|1 Kings|5-8|KJV}}), pointing forward to several beliefs:\n*(1) the glory in which God dwells with man in the Messiah ([[John 1:14]] ''The Word became a human being and lived with us, and we saw his Sh'khinah'' ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]]));\n*(2) The Messiah's body is the Temple ({{bibleverse|John|2:19-21|KJV}} ''Yeshua answered them, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\" The Judeans said, \"It took 46 years to build this Temple, and you're going to raise it in three days?\" But the \"temple\" he had spoken of was his body.''

Jews believe that the Messiah will completely change life on earth and that pain and suffering will be conquered, thus initiating the [[Kingdom of God]] and the Messianic Age on earth. Christian belief varies, with one segment holding that the Kingdom of God is not worldly at all, while another believe that the Kingdom is both spiritual and will be of this world in a Messianic Age where Jesus will rule on the throne of David. Most Jews hold that the Kingdom of God will be on earth and the Messiah will occupy the throne of David. Christians (in particular Evangelicals) who believe that it is both/and claim that it is spiritual and within right now, and physical and outward at the return of the Messiah.\n\nWhile Christians have cited the following as prophecies referencing the life, status, and legacy of Jesus, Jewish scholars maintain that these passages are not messianic prophecies and are based on mistranslations/misunderstanding of the Hebrew texts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/jewsandjesus#1|title=Why Don't Jews Believe In Jesus - The difference between Judaism and Christianity|website=www.simpletoremember.com}}</ref>\n\n===Haggai 2:6-9===\n{{quote|\"6 For this is what ADONAI-Tzva'ot says: \"It won't be long before one more time I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land;\n7 and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasures of all the nations will flow in; and I will fill this house with glory,\" says ADONAI-Tzva'ot.\n8  \"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,\" says ADONAI-Tzva'ot.\n9 \"The glory of this new house will surpass that of the old,\" says ADONAI-Tzva'ot, \"and in this place I will grant shalom,\" says ADONAI-Tzva'ot.'\" ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]])}}\n\nThe [[Second Temple]] was to be filled with the glory of God and its glory would be superior to [[Solomon's temple]] despite the missing artifacts and the absence of sacred fire (God initially lighting up the altar Himself).\n\nFor some Christians, this prophecy is believed to be fulfilled in [[Jesus of Nazareth]] being present and teaching in Herod's renovated [[Herod's Temple|Temple]] and peace being granted by God for mankind in that place through the tearing of the veil of the Holy of Holies upon Christ's death. Furthermore, it is asserted that if Haggai's prophecy is to be held as true, it must have been accomplished before 70 AD since the Romans destroyed the Second Temple at that time.\n\nOn the other hand, many scholars, including evangelical Christians, understand the prophecy as being in reference to the physical splendor of the Temple (as implied by the context) and/or apply it to the yet future [[Third Temple]].<ref>J.

In ancient times Jewish leaders were [[anointing|anointed]] with olive oil when they assumed their position (e.g. David, Saul, Isaac, Jacob). And \"Messiah\" is used as a name for kings in the Hebrew Bible: in {{bibleverse||2Samuel|1:14}} David finds King Saul's killer and asks, \"Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?\"\n\nIn many Psalms, whose authorship are traditionally ascribed to King David (i.e. ''Messiah'' David), the author writes about his life in third person, referring to himself as \"the/God's/your messiah\" while clearly discussing his military exploits. Thus it can be argued that many of the portions that are asserted to be prophetic Psalms may not be.\n\n====Psalm 2====\n<!--{{Main|Psalm 2}}-->\n{{quote|1 \"Why do the nations conspire, and the peoples plot in vain? 2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and his Anointed, saying, 3. 'Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast their cords from us.' 4. He who sits in the heavens laughs; the LORD has them in derision. 5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, 6. 'I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill.\" 7. I will tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to me, 'You are my son, today I have begotten you. 8. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. 9. You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter\u2019s vessel'\" ([[Psalm]] 2: 1-9).}}\n\nPsalm 2 can be argued to be about David; the authors of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] interpreted it as relating to Jesus. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] identifies \"the nations [that] conspire, and the peoples [that] plot in vain\" as the enemies referred to in Psalm 110: \"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.\"{{sfn|Augustine of Hippo, p. 270}}\n\nVerse 7. The LORD is the messiah's father. In Judaism the phrase \"Son of God\" has very different connotations than in Christianity, not referring to literal descent but to [[tzadik|the righteous]] who have become conscious of God's father of mankind.\n\nChristians cite [[Herod Antipas|Herod]] and [[Pontius Pilate]] setting themselves against Jesus as evidence that Psalm 2 refers to him. \n{{bibleverse|Acts|13:33|KJV}} interprets Jesus\u2019 rising from the dead as confirmation of verse 7 (\"You are my son, today I have begotten you\").\n\n[[Hebrews 1:5]] employs verse 7 in order to argue that Jesus is superior to the angels, i.e., Jesus is superior as a mediator between God and man. \"For to what angel did God ever say, ''Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee''?\" However, the phrase \"son of God\" appears in the Hebrew Bible to describe others than the coming Messiah, including [[David]] and [[Jacob]].\n\nTexts vary in the exact wording of the phrase beginning {{bibleverse|Psalm|2:12|KJV}}, with \"kiss his foot\", and \"kiss the Son\" being most common in various languages for centuries, though not in original Hebrew Manuscripts such as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].\n\n====Psalm 16====\n{{quote|\"I bless the Lord who has given me understanding, because even in the night, my heart warns me. I keep the Lord always within my sight; for he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

Thou wilt show me the path of life, the fullness of joys in thy presence, and delights at thy right hand forever\" (Psalm 16:7-11).}}\n\nThe interpretation of Psalm 16 as a messianic prophecy is common among Christian [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[hermeneutics]].<ref>Darrell L.

The second-in-command was seated to the right of the king in the ancient Near East. Such images are rare in psalms, but see {{bibleverse|Psalm|45:7|KJV}}. If the king trods on the back of his enemies (see {{bibleverse|Joshua|10:24|KJV}}), they poetically become his \"Footstool\" 2. In contrast to v.1, God is spoken of in the third person. The Zion tradition (see {{bibleref2|Isaiah|2:1-4|NKJV}}; {{bibleref2-nb|Isaiah|60:1-22|NKJV}}) and royal tradition are here connected. While v.1-2 express the great power of the king, they also emphasize it comes from God\" (YHWH).<ref>The Jewish Study Bible: Featuring The Jewish Publications Society Tanakh Translation Oxford University Press / 2004</ref>\n\nPsalm 110 is viewed as messianic in both Jewish and Christian tradition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0XvYAAAAMAAJ&q=Psalm+110#v=snippet&q=Psalm+110&f=false|title=Expositions of the Psalms 99-120|first=Saint Augustine (Bishop of|last=Hippo.)|date=July 5, 2003|publisher=New City Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> \nChristian authors have interpreted this psalm as a messianic passage in light of several New Testament passages.<ref>Herbert W.

The authors of these Old Testament \"prophecies\" often appear to be describing events that had already occurred. For example, the New Testament verse states:\n\n{{quote|\"So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, 15 where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: 'Out of Egypt I called my son.\" [[Matthew 2:14]] }}\n\nThis is referring to the Old Testament verse [[Hosea 11:1]]. However, that passage reads,\n\n{{quote|\"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.''\" {{bibleverse|Hosea|11:1|KJV}} }}\n\nSkeptics say that the Hosea passage clearly is talking about a historical event and therefore the passage clearly is not a prophecy.\n\nAccording to modern scholarship, the suffering servant described in [[Isaiah 53|Isaiah chapter 53]] is actually the Jewish people.<ref name=\"j-interrupted\"/><ref name=\"Beckwith2001\">{{cite book|author=Isbon T.

Who Invented Christianity? A Suffering Messiah. Jewish Expectations of the Messiah|authorlink1=Bart D. Ehrman|quote=But doesn\u2019t the Bible constantly talk about the Messiah who would suffer? As it turns out, the answer is no. Since the beginning, Christians have frequently cited certain passages in the Old Testament as clear prophecies of the future suffering Messiah, passages such as Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22, in which someone suffers horribly, sometimes expressly for the sins of others. These passages, Christians have claimed, are clear statements about what the Messiah would be like. Jews who do not believe in Jesus, however, have always had a very effective response: the Messiah is never mentioned in these passages. You can check it out for yourself: read Isaiah 53 or Psalm 22 (I\u2019ll quote the relevant verses later in this chapter). The term \u201cMessiah\u201d never occurs in them.

And one has to admit, just looking at this set of debates from the outside, the Jewish readers have a point. In the passages allegedly predicting the death and resurrection of Jesus, for example, the term \u201cmessiah\u201d in fact never does occur.

Furthermore, Ezekiel (622-570 BCE) wrote in the seventh century BCE, four century after this subject of the biblical narration, nevertheless adopting a prophecy that is by its nature usually referred to future happenings. Therefore, as the \"stick of Judah\" stands for the House of Judah, and the \"stick of Joseph\" stands for his tribe (verse 19), the expression \"David my servant shall be king over them\" (verse 24) may be read as a prophecy about a person of the House of David, which would have ruled over one nation in one land, gathered upon the mountains of Israel on evey side of the earth.\n\nThe narration continues as follows: \n{{quote|\"I will make a covenant of peace with them, an everlasting covenant. I will give to them, increase their numbers, and set my Sanctuary among them forever. My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people.\" ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]])}}\n\nThe \"dwelling place\" (Hebrew ''mishkan'') recalls the wilderness [[tabernacle]]. The Sanctuary (Hebrew ''miqdash'') points rather to the Temple, in particular the renewed Temple, which will occupy Ezekiel's attention in the last chapters of [[Ezekiel 40|40]][[Ezekiel 48|\u201348]].\n\nChristianity believes that Ezekiel's Temple is more glorious than the Tabernacle of Moses (Exodus 25-40) and the Temple of Solomon ({{bibleverse|1 Kings|5-8|KJV}}), pointing forward to several beliefs:\n*(1) the glory in which God dwells with man in the Messiah ([[John 1:14]] ''The Word became a human being and lived with us, and we saw his Sh'khinah'' ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]]));\n*(2) The Messiah's body is the Temple ({{bibleverse|John|2:19-21|KJV}} ''Yeshua answered them, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\" The Judeans said, \"It took 46 years to build this Temple, and you're going to raise it in three days?\" But the \"temple\" he had spoken of was his body.''

Jews believe that the Messiah will completely change life on earth and that pain and suffering will be conquered, thus initiating the [[Kingdom of God]] and the Messianic Age on earth. Christian belief varies, with one segment holding that the Kingdom of God is not worldly at all, while another believe that the Kingdom is both spiritual and will be of this world in a Messianic Age where Jesus will rule on the throne of David. Most Jews hold that the Kingdom of God will be on earth and the Messiah will occupy the throne of David. Christians (in particular Evangelicals) who believe that it is both/and claim that it is spiritual and within right now, and physical and outward at the return of the Messiah.\n\nWhile Christians have cited the following as prophecies referencing the life, status, and legacy of Jesus, Jewish scholars maintain that these passages are not messianic prophecies and are based on mistranslations/misunderstanding of the Hebrew texts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/jewsandjesus#1|title=Why Don't Jews Believe In Jesus - The difference between Judaism and Christianity|website=www.simpletoremember.com}}</ref>\n\n===Haggai 2:6-9===\n{{quote|\"6 For this is what ADONAI-Tzva'ot says: \"It won't be long before one more time I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land;\n7 and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasures of all the nations will flow in; and I will fill this house with glory,\" says ADONAI-Tzva'ot.\n8  \"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,\" says ADONAI-Tzva'ot.\n9 \"The glory of this new house will surpass that of the old,\" says ADONAI-Tzva'ot, \"and in this place I will grant shalom,\" says ADONAI-Tzva'ot.'\" ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]])}}\n\nThe [[Second Temple]] was to be filled with the glory of God and its glory would be superior to [[Solomon's temple]] despite the missing artifacts and the absence of sacred fire (God initially lighting up the altar Himself).\n\nFor some Christians, this prophecy is believed to be fulfilled in [[Jesus of Nazareth]] being present and teaching in Herod's renovated [[Herod's Temple|Temple]] and peace being granted by God for mankind in that place through the tearing of the veil of the Holy of Holies upon Christ's death. Furthermore, it is asserted that if Haggai's prophecy is to be held as true, it must have been accomplished before 70 AD since the Romans destroyed the Second Temple at that time.\n\nOn the other hand, many scholars, including evangelical Christians, understand the prophecy as being in reference to the physical splendor of the Temple (as implied by the context) and/or apply it to the yet future [[Third Temple]].<ref>J.

In ancient times Jewish leaders were [[anointing|anointed]] with olive oil when they assumed their position (e.g. David, Saul, Isaac, Jacob). And \"Messiah\" is used as a name for kings in the Hebrew Bible: in {{bibleverse||2Samuel|1:14}} David finds King Saul's killer and asks, \"Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?\"\n\nIn many Psalms, whose authorship are traditionally ascribed to King David (i.e. ''Messiah'' David), the author writes about his life in third person, referring to himself as \"the/God's/your messiah\" while clearly discussing his military exploits. Thus it can be argued that many of the portions that are asserted to be prophetic Psalms may not be.\n\n====Psalm 2====\n<!--{{Main|Psalm 2}}-->\n{{quote|1 \"Why do the nations conspire, and the peoples plot in vain? 2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and his Anointed, saying, 3. 'Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast their cords from us.' 4. He who sits in the heavens laughs; the LORD has them in derision. 5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, 6. 'I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill.\" 7. I will tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to me, 'You are my son, today I have begotten you. 8. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. 9. You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter\u2019s vessel'\" ([[Psalm]] 2: 1-9).}}\n\nPsalm 2 can be argued to be about David; the authors of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] interpreted it as relating to Jesus. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] identifies \"the nations [that] conspire, and the peoples [that] plot in vain\" as the enemies referred to in Psalm 110: \"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.\"{{sfn|Augustine of Hippo, p. 270}}\n\nVerse 7. The LORD is the messiah's father. In Judaism the phrase \"Son of God\" has very different connotations than in Christianity, not referring to literal descent but to [[tzadik|the righteous]] who have become conscious of God's father of mankind.\n\nChristians cite [[Herod Antipas|Herod]] and [[Pontius Pilate]] setting themselves against Jesus as evidence that Psalm 2 refers to him. \n{{bibleverse|Acts|13:33|KJV}} interprets Jesus\u2019 rising from the dead as confirmation of verse 7 (\"You are my son, today I have begotten you\").\n\n[[Hebrews 1:5]] employs verse 7 in order to argue that Jesus is superior to the angels, i.e., Jesus is superior as a mediator between God and man. \"For to what angel did God ever say, ''Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee''?\" However, the phrase \"son of God\" appears in the Hebrew Bible to describe others than the coming Messiah, including [[David]] and [[Jacob]].\n\nTexts vary in the exact wording of the phrase beginning {{bibleverse|Psalm|2:12|KJV}}, with \"kiss his foot\", and \"kiss the Son\" being most common in various languages for centuries, though not in original Hebrew Manuscripts such as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].\n\n====Psalm 16====\n{{quote|\"I bless the Lord who has given me understanding, because even in the night, my heart warns me. I keep the Lord always within my sight; for he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

Here God is speaking to the king, called my ''lord''; Perhaps these are the words spoken by a prophet. The king is very proximate to God, in a position of privilege, imagined as being on His ''right hand'' in the [[Divine Council]]. The second-in-command was seated to the right of the king in the ancient Near East. Such images are rare in psalms, but see {{bibleverse|Psalm|45:7|KJV}}. If the king trods on the back of his enemies (see {{bibleverse|Joshua|10:24|KJV}}), they poetically become his \"Footstool\" 2. In contrast to v.1, God is spoken of in the third person. The Zion tradition (see {{bibleref2|Isaiah|2:1-4|NKJV}}; {{bibleref2-nb|Isaiah|60:1-22|NKJV}}) and royal tradition are here connected.

[[Shamanism]] and [[animism]] are dominant themes in [[Inuit religion|Inughuit traditional beliefs]] with the [[angakkuq]] (healer) acting as a mediator with the supernatural forces. Angakkuit use trance states to communicate with spirits and carry out faith healing. There is a view among the Inughuit that individuals entering trance states should be treated with respect given the possibility of a new \"revelation\" emerging as a result. Treatment in piblokto cases usually involves allowing the episode to run its course without interference. While piblokto can often be confused with other conditions, (including [[epilepsy]]) in which failure to intervene can lead to the victim coming to harm, most cases tend to be more typical.\n\n==Skepticism==\nAlthough piblokto has a place in the historical record and official medical canons, a number of Arctic researchers and Arctic residents doubt its existence. The phenomena, they suggest, may be more rooted in the experience and behavior of the early European explorers than the Inuit themselves.<ref name = \"ArcticHis\"/>\n\nIn 1988 [[Parks Canada]] historian Lyle Dick began a substantial challenge to the concept that piblokto exists at all. Dick examined the original records of the European [[Arctic exploration|Arctic explorers]], and ethnographic and linguistic reports on Inughuit societies, and discovered that not only is the majority of academic speculation into piblokto based on reports of only eight cases, but the word \"piblokto\" / \"pibloktoq\" does not exist within [[Inuktun]] (the Inughuit language); possibly, Dick concluded, this may have been the result of errors in [[phonetic transcription]]. In a 1995 paper published in the journal ''[[Arctic Anthropology]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dick|first=L|title=\"Pibloktoq\"(Arctic Hysteria): A construction of European-Inuit relations.|journal=Arctic Anthropology|date=February 1995|volume=32|issue=2|pages=2|url=http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?hid=23&sid=fcfa52f5-9576-463b-9e9c-52ae709b9f3a%40sessionmgr15&vid=3&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&AN=9512292521|accessdate=March 11, 2011}}</ref> and in his 2001 book ''Muskox land: Ellesmere Island in the Age of Contact'', Dick suggests that piblokto is a \"phantom phenomenon\", arising more from the [[culture shock|Inuhuit reaction to European explorers in their midst]].<ref name = \"ArcticHis\"/>\n\nSimilarly, Hughes and Simons have described piblokto as a \"catch-all rubric under which explorers lumped various Inuhuit anxiety reactions, expressions of resistance to [[patriarchy]] or [[sexual coercion]], and shamanistic practice\".<ref>Simons, R. C., Hughes, C. C. The culture-bound syndromes: folk illnesses of psychiatric and anthropological interest. D. Reidel Publishing Company, (1985), Holland. p. 275, 289.</ref> Simply put, rather than understanding piblokto as a strange cultural phenomenon, some critical scholars now understand it to be an expression of trauma of colonial violence, including rape. For example, transcultural psychiatry scholar Laurence Kirmayer writes:\n\n{{quote|Most comprehensive psychiatric texts mention pibloktoq as a culture-bound syndrome characterized by sudden wild and erratic behaviour. Recently, the historian Lyle Dick collected all the published accounts of pibloktoq, of which there are only about 25. It seems that psychiatric case description transformed a situation of sexual exploitation of Inuit women by explorers into a discrete disorder worthy of a new diagnostic label. With hindsight, we can see how insensitivity to the impact of exploration on other peoples distorted the picture when vital information on social context was not included.

A reason for this disorder present in this culture may be due to the isolation of their cultural group.<ref name = \"ArcticHis\">Ephron, Sarah.

This causative factor is through the disturbance that has been reported for males, females, adults, children, and dogs.<ref>Landy, D. (1985) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4049004 Pibloktoq (hysteria) and Inuit nutrition: possible implication of hypervitaminosis A].</ref> The ingestion of [[Offal|organ meats]], particularly the [[Liver (food)|livers]] of some Arctic mammals, such as the [[polar bear]] and [[bearded seal]], where the vitamin is stored in toxic quantities, can be fatal to most people.\n\nInughuit tradition states that it is caused by evil spirits possessing the living. [[Shamanism]] and [[animism]] are dominant themes in [[Inuit religion|Inughuit traditional beliefs]] with the [[angakkuq]] (healer) acting as a mediator with the supernatural forces. Angakkuit use trance states to communicate with spirits and carry out faith healing. There is a view among the Inughuit that individuals entering trance states should be treated with respect given the possibility of a new \"revelation\" emerging as a result. Treatment in piblokto cases usually involves allowing the episode to run its course without interference. While piblokto can often be confused with other conditions, (including [[epilepsy]]) in which failure to intervene can lead to the victim coming to harm, most cases tend to be more typical.\n\n==Skepticism==\nAlthough piblokto has a place in the historical record and official medical canons, a number of Arctic researchers and Arctic residents doubt its existence. The phenomena, they suggest, may be more rooted in the experience and behavior of the early European explorers than the Inuit themselves.<ref name = \"ArcticHis\"/>\n\nIn 1988 [[Parks Canada]] historian Lyle Dick began a substantial challenge to the concept that piblokto exists at all. Dick examined the original records of the European [[Arctic exploration|Arctic explorers]], and ethnographic and linguistic reports on Inughuit societies, and discovered that not only is the majority of academic speculation into piblokto based on reports of only eight cases, but the word \"piblokto\" / \"pibloktoq\" does not exist within [[Inuktun]] (the Inughuit language); possibly, Dick concluded, this may have been the result of errors in [[phonetic transcription]]. In a 1995 paper published in the journal ''[[Arctic Anthropology]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dick|first=L|title=\"Pibloktoq\"(Arctic Hysteria): A construction of European-Inuit relations.|journal=Arctic Anthropology|date=February 1995|volume=32|issue=2|pages=2|url=http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?hid=23&sid=fcfa52f5-9576-463b-9e9c-52ae709b9f3a%40sessionmgr15&vid=3&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&AN=9512292521|accessdate=March 11, 2011}}</ref> and in his 2001 book ''Muskox land: Ellesmere Island in the Age of Contact'', Dick suggests that piblokto is a \"phantom phenomenon\", arising more from the [[culture shock|Inuhuit reaction to European explorers in their midst]].<ref name = \"ArcticHis\"/>\n\nSimilarly, Hughes and Simons have described piblokto as a \"catch-all rubric under which explorers lumped various Inuhuit anxiety reactions, expressions of resistance to [[patriarchy]] or [[sexual coercion]], and shamanistic practice\".<ref>Simons, R. C., Hughes, C. C. The culture-bound syndromes: folk illnesses of psychiatric and anthropological interest. D. Reidel Publishing Company, (1985), Holland. p. 275, 289.</ref> Simply put, rather than understanding piblokto as a strange cultural phenomenon, some critical scholars now understand it to be an expression of trauma of colonial violence, including rape. For example, transcultural psychiatry scholar Laurence Kirmayer writes:\n\n{{quote|Most comprehensive psychiatric texts mention pibloktoq as a culture-bound syndrome characterized by sudden wild and erratic behaviour. Recently, the historian Lyle Dick collected all the published accounts of pibloktoq, of which there are only about 25. It seems that psychiatric case description transformed a situation of sexual exploitation of Inuit women by explorers into a discrete disorder worthy of a new diagnostic label. With hindsight, we can see how insensitivity to the impact of exploration on other peoples distorted the picture when vital information on social context was not included.

Similar prizes for young talent economists in the world include the ''[[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation#Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award|Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award]]'' (1993), the European equivalent awarded to European economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Nakahara Prize]]'' (1995) awarded to Japanese economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Gossen Prize]]'' (1997) awarded to German-speaking economists under '''45''' years of age;  the ''[[Prix du meilleur jeune \u00e9conomiste de France|Prix du Meilleur Jeune \u00c9conomiste de France]]'' (2000) awarded to French economists under '''40''' years of age; and the ''[[Assar Lindbeck Medal]]'' (2007) awarded to Swedish economists under '''45''' years of age. \n* 2: The John von Neumann Award, which honors professors with top contributions to economics and social sciences, is distinguished from other scientific awards on the basis that it is given by students. The students at the [[Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), which is a self governing community of about 100 selected students living together, elect the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the candidates every year. Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. ''It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.''\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/><ref name=shanghairanking2017>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/subject-survey-2017/awards.html|title=ShanghaiRanking Academic Excellence Survey 2017|website=shanghairanking.com}}</ref>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref name=shanghairanking2017/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes.

These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation.

The recipient must be a member of one of the two societies. In 1967, these two prizes were established at the same time. The initial contribution for the Birkhoff Prize came from the Birkhoff family and for the Wiener Prize from the Mathematics Department of the Massachusettes Institute of Technology. Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting. Now they are usually awarded at joint mathematics meetings.\n}}</small>\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli Prize|Kavli Prize <small>in Astrophysics</small>]] (2008)<ref name=kavli1>{{cite web|url=https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/chancellor-fall.html|title=Fall Quarter greetings|website=ucsc.edu|date=27 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=kavli2>{{cite web|author=Ham Chau|url=https://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/special-reports/128401/internationally-famous-vietnamese-scientists.html |title=Internationally famous Vietnamese scientists|website=English.vietnamnet.vn|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=ambartsumian>{{cite journal |date=1 December 2009 |title=New international prize commemorates Viktor Ambartsumian|url=https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/50/6/6.6/192554|journal=Astronomy & Geophysics|volume=50|issue=6|pages=6.6 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4004.2009.50604_10.x|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Gruber Prize in Cosmology|Gruber Prize <small>in Cosmology</small>]] (2000)<ref name=ambartsumian/><ref name=gruber1>{{cite web|url=https://science.tamu.edu/news/2007/07/texas-am-physicist-shares-in-500000-gruber-cosmology-prize/|title=Texas A&M Physicist Shares in $500,000 Gruber Cosmology Prize|website=tamu.edu|date=17 July 2007}}</ref>\n* [[Crafoord Prize|Crafoord Prize <small>in Astronomy</small>]] (1985)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/story/prof-eugene-parker-wins-prestigious-crafoord-prize-astronomy|title=Prof. Eugene Parker wins prestigious Crafoord Prize in Astronomy|website=uchicago.edu|author=Louise Lerner|date=30 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=55209|title=Crafoord Prize in Astronomy to Solar Wind Discoverer Eugene Parker|website=spaceref.com|date=3 February 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Shaw Prize|Shaw Prize <small>in Astronomy</small>]] (2004)<ref name=shaw1>{{cite web|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2006/06/21/berkeley-labs-saul-perlmutter-wins-shaw-prize-in-astronomy/|title=Berkeley Lab's Saul Perlmutter Wins Shaw Prize in Astronomy|date=21 June 2006|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref><ref name=shaw2>{{cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/solana-beach/article_3b3d1a4d-261f-5ed0-9277-6d84554b28d9.html|title=Solana Beach: Astronomy researcher gets $1 million Shaw Prize|date=17 June 2009|work=[[North County Times]]|accessdate=20 November 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117150938/http://nctimes.com/news/local/solana-beach/article_3b3d1a4d-261f-5ed0-9277-6d84554b28d9.html|archivedate=17 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=shaw3>{{cite web|url=https://news.virginia.edu/content/astronomer-john-hawley-wins-2013-shaw-prize-astronomy|title=ASTRONOMER JOHN HAWLEY WINS 2013 SHAW PRIZE IN ASTRONOMY|date=29 May 2013|website=virginia.edu|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=shaw4>{{cite web|url=https://www.asianscientist.com/2014/05/topnews/scientists-honored-2014-shaw-prize-2014/|title=Six Scientists Honored With 2014 Shaw Prize|date=29 May 2014|website=asianscientist.com|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n<small>{{plainlist|\n''See also [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] (1824), [[Bruce Medal]] (1898), [[Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics]] (1980), [[Viktor Ambartsumian#Viktor Ambartsumian International Prize|Viktor Ambartsumian International Prize]] (2010).''\n}}</small>\n\n====Automation/control/cybernetics====\n* [[IEEE Control Systems Award]] (1982)<ref name=shanghairanking2018>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/Methodology-for-ShanghaiRanking-Global-Ranking-of-Academic-Subjects-2018.html|title=Methodology for ShanghaiRanking's Global Ranking of Academic Subjects 2018|website=shanghairanking.com}}</ref>  \n* Giorgio Quazza Medal (1981)<ref name=controlhistory>{{cite web|url=https://portal.research.lu.se/ws/files/49560469/TFRT_7561.pdf|title=Projects in History of Automatic Control|website=lu.se|author=Karl Henrik Johansson, Karl Johan \u00c5str\u00f6m|date=June 1997\n}}</ref>  \n* Hendrik W.

Similar prizes for young talent economists in the world include the ''[[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation#Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award|Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award]]'' (1993), the European equivalent awarded to European economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Nakahara Prize]]'' (1995) awarded to Japanese economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Gossen Prize]]'' (1997) awarded to German-speaking economists under '''45''' years of age;  the ''[[Prix du meilleur jeune \u00e9conomiste de France|Prix du Meilleur Jeune \u00c9conomiste de France]]'' (2000) awarded to French economists under '''40''' years of age; and the ''[[Assar Lindbeck Medal]]'' (2007) awarded to Swedish economists under '''45''' years of age. \n* 2: The John von Neumann Award, which honors professors with top contributions to economics and social sciences, is distinguished from other scientific awards on the basis that it is given by students. The students at the [[Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), which is a self governing community of about 100 selected students living together, elect the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the candidates every year. Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. ''It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.''\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/><ref name=shanghairanking2017>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/subject-survey-2017/awards.html|title=ShanghaiRanking Academic Excellence Survey 2017|website=shanghairanking.com}}</ref>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref name=shanghairanking2017/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.

The story follows the boy protagonist, [[Ichimura Tetsunosuke|Tetsunosuke Ichimura]], who joins the [[Shinsengumi]] (initially as [[Hijikata Toshiz\u014d|Toshiz\u014d Hijikata]]'s page) while seeking strength to avenge his parents' death at the hands of a Ch\u014dsh\u016b rebel.\n\nThe prequel of ''Peacemaker Kurogane'', {{Nihongo|''Shinsengumi Imon Peace Maker''|\u65b0\u64b0\u7d44\u7570\u805ePEACE MAKER|Shinsengumi Imon P\u012bsu Meik\u0101}} was published by [[Enix]] in the magazine ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Gangan]]''.

He and his older brother Tatsunosuke are left to fend for themselves after the vicious murder of their parents. While Tetsunosuke wants to get revenge, his pacifist brother is not so inclined. \"Tatsu\" joins a [[special police]] force dubbed the Shinsengumi, as an accountant to earn a living, his brother \"Tetsu\" wishes to join as a soldier to seek his revenge. The story chronicles Tetsu's trials and tribulations as a struggling page craving redemption. He develops relationships with all the legendary members of the Shinsengumi army helping them with their various struggles as he constantly battles his own against himself. At the story's climax, Tetsu discovers himself and the overwhelming responsibility the power he is searching for holds.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Peace Maker chapters}}\n\n====Peace Maker====\n''Peace Maker'' ({{Nihongo|''Shinsengumi Imon Peace Maker''|\u65b0\u64b0\u7d44\u7570\u805ePEACE MAKER|Shinsengumi Imon P\u012bsu Meik\u0101}}) was published from April 12, 1999 to August 11, 2001 in Japan by [[Enix]] magazine ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Gangan]]'' and was compiled in six volumes by Enix.\n\nThe sequel to ''Peace Maker'' transferred to [[Mag Garden]]'s ''[[Monthly Comic Blade]]''.

The story follows the boy protagonist, [[Ichimura Tetsunosuke|Tetsunosuke Ichimura]], who joins the [[Shinsengumi]] (initially as [[Hijikata Toshiz\u014d|Toshiz\u014d Hijikata]]'s page) while seeking strength to avenge his parents' death at the hands of a Ch\u014dsh\u016b rebel.\n\nThe prequel of ''Peacemaker Kurogane'', {{Nihongo|''Shinsengumi Imon Peace Maker''|\u65b0\u64b0\u7d44\u7570\u805ePEACE MAKER|Shinsengumi Imon P\u012bsu Meik\u0101}} was published by [[Enix]] in the magazine ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Gangan]]''.

He and his older brother Tatsunosuke are left to fend for themselves after the vicious murder of their parents. While Tetsunosuke wants to get revenge, his pacifist brother is not so inclined. \"Tatsu\" joins a [[Special police|special police]] force dubbed the Shinsengumi, as an accountant to earn a living, his brother \"Tetsu\" wishes to join as a soldier to seek his revenge. The story chronicles Tetsu's trials and tribulations as a struggling page craving redemption. He develops relationships with all the legendary members of the Shinsengumi army helping them with their various struggles as he constantly battles his own against himself. At the story's climax, Tetsu discovers himself and the overwhelming responsibility the power he is searching for holds.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Peace Maker chapters}}\n\n====Peace Maker====\n''Peace Maker'' ({{Nihongo|''Shinsengumi Imon Peace Maker''|\u65b0\u64b0\u7d44\u7570\u805ePEACE MAKER|Shinsengumi Imon P\u012bsu Meik\u0101}}) was published from April 12, 1999 to August 11, 2001 in Japan by [[Enix]] magazine ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Gangan]]'' and was compiled in six volumes by Enix. \n\nThe sequel to ''Peace Maker'' transferred to [[Mag Garden]]'s ''[[Monthly Comic Blade]]''.
