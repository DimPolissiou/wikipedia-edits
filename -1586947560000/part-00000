He played [[college football]] for the [[University of Michigan]] from 1995 to 1998.\n\n==Early years==\nCampbell was born in [[Clawson, Michigan]], in 1975.  He is the youngest of 5 children of John and Elizabeth Campbell. His siblings are John (brother), Kevin (brother), Diann (sister), and Doug (brother). He grew up in Clawson and attended [[Bishop Foley Catholic High School]] in [[Madison Heights, Michigan]].<ref name=PFR>{{cite web|title=Mark Cambell|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=April 9, 2015|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CampMa00.htm}}</ref><ref name=Roster/>He was an All-State selection as a High School Senior in football, basketball, and baseball.  Additionally, Campbell was 1 of 2 Tight Ends (Future Hall of Fame member Tony Gonzalez as the other) to be selected as a Football Parade All-American. He accepted a football scholarship to attend the University of Michigan. In later years, Campbell was selected in the Catholic League Hall of Fame.\n\n==University of Michigan==\nCampbell enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1994 with Gary Moeller as head coach. He played [[college football]] on head coach [[Lloyd Carr]]'s [[Michigan Wolverines football]] teams from 1995 to 1998.<ref name=Roster>{{cite web|title=Michigan Football Roster Database|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|accessdate=April 8, 2015|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/rosters/football.php}}</ref>  Campbell began his collegiate career playing multiple offensive positions but primarily as a tight end.

Ray Perkins served as his tight ends coach. Campbell missed most of the 2001 season with a broken leg suffered in the last week of training camp and placed on Injured Reserve. He was extremely motivated to keep improving so he took his recovery time to lift weights, train, and build his physique while gaining twenty pounds of muscle while keeping his playing weight the same. In 2002, Campbell came back ready to play and was named the opening day starter at tight end. The Browns released the previous starter and former first round pick, Rickey Dudley, to make room for Campbell. He had a solid season and was awarded the Ed Block Courage Award Winner. He appeared in 46 games for the Browns, 30 as the team's starting [[tight end]], and caught 46 passes for 390 yards and four touchdowns.<ref name=PFR/> Additionally, he was named on the team's leadership council selected by head coach Butch Davis.\n\nIn February 2003, the Browns traded Campbell to the [[Buffalo Bills]] in exchange for a conditional pick in the [[2004 NFL Draft]].  The conditional pick, based on Campbell's play in 2003, eventually was determined a fourth round selection. After playing well both as a blocker and receiver in the first eight games of the [[2003 Buffalo Bills season]], Campbell was signed to a multi-year contract extension by General Manager Tom Donahoe and head coach Gregg Williams.<ref>{{cite news|title=Buffalo locks up tight end|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (AP story)|date=November 5, 2003|page=2C|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1683&dat=20031105&id=d3k0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=z44EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3861,3814307&hl=en}}</ref> In 2004, under new head coach, Mike Mularkey, Campbell was elected on the team's leadership council. Also, he was the only tight end in Buffalo Bills team history to score three touchdowns in a single game. He is tied for the most receiving touchdowns in a single game for all receivers with three. Both records he still holds today. He suffered a season ending knee ACL injury in 2004 in the ninth game of the year. He was on pace to break personal records for receptions and touchdowns before the injury. Additionally, he was nominated as the NFL Players Association representative as voted on by his teammates. An honor that Campbell held for six of his ten years in the NFL. In 2005, he returned from injury to start the first game of the season. He played another solid season in Buffalo highlighted with his second career Ed Block Courage Award. He is the only player to win the Ed Block Courage Award twice in a career. Campbell was with the Bills from 2003 to 2005.  He appeared in 42 games for the Bills, 33 as a starting tight end, and caught 70 passes for 681 yards and six touchdowns.<ref name=PFR/>\n\nCampbell concluded his NFL career playing for the [[New Orleans Saints]] from 2006-2008.

This team is composed of low profile players that quietly excel. It is voted on by all of the general managers of NFL teams. In 2017, Campbell injured his back in the last pre-season game versus the Kansas City Chiefs. He was placed on Injured Reserve for the entire season. In 2008, Campbell returned to the field and filled a variety of offensive roles. He retired after suffering a knee injury late in the 2008 season, and having undergone ten surgeries in 10 years to repair a variety of football injuries.

The Indian government and local activists argue that slack management and deferred maintenance created a situation where routine pipe maintenance caused a backflow of water into a MIC tank, triggering the disaster. [[Union Carbide Corporation]] (UCC) argues water entered the tank through an act of sabotage.\n\nThe owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|470000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to [[Eveready Industries India|Eveready Industries India Limited]] (EIIL), which subsequently merged with [[McLeod Russel|McLeod Russel (India) Ltd]]. Eveready ended clean-up on the site in 1998, when it terminated its 99-year lease and turned over control of the site to the state government of Madhya Pradesh.

This \"route\" differed from the MIC-free routes used elsewhere, in which the same raw materials were combined in a different manufacturing order, with phosgene first reacting with naphthol to form a chloroformate ester, which was, in turn, reacted with methylamine.

UCC safety regulations specified that no one tank should be filled more than 50% (here, 30 tons) with liquid MIC. Each tank was pressurized with inert nitrogen gas.

The initial investigation was conducted entirely by the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR) and the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]]. The UCC chairman and CEO [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]], together with a technical team, immediately travelled to India. Upon arrival Anderson was placed under house arrest and urged by the Indian government to leave the country within 24 hours. Union Carbide organized a team of international medical experts, as well as supplies and equipment, to work with the local Bhopal medical community, and the UCC technical team began assessing the cause of the gas leak.\n\nThe health care system immediately became overloaded. In the severely affected areas, nearly 70 percent were under-qualified doctors. Medical staff were unprepared for the thousands of casualties. Doctors and hospitals were not aware of proper treatment methods for MIC gas inhalation.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" />{{rp|6}}\n\nThere were mass funerals and cremations.

The photographers did not ask for the identity of the father or child as she was buried, and no relative has since confirmed it. As such, the identity of the girl remains unknown. Both photos became symbolic of the suffering of victims of the Bhopal disaster, and Bartholomew's went on to win the 1984 World Press Photo of the Year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1985/world-press-photo-year/pablo-bartholomew|title=1985 Pablo Bartholomew WY|website=World Press Photo|access-date=9 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nWithin a few days, trees in the vicinity became barren and bloated animal carcasses had to be disposed of. 170,000 people were treated at hospitals and temporary dispensaries, and 2,000 buffalo, goats, and other animals were collected and buried. Supplies, including food, became scarce owing to suppliers' safety fears. Fishing was prohibited causing further supply shortages.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" />\n\nLacking any safe alternative, on 16 December, tanks 611 and 619 were emptied of the remaining MIC by reactivating the plant and continuing the manufacture of pesticide. Despite safety precautions such as having water-carrying helicopters continually overflying the plant, this led to a second mass evacuation from Bhopal. The Government of India passed the \"Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Act\" that gave the government rights to represent all victims, whether or not in India. Complaints of lack of information or misinformation were widespread. An Indian government spokesman said, \"Carbide is more interested in getting information from us than in helping our relief work\".<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" />\n\nFormal statements were issued that air, water, vegetation and foodstuffs were safe, but warned not to consume fish. The number of children exposed to the gases was at least 200,000.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /> Within weeks, the State Government established a number of hospitals, clinics and mobile units in the gas-affected area to treat the victims.\n\n===Subsequent legal action===\n[[File:BHOPAL (231583728).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Victims of Bhopal disaster march in September 2006 demanding the extradition of American [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]] from the United States.|alt=Number of women pictured in black and white colour, sitting and protesting against Anderson and the company.]]\nLegal proceedings involving UCC, the United States and Indian governments, local Bhopal authorities, and the disaster victims started immediately after the catastrophe. The Indian Government passed the Bhopal Gas Leak Act in March 1985, allowing the Government of India to act as the legal representative for victims of the disaster,<ref name=\"chrono\" /> leading to the beginning of legal proceedings. Initial lawsuits were generated in the United States federal court system. On 17 April 1985, Federal District court judge [[John F. Keenan]] (overseeing one lawsuit) suggested that \"'fundamental human decency' required Union Carbide to provide between $5 million and $10 million to immediately help the injured\" and suggested the money could be quickly distributed through the International Red Cross.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/120143461|title=19 Apr 1985, Page 56 - Arizona Republic at Newspapers.com|website=$5 million in relief offered to gas-leak victims|access-date=7 June 2016}}</ref> UCC, on the notion that doing so did not constitute an admission of liability and the figure could be credited toward any future settlement or judgement, offered a $5 million relief fund two days later.<ref name=\":5\" /> The Indian government turned down the offer.<ref name=\"D\" />\n\nIn March 1986 UCC proposed a settlement figure, endorsed by plaintiffs' U.S. attorneys, of {{Nowrap|$350 million}} that would, according to the company, \"generate a fund for Bhopal victims of between {{Nowrap|$500\u2013600 million}} over 20 years\". In May, litigation was transferred from the United States to Indian courts by a U.S. District Court ruling. Following an appeal of this decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the transfer, judging, in January 1987, that UCIL was a \"separate entity, owned, managed and operated exclusively by Indian citizens in India\".<ref name=\"chrono\" />\n\nThe Government of India refused the offer from Union Carbide and claimed US${{Nowrap|3.3 billion}}.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /> The [[Supreme Court of India|Indian Supreme Court]] told both sides to come to an agreement and \"start with a clean slate\" in November 1988.<ref name=\"chrono\" /> Eventually, in an out-of-court settlement reached in February 1989, Union Carbide agreed to pay US${{Nowrap|470 million}} for damages caused in the Bhopal disaster.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /> The amount was immediately paid.\n\nThroughout 1990, the [[Indian Supreme Court]] heard appeals against the settlement. In October 1991, the Supreme Court upheld the original {{Nowrap|$470 million}}, dismissing any other outstanding petitions that challenged the original decision. The Court ordered the Indian government \"to purchase, out of settlement fund, a group medical insurance policy to cover 100,000 persons who may later develop symptoms\" and cover any shortfall in the settlement fund. It also requested UCC and its subsidiary UCIL \"voluntarily\" fund a hospital in Bhopal, at an estimated {{Nowrap|$17 million}}, to specifically treat victims of the Bhopal disaster. The company agreed to this.<ref name=\"chrono\" />\n\n===Post-settlement activity===\n\nIn 1991, the local Bhopal authorities charged Anderson, who had retired in 1986, with manslaughter, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was declared a fugitive from justice by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Bhopal on 1 February 1992 for failing to appear at the court hearings in a culpable [[homicide]] case in which he was named the chief defendant. Orders were passed to the Government of India to press for an [[extradition]] from the United States. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] refused to hear an appeal of the decision of the lower federal courts in October 1993, meaning that victims of the Bhopal disaster could not seek damages in a U.S. court.<ref name=\"chrono\" />\n\nIn 2004, the Indian Supreme Court ordered the Indian government to release any remaining settlement funds to victims. And in September 2006, the Welfare Commission for Bhopal Gas Victims announced that all original compensation claims and revised petitions had been \"cleared\".<ref name=\"chrono\" /> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in New York City upheld the dismissal of remaining claims in the case of ''Bano v. Union Carbide Corporation'' in 2006. This move blocked plaintiffs' motions for class certification and claims for property damages and remediation. In the view of UCC, \"the ruling reaffirms UCC's long-held positions and finally puts to rest\u2014both procedurally and substantively\u2014the issues raised in the class action complaint first filed against Union Carbide in 1999 by Haseena Bi and several organisations representing the residents of Bhopal\".<ref name=\"chrono\" />\n\nIn June 2010, seven former employees of UCIL, all Indian nationals and many in their 70s, were convicted of causing death by [[negligence]]: Keshub Mahindra, former non-executive chairman of Union Carbide India Limited; V.

This point of view further argues that the Indian government took extensive actions to hide this possibility in order to attach blame to UCC.<ref name=\"Kalelkar1988\" />\n\nTheories differ as to how the water entered the tank. At the time, workers were cleaning out a clogged pipe with water about 400 feet from the tank. They claimed that they were not told to isolate the tank with a pipe slip-blind plate. The operators assumed that owing to bad maintenance and leaking valves, it was possible for the water to leak into the tank.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /><ref name=\"Chouhan\"/>\n\nThis water entry route could not be reproduced despite strenuous efforts by motivated parties.<ref name=\"Weisman NYT Dec 1985 p.5\">{{cite news|author=Steven R.

UCIL's investigation team found no evidence of the necessary connection; the investigation was totally controlled by the government, denying UCC investigators access to the tank or interviews with the operators.<ref name=\"Kalelkar1988\" /><ref name=\"tradeunion1985\" />\n\n===Corporate negligence===\n\nThis point of view argues that management (and to some extent, local government) underinvested in safety, which allowed for a dangerous working environment to develop. Factors cited include the filling of the MIC tanks beyond recommended levels, poor maintenance after the plant ceased MIC production at the end of 1984, allowing several safety systems to be inoperable due to poor maintenance, and switching off safety systems to save money\u2014 including the MIC tank refrigeration system which could have mitigated the disaster severity, and non-existent catastrophe management plans.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /><ref name=\"Eckerman2001\" /> Other factors identified by government inquiries included undersized safety devices and the dependence on manual operations.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /> Specific plant management deficiencies that were identified include the lack of skilled operators, reduction of safety management, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate emergency action plans.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /><ref name=\"Eckerman2006\"/>\n\n====Underinvestment====\n\nUnderinvestment is cited as contributing to an environment.   In attempts to reduce expenses, $1.25 million of cuts were placed upon the plant which affected the factory's employees and their conditions.<ref name=\":8\" /> Kurzman argues that \"cuts&nbsp;... meant less stringent quality control and thus looser safety rules.

Little]] claims that the Negligence argument was impossible for several tangible reasons:<ref name=\"Kalelkar1988\" />\n# The pipes being used by the nearby workers were only 1/2 inch in diameter and were physically incapable of producing enough hydraulic pressure to raise water the more than 10 feet that would have been necessary to enable the water to \"backflow\" into the MIC tank.\n# A key intermediate valve would have had to be open for the Negligence argument to apply. This valve was \"tagged\" closed, meaning that it had been inspected and found to be closed. While it is possible for open valves to clog over time, the only way a closed valve allows penetration is if there is leakage, and 1985 tests carried out by the government of India found this valve to be non-leaking.\n# In order for water to have reached the MIC tank from the pipe-cleaning area, it would have had to flow through a significant network of pipes ranging from 6 to 8 inches in diameter, before rising ten feet and flowing into the MIC tank. Had this occurred, most of the water that was in those pipes at the time the tank had its critical reaction would have remained in those pipes, as there was no drain for them. Investigation by the Indian government in 1985 revealed that the pipes were bone dry.\n\n===Employee sabotage===\nNow owned by [[Dow Chemical Company]], Union Carbide maintains a website dedicated to the tragedy and claims that the incident was the result of sabotage, stating that sufficient safety systems were in place and operative to prevent the intrusion of water.<ref name=\"ucs\">{{cite web |title=Statement of Union Carbide Corporation Regarding the Bhopal Tragedy |url=http://www.bhopal.com/union-carbide-statements |publisher=Bhopal Information Center |accessdate=30 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904032258/http://www.bhopal.com/union-carbide-statements |archivedate=4 September 2012  }}</ref>\n\nThe Union Carbide-commissioned Arthur D.

(This testimony was corroborated by other witnesses.)\n# Graphological analysis revealed major attempts to alter logfiles and destroy log evidence.\n# Other logfiles show that the control team had attempted to purge 1 ton of material out of Tank 610 immediately prior to the disaster. An attempt was then made to cover up this transfer via log alteration. Water is heavier than MIC, and the transfer line is attached to the bottom of the tank. The Arthur D. Little report concludes from this that the transfer was an effort to transfer water out of Tank 610 that had been discovered there.\n# A third key witness (the \"off-duty employee of another unit\") stated that \"he had been told by a close friend of one of the MIC operators that water had entered through a tube that had been connected to the tank.\" This had been discovered by the other MIC operators (so the story was recounted) who then tried to open and close valves to prevent the release.\n# A fourth key witness (the \"operator from a different unit\") stated that after the release, two MIC operators had told him that water had entered the tank through a pressure gauge.\n\nThe Little report argues that this evidence demonstrates that the following chronology took place:\n* At 10:20pm, the tank was at normal pressure, indicating the absence of water.\n* At 10:45pm, a shift change took place, after which the MIC storage area \"would be completely deserted\". During this period, a \"disgruntled operator entered the storage area and hooked up one of the readily available rubber water hoses to Tank 610, with the intention of contaminating and spoiling the tank's contents.\"\n* Water began to flow, beginning the chemical reaction that caused the disaster.\n* After midnight, control room operators noticed the pressure rising and realized there was a problem with Tank 610. They discovered the water connection, and decided to transfer one ton of the contents out to try and remove the water. The MIC release then occurred.\n* The cover-up activities discovered during the investigation then took place.\n* After over 30 years, in November 2017, S. P.

The Indian government and local activists argue that slack management and deferred maintenance created a situation where routine pipe maintenance caused a backflow of water into a MIC tank, triggering the disaster. [[Union Carbide Corporation]] (UCC) argues water entered the tank through an act of sabotage.\n\nThe owner of the factory, UCIL, was majority owned by UCC, with Indian Government-controlled banks and the Indian public holding a 49.1 percent stake. In 1989, UCC paid $470 million (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|470000000|1989}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}) to settle litigation stemming from the disaster. In 1994, UCC sold its stake in UCIL to [[Eveready Industries India|Eveready Industries India Limited]] (EIIL), which subsequently merged with [[McLeod Russel|McLeod Russel (India) Ltd]].

In May, litigation was transferred from the United States to Indian courts by a U.S. District Court ruling. Following an appeal of this decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the transfer, judging, in January 1987, that UCIL was a \"separate entity, owned, managed and operated exclusively by Indian citizens in India\".<ref name=\"chrono\" />\n\nThe Government of India refused the offer from Union Carbide and claimed US${{Nowrap|3.3 billion}}.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /> The [[Supreme Court of India|Indian Supreme Court]] told both sides to come to an agreement and \"start with a clean slate\" in November 1988.<ref name=\"chrono\" /> Eventually, in an out-of-court settlement reached in February 1989, Union Carbide agreed to pay US${{Nowrap|470 million}} for damages caused in the Bhopal disaster.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /> The amount was immediately paid.\n\nThroughout 1990, the [[Indian Supreme Court]] heard appeals against the settlement. In October 1991, the Supreme Court upheld the original {{Nowrap|$470 million}}, dismissing any other outstanding petitions that challenged the original decision. The Court ordered the Indian government \"to purchase, out of settlement fund, a group medical insurance policy to cover 100,000 persons who may later develop symptoms\" and cover any shortfall in the settlement fund. It also requested UCC and its subsidiary UCIL \"voluntarily\" fund a hospital in Bhopal, at an estimated {{Nowrap|$17 million}}, to specifically treat victims of the Bhopal disaster. The company agreed to this.<ref name=\"chrono\" />\n\n===Post-settlement activity===\n\nIn 1991, the local Bhopal authorities charged Anderson, who had retired in 1986, with manslaughter, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was declared a fugitive from justice by the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Bhopal on 1 February 1992 for failing to appear at the court hearings in a culpable [[homicide]] case in which he was named the chief defendant. Orders were passed to the Government of India to press for an [[extradition]] from the United States. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] refused to hear an appeal of the decision of the lower federal courts in October 1993, meaning that victims of the Bhopal disaster could not seek damages in a U.S. court.<ref name=\"chrono\" />\n\nIn 2004, the Indian Supreme Court ordered the Indian government to release any remaining settlement funds to victims. And in September 2006, the Welfare Commission for Bhopal Gas Victims announced that all original compensation claims and revised petitions had been \"cleared\".<ref name=\"chrono\" /> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in New York City upheld the dismissal of remaining claims in the case of ''Bano v. Union Carbide Corporation'' in 2006. This move blocked plaintiffs' motions for class certification and claims for property damages and remediation. In the view of UCC, \"the ruling reaffirms UCC's long-held positions and finally puts to rest\u2014both procedurally and substantively\u2014the issues raised in the class action complaint first filed against Union Carbide in 1999 by Haseena Bi and several organisations representing the residents of Bhopal\".<ref name=\"chrono\" />\n\nIn June 2010, seven former employees of UCIL, all Indian nationals and many in their 70s, were convicted of causing death by [[negligence]]: Keshub Mahindra, former non-executive chairman of Union Carbide India Limited; V.

This point of view further argues that the Indian government took extensive actions to hide this possibility in order to attach blame to UCC.<ref name=\"Kalelkar1988\" />\n\nTheories differ as to how the water entered the tank. At the time, workers were cleaning out a clogged pipe with water about 400 feet from the tank. They claimed that they were not told to isolate the tank with a pipe slip-blind plate. The operators assumed that owing to bad maintenance and leaking valves, it was possible for the water to leak into the tank.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /><ref name=\"Chouhan\"/>\n\nThis water entry route could not be reproduced despite strenuous efforts by motivated parties.<ref name=\"Weisman NYT Dec 1985 p.5\">{{cite news|author=Steven R. Weisman|title=Bhopal a Year Later: An Eerie Silence|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 December 1985|page=5}}</ref> UCC claims that a \"disgruntled worker\" deliberately connecting a hose to a pressure gauge connection was the real cause.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /><ref name=\"Kalelkar1988\" />\n\nEarly the next morning, a UCIL manager asked the instrument engineer to replace the gauge. UCIL's investigation team found no evidence of the necessary connection; the investigation was totally controlled by the government, denying UCC investigators access to the tank or interviews with the operators.<ref name=\"Kalelkar1988\" /><ref name=\"tradeunion1985\" />\n\n===Corporate negligence===\n\nThis point of view argues that management (and to some extent, local government) underinvested in safety, which allowed for a dangerous working environment to develop. Factors cited include the filling of the MIC tanks beyond recommended levels, poor maintenance after the plant ceased MIC production at the end of 1984, allowing several safety systems to be inoperable due to poor maintenance, and switching off safety systems to save money\u2014 including the MIC tank refrigeration system which could have mitigated the disaster severity, and non-existent catastrophe management plans.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /><ref name=\"Eckerman2001\" /> Other factors identified by government inquiries included undersized safety devices and the dependence on manual operations.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /> Specific plant management deficiencies that were identified include the lack of skilled operators, reduction of safety management, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate emergency action plans.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /><ref name=\"Eckerman2006\"/>\n\n====Underinvestment====\n\nUnderinvestment is cited as contributing to an environment.   In attempts to reduce expenses, $1.25 million of cuts were placed upon the plant which affected the factory's employees and their conditions.<ref name=\":8\" /> Kurzman argues that \"cuts&nbsp;... meant less stringent quality control and thus looser safety rules. A pipe leaked? Don't replace it, employees said they were told&nbsp;... MIC workers needed more training? They could do with less.

By 1984, only six of the original twelve operators were still working with MIC and the number of supervisory personnel had also been halved. No maintenance supervisor was placed on the night shift and instrument readings were taken every two hours, rather than the previous and required one-hour readings.<ref name=\"Chouhan\" /><ref name=\"Kurzman1987\" /> Workers made complaints about the cuts through their union but were ignored.

This valve was \"tagged\" closed, meaning that it had been inspected and found to be closed. While it is possible for open valves to clog over time, the only way a closed valve allows penetration is if there is leakage, and 1985 tests carried out by the government of India found this valve to be non-leaking.\n# In order for water to have reached the MIC tank from the pipe-cleaning area, it would have had to flow through a significant network of pipes ranging from 6 to 8 inches in diameter, before rising ten feet and flowing into the MIC tank. Had this occurred, most of the water that was in those pipes at the time the tank had its critical reaction would have remained in those pipes, as there was no drain for them. Investigation by the Indian government in 1985 revealed that the pipes were bone dry.\n\n===Employee sabotage===\nNow owned by [[Dow Chemical Company]], Union Carbide maintains a website dedicated to the tragedy and claims that the incident was the result of sabotage, stating that sufficient safety systems were in place and operative to prevent the intrusion of water.<ref name=\"ucs\">{{cite web |title=Statement of Union Carbide Corporation Regarding the Bhopal Tragedy |url=http://www.bhopal.com/union-carbide-statements |publisher=Bhopal Information Center |accessdate=30 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904032258/http://www.bhopal.com/union-carbide-statements |archivedate=4 September 2012  }}</ref>\n\nThe Union Carbide-commissioned Arthur D.

(This testimony was corroborated by other witnesses.)\n# Graphological analysis revealed major attempts to alter logfiles and destroy log evidence.\n# Other logfiles show that the control team had attempted to purge 1 ton of material out of Tank 610 immediately prior to the disaster. An attempt was then made to cover up this transfer via log alteration. Water is heavier than MIC, and the transfer line is attached to the bottom of the tank. The Arthur D. Little report concludes from this that the transfer was an effort to transfer water out of Tank 610 that had been discovered there.\n# A third key witness (the \"off-duty employee of another unit\") stated that \"he had been told by a close friend of one of the MIC operators that water had entered through a tube that had been connected to the tank.\" This had been discovered by the other MIC operators (so the story was recounted) who then tried to open and close valves to prevent the release.\n# A fourth key witness (the \"operator from a different unit\") stated that after the release, two MIC operators had told him that water had entered the tank through a pressure gauge.\n\nThe Little report argues that this evidence demonstrates that the following chronology took place:\n* At 10:20pm, the tank was at normal pressure, indicating the absence of water.\n* At 10:45pm, a shift change took place, after which the MIC storage area \"would be completely deserted\". During this period, a \"disgruntled operator entered the storage area and hooked up one of the readily available rubber water hoses to Tank 610, with the intention of contaminating and spoiling the tank's contents.\"\n* Water began to flow, beginning the chemical reaction that caused the disaster.\n* After midnight, control room operators noticed the pressure rising and realized there was a problem with Tank 610. They discovered the water connection, and decided to transfer one ton of the contents out to try and remove the water. The MIC release then occurred.\n* The cover-up activities discovered during the investigation then took place.\n* After over 30 years, in November 2017, S. P. Choudhary, former MIC production manager, claimed in court that the disaster was not an accident but the result of a sabotage that claimed thousands of lives.\nChaudry's counsel, Anirban Roy, argued that the theory of design defects was floated by the central government in its endeavour to protect the victims of the tragedy.

He founded several activist groups, as well as [[Sambhavna Trust]], the clinic for gas affected patients, where he is the manager.<ref name=\"Eckerman2005\" /> Other activists include Rashida Bee and Champa Devi Shukla, who received the [[Goldman Prize]] in 2004, Abdul Jabbar and [[Rachna Dhingra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/2004/Asia|title=Rashida Bee & Champa Devi Shukla|work=Goldman Environmental Foundation}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anindianmuslim.com/2009/12/crusader-for-victims-truth-of-bhopal.html |title=An Indian Muslim's Blog: News, Views & Urdu Poetry Website: Crusader for Victims: The Truth of Bhopal Gas Tragedy and its Aftermath-Part III |publisher=Anindianmuslim.com |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Local activism===\n[[File:Dow Chemical banner, Bhopal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Protest in Bhopal in 2010]]\nSoon after the accident, representatives from different activist groups arrived.

Every anniversary, actions are performed. Often these include marches around Old Bhopal, ending with burning an [[effigy]] of [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]].\n\n===International activism===\nCooperation with international NGOs including [http://www.pan-uk.org/ Pesticide Action Network UK] and [http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/toxics/justice-for-bhopal/ Greenpeace] started soon after the tragedy. One of the earliest reports is the Trade Union report from ILO 1985.<ref name=\"tradeunion1985\"/>\n\nIn 1992, a session of the [[Permanent Peoples' Tribunal]] on Industrial Hazards and Human Rights took place in Bhopal, and in 1996, the [https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/212/45285.html \"Charter on Industrial Hazards and Human Rights\"] was adopted.\n\nIn 1994, the [[International Medical Commission on Bhopal]] (IMCB) met in Bhopal.

That causes confusion for school children, who need to learn which words to write with ''ei'' and which with ''ij''. To distinguish between the two, the ''ij'' is referred to as the {{Lang|nl|lange ij|italic=yes}} (\"long ''ij''\"), the ''ei'' as {{Lang|nl|korte ei|italic=yes}} (\"short ''ei''\") or simply ''E{{snd}}I''.<ref>{{Citation | title = Woordenlijst Nederlandse Taal | language = Dutch | pages = 22\u201323}}.</ref> In certain Dutch dialects (notably [[West Flemish]] and [[Zeelandic]]) and the [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects of [[Low German]], a difference in the pronunciation of ''ei'' and ''ij'' is maintained. Whether it is pronounced identically to ''ei'' or not, the pronunciation of ''ij'' is often perceived as being difficult by people who do not have either sound in their native language.\n\nThe ''ij'' originally represented a 'long i'.<ref name=\"IJ origins\">{{cite web |url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/ij-oorsprong-van-de-lange-ij |title=IJ: oorsprong van de lange ij |work=Genootschap Onze Taal |language=Dutch}}</ref> This can still be seen in the etymology of some words and in the Dutch form of several foreign placenames: [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]] are spelled {{Lang|nl|Berlijn}} and {{Lang|nl|Parijs}}. Nowadays, the pronunciation follows the spelling, and they are pronounced with {{IPA |[\u025bi]}}. The ''ij'' is distinct from the letter ''[[Y|y]]''. Particularly when writing capitals, Y used to be common instead of IJ. That practice has long been deprecated and occurs instead in the derived language [[Afrikaans]], but the standard Dutch pronunciation of the letter Y is still ''ij'' when the alphabet is read.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\">{{cite web |url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1194/ij_alfabetiseren |title=IJ - alfabetiseren |work=Nederlandse Taalunie |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> In scientific disciplines such as [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the symbol ''y'' is usually pronounced ''ij''.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\">{{cite web |url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/ij-plaats-in-alfabet |title=IJ: plaats in alfabet |work=Genootschap Onze Taal |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo distinguish the ''Y'' from ''IJ'' in common speech, however, ''Y'' is often called {{Lang|nl|Griekse ij|italic=yes}} (\"Greek ''Y''\"), ''{{Lang|fr|i-grec}}'' (the latter from [[French language|French]], with the stress on ''grec'': {{IPA-nl|i\u02c8\u0261r\u025bk|}}), or ''[[Ypsilon]]''.

Furthermore, the names of Dutch immigrants to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] were often [[anglicised]], with the ''IJ'' becoming a ''Y''. For example, the surname ''{{Lang|nl|Spijker}}'' was often changed into ''Spyker'' and ''Snijder'' into ''[[Snyder (surname)|Snyder]]''.\n[[File:IJ (letter).svg|thumb|The words ''{{Lang|nl|ijsvrij}}'' and ''yoghurt'' in various forms. Depending on the form of handwriting or font used, the IJ and Y can look either nearly identical or very different.]]\n[[File:Comparison of normal and italic of ij and \u00ff.svg|thumb|Apt to confusion: (1) i + j, (2) ligature ij, (3) y with diaeresis, (4) y in [[Garamond]]]]\n[[File:Rijks museum logo.png|thumb|Logo of the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam]]\n[[File:Station Rijssen.jpg|thumb|The name of a railway station]]\n[[File:Spandoek Hengelo.jpg|thumb|IJ here is written as one letter.]]\n[[File:Graffiti viaduct boven A1.jpg|thumb|Here, IJ is written as Y.]]\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n''IJ'' probably developed out of ''ii'', representing a long {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} sound (which it still does in some cases, such as in the word ''{{Lang|nl|bijzonder}}'' and in several Dutch dialects).<ref name=\"IJ origins\" /> In the [[Middle Ages]], the ''i'' was written without a [[tittle|dot]] in handwriting, and the combination ''\u0131\u0131'' was often confused with ''u''.  Therefore, the second ''i'' was elongated: ''\u0131\u0237''. Later, the dots were added, albeit not in [[Afrikaans]], a language that has its roots in Dutch. In this language ''y'' is used instead.\n\nAlternatively, the letter [[J]] may have developed as a [[swash (typography)|swash]] form of ''i''. In other European languages it was first used for the final ''i'' in [[Roman numerals]] when there was more than one ''i'' in a row, such as ''iij'' for \"three\", to prevent the fraudulent addition of an extra ''i'' to change the number. In Dutch, which had a native ''ii'', the \"final ''i'' in a row elongated\" rule was applied as well, leading to ''ij''.\n\nAnother theory is that ''IJ'' might have arisen from the lowercase ''y'' being split into two strokes in handwriting. At some time in the 15th or 16th century, this combination began to be spelled as a ligature ''ij''. An argument against this theory is that even in handwriting which does not join letters, ''ij'' is often written as a single sign.\n\nSome time after the birth of this new letter, the sound which was now represented by ''ij'', in most cases, began to be pronounced much like ''ei'' instead, but words containing it were still spelled the same. Nowadays, ''ij'' in most cases represents the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[\u025bi]}}, except in the suffix ''-lijk'', where it is usually pronounced as a [[schwa]]. In one special case, the Dutch word ''bijzonder'', the (old) sound {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} is correct standard pronunciation, although {{IPA|[i]}} is more common and {{IPA|[\u025bi]}} is also allowed.\n\nIn [[proper noun|proper names]], ''ij'' often appears instead of ''i'' at the end of other [[diphthong]]s, where it does not affect the pronunciation: ''aaij'', ''eij'', ''oeij'', ''ooij'' and ''uij'' are pronounced identically to ''aai'' {{IPA|[a\u02d0i]}}, ''ei'' {{IPA|[\u025bi]}}, ''oei'' {{IPA|[ui]}}, ''ooi'' {{IPA|[o\u02d0i]}} and ''ui'' {{IPA|[\u0153y]}}. This derives from an old orthographic practice (also seen in older French and German) of writing ''y'' instead of ''i'' after another vowel; later, when ''y'' and ''ij'' came to be seen as interchangeable, the spellings with ''ij'' came to be used. [[History of Dutch orthography|Spelling reforms and standardization]] have removed the redundant ''j''s in common words, but proper names continue to use these archaic spellings.\n\n==Status==\n[[File:Dutch handwriting sample.png|thumb|A poster showing the letters of the alphabet used for writing education in the Netherlands. The final three letter pairs read \"Xx IJij Zz\".]]\n[[File:Leesplankje van Hoogeveen (2).png|thumb|In this version the ij is a single glyph.]]\nAs the rules of usage for the ''IJ'' differ from those that apply to the many other digraphs in the Dutch language{{snd}}in some situations behaving more as a single ligature or letter than a digraph{{snd}}the ''IJ'' is not only confusing to foreigners, but also a source of discussion among native speakers of Dutch. Its actual usage in the [[Netherlands]] and in Flanders ([[Belgium]]) sometimes differs from the official recommendations.\n\n===Official status===\nBoth the [[Dutch Language Union]] and the [[Genootschap Onze Taal]] consider the ''ij'' to be a digraph of the letters ''i'' and ''j''.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\" /><ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\" /> The descriptive dictionary ''[[Van Dale|Van Dale Groot woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal]]'' states that ''ij'' is a \"letter combination consisting of the signs i and j, used, in some words, to represent the diphthong \u025bi.\"<ref name=\"dikkevandale\">''Van Dale Groot woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal'': \"lettercombinatie bestaande uit de tekens i en j, gebruikt om, in een aantal woorden, de tweeklank \u025bi weer te geven\"</ref> The ''[[Winkler Prins]]'' encyclopedia states that ''ij'' is the 25th letter of the Dutch alphabet, placed between ''X'' and ''Y''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, this definition is not generally accepted.\n\nIn words where ''i'' and ''j'' are in different syllables, they [[#Not as a digraph|do not]] form the digraph ''ij''. In [[compound (linguistics)|compound words]], a [[hyphen]] is added, as in ''gummi-jas''.<ref>[http://woordenlijst.org/leidraad/7/1 Welke klinkers botsen?], Taalunie {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the Netherlands, ''IJ'' is often used as a ligature:\n\n* In Dutch primary schools, ''ij'' used to be taught as being the 25th letter of the alphabet, and some primary school writing materials list 'ij' as the 25th letter of the alphabet. However, ''ij'' is according to Onze Taal not part of the Dutch alphabet and is usually sorted under the ''i'' as it is considered to consist of two letters.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\" />\n* When a word starting with ''IJ'' is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: {{Lang|nl|[[IJsselmeer]]}}, {{Lang|nl|[[IJmuiden]]}}.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\" />\n* On mechanical Dutch typewriters, there is a key that produces 'ij' (in a single letterspace, located directly to the right of the ''L''). However, this is not the case on modern computer keyboards.\n* In word puzzles, ''ij'' often fills one square.\n\n===Flanders===\nIn Flanders (Belgium), ''IJ'' is generally described in schools as a combination of two separate characters.\n\n* As in the Netherlands, words that begin with ''IJ'' usually capitalise the entire pair: ''[[Yser|IJzer]]'', ''[[IJzertoren]]''.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Capitalisation===\nWhen a Dutch word starting with ''IJ'' is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: ''IJsselmeer'', ''IJmuiden''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1188 |title=Ijsland / IJsland |work=Nederlandse Taalunie |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Firefox]] version 14.0 and above knows that ''ijsselmeer'' can be capitalized as ''IJsselmeer'' with [[CSS]] property <code>text-transform: capitalize</code>, this is requiring <code>lang=\"nl\"</code> attribute to indicate Dutch locale.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform |title=text-transform - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets {{!}} MDN |work=MDN Web Docs |accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Collation===\n[[Dutch dictionaries]] since about 1850 invariably sort ''ij'' as an ''i'' followed by a ''j'', i.e. between ''ih'' and ''ik''. This is the preferred sorting by the [[Taalunie]].<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\" /> On the other hand, some encyclopedias, like the ''[[Winkler Prins]]'', 7th edition, sort ''ij'' as a single letter positioned between ''x'' and ''y''.\n\n[[Telephone directory|Telephone directories]] as well as the [[Yellow Pages]] in the Netherlands (but not those in Belgium) sort ''ij'' and ''y'' together, as if they were the same, between ''x'' and ''z''. Thanks to this, surnames like ''Bruijn'' and ''Bruyn'' which sound the same (and even look similar), can be found in the same area. However, ''Bruin'', though it sounds the same as well, is placed with \"Brui-\" and not with \"Bruy-\".\n\n===Abbreviations===\nWhen words or (first) names are shortened to their initials, in the Netherlands a word or proper name starting with ''IJ'' is abbreviated to ''IJ''. For example, ''IJsbrand Eises Ypma'' is shortened to ''IJ. E. Ypma''.<ref name =\"eu\">{{cite web| first =Yuri | last = Demchenko |url= http://www.uazone.org/multiling/euroml/annex02.html | title =European rules for the use of the IJ in public records |publisher=UA zone |accessdate=2012-07-19}}</ref> Note that the digraph \"ei\" in \"Eises\", like other digraphs in Dutch, is shortened to one letter.\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Bijna.png|thumb|The Dutch word \"bijna\" (almost, nearly) with ''ad hoc'' stress on the first syllable indicated by two acute accents on the digraph ''ij''.]]\nIn Dutch orthography, ''ad hoc'' indication of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] can be marked by placing an [[acute accent]] on the vowel of the stressed syllable. In case of a diphthong or double vowel, both vowels should be marked with an acute accent; this also applies to the ''IJ'' (even though ''J'' by itself is not a vowel, the digraph ''IJ'' represents one distinct vowel sound). However, due to technical limitations the accent on the ''j'' is often omitted in electronic documents: \"b\u00edjna\".<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/tekst/16/klemtoonteken_algemeen/ Klemtoonteken (algemeen)], Nederlandse Taalunie</ref> Nevertheless, in [[Unicode]] it is possible to [[Combining character|combine characters]] into a ''j'' with an acute accent{{snd}}\"b\u00edj\u0301na\" {{snd}}though this might not be supported or rendered correctly by some [[Computer font|fonts]] or systems. This ''j\u0301'' is the combination of the regular (soft-dotted) ''j'' (U+006A) and the combining acute accent &nbsp;\u0301 (U+0301).\n\n===Spelling===\n{{Lang|nl|Vrijdag}} can be spelled out in two ways, depending on whether the speller considers ''ij'' to be one letter or not:\n\n* ''V \u2013 R \u2013 IJ \u2013 D \u2013 A \u2013 G''\n* ''V \u2013 R \u2013 I \u2013 J \u2013 D \u2013 A \u2013 G''\n\n===Wide inter-letter spacing===\n[[File:Signboard-slijterij.jpg|thumb|upright|On this signboard of an alcohol store ({{Lang|nl|slijterij}}), IJ occupies the same space as single letters. The I is put over the lower end of the J to reinforce their unity, but this is optional and I and J can also be found separately on other signs]]\n\nWhen words are written with large inter-letter spacing, ''IJ'' is often, but not always, kept together. ''F&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;k&nbsp;r&nbsp;ij&nbsp;k'' or ''F&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;k&nbsp;r&nbsp;i&nbsp;j&nbsp;k''.\n\nWhen words are written from top to bottom, with non-rotated letters, ''IJ'' is usually, but not always, kept together.

Some names are changed unofficially for commercial reasons or by indifference:\n\n* [[Johan Cruyff|Johan Cruijff/Cruyff]], former football player and manager\n* [[Ruud van Nistelrooy|Ruud van Nistelrooij/Nistelrooy]], football player\n* [[Piet Pieterszoon Hein|Piet Heijn/Heyn/Hein]], a [[Dutch West India Company]] admiral\n* [[Dirk Kuyt|Dirk Kuijt/Kuyt]], football player\n* [[Arie Luyendyk|Arie Luijendijk/Luyendyk]], a race-driver\n* [[Spyker|Spijker/Spyker]], car manufacturer\n* [[Anner Bylsma|Anner Bijlsma/Bylsma]], cellist\n\nThe Dutch football team of [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] changed its name from the original \"{{Lang|nl|Feijenoord|italic=unset}}\" to \"{{Lang|nl|Feyenoord|italic=unset}}\" after achieving international successes. This was done as a reaction to foreign people often mispronouncing the name. The [[Feijenoord district]] in [[Rotterdam]], where the team is from, still writes its name using the original ''ij''.\n\n===Phonetic Radio Alphabet===\nIn the Dutch phonetic [[radio alphabet]], the codeword {{Lang|nl|IJmuiden|italic=yes}} represents the ''IJ''. This is clearly different from the codeword ''Ypsilon'', which is used to represent the ''Y''. Dutch and Belgian armed forces use the official [[NATO phonetic alphabet]], \"Y\" is \"Yankee\" and \"IJ\" is spelled out \"India Juliett\".\n\n===Word games===\nIn [[crossword puzzle]]s (except for [[Scrabble]]{{snd}}see next paragraph), and in the game [[Lingo (Dutch game show)|Lingo]], ''IJ'' is considered one letter, filling one square, but the ''IJ'' and the ''Y'' are considered distinct. In other word games, the rules may vary.\n\nThe Dutch version of Scrabble has a ''Y'' with a face value of eight.  Some players used it to represent ''IJ'' or ''Y''. The recent Dutch version comes with an example game, which clearly indicates that ''Y'' is only ''Y'', and ''IJ'' should be composed of ''I'' and ''J''. In previous editions of Scrabble there was a single IJ sign.<!-- http://www.gtoal.com/wordgames/details/dutch/ is definitely incorrect - the face values differ too-->\n\nIn word games that make a distinction between vowels and consonants, ''IJ'' is considered to be a vowel, if it is considered one letter. Whether ''Y'' is a vowel or a consonant, is another matter of discussion, since ''Y'' can represent both a vowel or a (half-)consonant.\n\n==Technical details==\n===Print and handwriting===\n[[File:Amsterdamse tram - De Red Crosser - from Flickr 2838709455 cropped lijnbus.jpg|thumb|{{lang|nl|Lijnbus}} ([[public bus]], literally \"line bus\") road marking with IJ as a \"broken U\" glyph]]\nIn print, the letter ''\u00ff'' (lowercase [[y]] with [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and ''ij'' look very different, but [[handwriting]] usually makes  ''\u00ff'', ''ij'' and ''Y'', ''IJ'' look identical. However, since ''y'' occurs only in loanwords, the letter ''\u00ff'' is extremely rare (if not altogether nonexistent) in Dutch.\n\nThe ''long ij'' extends below the baseline and so is written with a long stroke.

To distinguish between the two, the ''ij'' is referred to as the {{Lang|nl|lange ij|italic=yes}} (\"long ''ij''\"), the ''ei'' as {{Lang|nl|korte ei|italic=yes}} (\"short ''ei''\") or simply ''E{{snd}}I''.<ref>{{Citation | title = Woordenlijst Nederlandse Taal | language = Dutch | pages = 22\u201323}}.</ref> In certain Dutch dialects (notably [[West Flemish]] and [[Zeelandic]]) and the [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects of [[Low German]], a difference in the pronunciation of ''ei'' and ''ij'' is maintained.

Nowadays, the pronunciation follows the spelling, and they are pronounced with {{IPA |[\u025bi]}}. The ''ij'' is distinct from the letter ''[[Y|y]]''. Particularly when writing capitals, Y used to be common instead of IJ.That practice has long been deprecated and occurs instead in the derived language [[Afrikaans]], but the standard Dutch pronunciation of the letter Y is still ''ij'' when the alphabet is read.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\">{{cite web |url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1194/ij_alfabetiseren |title=IJ - alfabetiseren |work=Nederlandse Taalunie |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> In scientific disciplines such as [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the symbol ''y'' is usually pronounced ''ij''.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\">{{cite web |url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/ij-plaats-in-alfabet |title=IJ: plaats in alfabet |work=Genootschap Onze Taal |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo distinguish the ''Y'' from ''IJ'' in common speech, however, ''Y'' is often called {{Lang|nl|Griekse ij|italic=yes}} (\"Greek ''Y''\"), ''{{Lang|fr|i-grec}}'' (the latter from [[French language|French]], with the stress on ''grec'': {{IPA-nl|i\u02c8\u0261r\u025bk|}}), or ''[[Ypsilon]]''.

Furthermore, the names of Dutch immigrants to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] were often [[anglicised]], with the ''IJ'' becoming a ''Y''. For example, the surname ''{{Lang|nl|Spijker}}'' was often changed into ''Spyker'' and ''Snijder'' into ''[[Snyder (surname)|Snyder]]''.\n[[File:IJ (letter).svg|thumb|The words ''{{Lang|nl|ijsvrij}}'' and ''yoghurt'' in various forms.

Therefore, the second ''i'' was elongated: ''\u0131\u0237''. Later, the dots were added, albeit not in [[Afrikaans]], a language that has its roots in Dutch. In this language ''y'' is used instead.\n\nAlternatively, the letter [[J]] may have developed as a [[swash (typography)|swash]] form of ''i''. In other European languages it was first used for the final ''i'' in [[Roman numerals]] when there was more than one ''i'' in a row, such as ''iij'' for \"three\", to prevent the fraudulent addition of an extra ''i'' to change the number. In Dutch, which had a native ''ii'', the \"final ''i'' in a row elongated\" rule was applied as well, leading to ''ij''.\n\nAnother theory is that ''IJ'' might have arisen from the lowercase ''y'' being split into two strokes in handwriting. At some time in the 15th or 16th century, this combination began to be spelled as a ligature ''ij''. An argument against this theory is that even in handwriting which does not join letters, ''ij'' is often written as a single sign.\n\nSome time after the birth of this new letter, the sound which was now represented by ''ij'', in most cases, began to be pronounced much like ''ei'' instead, but words containing it were still spelled the same. Nowadays, ''ij'' in most cases represents the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[\u025bi]}}, except in the suffix ''-lijk'', where it is usually pronounced as a [[schwa]]. In one special case, the Dutch word ''bijzonder'', the (old) sound {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} is correct standard pronunciation, although {{IPA|[i]}} is more common and {{IPA|[\u025bi]}} is also allowed.\n\nIn [[proper noun|proper names]], ''ij'' often appears instead of ''i'' at the end of other [[diphthong]]s, where it does not affect the pronunciation: ''aaij'', ''eij'', ''oeij'', ''ooij'' and ''uij'' are pronounced identically to ''aai'' {{IPA|[a\u02d0i]}}, ''ei'' {{IPA|[\u025bi]}}, ''oei'' {{IPA|[ui]}}, ''ooi'' {{IPA|[o\u02d0i]}} and ''ui'' {{IPA|[\u0153y]}}. This derives from an old orthographic practice (also seen in older French and German) of writing ''y'' instead of ''i'' after another vowel; later, when ''y'' and ''ij'' came to be seen as interchangeable, the spellings with ''ij'' came to be used. [[History of Dutch orthography|Spelling reforms and standardization]] have removed the redundant ''j''s in common words, but proper names continue to use these archaic spellings.\n\n==Status==\n[[File:Dutch handwriting sample.png|thumb|A poster showing the letters of the alphabet used for writing education in the Netherlands. The final three letter pairs read \"Xx IJij Zz\".]]\n[[File:Leesplankje van Hoogeveen (2).png|thumb|In this version the ij is a single glyph.]]\nAs the rules of usage for the ''IJ'' differ from those that apply to the many other digraphs in the Dutch language{{snd}}in some situations behaving more as a single ligature or letter than a digraph{{snd}}the ''IJ'' is not only confusing to foreigners, but also a source of discussion among native speakers of Dutch.

However, this is not the case on modern computer keyboards.\n* In word puzzles, ''ij'' often fills one square.\n\n===Flanders===\nIn Flanders (Belgium), ''IJ'' is generally described in schools as a combination of two separate characters.\n\n* As in the Netherlands, words that begin with ''IJ'' usually capitalise the entire pair: ''[[Yser|IJzer]]'', ''[[IJzertoren]]''.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Capitalisation===\nWhen a Dutch word starting with ''IJ'' is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: ''IJsselmeer'', ''IJmuiden''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1188 |title=Ijsland / IJsland |work=Nederlandse Taalunie |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Firefox]] version 14.0 and above knows that ''ijsselmeer'' can be capitalized as ''IJsselmeer'' with [[CSS]] property <code>text-transform: capitalize</code>, this is requiring <code>lang=\"nl\"</code> attribute to indicate Dutch locale.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform |title=text-transform - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets {{!}} MDN |work=MDN Web Docs |accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Collation===\n[[Dutch dictionaries]] since about 1850 invariably sort ''ij'' as an ''i'' followed by a ''j'', i.e. between ''ih'' and ''ik''. This is the preferred sorting by the [[Taalunie]].<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\" /> On the other hand, some encyclopedias, like the ''[[Winkler Prins]]'', 7th edition, sort ''ij'' as a single letter positioned between ''x'' and ''y''.\n\n[[Telephone directory|Telephone directories]] as well as the [[Yellow Pages]] in the Netherlands (but not those in Belgium) sort ''ij'' and ''y'' together, as if they were the same, between ''x'' and ''z''. Thanks to this, surnames like ''Bruijn'' and ''Bruyn'' which sound the same (and even look similar), can be found in the same area. However, ''Bruin'', though it sounds the same as well, is placed with \"Brui-\" and not with \"Bruy-\".\n\n===Abbreviations===\nWhen words or (first) names are shortened to their initials, in the Netherlands a word or proper name starting with ''IJ'' is abbreviated to ''IJ''. For example, ''IJsbrand Eises Ypma'' is shortened to ''IJ. E. Ypma''.<ref name =\"eu\">{{cite web| first =Yuri | last = Demchenko |url= http://www.uazone.org/multiling/euroml/annex02.html | title =European rules for the use of the IJ in public records |publisher=UA zone |accessdate=2012-07-19}}</ref> Note that the digraph \"ei\" in \"Eises\", like other digraphs in Dutch, is shortened to one letter.\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Bijna.png|thumb|The Dutch word \"bijna\" (almost, nearly) with ''ad hoc'' stress on the first syllable indicated by two acute accents on the digraph ''ij''.]]\nIn Dutch orthography, ''ad hoc'' indication of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] can be marked by placing an [[acute accent]] on the vowel of the stressed syllable. In case of a diphthong or double vowel, both vowels should be marked with an acute accent; this also applies to the ''IJ'' (even though ''J'' by itself is not a vowel, the digraph ''IJ'' represents one distinct vowel sound). However, due to technical limitations the accent on the ''j'' is often omitted in electronic documents: \"b\u00edjna\".<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/tekst/16/klemtoonteken_algemeen/ Klemtoonteken (algemeen)], Nederlandse Taalunie</ref> Nevertheless, in [[Unicode]] it is possible to [[Combining character|combine characters]] into a ''j'' with an acute accent{{snd}}\"b\u00edj\u0301na\" {{snd}}though this might not be supported or rendered correctly by some [[Computer font|fonts]] or systems. This ''j\u0301'' is the combination of the regular (soft-dotted) ''j'' (U+006A) and the combining acute accent &nbsp;\u0301 (U+0301).\n\n===Spelling===\n{{Lang|nl|Vrijdag}} can be spelled out in two ways, depending on whether the speller considers ''ij'' to be one letter or not:\n\n* ''V \u2013 R \u2013 IJ \u2013 D \u2013 A \u2013 G''\n* ''V \u2013 R \u2013 I \u2013 J \u2013 D \u2013 A \u2013 G''\n\n===Wide inter-letter spacing===\n[[File:Signboard-slijterij.jpg|thumb|upright|On this signboard of an alcohol store ({{Lang|nl|slijterij}}), IJ occupies the same space as single letters. The I is put over the lower end of the J to reinforce their unity, but this is optional and I and J can also be found separately on other signs]]\n\nWhen words are written with large inter-letter spacing, ''IJ'' is often, but not always, kept together. ''F&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;k&nbsp;r&nbsp;ij&nbsp;k'' or ''F&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;k&nbsp;r&nbsp;i&nbsp;j&nbsp;k''.\n\nWhen words are written from top to bottom, with non-rotated letters, ''IJ'' is usually, but not always, kept together. Keeping it together is the preferred way.<ref name=\"eu\"/>\n\n{| cellspacing=\"20\"\n|\n''F''<br />\n''r''<br />\n''a''<br />\n''n''<br />\n''k''<br />\n''r''<br />\n''ij''<br />\n''k''\n|or\n|\n''F''<br />\n''r''<br />\n''a''<br />\n''n''<br />\n''k''<br />\n''r''<br />\n''i''<br />\n''j''<br />\n''k''\n|}\n\n===Spelling of proper names===\nIn Dutch names, interchangeability of ''i'', ''ij'' and ''y'' is frequent. Some names are changed unofficially for commercial reasons or by indifference:\n\n* [[Johan Cruyff|Johan Cruijff/Cruyff]], former football player and manager\n* [[Ruud van Nistelrooy|Ruud van Nistelrooij/Nistelrooy]], football player\n* [[Piet Pieterszoon Hein|Piet Heijn/Heyn/Hein]], a [[Dutch West India Company]] admiral\n* [[Dirk Kuyt|Dirk Kuijt/Kuyt]], football player\n* [[Arie Luyendyk|Arie Luijendijk/Luyendyk]], a race-driver\n* [[Spyker|Spijker/Spyker]], car manufacturer\n* [[Anner Bylsma|Anner Bijlsma/Bylsma]], cellist\n\nThe Dutch football team of [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] changed its name from the original \"{{Lang|nl|Feijenoord|italic=unset}}\" to \"{{Lang|nl|Feyenoord|italic=unset}}\" after achieving international successes. This was done as a reaction to foreign people often mispronouncing the name. The [[Feijenoord district]] in [[Rotterdam]], where the team is from, still writes its name using the original ''ij''.\n\n===Phonetic Radio Alphabet===\nIn the Dutch phonetic [[radio alphabet]], the codeword {{Lang|nl|IJmuiden|italic=yes}} represents the ''IJ''. This is clearly different from the codeword ''Ypsilon'', which is used to represent the ''Y''. Dutch and Belgian armed forces use the official [[NATO phonetic alphabet]], \"Y\" is \"Yankee\" and \"IJ\" is spelled out \"India Juliett\".\n\n===Word games===\nIn [[crossword puzzle]]s (except for [[Scrabble]]{{snd}}see next paragraph), and in the game [[Lingo (Dutch game show)|Lingo]], ''IJ'' is considered one letter, filling one square, but the ''IJ'' and the ''Y'' are considered distinct. In other word games, the rules may vary.\n\nThe Dutch version of Scrabble has a ''Y'' with a face value of eight.  Some players used it to represent ''IJ'' or ''Y''. The recent Dutch version comes with an example game, which clearly indicates that ''Y'' is only ''Y'', and ''IJ'' should be composed of ''I'' and ''J''. In previous editions of Scrabble there was a single IJ sign.<!-- http://www.gtoal.com/wordgames/details/dutch/ is definitely incorrect - the face values differ too-->\n\nIn word games that make a distinction between vowels and consonants, ''IJ'' is considered to be a vowel, if it is considered one letter. Whether ''Y'' is a vowel or a consonant, is another matter of discussion, since ''Y'' can represent both a vowel or a (half-)consonant.\n\n==Technical details==\n===Print and handwriting===\n[[File:Amsterdamse tram - De Red Crosser - from Flickr 2838709455 cropped lijnbus.jpg|thumb|{{lang|nl|Lijnbus}} ([[public bus]], literally \"line bus\") road marking with IJ as a \"broken U\" glyph]]\nIn print, the letter ''\u00ff'' (lowercase [[y]] with [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and ''ij'' look very different, but [[handwriting]] usually makes  ''\u00ff'', ''ij'' and ''Y'', ''IJ'' look identical. However, since ''y'' occurs only in loanwords, the letter ''\u00ff'' is extremely rare (if not altogether nonexistent) in Dutch.\n\nThe ''long ij'' extends below the baseline and so is written with a long stroke. It is often written as a single sign, even in handwriting that does not join letters.\n\nOn some road signs in the Netherlands, ''IJ'' appears as a single glyph formed like a ''U'' with a break in the left-hand stroke.\n[[File:\u0132 uppercase ligature.svg|thumb|upright|Uppercase IJ glyph with the distinctive \"broken U\" [[Typographical ligature|ligature]] in a [[Helvetica]] font for [[Omega (TeX)|Omega TeX]]]]\n\n===Braille===\n[[Dutch Braille]], which is used in the Netherlands, has {{angbr|ij}} represented by {{bc|y}}, which represents {{angbr|y}} in other varieties of Braille. {{angbr|y}} is written as {{bc|6|y}}.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kim |last=Bols |url=http://www.kimbols.be/hulp/braille/brailleschrift.php |title=Het brailleschrift |publisher=Kimbols |place=[[Belgium|BE]] |access-date=2007-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209075837/http://kimbols.be/hulp/braille/brailleschrift.php |archive-date=2009-02-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, [[French Braille]] is used, in which {{angbr|ij}} is written simply as {{angbr|i}} + {{angbr|j}}: {{bc|i|j}}.\n\n===Encoding===\nThe Dutch ''ij'' is not present in the [[ASCII]] code, nor in any of the [[ISO 8859]] [[character encoding]]s.

The standard US layout (often in \"[[US-International|International Mode]]\") is widely used, although a specific but rarely used Dutch variant (KBD143) does exist. In Belgium, a specific Belgian variant of [[AZERTY]] keyboard layout (KBD120) is widely used. None of these keyboards feature a key for ''\u0133'' or ''\u0132''.\n\n==Not as a digraph==\n[[File:Bijoux fout gespeld.jpg|thumb|upright|This Dutch shopkeeper wrote 'byoux' instead of '{{Lang|fr|[[Bijou (jewellery)|bijoux]]|italic=unset}}<nowiki/>'.]]\nIf the ''i'' and the ''j'' belong to different syllables, such as in the mathematical term {{Lang|nl|[[bijection|bijectie]]}} (syllablised \"bi\u00b7jec\u00b7tie\"), they do not form a ligature or a single letter. Earlier statements about sorting ''ij'' on par with ''y'', keeping ''ij'' together in the [[kerning]] of printed texts, the single square in crossword puzzles, etc., do not apply.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Bettencourt_2016\">{{cite web |author-first=Rebecca G. |author-last=Bettencourt |title=Character Encodings - Legacy Encodings - Atari ST |publisher=Kreative Korporation |date=2016-08-01 |orig-year=1999 |url=http://www.kreativekorp.com/charset/encoding.php?name=Atari+ST |access-date=2016-08-09 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Lehmann_AtariST\">{{cite web |author-first1=Kosta |author-last1=Kostis |author-first2=Alexander |author-last2=Lehmann |title=Atari ST/TT Character Encoding |version=1.56 |url=http://www.kostis.net/charsets/atarist.htm |access-date=2017-01-16 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116124907/http://www.kostis.net/charsets/atarist.htm |archive-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ATARIWIKI\">{{cite web |title=Atari Wiki - The Atari character set |url=http://www.atari-wiki.com/index.php/The_Atari_character_set |access-date=2017-01-16 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116130251/http://www.atari-wiki.com/index.php/The_Atari_character_set |archive-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ASCII-CA_ST_2006\">{{cite web |title=Codepages / Ascii Table Atari ST/TT Character Encoding |publisher=ASCII.ca |date=2016 |orig-year=2006 |url=http://www.ascii.ca/atarist.htm |access-date=2017-01-16 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116125230/http://www.ascii.ca/atarist.htm |archive-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Unicode_2016_AtariST\">{{cite web |author-first1=Philippe |author-last1=Verdy |author-first2=Bruno |author-last2=Haible |author-first3=Ulf |author-last3=Zibis |author-first4=Yves-Marie K. |author-last4=Rinquin |orig-year=1998 |date=2015-10-08 |version=1.3 |title=AtariST to Unicode |url=ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MISC/ATARIST.TXT |access-date=2016-12-09 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Flohr_2016_Atari-ST\">{{cite web |title=Locale::RecodeData::ATARI_ST - Conversion routines for ATARI-ST |author-first=Guido |author-last=Flohr |version=1.1 |work=[[CPAN]] libintl-perl |date=2016 |orig-year=2006<!-- 2002 --> |url=http://search.cpan.org/~guido/libintl-perl/lib/Locale/RecodeData/ATARI_ST.pm |access-date=2017-01-14 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114223110/http://search.cpan.org/~guido/libintl-perl/lib/Locale/RecodeData/ATARI_ST.pm |archive-date=2017-01-14}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"vt220_pr\">{{cite web |url=http://vt100.net/docs/vt220-rm/ |title=VT220 Programmer Reference Manual |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1984 |orig-year=1983 |edition=2}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"IBM_CP1102\">{{cite web |title=SBCS code page information - CPGID: 01102 / Name: Dutch NRC Set |work=IBM Software: Globalization: Coded character sets and related resources: Code pages by CPGID: Code page identifiers |date=1992-10-01 |version=1 |publisher=[[IBM]] |url=https://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/cp/cp01102.html |access-date=2016-12-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205040334/https://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/cp/cp01102.html |archive-date=2016-12-05}} [https://www-03.ibm.com/systems/resources/systems_i_software_globalization_pdf_cp01102z.pdf<!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20161205115943/https://www-03.ibm.com/systems/resources/systems_i_software_globalization_pdf_cp01102z.pdf -->] [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/globalization/gcoc/attachments/CP01102.pdf] [ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/globalization/gcoc/attachments/CP01102.txt]</ref>\n<ref name=\"LMB-EXCP\">{{cite web |title=lmb-excp.ucm |work=megadaddeln / icu_chrome |orig-year=1995 |date=2010 |url=https://gitlab.q3df.org/megadaddeln/icu_chrome/blob/caccda5a040f058024da1c2d894f8914cfc40618/source/data/mappings/lmb-excp.ucm |access-date=2016-12-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206172112/https://gitlab.q3df.org/megadaddeln/icu_chrome/blob/caccda5a040f058024da1c2d894f8914cfc40618/source/data/mappings/lmb-excp.ucm |archive-date=2016-12-06}} [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/deps/icu52/+/52e8245ce532b9ea3d28c91bf04e3265392cb959/source/data/mappings/lmb-excp.ucm<!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20161211125825/https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/deps/icu52/+/52e8245ce532b9ea3d28c91bf04e3265392cb959/source/data/mappings/lmb-excp.ucm -->]</ref>\n<ref name=\"Lotus_1989_RM31\">{{cite book |title=Lotus 1-2-3 Version 3.1 Referenzhandbuch |language=German |trans-title=Lotus 1-2-3 Version 3.1 Reference Manual |edition=1 |chapter=Anhang 2.

The holders of the position were, traditionally, the daughters or sometimes the sons of a celebrity, and as a point of pride, these often continued to be contested among celebrity parents.<ref name=\"New York Times 5 January 2018\">{{cite news|last1=Harel|first1=Monica Corcoran|title=Miss Golden Globe Is No More.

The New York firm [[Society Awards]] collaborated for a year with the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] to produce a statuette that included a unique marble and enhanced the statuette's quality and gold content.

The most prominent beneficiary is the [[Young Artist Award]]s, presented annually by the [[Young Artist Foundation]], established in 1978 by Hollywood Foreign Press member [[Maureen Dragone]], to recognize and award excellence of young [[Hollywood]] performers under the age of 21 and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically or financially challenged.<ref name=\"Golden Globes2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hfpa.org/|title=HFPA Golden Globes \u2013 Young Artist Foundation|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=hfpa.org}}</ref><ref name=\"ABC Local\">{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&id=7380555|title=KABC-TV \u2013 Budding stars shine at Young Artist Awards|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=ABCLocal.go.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629023941/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news%2Fentertainment&id=7380555|archive-date=June 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Young Artist Awards 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/presidents.html|title=Young Artist Awards \u2013 President's Message|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=YoungArtistAwards.org}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n===Eligibility===\nThe qualifying eligibility period for all nominations is the calendar year from January 1 through December 31.<ref name=\"GGRules\">{{cite web | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/04/HFPA-Golden-Globe-Awards-Eligibility-Descriptions-Effective-2-1-15.pdf | title=Golden Globe Award Consideration Rules | publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association | accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nVoice-over performances and cameo appearances in which persons play themselves are disqualified from all of the film and TV acting categories.\n\nFilms must be at least 70 minutes and released for at least a seven-day run in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], starting prior to midnight on December 31. Films can be released in theaters, on [[pay-per-view]], or by digital delivery.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category, films do not need to be released in the United States. At least 51 percent of the dialogue must be in a language other than English, and they must first be released in their country of origin during a 14-month period from November 1 to December 31 prior to the Awards. However, if a film was not released in its country of origin due to censorship, it can still qualify if it had a one-week release in the United States during the qualifying calendar year. There is no limit to the number of submitted films from a given country.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nA TV program must air in the United States between the [[prime time]] hours of 8:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00 p.m (or 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00 p.m on Sundays). A show can air on [[broadcast television]], on basic or premium cable, or by digital delivery; it does not qualify if it is only on pay-per-view or via digital delivery of film. Also, a TV show must either be made in the United States or be a co-production financially and creatively between an American and a foreign production company. Furthermore, [[Reality television|reality]] and non-scripted shows are disqualified.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor a [[television film]], it cannot be entered in both the film and TV categories, and instead should be entered based on its original release format. If it was first aired on American television, then it can be entered into the TV categories. If it was released in theaters or on pay-per-view, then it should instead be entered into the film categories. A film festival showing does not count towards disqualifying what would otherwise be a TV program.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nActors in a TV series must appear in at least six episodes during the qualifying calendar year. Actors in a TV film or miniseries must appear in at least five percent of the time in that TV film or miniseries.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\n===Screening requirements===\nActive HFPA members need to be invited to an official screening of each eligible film directly by its respective distributor or publicist. The screening must take place in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], either before the film's release or up to one week afterwards. The screening can be a regular screening in a theater with the public or a press screening; it does not need to be an HFPA member-only event. The screening must also be cleared with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] so there are not scheduling conflicts with other official screenings.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor TV programs, they must merely be available to be seen by HFPA members in any common format, including the original TV broadcast.\n\n===Nominations and voting===\nEntry forms for films need to be received by the HFPA within ten days of the official screening. TV programs should be submitted \"as early as possible\" before the deadline.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nAs part of their regular journalistic jobs, active HFPA members will participate in covering the press conferences, and interviewing cast members, of selected films and TV programs. The film press conferences need to take place either before the film's release in the Greater Los Angeles area or up to one week afterwards.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nBallots to select the nominations are sent to HFPA members in November, along with a \"Reminder List\" of eligible film and TV programs.<ref name=\"GGTime\">{{cite web | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/award-rules\u2022entry-forms | title=Award Rules And Entry Forms | publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association | accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref> Each HFPA member then votes for their top five choices in each category, numbering them 5 to 1, with 5 being their top choice.

Since 2010, it was televised live in all United States time zones. Until [[Ricky Gervais]] hosted in 2010, the award ceremony was one of two major [[Hollywood]] award ceremonies (the other being the [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s) that did not have a regular host; every year a different presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast. Gervais returned to host the 68th and 69th Golden Globe Awards the next two years.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=84317|title=Ricky Gervais to Return as Golden Globes Host!|accessdate=2011-11-16 |date= 2011-11-16|publisher=ComingSoon.net}}</ref> [[Tina Fey]] and [[Amy Poehler]] hosted the 70th, 71st and 72nd Golden Globe Awards in 2013 through 2015. The Golden Globe Awards' theme song, which debuted in 2012, was written by Japanese musician and songwriter [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki Hayashi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSince 1993, [[Dick Clark Productions]] has produced the ceremony with [[NBC]] as broadcaster; its involvement came at a time of instability for the Golden Globes, including reduced credibility and having lost its contract with [[CBS]] (the interim period saw it contract with cable network [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] to air the ceremony). Enthusiastic over Clark's commitment, the HFPA's contract contained an unusual provision granting Dick Clark Productions the role of producer in perpetuity, as long as it continued to maintain a broadcast rights deal for the ceremony with NBC.<ref name=\"thr-dcpsuit\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Dick Clark Productions reached an extension with NBC through 2018. However, the deal was negotiated without the HFPA's knowledge. The HFPA sued DCP over the deal, as well as claims that the company was attempting to sell digital rights that it did not hold; the HFPA had wanted a new contract that would grant them a larger share of revenue from the telecast. In April 2012, judge [[Howard Matz]] upheld the NBC perpetuity clause and ruled in favor of DCP, noting that the HFPA had a history of \"unbusiness-like display[s] of misplaced priorities\" and \"[succumbing] to bouts of pronounced turmoil and personal feuds\", in contrast to DCP, which had been \"represented by one experienced executive who was adept at dealing fairly and effectively with the often amateurish conduct of HFPA.\" Matz pointed out examples of the HFPA's enthusiasm over the relationship and their desire to \"not get cancelled\", such as having disregarded its own bylaws by approving an extension in 2001 without a formal vote. The case was taken to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.<ref name=\"thr-dcpsuit\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/dick-clark-productions-prevails-golden-318099|title=Dick Clark Productions Prevails in Golden Globes Trial, Will Remain Show Producer|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Dick Clark Productions and the HFPA reached a settlement; details were not released, but DCP committed to continue its role as producer through at least the end of its current contract with NBC, and to work with the HFPA to \"expand the brand with unique and exciting entertainment experiences\".

While NBC was initially intended to be the exclusive broadcaster of the press conference, the HFPA ultimately allowed other broadcasters to air it. The decision prompted broadcasts from [[CNN]], as well as [[E!]] and [[TV Guide Network]] (who aired pre- and post-show analysis, downsized from their typical red carpet coverage of major awards shows). Ultimately, NBC did not air the live, 32-minute press conference, and instead aired an hour-long [[NBC News]] special where ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' hosts [[Billy Bush]] and [[Nancy O'Dell]] relayed the results over an hour with commercials.<ref name=\"CTribune\">{{cite web |url= http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2008/01/golden-globes.html|title= Golden Globes winners?

in 1958, then nationally in 1964. However, in 1968, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] claimed the show \"misled the public as to how the winners were determined\" (allegations included that winners were determined by lobby; to motivate winners to show up to the awards ceremony winners were informed if they did not attend another winner would be named). The FCC admonished NBC for participating in the scandal.

The eligibility period for the Golden Globes corresponds to the calendar year (i.e. January 1 through December 31). The [[77th Golden Globe Awards]], honoring the best in film and television in 2019, were held on January 5, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/2020-golden-globes-get-airdate-nbc-1194965|title=2020 Golden Globes Get Airdate on NBC|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[1st Golden Globe Awards]], honoring the best achievements in [[1943 in film|1943 filmmaking]], were held in January 1944, at the [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] studios. Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including [[the Beverly Hills Hotel]] and the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]].\n\nIn 1950, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association made the decision to establish a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry. Recognizing its subject as an international figure within the entertainment industry, the first award was presented to director and producer, [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. The official name of the award thus became the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]].<ref name=\"Cecil B. deMille Award\">{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/cecil-b-demille-award-0|title=The Cecil B. deMille Award| accessdate= | work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher = Hollywood Foreign Press Association}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1963, the trophies commenced to be handed out by one or more persons (exclusively female at first) referred to as \"Miss Golden Globe\", a title renamed on January 5, 2018 to \"[[Golden Globe Ambassador]]\". The holders of the position were, traditionally, the daughters or sometimes the sons of a celebrity, and as a point of pride, these often continued to be contested among celebrity parents.<ref name=\"New York Times 5 January 2018\">{{cite news|last1=Harel|first1=Monica Corcoran|title=Miss Golden Globe Is No More.

The New York firm [[Society Awards]] collaborated for a year with the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] to produce a statuette that included a unique marble and enhanced the statuette's quality and gold content. It was unveiled at a press conference at the Beverly Hilton prior to the show.<ref name=\"Golden Globe Statuette\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-503683_162-4707856.html|title=New Look For Golden Globe Statuette\n|accessdate=2012-12-27|work=cbsnews.com}}</ref>\n\nRevenues generated from the annual ceremony have enabled the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to donate millions of dollars to entertainment-related charities, as well as funding scholarships and other programs for future film and television professionals. The most prominent beneficiary is the [[Young Artist Award]]s, presented annually by the [[Young Artist Foundation]], established in 1978 by Hollywood Foreign Press member [[Maureen Dragone]], to recognize and award excellence of young [[Hollywood]] performers under the age of 21 and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically or financially challenged.<ref name=\"Golden Globes2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hfpa.org/|title=HFPA Golden Globes \u2013 Young Artist Foundation|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=hfpa.org}}</ref><ref name=\"ABC Local\">{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&id=7380555|title=KABC-TV \u2013 Budding stars shine at Young Artist Awards|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=ABCLocal.go.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629023941/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news%2Fentertainment&id=7380555|archive-date=June 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Young Artist Awards 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/presidents.html|title=Young Artist Awards \u2013 President's Message|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=YoungArtistAwards.org}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n===Eligibility===\nThe qualifying eligibility period for all nominations is the calendar year from January 1 through December 31.<ref name=\"GGRules\">{{cite web | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/04/HFPA-Golden-Globe-Awards-Eligibility-Descriptions-Effective-2-1-15.pdf | title=Golden Globe Award Consideration Rules | publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association | accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nVoice-over performances and cameo appearances in which persons play themselves are disqualified from all of the film and TV acting categories.\n\nFilms must be at least 70 minutes and released for at least a seven-day run in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], starting prior to midnight on December 31. Films can be released in theaters, on [[pay-per-view]], or by digital delivery.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category, films do not need to be released in the United States. At least 51 percent of the dialogue must be in a language other than English, and they must first be released in their country of origin during a 14-month period from November 1 to December 31 prior to the Awards. However, if a film was not released in its country of origin due to censorship, it can still qualify if it had a one-week release in the United States during the qualifying calendar year. There is no limit to the number of submitted films from a given country.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nA TV program must air in the United States between the [[prime time]] hours of 8:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00 p.m (or 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00 p.m on Sundays). A show can air on [[broadcast television]], on basic or premium cable, or by digital delivery; it does not qualify if it is only on pay-per-view or via digital delivery of film. Also, a TV show must either be made in the United States or be a co-production financially and creatively between an American and a foreign production company. Furthermore, [[Reality television|reality]] and non-scripted shows are disqualified.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor a [[television film]], it cannot be entered in both the film and TV categories, and instead should be entered based on its original release format. If it was first aired on American television, then it can be entered into the TV categories. If it was released in theaters or on pay-per-view, then it should instead be entered into the film categories. A film festival showing does not count towards disqualifying what would otherwise be a TV program.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nActors in a TV series must appear in at least six episodes during the qualifying calendar year. Actors in a TV film or miniseries must appear in at least five percent of the time in that TV film or miniseries.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\n===Screening requirements===\nActive HFPA members need to be invited to an official screening of each eligible film directly by its respective distributor or publicist. The screening must take place in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], either before the film's release or up to one week afterwards. The screening can be a regular screening in a theater with the public or a press screening; it does not need to be an HFPA member-only event. The screening must also be cleared with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] so there are not scheduling conflicts with other official screenings.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor TV programs, they must merely be available to be seen by HFPA members in any common format, including the original TV broadcast.\n\n===Nominations and voting===\nEntry forms for films need to be received by the HFPA within ten days of the official screening. TV programs should be submitted \"as early as possible\" before the deadline.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nAs part of their regular journalistic jobs, active HFPA members will participate in covering the press conferences, and interviewing cast members, of selected films and TV programs. The film press conferences need to take place either before the film's release in the Greater Los Angeles area or up to one week afterwards.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nBallots to select the nominations are sent to HFPA members in November, along with a \"Reminder List\" of eligible film and TV programs.<ref name=\"GGTime\">{{cite web | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/award-rules\u2022entry-forms | title=Award Rules And Entry Forms | publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association | accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref> Each HFPA member then votes for their top five choices in each category, numbering them 5 to 1, with 5 being their top choice.

Since 2010, it was televised live in all United States time zones. Until [[Ricky Gervais]] hosted in 2010, the award ceremony was one of two major [[Hollywood]] award ceremonies (the other being the [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s) that did not have a regular host; every year a different presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast. Gervais returned to host the 68th and 69th Golden Globe Awards the next two years.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=84317|title=Ricky Gervais to Return as Golden Globes Host!|accessdate=2011-11-16 |date= 2011-11-16|publisher=ComingSoon.net}}</ref> [[Tina Fey]] and [[Amy Poehler]] hosted the 70th, 71st and 72nd Golden Globe Awards in 2013 through 2015. The Golden Globe Awards' theme song, which debuted in 2012, was written by Japanese musician and songwriter [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki Hayashi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSince 1993, [[Dick Clark Productions]] has produced the ceremony with [[NBC]] as broadcaster; its involvement came at a time of instability for the Golden Globes, including reduced credibility and having lost its contract with [[CBS]] (the interim period saw it contract with cable network [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] to air the ceremony). Enthusiastic over Clark's commitment, the HFPA's contract contained an unusual provision granting Dick Clark Productions the role of producer in perpetuity, as long as it continued to maintain a broadcast rights deal for the ceremony with NBC.<ref name=\"thr-dcpsuit\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Dick Clark Productions reached an extension with NBC through 2018. However, the deal was negotiated without the HFPA's knowledge. The HFPA sued DCP over the deal, as well as claims that the company was attempting to sell digital rights that it did not hold; the HFPA had wanted a new contract that would grant them a larger share of revenue from the telecast. In April 2012, judge [[Howard Matz]] upheld the NBC perpetuity clause and ruled in favor of DCP, noting that the HFPA had a history of \"unbusiness-like display[s] of misplaced priorities\" and \"[succumbing] to bouts of pronounced turmoil and personal feuds\", in contrast to DCP, which had been \"represented by one experienced executive who was adept at dealing fairly and effectively with the often amateurish conduct of HFPA.\" Matz pointed out examples of the HFPA's enthusiasm over the relationship and their desire to \"not get cancelled\", such as having disregarded its own bylaws by approving an extension in 2001 without a formal vote. The case was taken to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.<ref name=\"thr-dcpsuit\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/dick-clark-productions-prevails-golden-318099|title=Dick Clark Productions Prevails in Golden Globes Trial, Will Remain Show Producer|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Dick Clark Productions and the HFPA reached a settlement; details were not released, but DCP committed to continue its role as producer through at least the end of its current contract with NBC, and to work with the HFPA to \"expand the brand with unique and exciting entertainment experiences\".

While NBC was initially intended to be the exclusive broadcaster of the press conference, the HFPA ultimately allowed other broadcasters to air it. The decision prompted broadcasts from [[CNN]], as well as [[E!]] and [[TV Guide Network]] (who aired pre- and post-show analysis, downsized from their typical red carpet coverage of major awards shows).
