The same \"Steffie\" mold was used for Cool Times Midge in 1989. In 1990, she began to use the \"Diva\" mold for All Stars Midge and The Beat Midge. In 1991 she was married to Allan (now spelled \"Alan\"). Before and after the Wedding Day Midge doll was sold, many Midge play line dolls were produced. Before Wedding Day Midge, Midge dolls still had freckles, but up until Hawaii Midge was sold in 1999, the dolls lacked freckles.

With this, her canon has been changed extensively, and she is a teenager who is retro at heart and still uses old-fangled terms. The whole 'Happy Family' canon has been dropped altogether due to controversy. Two Midge dolls were released in 2013, one is as part of a collectors set with Barbie, and the other on her own in the Life in the Dreamhouse doll line.\n\nThe year after Midge and Alan were married, a picture of the couple with twin babies was shown in a pamphlet, but the dolls were never produced.<ref name=\"kattisdollsmidge\"/>  However, in 2003, she and Alan were re-introduced with a family consisting of them and three different kids, three-year-old Ryan, and newborn baby Nikki. This was known as the \"Happy Family\" line, and was similar to the discontinued Heart Family line of the 1980s. The dolls came in both [[European American]] and [[African American]] versions. This was the first time an African American Midge was ever produced.<ref name=\"kattisdollsmidge\"/>\n\nMidge was sold \"pregnant\" with Nikki, who was a tiny baby inside Midge's magnetic removable womb.

Midge's new baby was later named Cassandra. Midge has two known parents who are simply called \"Grandpa\" and \"Grandma\". At first, the [[grandparent]] dolls were sold together as part of a big set consisting of the dolls and a kitchen play set, but for Nikki's first birthday they were sold separately. Midge, Alan, and Ryan gave Nikki a dog for her birthday. They too came in both Caucasian and African American versions.

Two Midge dolls were released in 2013, one is as part of a collectors set with Barbie, and the other on her own in the Life in the Dreamhouse doll line.\n\n==\"Happy Family\" line==\nThe year after Midge and Alan were married, a picture of the couple with twin babies was shown in a pamphlet, but the dolls were never produced.<ref name=\"kattisdollsmidge\"/>  However, in 2003, she and Alan were re-introduced with a family consisting of them and three different kids, three-year-old Ryan, and newborn baby Nikki. This was known as the \"Happy Family\" line, and was similar to the discontinued Heart Family line of the 1980s. The dolls came in both [[European American]] and [[African American]] versions. This was the first time an African American Midge was ever produced.<ref name=\"kattisdollsmidge\"/>\n\nMidge was sold \"pregnant\" with Nikki, who was a tiny baby inside Midge's magnetic removable womb. This led to some controversy with some consumers saying that the doll was inappropriate for children, or that it promoted teen pregnancy. Another cause for this controversy was that Midge did not initially have a wedding ring, but this was later fixed. She also was packaged without Alan. Customers complaining about the doll led to [[Wal-Mart]] pulling the Happy Family line off their shelves.<ref name= midgecontroversy>{{cite news | author= usatoday.com| title= \"Pregnant\" Midge controversy| work= USA Today| url= https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2002-12-24-pregnant-doll_x.htm |accessdate=March 23, 2007| date=December 25, 2002}}</ref>  A new version of this Midge was produced for Wal-Mart, this time not pregnant and with a cardboard cut-out display of Alan and Ryan standing next to her inside the box.<ref name= happyfamilymidge>{{cite web | author= manbehindthedoll.com| title= Information on the Happy Family line| work= | url= http://www.manbehindthedoll.com/FA030105.htm |accessdate=March 12, 2007 }}</ref> The Happy Family Line included everything from a talking house, a backyard swimming pool, neighborhood market, and playground.\n\nLater, around Nikki's first birthday, Midge was \"pregnant\" again with another child, who wasn't named or given a specific gender, as the gender was a surprise when the owner opened the doll's box. Midge's new baby was later named Cassandra. Midge has two known parents who are simply called \"Grandpa\" and \"Grandma\". At first, the [[grandparent]] dolls were sold together as part of a big set consisting of the dolls and a kitchen play set, but for Nikki's first birthday they were sold separately. Midge, Alan, and Ryan gave Nikki a dog for her birthday. They too came in both Caucasian and African American versions. They use different body molds, to reflect their age.<ref name=\"kattisdollsmidge\"/>\n\n==Head Molds==\n*Midge's first appearance was made with her own headmold, Vintage Midge\n*in 1964 and 1965 the Japanese exclusive \u201cnew midge\u201d face mould is released and is only offered in Japan these dolls are heavily sought out by collectors today\n*Later, we have Midge using DIVA (by Barbie and the Rockers) headmold\n*Before Teresa made her debut, Midge used Steffie headmold\n*Midge comes and goes so many times, but with her 50th birthday, she returns with the Steffie headmold\n*There are two different versions of the Florida Vacation Midge. One uses the Mackie Headmold while another version uses the Diva sculpt.\n\n==Trivia==\nMidge appears in the web series, [[Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse]] in the episode, \u2018A Smidge of Midge\u2019.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Barbie}}\n{{good article}}\n\n[[Category:Barbie]]\n[[Category:Playscale figures]]\n[[Category:Fictional models]]\n[[Category:Toy controversies]]\n", "name_user": "99.242.48.114", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midge_(Barbie)"}

As soon as human societies came into existence, so did [[economic activity]]. Earliest humans were hunter gatherers living in small, family groups. Even then there was considerable trade that could cover long distances. Archaeologists have found that evidence of trade in luxury items like metals and shells across the entirety of the continent were the main trades of the [[Berber people]], lived in dry areas and became nomadic herders, while in the [[savannah]] grasslands, cultivated crops and thus permanent settlement were possible. Agriculture supported large towns, and eventually large trade networks developed between the towns.\n\n===Origins of agriculture===\nThe first agriculture in Africa began in the heart of the [[Sahara Desert]], which in 5200 BC was far more moist and densely populated than today. Several native species were domesticated, most importantly [[pearl millet]], [[sorghum]] and [[cowpea]]s, which spread through [[West Africa]] and the [[Sahel]]. The Sahara at this time was like the Sahel today. Its wide open fields made cultivation easy, but the poor soil and limited rain made intensive farming impossible. The local crops were also not ideal and produced fewer calories than those of other regions. These factors limited surpluses and kept populations sparse and scattered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[North Africa]] took a very different route from the southern regions. Climatically it is linked to the [[Middle East]] and the [[Fertile Crescent]], and the agricultural techniques of that region were adopted wholesale. This included a different set of crops, such as [[wheat]], [[barley]], and [[grapes]]. North Africa was also blessed by one of the richest agricultural regions in the world in the [[Nile River]] valley. With the arrival of agriculture, the Nile region became one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] home to one of the first civilizations.\n\nThe drying of the Sahara created a formidable barrier between the northern and southern portions of the continent. Two important exceptions were Nubian [[Sudan]], which was linked to Egypt by the Nile and [[Ethiopia]], which could trade with the northern regions over the [[Red Sea]]. Powerful states grew up in these regions such as [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] in Nubia (modern day Northern Sudan and Southern Egypt) and [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]] in Ethiopia. Especially from Nubia, ideas and technologies from the Middle East and Europe reached the rest of Africa.\n\nHistorians believe that iron working  developed independently in Africa. Unlike other continents Africa did not have a period of [[copper]] and [[bronze]] working before their [[Iron Age]]. Copper is quite rare in Africa while iron is quite common. In Nubia and Ethiopia, iron, trade, and agricultural surpluses lead to the establishment of cities and civilizations.\n\n===The Bantu expansion===\n{{Further|Bantu expansion}}\n\nOrdinarily, in the sparsely populated areas, this same period saw the expansion of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] speaking peoples. The [[Bantu expansion]] began in Southern Cameroon around 4000 years ago. Bantu languages are spoken there today and there is archaeological evidence for incoming Neolithic farmers in Northern Gabon c. 3800 BC. It is known that Bantu expansion was extremely rapid and massive, but its exact engine remains controversial. This period predated iron, which appears in the archaeological record by 2500 BC.\n\nOne of the early expansions of Bantu was the migration of the [[Bubi people|Bubi]] to [[Fernando Po (Bioko)]]. They were still using [[stone technology]] at first. The difficulties of cutting down the equatorial forest for farming have led to the suggestion that the primary expansion was along river valleys, a hypothesis supported by studies of fish names. Another factor may have been the arrival of southeast-Asian food crops, notably the [[AAB plantain]], the [[Taro|cocoyam]] and the [[water-yam]].

Sometime in the first millennium, an equally important change began as crops began to arrive from [[Southeast Asia]]. The [[Indian Ocean]] has always been far more open to trade than the turbulent [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]]. Traders could ride the [[monsoon]] winds west early in the year and return east on them later. It is guessed that these crops first arrived in [[Madagascar]], which also adopted Southeast Asian languages, sometime between AD 300 and 800. From the island, the crops crossed to African Great Lakes region. They included many crops, the most important being the [[banana]].\n\nThe banana and other crops allowed for more intensive cultivation in the tropical regions of Africa, this was most notable in the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] region, and area with excellent soil, that saw many cities and states form, their populations being fed largely\n\n==Trade routes==\n[[File:Endubis.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Aksumite currency|Aksumite gold coin]] of [[Endubis]].]]\n[[File:Trans-Saharan routes early.svg|thumb|350px|Early trans-[[Sahara Desert|Saharan]] trade routes.]]\nWhile some level of trade had been ongoing, the rise of cities and empires made it far more central to the African economy. North Africa was central to the trade of the entire [[Mediterranean]] region. Outside of Egypt, this trade was mostly controlled by the [[Phoenicians]] who came to dominate North Africa, with [[Carthage]] becoming their most important city. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] controlled much of the eastern trade, including along the Red Sea with Ethiopia. In this region a number of Greek trading cities that were established acted as a conduit for their civilization and learning.\n\nThe Egyptian (and later, [[Roman Empire|Roman]]) city of [[Alexandria]] (founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in 334 BC), was one of the hubs for Mediterranean trade for many centuries. Well into the 19th century Egypt remained one of the most developed parts of the world.\n\n[[Nubia]] in Sudan likewise traded with interior African countries such as Chad and Libya, as well as with Egypt, China, India and the Arabian peninsula.\n\nFor most of the 1st millennium AD, the [[Axumite Kingdom]] in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]] had a powerful navy and trading links reaching as far as the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[India]]. Between the 14th and 17th centuries, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] centered in modern-day [[Somalia]] practiced [[hydraulic engineering]] and developed new systems for [[agriculture]] and [[taxation]], which continued to be used in parts of the [[Horn of Africa]] as late as the 19th century.\n\nOn the east coast of the continent [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders linked the region into an Indian Ocean trading network, bringing imports of [[China|Chinese]] pottery and [[India]]n fabrics in exchange for gold, [[ivory trade|ivory]], and slaves. [[Swahili culture|Swahili Kingdoms]] created a prosperous trade empire, where occupied the territory of modern-day [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]]. Swahili cities were important trading ports for trade with the Middle East and Far East.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wonders/Episodes/Epi2/2_wondr2.htm Wonders of the African World: The Swahili People]</ref>\n\nIn the interior of Africa, trade was far more limited. Low population densities made profitable commerce difficult. The massive barrier of the [[Congo Basin|Congo]] rainforests were more imposing than the Sahara, blocking trade through the center of the continent.\n\nIt was the arrival of the [[Islam]]ic armies that transformed the economies of much of Africa. Though Islam had comparatively little impact on North Africa where large cities, literacy, and centralized states had been the norm, Muslims were far more effective at penetrating the Sahara than Christians had been. This was largely due to the [[camel]], which had carried the Arab expansion and would soon after carry large amounts of trade across the desert.\n\nA series of states developed in the [[Sahel]] on the southern edge of the Sahara which made immense profits from trading across the Sahara. The first of these was the [[Kingdom of Ghana]], reaching it peak in the 12th century. Soon, others such as the [[Mali Empire]] and [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], also arose in the region. The main trade of these states was [[gold]], which was plentiful in [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]. Also important was the [[trans-Saharan slave trade]] that shipped large numbers of slaves to North Africa.\n\n===600\u20131600 AD===\n[[File:Manillaokhapo.JPG|thumb|An Okpoho variety of Manilla from the [[Igbo people]] of southeastern [[Nigeria]].]]\nMany wealthy empires grew around coastal areas or large rivers that served as part of important trade routes.

Portuguese prince [[Henry the Navigator]] advanced Portuguese exploration of Africa, driven by two desires: to spread Christianity, and to establish Africa as a bastion of Christianity against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was making many African converts to Islam. Africa was exploited for commercial purposes because of another Portuguese goal: to find a route to India, which would open the entire Indian Ocean region to direct trade with Portugal. Conquest of territory in Africa also meant that the Portuguese could use African gold to finance travel along this new trade route.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irele, F.

This trade was primarily for the same commodities the Arabs had bought\u2014gold, ivory, and slaves. The Portuguese sold the Africans Indian cloth and European manufactured goods but refused to sell them guns. Soon, however, other European powers such as [[France]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] were developing their own trade with Africa, and they had fewer restrictions. The major European imperial powers in Africa were Portugal, Great Britain, France, and to a lesser extent Germany, Belgium, Spain and Italy. Portugal's presence in Africa as an imperial power lasted until the 1970s, when the last of its former colonies declared independence after years of war.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean had long been all but impenetrable to the [[galley]]s that plied the Mediterranean. That any ship needed to pass thousands of kilometers of waterless desert before reaching any populated regions also made trade impossible. These barriers were overcome by the development of the [[caravel]] in Europe. Previously, trade with Sub-Saharan Africa could only be conducted through North African middlemen. Now Europeans could trade directly with the Africans themselves.\n\nThis valuable trade lead to rapid change in West Africa. The region had long been agriculturally productive and, especially in western Nigeria, densely populated. The massive profits from trade and the arrival of guns lead to significant centralization and a number of states formed in the region such as the [[Ashanti Confederacy]] and [[Kingdom of Benin]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} These states became some of the wealthiest and most advanced in Africa. Wealthy merchants began to send their children to European universities and their well armed standing armies could challenge European forces.\n\nMany West-African natives, such as [[Seedies and Kroomen]], served on European ships, and received regular pay, which greatly enhanced their status back home.\n\n===Atlantic slave trade===\n{{further|Atlantic slave trade}}\nClearly, the slave trade enriched the segments of African society that traded in slaves{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. However, the modern historiography of slavery has swung between two poles on the question of its demographic and economic effects on Africa as a whole. Early historical accounts of the Atlantic slave trade were largely written for a popular audience by abolitionists and former slaves like [[Olaudah Equiano]] who emphasized its profoundly negative effects on African peoples. As the 19th century progressed, accounts of the negative impact of slavery were increasingly used to argue for European colonization of the continent. Conversely, there were those, like the British explorer and geographer William Winwood Reade, who drew on the accounts of slave traders to argue that the effects of slavery were positive.<ref>See Reade 1864.</ref>\n\nBy the early 20th century, the view of slavery as a negative influence on Africa prevailed among professional academic historians in Europe and the United States. During the decolonization period following World War II, an influential group of scholars, led by J.D. Fage, argued that the negative effects of slavery had been exaggerated, and that the export of slaves had been offset by population growth. [[Walter Rodney]], a specialist on the Upper Guinea Coast, countered that European demand for slaves had vastly increased the economic importance of the slave trade in West Africa, with catastrophic effects. Rodney, who was active in Pan-African independence movements, accused Fage of whitewashing the role of Europeans in Africa; Fage responded by accusing Rodney of nationalist romanticism.<ref>For a summary of the Fage-Rodney debate, see Inikori 1982, pp. 74\u201399.</ref>\n\nDebates on the economic impacts of the Atlantic trade were further stimulated by the publication of Philip Curtin's ''The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census'' (1969), which argued that 9.566 million slaves were exported from Africa through the Atlantic trade. In the 1970s, the debate on the economic impacts of the Atlantic trade increasingly turned on demographic estimates of slave exports in relation to continental birth rates. Most scholars now believe that Curtin was too conservative in his calculation, with most estimates ranging between 11.5 million to 15.4 million.<ref>See Curtin 1972, Lovejoy 1983, Inikori and Engerman 1992</ref> More recently, John K. Thornton has presented an argument closer to that of Fage, while Joseph Inikori, Patrick Manning and [[Nathan Nunn]] have argued that the slave trade had a long-term debilitating impact on African economic development.<ref>See Thornton 1998, Inikori 1982, Inikori 1992, Manning 1990, Nunn 2008.</ref>\n\nManning, for example, arrived at the following conclusion, after accounting for regional variations in slave exports and assuming an annual African population growth rate of 0.5.%: the population of Africa would have been 100 million rather than 50 million in 1850, if not for the combined effects of the external and internal slave trades.<ref>Manning 1990, p. 85</ref> Nunn, in a recent econometric analysis of slave-exporting regions in all parts of Africa, found \"a robust negative relationship between the number of slaves taken from a country and its subsequent economic development.\"<ref>Nunn, 2008, p. 168</ref> Nunn argues, moreover, that this cannot be explained by poverty prior to the slave trade, because more densely populated and economically developed parts of Africa regressed behind previously less developed, non-slave exporting areas during the course of the Atlantic, trans-Saharan, Red Sea and Indian Ocean slave trades.\n\n==Colonial era==\n{{further|Scramble for Africa}}\n\n===1884\u20131945===\nThe [[Berlin Conference]] (German: Kongokonferenz or \"Congo Conference\") of 1884\u201385 regulated European colonization and trade in Africa during the [[Imperialism]] period, and coincided with Germany's sudden emergence as an imperial power. Called for by [[Portugal]] and organized by [[Otto von Bismarck]], first Chancellor of [[Germany]], its outcome, the General Act of the Berlin Conference, can be seen as the formalization of the [[Scramble for Africa]]. The conference ushered in a period of heightened colonial activity by European powers, while simultaneously eliminating most existing forms of African [[autonomy]] and [[self-governance]].<ref>[[Berlin Conference]]</ref> During this  colonial time, the economy of Africa was re-arranged to serve Europe and Europeans, and the European industrial chain began in Africa and ended in European industrial warehouses.\n\nAll of Africa would ultimately fall under European colonial rule by 1914, with the exceptions of Ethiopia and Liberia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume 1|year=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781579582456|page=455}}</ref> The partitioning of African territory among European regimes often violated existing boundaries recognized by local Africans.

Mining for gems and precious metals such as gold was developed in a similar way by wealthy European entrepreneurs such as [[Cecil Rhodes]]. The implementation and effects of these colonial policies could be brutal. One extreme example of exploitation of Africans during this period is the [[Congo Free State]], administered under a form of \"company rule\". The Belgians, under [[Leopold II of Belgium]], allowed businesses to use forced labour as they saw fit. The brutal conditions, famine and disease ended in the deaths of an estimated 10 million Congolese between 1885 and 1908.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Matthew|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|year=2012|publisher=W.W.

In these countries African farmers were pushed onto \"native reserves,\" usually located on arid, marginal lands. Slavery was also widely abolished by colonial powers.\n====Economics====\n[[File:Map of railways in Africa 1899.jpg|thumb|350px|Railway map of Africa, including tracks proposed and under construction, ''[[The Statesman's Yearbook]]'', 1899.]]\n\nTo some colonizers, such as the British, the ideal colony was based on an open economy, actively engaged in world trade through the export of raw materials and the import of finished goods.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Munro|first1=J.

As long as British interests were achieved, native populations were given greater individual freedoms. However, other colonizers, such as the French, took a more active approach to governance, encouraging or even requiring their subjects to more fully assimilate into French culture.\n\nColonizers were under heavy political pressure to make their colonies immediately and continuously profitable. In almost all cases, this constraint led to a shortage of long-term investment from the mother countries into the economic development in their colonies. While these countries did finance some major infrastructure projects designed to facilitate trade, this was primarily to aid in the immediate extraction of valuable resources, and there was little to no investment into growing local business. Another reason colonial governments allowed local economies to lag behind was that competitive local industries would have reduced the colonies\u2019 trade dependence on the central economies in Europe.\n\nFor the colonies to be integrated into the world economy and imperial trade network, the colonial governments needed the local citizens to engage in market activity, rather than simply subsistence agriculture. One method that colonial powers used to urge the native populations into participating in the larger economy was the requirement that taxes be paid in official currency. This made subsistence farming less feasible, as the producers then needed to sell at least some surplus in the market to obtain the currency needed for the payment of taxes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ochonu|first1=Moses|title=African Colonial Economies: State Control, Peasant Maneuvers, and Unintended Outcomes|journal=History Compass|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1\u201313|doi=10.1111/hic3.12024|year=2013}}</ref>\n\nMany times colonial powers collected these taxes through the assistance of local African chiefs, who were politically and financially supported by the colonial governments in exchange for their assistance in enforcing these governments\u2019 policies, especially for policies that could be unpopular. Thus, the colonizers themselves avoided some degree of animosity from their subjects by using these established chiefs as proxies to enforce many of their coercive policies.\n\nToday, many African economies are affected by the legacy of colonialism. In agriculture, the plantation systems that they introduced were highly unsustainable and caused severe environmental degradation. For example, cotton severely lowers [[soil fertility]] wherever it is grown, and areas of West Africa that are dominated by cotton plantations are now unable to switch to more profitable crops or even to produce food because of the depleted soil. Recently, more countries have initiated programs to change to traditional, sustainable forms of agriculture such as shifting cultivation and bush fallow in order to grow enough food to support the population while maintaining soil fertility which allows agriculture to continue in future generations.

In the aftermath of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, 'Western' powers were averse to the idea of using outright conquest to annex territory. At the same time, agitation against colonial rule was becoming persistent in Africa. Between 1945 and 1948 there was a series of strikes and protests, in Senegal, Tanzania, on the French West African railway system, and along West Africa's [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]].<ref name=\"Young 2010 45\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=Tom|title=Africa: A Beginner's Guide|year=2010|publisher=Oneworld|isbn=9781851687534|page=45}}</ref>\n\nAfrican countries gradually won their independence (with colonial-era boundaries intact), in most cases without prolonged violent conflict (exceptions include the [[Cameroon]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Kenya]]).

One result was African countries becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign food imports.<ref name=\"Young 2010 45\"/>\n\nA heavy blow to the economies of many African countries came from the 1973 [[OPEC]] oil embargo. Arab OPEC member countries opposed Israel during the [[Yom Kippur War]] of October 1973. OPEC embargoed oil exports to many Western governments as retaliation for their having supported Israel in the War. 40 African countries were dependent upon oil imports from OPEC, and when the price of oil rose rapidly from the embargo, African exports became too expensive for many foreign markets.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Collins, Robert O.  |author2=James M.

Economists today use different ways to explain this phenomenon usually either an external or internal approach.\n\n;External approach\nExternal approaches usually focus on institutional patterns within economies. They try to explain Africa's economic development as subject to European institutional decisions of the past. European colonial governments had no incentive to create institutions fostering economic development in African colonies, but rather economic extraction of given resources. Even today, African institutions still depend on these early decisions. For example, in Africa, property rights are not established or enforced in a way promoting economic activity.\n\n;Internal approach\nHere two distinct ways have to be differentiated:\nThe first one, similar to the external approach, focuses on property right distributions in Africa. These usually emerge from the setup of the society, being more collective than individualist with  tribes or families playing an important role in Africa. Thereby the distribution of property rights is an obstacle to economic development. Also, there are few incentives to change this setup into an economically more advantageous setting. For rulers it is often the rational choice to stick to this property rights setup, thereby being able to extract more from their dominion than by fostering economic development.\nThe second internal approach focuses directly on resource endowments within the specific regions. Labor scarcity until the 20th century combined with a relatively low quality of soils lead to an extensive way of farming, largely relying on vast amounts of land rather than on intensive use of labor on the land. Combined with bad institutions from precolonial or colonial times this economic setup hinders the extensive use of technology and thereby slowing down or even preventing economic development.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

As soon as human societies came into existence, so did [[economic activity]]. Earliest humans were hunter gatherers living in small, family groups. Even then there was considerable trade that could cover long distances. Archaeologists have found that evidence of trade in luxury items like metals and shells across the entirety of the continent were the main trades of the [[Berber people]], lived in dry areas and became nomadic herders, while in the [[savannah]] grasslands, cultivated crops and thus permanent settlement were possible. Agriculture supported large towns, and eventually large trade networks developed between the towns.\n\n===Origins of agriculture===\nThe first agriculture in Africa began in the heart of the [[Sahara Desert]], which in 5200 BC was far more moist and densely populated than today. Several native species were domesticated, most importantly [[pearl millet]], [[sorghum]] and [[cowpea]]s, which spread through [[West Africa]] and the [[Sahel]]. The Sahara at this time was like the Sahel today. Its wide open fields made cultivation easy, but the poor soil and limited rain made intensive farming impossible. The local crops were also not ideal and produced fewer calories than those of other regions. These factors limited surpluses and kept populations sparse and scattered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[North Africa]] took a very different route from the southern regions. Climatically it is linked to the [[Middle East]] and the [[Fertile Crescent]], and the agricultural techniques of that region were adopted wholesale. This included a different set of crops, such as [[wheat]], [[barley]], and [[grapes]]. North Africa was also blessed by one of the richest agricultural regions in the world in the [[Nile River]] valley. With the arrival of agriculture, the Nile region became one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] home to one of the first civilizations.\n\nThe drying of the Sahara created a formidable barrier between the northern and southern portions of the continent. Two important exceptions were Nubian [[Sudan]], which was linked to Egypt by the Nile and [[Ethiopia]], which could trade with the northern regions over the [[Red Sea]]. Powerful states grew up in these regions such as [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] in Nubia (modern day Northern Sudan and Southern Egypt) and [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]] in Ethiopia. Especially from Nubia, ideas and technologies from the Middle East and Europe reached the rest of Africa.\n\nHistorians believe that iron working  developed independently in Africa. Unlike other continents Africa did not have a period of [[copper]] and [[bronze]] working before their [[Iron Age]]. Copper is quite rare in Africa while iron is quite common. In Nubia and Ethiopia, iron, trade, and agricultural surpluses lead to the establishment of cities and civilizations.\n\n===The Bantu expansion===\n{{Further|Bantu expansion}}\n\nOrdinarily, in the sparsely populated areas, this same period saw the expansion of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] speaking peoples. The [[Bantu expansion]] began in Southern Cameroon around 4000 years ago. Bantu languages are spoken there today and there is archaeological evidence for incoming Neolithic farmers in Northern Gabon c. 3800 BC. It is known that Bantu expansion was extremely rapid and massive, but its exact engine remains controversial. This period predated iron, which appears in the archaeological record by 2500 BC.\n\nOne of the early expansions of Bantu was the migration of the [[Bubi people|Bubi]] to [[Fernando Po (Bioko)]]. They were still using [[stone technology]] at first. The difficulties of cutting down the equatorial forest for farming have led to the suggestion that the primary expansion was along river valleys, a hypothesis supported by studies of fish names. Another factor may have been the arrival of southeast-Asian food crops, notably the [[AAB plantain]], the [[Taro|cocoyam]] and the [[water-yam]]. Linguistic reconstructions suggest that the only livestock possessed by the proto-Bantu was the goat. Over the centuries the entire southern half of Africa was covered with the group, excluding only the [[Kalahari]] desert. Their expansion only ended relatively recently. In the year 1000, Arab traders described that the Bantu had not reached as far as [[Mozambique]]{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}, and European settlers observed the Bantu expansion into South Africa under the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] and others{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}, yet there's no archaeological evidence that supports their claims instead on the contrary the evidence indicates Bantu speakers's presence very much earlier by over 1800 years and over 1400 years before the first European settlement in the south African regions of Mozambique and South Africa respectively.<ref name=\"ResearchArticle\">{{cite journal|title= The archaeological evidence for the appearance of pastoralism and farming in southern Africa|journal= PLOS ONE|volume= 13|issue= 6|pages= e0198941|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0198941|pmid= 29902271|year= 2018|last1= Lander|first1= Faye|last2= Russell|first2= Thembi}}</ref>\n\nThe importation Bantu pastoralism reshaped the continent's economy. Sometime in the first millennium, an equally important change began as crops began to arrive from [[Southeast Asia]]. The [[Indian Ocean]] has always been far more open to trade than the turbulent [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]]. Traders could ride the [[monsoon]] winds west early in the year and return east on them later. It is guessed that these crops first arrived in [[Madagascar]], which also adopted Southeast Asian languages, sometime between AD 300 and 800. From the island, the crops crossed to African Great Lakes region. They included many crops, the most important being the [[banana]].\n\nThe banana and other crops allowed for more intensive cultivation in the tropical regions of Africa, this was most notable in the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] region, and area with excellent soil, that saw many cities and states form, their populations being fed largely\n\n==Trade routes==\n[[File:Endubis.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Aksumite currency|Aksumite gold coin]] of [[Endubis]].]]\n[[File:Trans-Saharan routes early.svg|thumb|350px|Early trans-[[Sahara Desert|Saharan]] trade routes.]]\nWhile some level of trade had been ongoing, the rise of cities and empires made it far more central to the African economy. North Africa was central to the trade of the entire [[Mediterranean]] region. Outside of Egypt, this trade was mostly controlled by the [[Phoenicians]] who came to dominate North Africa, with [[Carthage]] becoming their most important city. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] controlled much of the eastern trade, including along the Red Sea with Ethiopia. In this region a number of Greek trading cities that were established acted as a conduit for their civilization and learning.\n\nThe Egyptian (and later, [[Roman Empire|Roman]]) city of [[Alexandria]] (founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in 334 BC), was one of the hubs for Mediterranean trade for many centuries. Well into the 19th century Egypt remained one of the most developed parts of the world.\n\n[[Nubia]] in Sudan likewise traded with interior African countries such as Chad and Libya, as well as with Egypt, China, India and the Arabian peninsula.\n\nFor most of the 1st millennium AD, the [[Axumite Kingdom]] in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]] had a powerful navy and trading links reaching as far as the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[India]]. Between the 14th and 17th centuries, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] centered in modern-day [[Somalia]] practiced [[hydraulic engineering]] and developed new systems for [[agriculture]] and [[taxation]], which continued to be used in parts of the [[Horn of Africa]] as late as the 19th century.\n\nOn the east coast of the continent [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders linked the region into an Indian Ocean trading network, bringing imports of [[China|Chinese]] pottery and [[India]]n fabrics in exchange for gold, [[ivory trade|ivory]], and slaves. [[Swahili culture|Swahili Kingdoms]] created a prosperous trade empire, where occupied the territory of modern-day [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]]. Swahili cities were important trading ports for trade with the Middle East and Far East.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wonders/Episodes/Epi2/2_wondr2.htm Wonders of the African World: The Swahili People]</ref>\n\nIn the interior of Africa, trade was far more limited. Low population densities made profitable commerce difficult. The massive barrier of the [[Congo Basin|Congo]] rainforests were more imposing than the Sahara, blocking trade through the center of the continent.\n\nIt was the arrival of the [[Islam]]ic armies that transformed the economies of much of Africa. Though Islam had comparatively little impact on North Africa where large cities, literacy, and centralized states had been the norm, Muslims were far more effective at penetrating the Sahara than Christians had been. This was largely due to the [[camel]], which had carried the Arab expansion and would soon after carry large amounts of trade across the desert.\n\nA series of states developed in the [[Sahel]] on the southern edge of the Sahara which made immense profits from trading across the Sahara. The first of these was the [[Kingdom of Ghana]], reaching it peak in the 12th century. Soon, others such as the [[Mali Empire]] and [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], also arose in the region. The main trade of these states was [[gold]], which was plentiful in [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]. Also important was the [[trans-Saharan slave trade]] that shipped large numbers of slaves to North Africa.\n\n===600\u20131600 AD===\n[[File:Manillaokhapo.JPG|thumb|An Okpoho variety of Manilla from the [[Igbo people]] of southeastern [[Nigeria]].]]\nMany wealthy empires grew around coastal areas or large rivers that served as part of important trade routes.

This trade was primarily for the same commodities the Arabs had bought\u2014gold, ivory, and slaves. The Portuguese sold the Africans Indian cloth and European manufactured goods but refused to sell them guns. Soon, however, other European powers such as [[France]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] were developing their own trade with Africa, and they had fewer restrictions. The major European imperial powers in Africa were Portugal, Great Britain, France, and to a lesser extent Germany, Belgium, Spain and Italy. Portugal's presence in Africa as an imperial power lasted until the 1970s, when the last of its former colonies declared independence after years of war.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean had long been all but impenetrable to the [[galley]]s that plied the Mediterranean. That any ship needed to pass thousands of kilometers of waterless desert before reaching any populated regions also made trade impossible. These barriers were overcome by the development of the [[caravel]] in Europe. Previously, trade with Sub-Saharan Africa could only be conducted through North African middlemen. Now Europeans could trade directly with the Africans themselves.\n\nThis valuable trade lead to rapid change in West Africa. The region had long been agriculturally productive and, especially in western Nigeria, densely populated. The massive profits from trade and the arrival of guns lead to significant centralization and a number of states formed in the region such as the [[Ashanti Confederacy]] and [[Kingdom of Benin]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} These states became some of the wealthiest and most advanced in Africa. Wealthy merchants began to send their children to European universities and their well armed standing armies could challenge European forces.\n\nMany West-African natives, such as [[Seedies and Kroomen]], served on European ships, and received regular pay, which greatly enhanced their status back home.\n\n===Atlantic slave trade===\n{{further|Atlantic slave trade}}\nClearly, the slave trade enriched the segments of African society that traded in slaves{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. However, the modern historiography of slavery has swung between two poles on the question of its demographic and economic effects on Africa as a whole. Early historical accounts of the Atlantic slave trade were largely written for a popular audience by abolitionists and former slaves like [[Olaudah Equiano]] who emphasized its profoundly negative effects on African peoples. As the 19th century progressed, accounts of the negative impact of slavery were increasingly used to argue for European colonization of the continent. Conversely, there were those, like the British explorer and geographer William Winwood Reade, who drew on the accounts of slave traders to argue that the effects of slavery were positive.<ref>See Reade 1864.</ref>\n\nBy the early 20th century, the view of slavery as a negative influence on Africa prevailed among professional academic historians in Europe and the United States. During the decolonization period following World War II, an influential group of scholars, led by J.D. Fage, argued that the negative effects of slavery had been exaggerated, and that the export of slaves had been offset by population growth. [[Walter Rodney]], a specialist on the Upper Guinea Coast, countered that European demand for slaves had vastly increased the economic importance of the slave trade in West Africa, with catastrophic effects. Rodney, who was active in Pan-African independence movements, accused Fage of whitewashing the role of Europeans in Africa; Fage responded by accusing Rodney of nationalist romanticism.<ref>For a summary of the Fage-Rodney debate, see Inikori 1982, pp. 74\u201399.</ref>\n\nDebates on the economic impacts of the Atlantic trade were further stimulated by the publication of Philip Curtin's ''The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census'' (1969), which argued that 9.566 million slaves were exported from Africa through the Atlantic trade. In the 1970s, the debate on the economic impacts of the Atlantic trade increasingly turned on demographic estimates of slave exports in relation to continental birth rates. Most scholars now believe that Curtin was too conservative in his calculation, with most estimates ranging between 11.5 million to 15.4 million.<ref>See Curtin 1972, Lovejoy 1983, Inikori and Engerman 1992</ref> More recently, John K. Thornton has presented an argument closer to that of Fage, while Joseph Inikori, Patrick Manning and [[Nathan Nunn]] have argued that the slave trade had a long-term debilitating impact on African economic development.<ref>See Thornton 1998, Inikori 1982, Inikori 1992, Manning 1990, Nunn 2008.</ref>\n\nManning, for example, arrived at the following conclusion, after accounting for regional variations in slave exports and assuming an annual African population growth rate of 0.5.%: the population of Africa would have been 100 million rather than 50 million in 1850, if not for the combined effects of the external and internal slave trades.<ref>Manning 1990, p. 85</ref> Nunn, in a recent econometric analysis of slave-exporting regions in all parts of Africa, found \"a robust negative relationship between the number of slaves taken from a country and its subsequent economic development.\"<ref>Nunn, 2008, p. 168</ref> Nunn argues, moreover, that this cannot be explained by poverty prior to the slave trade, because more densely populated and economically developed parts of Africa regressed behind previously less developed, non-slave exporting areas during the course of the Atlantic, trans-Saharan, Red Sea and Indian Ocean slave trades.\n\n==Colonial era==\n{{further|Scramble for Africa}}\n\n===1884\u20131945===\nThe [[Berlin Conference]] (German: Kongokonferenz or \"Congo Conference\") of 1884\u201385 regulated European colonization and trade in Africa during the [[Imperialism]] period, and coincided with Germany's sudden emergence as an imperial power. Called for by [[Portugal]] and organized by [[Otto von Bismarck]], first Chancellor of [[Germany]], its outcome, the General Act of the Berlin Conference, can be seen as the formalization of the [[Scramble for Africa]]. The conference ushered in a period of heightened colonial activity by European powers, while simultaneously eliminating most existing forms of African [[autonomy]] and [[self-governance]].<ref>[[Berlin Conference]]</ref> During this  colonial time, the economy of Africa was re-arranged to serve Europe and Europeans, and the European industrial chain began in Africa and ended in European industrial warehouses.\n\nAll of Africa would ultimately fall under European colonial rule by 1914, with the exceptions of Ethiopia and Liberia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume 1|year=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781579582456|page=455}}</ref> The partitioning of African territory among European regimes often violated existing boundaries recognized by local Africans.

Mining for gems and precious metals such as gold was developed in a similar way by wealthy European entrepreneurs such as [[Cecil Rhodes]]. The implementation and effects of these colonial policies could be brutal. One extreme example of exploitation of Africans during this period is the [[Congo Free State]], administered under a form of \"company rule\". The Belgians, under [[Leopold II of Belgium]], allowed businesses to use forced labour as they saw fit. The brutal conditions, famine and disease ended in the deaths of an estimated 10 million Congolese between 1885 and 1908.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Matthew|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|year=2012|publisher=W.W.

In these countries African farmers were pushed onto \"native reserves,\" usually located on arid, marginal lands. Slavery was also widely abolished by colonial powers.\n====Economics====\n[[File:Map of railways in Africa 1899.jpg|thumb|350px|Railway map of Africa, including tracks proposed and under construction, ''[[The Statesman's Yearbook]]'', 1899.]]\n\nTo some colonizers, such as the British, the ideal colony was based on an open economy, actively engaged in world trade through the export of raw materials and the import of finished goods.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Munro|first1=J. Forbes|title=Britain in Tropical Africa, 1880\u20131960: Economic Relationships and Impact|date=1984|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0333323304|url=https://archive.org/details/britainintropica00jfor}}</ref> The British practiced a policy of light administration, enforcing relatively little regulation on their colonies, especially in non-economic matters. As long as British interests were achieved, native populations were given greater individual freedoms. However, other colonizers, such as the French, took a more active approach to governance, encouraging or even requiring their subjects to more fully assimilate into French culture.\n\nColonizers were under heavy political pressure to make their colonies immediately and continuously profitable. In almost all cases, this constraint led to a shortage of long-term investment from the mother countries into the economic development in their colonies. While these countries did finance some major infrastructure projects designed to facilitate trade, this was primarily to aid in the immediate extraction of valuable resources, and there was little to no investment into growing local business. Another reason colonial governments allowed local economies to lag behind was that competitive local industries would have reduced the colonies\u2019 trade dependence on the central economies in Europe.\n\nFor the colonies to be integrated into the world economy and imperial trade network, the colonial governments needed the local citizens to engage in market activity, rather than simply subsistence agriculture. One method that colonial powers used to urge the native populations into participating in the larger economy was the requirement that taxes be paid in official currency. This made subsistence farming less feasible, as the producers then needed to sell at least some surplus in the market to obtain the currency needed for the payment of taxes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ochonu|first1=Moses|title=African Colonial Economies: State Control, Peasant Maneuvers, and Unintended Outcomes|journal=History Compass|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1\u201313|doi=10.1111/hic3.12024|year=2013}}</ref>\n\nMany times colonial powers collected these taxes through the assistance of local African chiefs, who were politically and financially supported by the colonial governments in exchange for their assistance in enforcing these governments\u2019 policies, especially for policies that could be unpopular. Thus, the colonizers themselves avoided some degree of animosity from their subjects by using these established chiefs as proxies to enforce many of their coercive policies.\n\nToday, many African economies are affected by the legacy of colonialism. In agriculture, the plantation systems that they introduced were highly unsustainable and caused severe environmental degradation. For example, cotton severely lowers [[soil fertility]] wherever it is grown, and areas of West Africa that are dominated by cotton plantations are now unable to switch to more profitable crops or even to produce food because of the depleted soil. Recently, more countries have initiated programs to change to traditional, sustainable forms of agriculture such as shifting cultivation and bush fallow in order to grow enough food to support the population while maintaining soil fertility which allows agriculture to continue in future generations.

In the aftermath of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, 'Western' powers were averse to the idea of using outright conquest to annex territory. At the same time, agitation against colonial rule was becoming persistent in Africa. Between 1945 and 1948 there was a series of strikes and protests, in Senegal, Tanzania, on the French West African railway system, and along West Africa's [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]].<ref name=\"Young 2010 45\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=Tom|title=Africa: A Beginner's Guide|year=2010|publisher=Oneworld|isbn=9781851687534|page=45}}</ref>\n\nAfrican countries gradually won their independence (with colonial-era boundaries intact), in most cases without prolonged violent conflict (exceptions include the [[Cameroon]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Kenya]]).

This economic resilience eroded for the most part over the next several decades. Many arguments have been made to identify factors to explain the economic decline of many African countries.

One result was African countries becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign food imports.<ref name=\"Young 2010 45\"/>\n\nA heavy blow to the economies of many African countries came from the 1973 [[OPEC]] oil embargo. Arab OPEC member countries opposed Israel during the [[Yom Kippur War]] of October 1973. OPEC embargoed oil exports to many Western governments as retaliation for their having supported Israel in the War. 40 African countries were dependent upon oil imports from OPEC, and when the price of oil rose rapidly from the embargo, African exports became too expensive for many foreign markets.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Collins, Robert O.  |author2=James M.

Economists today use different ways to explain this phenomenon usually either an external or internal approach.\n\n;External approach\nExternal approaches usually focus on institutional patterns within economies. They try to explain Africa's economic development as subject to European institutional decisions of the past. European colonial governments had no incentive to create institutions fostering economic development in African colonies, but rather economic extraction of given resources. Even today, African institutions still depend on these early decisions. For example, in Africa, property rights are not established or enforced in a way promoting economic activity.\n\n;Internal approach\nHere two distinct ways have to be differentiated:\nThe first one, similar to the external approach, focuses on property right distributions in Africa. These usually emerge from the setup of the society, being more collective than individualist with  tribes or families playing an important role in Africa. Thereby the distribution of property rights is an obstacle to economic development. Also, there are few incentives to change this setup into an economically more advantageous setting. For rulers it is often the rational choice to stick to this property rights setup, thereby being able to extract more from their dominion than by fostering economic development.\nThe second internal approach focuses directly on resource endowments within the specific regions. Labor scarcity until the 20th century combined with a relatively low quality of soils lead to an extensive way of farming, largely relying on vast amounts of land rather than on intensive use of labor on the land. Combined with bad institutions from precolonial or colonial times this economic setup hinders the extensive use of technology and thereby slowing down or even preventing economic development.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

They are sometimes categorised as [[psychedelic folk]] or as [[medieval folk rock]], but their music was much more a reinvention of [[Renaissance music]], based around the use of period instruments such as [[lute]]s and [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s.\n\n==History==\nJohn Gladwin (guitar and vocals) and Terrance (Terry) Wincott (guitar and vocals) formed a band called The Dimples along with Stuart Smith (drums) and Johnny Jackson (bass guitar). Signed to the Decca label they recorded a single, the \"A\" side \"Love of a Lifetime\" and the \"B\" side written by John Gladwin titled \"My Heart is Tied to You\". The record did not chart, although more recently the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] has become popular on the [[Northern soul]] scene.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n \nFollowing the break up of The Dimples John and Terry joined up with Craig Austin, Jeff Tindall and Steve Cox to form a band called Gospel Garden. They produced one single , the A side \"Finder's Keepers\" and the B side Just a Tear written by Gladwin. The band was short lived and John and Terry went on to form a loud \"electric\" band called Methuselah.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> However, at some point in Methuselah concerts, the duo would play an acoustic number together: they found that this went down well with the audiences and allowed them to bring out more of the subtlety of their singing and instrumental work. They left Methuselah in 1969 and began working on their own acoustic material.\n\nInitially their material was derived from folk music, in line with many of the other performers of the time. However, they began to develop their own musical idiom, influenced, at one extreme, by the early music revivalists such as [[David Munrow]], and the other extreme, by their childhood memories of the ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|Robin Hood]]'' TV series, with its pseudo-mediaeval soundtrack by [[Elton Hayes]].\n\nThe band was named after [[Blondel de Nesle]], the musician in the court of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. According to legend, when Richard was held prisoner, Blondel travelled through central Europe, singing at every castle to locate the King and assist his escape. This name for the band was suggested by a chef, Eugene McCoy, who listened to some of their songs and commented: \"Oh, very Blondel!\" and they began to use that name. They were then advised to add an adjective (in line, for example, with [[The Incredible String Band]]) and so they became \"Amazing Blondel\".\n\nTheir first album ''The Amazing Blondel'' (also called \"Amazing Blondel and a Few Faces,\") was recorded in 1969 and released by Bell Records. It was directed by session guitarist [[Big Jim Sullivan]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> At about this time, Eddie Baird (who had known the other members at school) joined the band.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> On 19 September 1970 they were one of the bands to play at the first [[Glastonbury Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/history/history-1970/|title=Glastonbury Festival - 1970|website=Glastonburyfestivals.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8566404/Glastonbury-festival-the-worst-acts-ever.html|title=Glastonbury festival: the worst acts ever|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> Following what Baird described as \"a disastrous 'showbiz' record signing\",{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Amazing Blondel were introduced, by members of the band [[Free (band)|Free]], to [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records|Island Records and Artists]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  Blackwell signed them up to Island, for whom they recorded their albums ''[[Evensong (album)|Evensong]]'', ''[[Fantasia Lindum]]'' and ''England''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  \n\nIn Baird's words (in a 2003 interview) the band \"adored recording\". They recorded the Island albums in the company's [[Basing Street Studios]] which, at that time, was the source of some of the most innovative independent music in Britain.\n\nThey toured widely, both in their own concerts and as a support act for bands such as [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Procol Harum]] and [[Steeleye Span]]. On stage, they aimed at technical precision of the music and versatility of instrumentation (with most concerts involving the use of some forty instruments) interspersed with banter and bawdy humour.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> However, there was a conflict between their managers' desires to organise ever more demanding tour schedules and the band's own wish to spend more time writing material and working in  the studio. In the end, this led to the departure of John Gladwin (who had written most of their material) from the band in 1973, and the remaining two members decided to continue as a duo.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In this new format, they went on to record several more albums, with Baird now writing the bulk of the material. The first of these, ''Blondel'', was their final release for Island. They were next signed to Dick James' DJM label, where they recorded three albums, ''Mulgrave Street'', ''Inspiration'' and ''Bad Dreams''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>   They gradually modernized and electrified their sound. These albums featured a number of guest musicians, including [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Paul Kossoff]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> There is a mistaken belief that, during this period, they shortened the band name to Blondel. This is probably caused by the title of the final Island album, and the front cover of ''Mulgrave Street'', which gives the short version of the name. But the full name is given on the back and on the front of the next two albums. The final release in the 1970s was a live album.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \n\nBy the end of the 1970s, with [[disco]] being the largest selling music genre and with [[Folk music|folk]] losing popularity, Baird and Wincott stopped performing under the Amazing Blondel name. John Gladwin reinherited the name and began to tour universities with bandmates, and former session players for the original Amazing Blondel; Adrian Hopkins and Paul Empson. This line-up had originally been billed as \"John David Gladwin's Englishe Musicke\". \n\nThe original band reformed in 1997 and produced a new album ''Restoration''. They have since played at venues across  Europe in the period 1997\u20132000. As of 2005, Terry Wincott had a successful [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|heart bypass operation]], which curtailed the band's plans for future concerts.\n\nIn 2005, Eddie Baird played two concerts in a duo with acoustic guitarist and singer songwriter Julie Ellison and is currently working on a collaboration with Darryl Ebbatson, called \"Ebbatson Baird\".\n\n==Band membership==\nJohn David Gladwin and Edward Baird were born and brought up in [[Scunthorpe]], [[Lincolnshire]]: Terence Alan Wincott was born in [[Hampshire]] but moved to Scunthorpe at an early age.\n\nThe members of the band were all accomplished musicians. Gladwin sang and played [[twelve-string guitar]], [[lute]], [[double bass]], [[theorbo]], [[cittern]], [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]] and [[tubular bell]]s. Wincott sang and played [[Steel-string guitar|6 string guitar]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s, [[flute]], [[ocarina]], [[conga]]s, [[crumhorn]], [[pipe organ]], tabor, [[harpsichord]], [[piano]], [[mellotron]], [[bongo drum|bongos]] and assorted [[percussion instrument|percussion]]. Baird sang and played lute, [[glockenspiel]], cittern, [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimer]], twelve string guitar and percussion.\n\n==Style of music==\nThe style of their music is difficult to categorise. Most of it was composed by themselves, but was based on the form and structure of Renaissance music, featuring, for example, [[pavane]]s, [[galliard]]s and [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]]. It is sometimes categorised as psychedelic folk but would probably have been disowned by both the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] community and the [[folk music|folk]] community, whilst being instantly recognisable to students of [[early music]]. Terry Wincott described it as \"pseudo-Elizabethan/Classical acoustic music sung with British accents\". Eddie Baird is quoted as saying \"People used to ask us, How would you describe your music? Well, there was no point asking us, we didn't have a clue.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nTheir music has been compared with that of [[Gryphon (band)|Gryphon]] and [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]]: however, Amazing Blondel did not embrace the rock influences of the former nor the folk and jazz influences of the latter. They have also been likened to [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].\n\n==Instruments==\nThe band employed a wide range of instruments (see above) but, central to their sound was their use of the lute and recorders. \n\nWhen touring, the lutes proved to be quite difficult instruments for stage performance (in terms of amplification and tuning) and, in 1971, the band commissioned the construction of two 7-string guitars, which could be played in lute tuning. The design and construction of these instruments was undertaken by [[David Rubio]] who made classical guitars, lutes, and other early instruments for classical players, including [[Julian Bream]] and [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingblondel.com/history_contentpop.asp?hid=3 |title=The Rubio Seven String Classical Guitar |publisher=Amazing Blondel |date=2003-04-11 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716232503/http://www.amazingblondel.com/history_contentpop.asp?hid=3 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-16 |author-last=Gladwin |author-first=John}}</ref>\n\nGladwin's instrument was designed to have slightly more of a bass sound, as it was used mainly as an accompaniment instrument, whereas Baird's had a little bit more treble emphasis, to allow his melodic playing in the higher register to predominate. The two instruments were individually successful and also blended well together. They also proved to be stable (from a tuning point of view) for stage performance. The guitars were fitted with internal microphones to simplify amplification.\n\n==Discography==\nThis list is incomplete.

Wincott sang and played [[Steel-string guitar|6 string guitar]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]s, [[flute]], [[ocarina]], [[conga]]s, [[crumhorn]], [[pipe organ]], tabor, [[harpsichord]], [[piano]], [[mellotron]], [[bongo drum|bongos]] and assorted [[percussion instrument|percussion]]. Baird sang and played lute, [[glockenspiel]], cittern, [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimer]], twelve string guitar and percussion.\n\n==Style of music==\nThe style of their music is difficult to categorise. Most of it was composed by themselves, but was based on the form and structure of Renaissance music, featuring, for example, [[pavane]]s, [[galliard]]s and [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]]. It is sometimes categorised as psychedelic folk but would probably have been disowned by both the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] community and the [[folk music|folk]] community, whilst being instantly recognisable to students of [[early music]]. Terry Wincott described it as \"pseudo-Elizabethan/Classical acoustic music sung with British accents\". Eddie Baird is quoted as saying \"People used to ask us, How would you describe your music? Well, there was no point asking us, we didn't have a clue.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nTheir music has been compared with that of [[Gryphon (band)|Gryphon]] and [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]]: however, Amazing Blondel did not embrace the rock influences of the former nor the folk and jazz influences of the latter. They have also been likened to [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].\n\n==Instruments==\nThe band employed a wide range of instruments (see above) but, central to their sound was their use of the lute and recorders. \n\nWhen touring, the lutes proved to be quite difficult instruments for stage performance (in terms of amplification and tuning) and, in 1971, the band commissioned the construction of two 7-string guitars, which could be played in lute tuning. The design and construction of these instruments was undertaken by [[David Rubio]] who made classical guitars, lutes, and other early instruments for classical players, including [[Julian Bream]] and [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingblondel.com/history_contentpop.asp?hid=3 |title=The Rubio Seven String Classical Guitar |publisher=Amazing Blondel |date=2003-04-11 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716232503/http://www.amazingblondel.com/history_contentpop.asp?hid=3 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-16 |author-last=Gladwin |author-first=John}}</ref>\n\nGladwin's instrument was designed to have slightly more of a bass sound, as it was used mainly as an accompaniment instrument, whereas Baird's had a little bit more treble emphasis, to allow his melodic playing in the higher register to predominate. The two instruments were individually successful and also blended well together. They also proved to be stable (from a tuning point of view) for stage performance. The guitars were fitted with internal microphones to simplify amplification.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|<center>'''Title'''</center>\n|<center>'''Year'''</center>\n|<center>'''Label'''</center>\n|<center>'''Line-up'''</center>\n|-\n|''The Amazing Blondel'' (aka ''The Amazing Blondel and a Few Faces'')\n|1970\n|[[Bell Records (UK)|Bell Records]]\n|John Gladwin, Terry Wincott\n|-\n|''[[Evensong (album)|Evensong]]''\n|1970\n|[[Island Records]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Eddie Baird, John Gladwin, Terry Wincott\n|-\n|''[[Fantasia Lindum]]''\n|1971\n|[[Island Records]]\n|-\n|''England''\n|1972\n|[[Island Records]]\n|-\n|''[[Blondel (album)|Blondel]]''\n|1973\n|[[Island Records]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Eddie Baird, Terry Wincott\n|-\n|''Mulgrave Street''\n|1974\n|[[DJM Records]]\n|-\n|''Inspiration''\n|1975\n|[[DJM Records]]\n|-\n|''Bad Dreams''\n|1976\n|[[DJM Records]]\n|-\n|''Restoration''\n|1997\n|[[HTD Records]]\n|Eddie Baird, John Gladwin, Terry Wincott\n|-\n|''The Amazing Elsie Emerald''\n|2010\n|[[Talking Elephant]]\n|Eddie Baird, Terry Wincott\n|}\n\n===Other releases===\n* ''Live in Tokyo'' (1977) (actually this live album was recorded in Europe)\n*''Englishe Musicke'' (compilation), Edsel Records, (1993)\n*''A Foreign Field That Is Forever England'' (recorded live, 1972\u20131973) HTD Records (1996)\n*''Evensong''/''[[Fantasia Lindum]]'', Beat Goes On 626 (2004)\n*''Going Where The Music Takes Me (Live & Studio Archive recordings From The 60's To the 80's) (2-CD-Box + DVD)'', Shakedown Records (2004)(Compilation with 38 unreleased songs; no Amazing Blondel recordings but songs by the individual members)\n*''Harvest of gold - The English Folk Almanach'' (Live sampler including recordings from [[Steeleye Span]]; [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Magna Carta (band)|Magna Carta]] as well as five live recordings by Amazing Blondel from the early 1970s which are otherwise unreleased)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.is/20130421082248/http://www.talkingelephant.co.uk/artists/artist.php?Artist_Ref=22426&Genre_id=all Blondel CD re-issues and latest news on their reformation courtesy of Talking Elephant]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120916201608/http://www.amazingblondel.com/ The last snapshot of the official site of Amazing Blondel]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080526082553/http://www.ebbatsonbaird.co.uk/index.html The last snapshot of the official site of the Ebbatson-Baird project]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amazing Blondel}}\n[[Category:English folk musical groups]]\n[[Category:English progressive rock groups]]\n[[Category:Medieval folk rock groups]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic folk groups]]\n[[Category:Bell Records artists]]\n[[Category:Island Records artists]]\n[[Category:DJM Records artists]]\n[[Category:Transatlantic Records artists]]\n[[Category:Mooncrest Records artists]]\n", "name_user": "Pauln50", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eStudio albums)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Blondel"}

The meaning of the word has expanded over time to include dogs who also do other kinds of related work. This expansion of meaning has caused some conflation between the term {{lang|es|doggo}} and the terms {{lang|es|presa}} (Spanish, literally 'prey[ing]', '[[Catch dog|catch]][ing]') and {{lang|pt|fila}} (Portuguese, lit. 'seize/seizing') as applied to dogs. The Spanish {{lang|es|doggos}} are sometimes known as {{lang|es|presas}};<ref name=\"B\" /> for instance, the breed known in English by one of its Spanish names {{lang|es|[[Perro de Presa Canario|Doggo Canario]]}} is also called in Spanish {{lang|es|presa canario}}<!--Spanish does NOT capitalize adjectives derived from proper names.-->, and the {{lang|es|doggo mallorqu\u00edn}} (usually known in English as the {{lang|ca|[[Ca de Bou]]}} from its Catalan name) is alternatively known by Spaniards as {{lang|es|presa mallorqu\u00edn}} (Spanish does not capitalize breed names). The extinct {{lang|es|perro de presa espa\u00f1ol}} was closely related to them and might have been one of their ancestors ([[foundation stock]]). However, the Latin American {{lang|es|doggos}} [[standardized breed]]s \u2013 [[Argentine Doggo]] or {{lang|es|doggo argentino}}, [[Brazilian Doggo]] or {{lang|pt-BR|dogue brasileiro}}, and [[Guatemalan Doggo]] or {{lang|es|doggo guatemalteco}} \u2013 are not called {{lang|es|presas}} because they have traditionally been used only as hunting and guard dogs, the original meaning of the term {{lang|es|doggo}}. {{lang|es|Presas}} and {{lang|pt|filas}} were often used as fighting, cattle, or butcher's dogs in addition to hunting and guarding.\n\nIn French and Portuguese, doggos are called {{lang|fr|dogues}}, and in German {{lang|de|Dogges}}<!--German capitalized ALL nouns.-->. Therefore, in Spanish, the [[Dogue de Bordeaux]] (its name in English as well as in French, which would not capitalize {{lang|fr|dogue}}) is known as {{lang|es|doggo de Burdeos}}<!--Burdeos is a noun, not an adjective, so capitalized.-->, and the [[Great Dane]] ({{lang|de|Deutsche Dogge}} in German) as {{lang|es|dogo alem\u00e1n}} ('German doggo').
