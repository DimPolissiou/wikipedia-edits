A [[criminal mastermind]] with aspirations of [[world domination]], he is the [[archenemy]] of the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]] agent James Bond. Blofeld is head of the global criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]] and is commonly referred to by the codename '''Number 1''' within this organisation. The character was originally written by Fleming as a physically massive and powerfully built man, standing around 1.90 m and weighing 140 kg, who had become flabby with a huge belly.<ref name=\"Buckton2015\">{{cite book|first=Oliver|last=Buckton|title=Espionage in British Fiction and Film since 1900: The Changing Enemy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZkpCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA244|date=8 October 2015|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-1-4985-0484-3|page=244|quote=Yet this suggestion of femininity in Blofeld's face is belied by his massive girth, his body \"weighed about twenty stone. It had once been all muscle ... but in the past ten years it had softened and he had a vast belly that he concealed behind roomy trousers.}}</ref>\n\nBlofeld appears or is heard in three novels: ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'', ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''; and ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]''; as well as eight films from [[Eon Productions]]: ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963); ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965); ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967); ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969); ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971); ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' (1981; the pre-title sequence of which shows an unnamed character resembling him fall to his death); ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015); and ''[[No Time to Die]]'' (2020). The latter two films are set in an rebooted continuity, which started with ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006). He also appears in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983), a remake of ''Thunderball'' that was not produced by Eon.\n\nBlofeld has been played on screen by [[Donald Pleasence]], [[Telly Savalas]], [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], [[Max von Sydow]], and [[Christoph Waltz]], among others. It was initially a convention of the films not to show Blofeld's face, only a close-up of him stroking his white, blue-eyed [[Persian cat]]. His face's first appearance is in ''You Only Live Twice'' as he introduces himself to Bond (whom he is meeting face-to-face for the first time) after previously appearing in the \"traditional\" way in earlier parts of the film.\n\nMany of Blofeld's characteristics have become [[trope (literature)|trope]]s in popular fiction, representing the [[stock character]] of the criminal mastermind, with the stroking of his white cat often retained as a parodic allusion to Blofeld's character. This can be seen in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|''Austin Powers'' film series]] with the character of [[Dr. Evil]] and his cat Mr. Bigglesworth, or in the cartoons ''[[Inspector Gadget]]'' and with the character of Dr. Claw, ''[[Danger Mouse (1981 TV series)|Danger Mouse]]'' with the character of Baron Silas Greenback.\n\n==Character==\nIan Fleming includes information about Blofeld's background in his novel ''Thunderball''. According to the novel, Blofeld was born on 28 May 1908 (which is also Fleming's birthday) in [[Gdynia|Gdingen]], [[Imperial Germany]] (now [[Gdynia]], [[Poland]]); his father Ernst George Blofeld was Polish, and his mother Maria Stavro Michelopoulos was Greek, hence his Greek name Stavro.<ref name=\"Griswold 2006 34\">{{cite book|first=John|last=Griswold|title=Ian Fleming's James Bond: Annotations and Chronologies for Ian Fleming's Bond Stories|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, Indiana|date=2006|ISBN=978-1425931001|page=34}}</ref> After [[World War I]], Blofeld became a Polish national. As a young man, he was well-versed in the social science disciplines, but also in the natural science and technology disciplines. He first graduated from the [[University of Warsaw]] with a degree in Political History and Economics, and then from the [[Warsaw University of Technology]] with a degree in Engineering and [[Radionics]]. He was then hired by the [[Ministry of Post and Telegraphs (Poland)|Polish Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs]] and appointed to a sensitive communication position, which he used for buying and selling stocks at the [[Warsaw Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjnewton.demon.co.uk/bond/blofeld.htm |title=The Bond Film Informant: Ernst Stavro Blofeld |publisher=Mjnewton.demon.co.uk |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108184939/http://www.mjnewton.demon.co.uk/bond/blofeld.htm|archivedate=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nForeseeing [[World War II]], Blofeld made copies of top-secret wires and sold them for cash to [[Nazi Germany]]. Before the German [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, he destroyed all records of his existence, then moved first to Sweden, then to Turkey, where he worked for [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|Turkish Radio]] and began to set up his own private intelligence organisation. During the war, he sold information to both sides. After the defeat of [[Erwin Rommel]], he decided to back the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, and was awarded numerous medals by the Allied powers after the war's end. Blofeld then moved temporarily to South America before founding [[SPECTRE]].\n\nIn the [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]] novel ''[[For Special Services]]'', Blofeld is depicted as having had a daughter named Nena with a French prostitute.\n\nAlthough Fleming himself never confirmed it, it is generally thought that the character of Blofeld was based on real-life Greek arms dealer [[Basil Zaharoff]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard B.|last=Spence|chapter=Aleister Crowley, Sidney Reilly, Basil Zaharoff: Their Influence on the Creation of James Bond and His World|editor1-first=Jack|editor1-last=Becker|editor2-first=Freedonia|editor2-last=Paschall|editor3-first=Robert|editor3-last=Weiner|title=James Bond and Popular Culture: The Films Are Not Enough|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Press|location=Cambridge, England|ISBN=978-0786477937|date=2010}}</ref> It is commonly believed that the name Blofeld was inspired by the English [[cricket]] commentator [[Henry Blofeld]]'s father, with whom Fleming went to school.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/26b37783#p009375w |title=BBC Radio 4 \u2013 Desert Island Discs, Henry Blofeld |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=5 December 2003 |accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> Henry Blofeld offered on the [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[Just a Minute]]'' that \"Ian took my father's name as the name of the baddie.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b038xmf6/Just_a_Minute_Series_67_Episode_3/ |title=BBC Radio 4 \u2013 Just a Minute, Series 67, Episode 3 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==In novels==\nBlofeld has three appearances in Ian Fleming's novels. He first appears in a minor role as the leader of SPECTRE in the 1961 novel ''Thunderball''. The plot that he formulates is carried out by his second-in-command [[Emilio Largo]]. Blofeld is described physically as a massive man, weighing roughly 140 kg, who had previously been a champion amateur weightlifter in his youth before becoming obese in middle age; he has black crew-cut hair, black eyes (similar to those of [[Benito Mussolini]]), heavy eyelashes, a thin mouth, and long pointed hands and feet. He has violet-scented breath from chewing flavored [[Throat lozenge|cachous]] (breath mints), a habit he adopts whenever he must deliver bad news. A meticulous planner of formidable intellect, he seems to be without conscience but not necessarily insane, and is motivated solely by financial gain; one novel even makes reference to an instance where a young woman was taken hostage to extract a ransom from her father, and after learning that the woman was raped by one of her guards after the ransom was paid and the girl returned, Blofeld killed the guard and returned some of the ransom as compensation, as he had guaranteed that she would be returned unharmed. Blofeld's lifestyle is described in one chapter in ''Thunderball'': \"For the rest, he didn't smoke or drink and he had never been known to sleep with a member of either sex. He didn't even eat very much.\"\n\nBlofeld is absent from the next novel, ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', though its events take place while Bond is battling SPECTRE in North America. In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1963), Bond learns that Blofeld has altered his appearance radically \u2014he is now tall and thin; has reduced his weight to {{convert|12|st}}; sports long silver hair, a [[syphilitic]] infection on his nose, and no earlobes; he wears dark green tinted contact lenses to hide his distinctive eyes. Perhaps less calculating than previously, he is notably saddled with the exploitable weakness of snobbery about his assumed nobility, indicating that he is losing his sanity. He is hiding in Switzerland in the guise of the Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp and Bond defeats his vindictive plans to destroy Britain's agricultural economy. In the final sequence of the novel, Blofeld gets revenge by murdering Bond's new wife, [[Tracy Bond|Tracy]].\n\nIn ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'', published in 1964, Blofeld returns and Bond finds him hiding in Japan under the alias Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. He has once again changed his appearance. He has put on some muscle, and has a gold-capped tooth, a fully healed nose, and a drooping grey mustache. Bond describes Blofeld on their confrontation as being \"a big man, perhaps six foot three (190 cm), and powerfully built.\" It is indicated that Blofeld has by now gone completely insane, as he all but admits himself when Bond levels the accusation. Bond strangles him to death in a fit of rage at the end of the novel (something that he had done only once before, to [[Auric Goldfinger]]). In both ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' and ''You Only Live Twice'', Blofeld is aided in his schemes by Irma Bunt, who is clearly his lover in the latter, and posing as Shatterhand's wife. Bond incapacitates her in their Japanese castle base before it blows up, killing Bunt. The final mention of Blofeld is in the beginning of the next novel, ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', published in 1965.\n\n==In films==\n===Original timeline===\n[[File:ESBlofelds.png|thumb|right|Blofeld in ''You Only Live Twice'' ([[Donald Pleasence]]), ''On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service'' ([[Telly Savalas]]), ''Diamonds Are Forever'' ([[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]), ''Never Say Never Again'' ([[Max von Sydow]]) and ''Spectre'' ([[Christoph Waltz]])]]\n\nIn the film series, Blofeld first appears in ''From Russia with Love'' (credited as \"Ernst Blofeld\", though the name is never heard), then in ''Thunderball'' (uncredited).  In these two appearances, his name is never spoken, his face is not seen, and only his lower body is visible as he strokes his trademark white cat.\n\n[[Czechs|Czech]] actor [[Jan Werich]] was originally cast by producer [[Harry Saltzman]] to play Blofeld in ''You Only Live Twice''.  Upon his arrival at the [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] set, both producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and director [[Lewis Gilbert]] felt that he was a bad choice, resembling a \"poor, benevolent [[Santa Claus]].\"  Nonetheless, in an attempt to make the casting work, Gilbert continued filming.  After five days, both Gilbert and Broccoli determined that Werich was not menacing enough, and recast [[Donald Pleasence]] in the role \u2013 the official excuse being that Werich was ill.<ref name=\"MGM documentary\">{{cite video| title =Inside You Only Live Twice: An Original Documentary | medium=Television | people=Production Staff | publisher=MGM Home Entertainment Inc| date= 2000}}</ref>\n\nIn the third, fourth, and fifth appearances{{spaced ndash}}''You Only Live Twice'', ''On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service'' and ''Diamonds Are Forever''{{spaced ndash}}he is the primary antagonist, meeting Bond face-to-face.  During the opening sequence of ''Diamonds Are Forever'', he reveals to Bond that some of his men have undergone [[plastic surgery]] to become his decoy duplicates.\n\nIn the film version of ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', he is not [[Tracy Bond]]'s actual killer.  He drives the car from which Irma Bunt ([[Ilse Steppat]]) fires the fatal shots at Tracy, minutes after she marries Bond.\n\nIn a sixth appearance{{spaced ndash}}in the pre-credit sequence of ''For Your Eyes Only''{{spaced ndash}}he is an anonymous, bald, wheelchair-bound villain trying to kill Bond once again. Blofeld remains unnamed and unlisted in the film's end credits.

In this continuity, he was born '''Franz Oberhauser''', the son of Hannes Oberhauser, Bond's legal guardian after being orphaned at the age of 11, making him and Bond adoptive brothers. As a young man, he murdered his father, staged his own death, and took on the alias of \"Ernst Stavro Blofeld\" using his mother's maiden name. He then assembled the global criminal organisation known as Spectre. He is revealed to have been trying for years to destroy Bond whom he resents for having been his father's favourite; he is thus revealed to have been the power behind the villains of the previous three films who were all Spectre agents. At the end of the film, Bond has him at gunpoint, but spares his life. M, who is looking on, takes Blofeld into custody after foiling his plan to take control of the world's national security intelligence data. This incarnation again wears a jacket without lapels, has a full head of hair, and is disfigured in the course of the film, echoing Donald Pleasence's version's duelling scar. He is also briefly shown with a white Persian cat.\n\nBlofeld, again portrayed by Waltz, will appear in the upcoming Bond film ''[[No Time to Die]]''.<ref>{{Cite web||url=https://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/no-time-to-die-new-information-ahead-of-teaser-trailer-release?id=04613|title=One Last Thing... |date=2019-09-03 |website=MI6-HQ.com |access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n\n===Table of film appearances===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Film \n!Actor and notes\n!Status after the film concludes\n|-\n|1963\n|''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''\n|[[Anthony Dawson]] as actor (only hands and back of head are seen), [[Eric Pohlmann]] as voice actor; the end credits list a [[question mark]] instead of an actor's name in the \"Ernst Blofeld\" field (however, he is only referred to as \"Number One\" in the film).\n| Active/indirect involvement in the field.

A [[criminal mastermind]] with aspirations of [[world domination]], he is the [[archenemy]] of the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]] agent James Bond. Blofeld is head of the global criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]] and is commonly referred to by the codename '''Number 1''' within this organisation. The character was originally written by Fleming as a physically massive and powerfully built man, standing around 1.90 m and weighing 140 kg, who had become flabby with a huge belly.<ref name=\"Buckton2015\">{{cite book|first=Oliver|last=Buckton|title=Espionage in British Fiction and Film since 1900: The Changing Enemy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZkpCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA244|date=8 October 2015|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-1-4985-0484-3|page=244|quote=Yet this suggestion of femininity in Blofeld's face is belied by his massive girth, his body \"weighed about twenty stone. It had once been all muscle ... but in the past ten years it had softened and he had a vast belly that he concealed behind roomy trousers.}}</ref>\n\nBlofeld appears or is heard in three novels: ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'', ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''; and ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]''; as well as eight films from [[Eon Productions]]: ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963); ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965); ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967); ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969); ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971); ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' (1981; the pre-title sequence of which shows an unnamed character resembling him fall to his death); ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015); and ''[[No Time to Die]]'' (2020). The latter two films are set in an rebooted continuity, which started with ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006). He also appears in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983), a remake of ''Thunderball'' that was not produced by Eon.\n\nBlofeld has been played on screen by [[Donald Pleasence]], [[Telly Savalas]], [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], [[Max von Sydow]], and [[Christoph Waltz]], among others. It was initially a convention of the films not to show Blofeld's face, only a close-up of him stroking his white, blue-eyed [[Persian cat]]. His face's first appearance is in ''You Only Live Twice'' as he introduces himself to Bond (whom he is meeting face-to-face for the first time) after previously appearing in the \"traditional\" way in earlier parts of the film.\n\nMany of Blofeld's characteristics have become [[trope (literature)|trope]]s in popular fiction, representing the [[stock character]] of the criminal mastermind, with the stroking of his white cat often retained as a parodic allusion to Blofeld's character. This can be seen in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|''Austin Powers'' film series]] with the character of [[Dr. Evil]] and his cat Mr. Bigglesworth, or in the cartoons ''[[Inspector Gadget]]'' and with the character of Dr. Claw, ''[[Danger Mouse (1981 TV series)|Danger Mouse]]'' with the character of Baron Silas Greenback.\n\n==Character==\nIan Fleming includes information about Blofeld's background in his novel ''Thunderball''. According to the novel, Blofeld was born on 28 May 1908 (which is also Fleming's birthday) in [[Gdynia|Gdingen]], [[Imperial Germany]] (now [[Gdynia]], [[Poland]]); his father Ernst George Blofeld was Polish, and his mother Maria Stavro Michelopoulos was Greek, hence his Greek name Stavro.<ref name=\"Griswold 2006 34\">{{cite book|first=John|last=Griswold|title=Ian Fleming's James Bond: Annotations and Chronologies for Ian Fleming's Bond Stories|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, Indiana|date=2006|ISBN=978-1425931001|page=34}}</ref> After [[World War I]], Blofeld became a Polish national. As a young man, he was well-versed in the social science disciplines, but also in the natural science and technology disciplines. He first graduated from the [[University of Warsaw]] with a degree in Political History and Economics, and then from the [[Warsaw University of Technology]] with a degree in Engineering and [[Radionics]]. He was then hired by the [[Ministry of Post and Telegraphs (Poland)|Polish Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs]] and appointed to a sensitive communication position, which he used for buying and selling stocks at the [[Warsaw Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjnewton.demon.co.uk/bond/blofeld.htm |title=The Bond Film Informant: Ernst Stavro Blofeld |publisher=Mjnewton.demon.co.uk |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108184939/http://www.mjnewton.demon.co.uk/bond/blofeld.htm|archivedate=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nForeseeing [[World War II]], Blofeld made copies of top-secret wires and sold them for cash to [[Nazi Germany]]. Before the German [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, he destroyed all records of his existence, then moved first to Sweden, then to Turkey, where he worked for [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|Turkish Radio]] and began to set up his own private intelligence organisation. During the war, he sold information to both sides. After the defeat of [[Erwin Rommel]], he decided to back the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, and was awarded numerous medals by the Allied powers after the war's end. Blofeld then moved temporarily to South America before founding [[SPECTRE]].\n\nIn the [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]] novel ''[[For Special Services]]'', Blofeld is depicted as having had a daughter named Nena with a French prostitute.\n\nAlthough Fleming himself never confirmed it, it is generally thought that the character of Blofeld was based on real-life Greek arms dealer [[Basil Zaharoff]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard B.|last=Spence|chapter=Aleister Crowley, Sidney Reilly, Basil Zaharoff: Their Influence on the Creation of James Bond and His World|editor1-first=Jack|editor1-last=Becker|editor2-first=Freedonia|editor2-last=Paschall|editor3-first=Robert|editor3-last=Weiner|title=James Bond and Popular Culture: The Films Are Not Enough|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Press|location=Cambridge, England|ISBN=978-0786477937|date=2010}}</ref> It is commonly believed that the name Blofeld was inspired by the English [[cricket]] commentator [[Henry Blofeld]]'s father, with whom Fleming went to school.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/26b37783#p009375w |title=BBC Radio 4 \u2013 Desert Island Discs, Henry Blofeld |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=5 December 2003 |accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> Henry Blofeld offered on the [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[Just a Minute]]'' that \"Ian took my father's name as the name of the baddie.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b038xmf6/Just_a_Minute_Series_67_Episode_3/ |title=BBC Radio 4 \u2013 Just a Minute, Series 67, Episode 3 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==In novels==\nBlofeld has three appearances in Ian Fleming's novels. He first appears in a minor role as the leader of SPECTRE in the 1961 novel ''Thunderball''. The plot that he formulates is carried out by his second-in-command [[Emilio Largo]]. Blofeld is described physically as a massive man, weighing roughly 140 kg, who had previously been a champion amateur weightlifter in his youth before becoming obese in middle age; he has black crew-cut hair, black eyes (similar to those of [[Benito Mussolini]]), heavy eyelashes, a thin mouth, and long pointed hands and feet. He has violet-scented breath from chewing flavored [[Throat lozenge|cachous]] (breath mints), a habit he adopts whenever he must deliver bad news. A meticulous planner of formidable intellect, he seems to be without conscience but not necessarily insane, and is motivated solely by financial gain; one novel even makes reference to an instance where a young woman was taken hostage to extract a ransom from her father, and after learning that the woman was raped by one of her guards after the ransom was paid and the girl returned, Blofeld killed the guard and returned some of the ransom as compensation, as he had guaranteed that she would be returned unharmed. Blofeld's lifestyle is described in one chapter in ''Thunderball'': \"For the rest, he didn't smoke or drink and he had never been known to sleep with a member of either sex. He didn't even eat very much.\"\n\nBlofeld is absent from the next novel, ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', though its events take place while Bond is battling SPECTRE in North America. In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1963), Bond learns that Blofeld has altered his appearance radically \u2014he is now tall and thin; has reduced his weight to {{convert|12|st}}; sports long silver hair, a [[syphilitic]] infection on his nose, and no earlobes; he wears dark green tinted contact lenses to hide his distinctive eyes. Perhaps less calculating than previously, he is notably saddled with the exploitable weakness of snobbery about his assumed nobility, indicating that he is losing his sanity. He is hiding in Switzerland in the guise of the Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp and Bond defeats his vindictive plans to destroy Britain's agricultural economy. In the final sequence of the novel, Blofeld gets revenge by murdering Bond's new wife, [[Tracy Bond|Tracy]].\n\nIn ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'', published in 1964, Blofeld returns and Bond finds him hiding in Japan under the alias Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. He has once again changed his appearance. He has put on some muscle, and has a gold-capped tooth, a fully healed nose, and a drooping grey mustache. Bond describes Blofeld on their confrontation as being \"a big man, perhaps six foot three (190 cm), and powerfully built.\" It is indicated that Blofeld has by now gone completely insane, as he all but admits himself when Bond levels the accusation. Bond strangles him to death in a fit of rage at the end of the novel (something that he had done only once before, to [[Auric Goldfinger]]). In both ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' and ''You Only Live Twice'', Blofeld is aided in his schemes by Irma Bunt, who is clearly his lover in the latter, and posing as Shatterhand's wife. Bond incapacitates her in their Japanese castle base before it blows up, killing Bunt. The final mention of Blofeld is in the beginning of the next novel, ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', published in 1965.\n\n==In films==\n===Original timeline===\n[[File:ESBlofelds.png|thumb|right|Blofeld in ''You Only Live Twice'' ([[Donald Pleasence]]), ''On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service'' ([[Telly Savalas]]), ''Diamonds Are Forever'' ([[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]), ''Never Say Never Again'' ([[Max von Sydow]]) and ''Spectre'' ([[Christoph Waltz]])]]\n\nIn the film series, Blofeld first appears in ''From Russia with Love'' (credited as \"Ernst Blofeld\", though the name is never heard), then in ''Thunderball'' (uncredited).  In these two appearances, his name is never spoken, his face is not seen, and only his lower body is visible as he strokes his trademark white cat.\n\n[[Czechs|Czech]] actor [[Jan Werich]] was originally cast by producer [[Harry Saltzman]] to play Blofeld in ''You Only Live Twice''.  Upon his arrival at the [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] set, both producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and director [[Lewis Gilbert]] felt that he was a bad choice, resembling a \"poor, benevolent [[Santa Claus]].\"  Nonetheless, in an attempt to make the casting work, Gilbert continued filming.  After five days, both Gilbert and Broccoli determined that Werich was not menacing enough, and recast [[Donald Pleasence]] in the role \u2013 the official excuse being that Werich was ill.<ref name=\"MGM documentary\">{{cite video| title =Inside You Only Live Twice: An Original Documentary | medium=Television | people=Production Staff | publisher=MGM Home Entertainment Inc| date= 2000}}</ref>\n\nIn the third, fourth, and fifth appearances{{spaced ndash}}''You Only Live Twice'', ''On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service'' and ''Diamonds Are Forever''{{spaced ndash}}he is the primary antagonist, meeting Bond face-to-face.  During the opening sequence of ''Diamonds Are Forever'', he reveals to Bond that some of his men have undergone [[plastic surgery]] to become his decoy duplicates.\n\nIn the film version of ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', he is not [[Tracy Bond]]'s actual killer.  He drives the car from which Irma Bunt ([[Ilse Steppat]]) fires the fatal shots at Tracy, minutes after she marries Bond.\n\nIn a sixth appearance{{spaced ndash}}in the pre-credit sequence of ''For Your Eyes Only''{{spaced ndash}}he is an anonymous, bald, wheelchair-bound villain trying to kill Bond once again.

In this continuity, he was born '''Franz Oberhauser''', the son of Hannes Oberhauser, Bond's legal guardian after being orphaned at the age of 11, making him and Bond adoptive brothers. As a young man, he murdered his father, staged his own death, and took on the alias of \"Ernst Stavro Blofeld\" using his mother's maiden name. He then assembled the global criminal organisation known as Spectre. He is revealed to have been trying for years to destroy Bond whom he resents for having been his father's favourite; he is thus revealed to have been the power behind the villains of the previous three films who were all Spectre agents. At the end of the film, Bond has him at gunpoint, but spares his life. M, who is looking on, takes Blofeld into custody after foiling his plan to take control of the world's national security intelligence data. This incarnation again wears a jacket without lapels, has a full head of hair, and is disfigured in the course of the film, echoing Donald Pleasence's version's duelling scar. He is also briefly shown with a white Persian cat.\n\nBlofeld, again portrayed by Waltz, will appear in the upcoming Bond film ''[[No Time to Die]]''.<ref>{{Cite web||url=https://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/no-time-to-die-new-information-ahead-of-teaser-trailer-release?id=04613|title=One Last Thing... |date=2019-09-03 |website=MI6-HQ.com |access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n\n===Table of film appearances===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Film \n!Actor and notes\n!Status after the film concludes\n|-\n|1963\n|''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''\n|[[Anthony Dawson]] as actor (only hands and back of head are seen), [[Eric Pohlmann]] as voice actor; the end credits list a [[question mark]] instead of an actor's name in the \"Ernst Blofeld\" field (however, he is only referred to as \"Number One\" in the film).\n| Active/indirect involvement in the field.
