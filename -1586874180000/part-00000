He first came to international prominence as a close collaborator of explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]], organizing [[humanitarian relief]] during the [[Russian famine of 1921]] in [[Volga region|Povolzhye]]. He was posted as a Norwegian diplomat to the Soviet Union, and for some time also managed British diplomatic affairs there. He returned to Norway in 1929, and served as [[Minister of Defence (Norway)|Minister of Defence]] in [[List of Norwegian governments|the governments]] of [[Peder Kolstad]] (1931\u201332) and [[Jens Hundseid]] (1932\u201333), representing the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Farmers' Party]].\n\nIn 1933, Quisling left the Farmers' Party and founded the fascist party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (National Union). Although he achieved some popularity after his attacks on the [[Left-wing politics|political left]], his party failed to win any seats in the [[Storting]] and by 1940 it was still little more than peripheral. On 9 April 1940, with the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]] in progress, he attempted to seize power in the world's first radio-broadcast ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]],'' but failed after the Germans refused to support his government.  From 1942 to 1945 he served as [[Prime Minister of Norway]], heading the Norwegian state administration jointly with the German [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|civilian administrator]] [[Josef Terboven]]. His pro-Nazi [[puppet government]], known as the [[Quisling regime]], was dominated by ministers from Nasjonal Samling. The [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] government participated in Germany's genocidal [[Final Solution]].\n\nQuisling was put on trial during the [[legal purge in Norway after World War II]]. He was found guilty of charges including [[embezzlement]], [[murder]] and [[high treason]] against the Norwegian state, and was sentenced to [[capital punishment|death]]. He was [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] at [[Akershus Fortress]], Oslo, on 24 October 1945. The word \"[[quisling]]\" became a byword for \"collaborator\" or \"traitor\" in several languages, reflecting the contempt with which Quisling's conduct has been regarded, both at the time and since his death.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Familien Quisling ca. 1915..jpg|thumb|Vidkun Quisling (far left) with his family, {{circa}}&nbsp;1915]]\n\n=== Background ===\nVidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonss\u00f8n Quisling ({{Audio|IPA Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonss\u00f8n Quisling.ogg|Norwegian pronunciation}}) was born on 18 July 1887 in [[Fyresdal]], in the Norwegian county of [[Telemark]]. He was the son of [[Church of Norway]] pastor and [[genealogist]] Jon Lauritz Qvisling (1844\u20131930) and his wife Anna Caroline Bang (1860\u20131941),<ref name=\"borgen273\">{{harvnb|Borgen|1999|p=273}}.</ref> the daughter of J\u00f8rgen Bang, [[ship-owner]] and at the time the richest man in the town of [[Grimstad]] in South Norway.<ref name=\"juritzen11\">{{harvnb|Juritzen|1988|p=11}}</ref> The elder Quisling had lectured in Grimstad in the 1870s; one of his pupils was Bang, whom he married on 28 May 1886, following a long engagement. The newly-wed couple promptly moved to Fyresdal, where Vidkun and his younger siblings were born.<ref name=\"juritzen11\" />\n\nThe family name derives from ''Quislinus,'' a [[Latinisation of names|Latinised name]] invented by Quisling's ancestor Lauritz Ibsen Quislin (1634\u20131703), based on the village of Kvislemark near [[Slagelse]], Denmark, whence he had emigrated.<ref>{{harvnb|Juritzen|1988|p=12}}.</ref> Having two brothers and a sister,<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=6, 13\u201314}}.</ref> the young Quisling was \"shy and quiet but also loyal and helpful, always friendly, occasionally breaking into a warm smile.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=21}}.</ref> Private letters later found by historians also indicate a warm and affectionate relationship between the family members.<ref>{{harvnb|Juritzen|1988|p=15}}.</ref> From 1893 to 1900, his father was a [[chaplain]] for the [[Str\u00f8ms\u00f8]] borough in [[Drammen]]. Here, Vidkun went to school for the first time. He was bullied by other students at the school for his Telemark dialect, but proved a successful student.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|p=10}}.</ref> In 1900, the family moved to [[Skien]] when his father was appointed [[Provost (religion)|provost]] of the city.<ref name=\"borgen275\">{{harvnb|Borgen|1999|p=275}}.</ref>\n\nAcademically Quisling proved talented in [[humanities]], particularly history, and [[natural sciences]]; he specialised in mathematics. At this point, however, his life had no clear direction.<ref name=\"dahl6\" /> In 1905, Quisling enrolled at the [[Norwegian Military Academy]], having received the highest entrance examination score of the 250 applicants that year.<ref name=\"dahl6\" /> Transferring in 1906 to the [[Norwegian Military College]], he graduated with the highest score since the college's inception in 1817, and was rewarded by an audience with [[Haakon VII of Norway|the King]].<ref name=\"borgen275\" /><ref name=\"dahl6\" /> On 1 November 1911, he joined the army General Staff.<ref name=\"dahl6\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> Norway was neutral in the [[First World War]]; Quisling detested the peace movement, though the high human cost of the war did temper his views.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=25}}.</ref> In March 1918, he was sent to Russia as an attach\u00e9 at the Norwegian [[legation]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], to take advantage of the five years he had spent studying the country.<ref name=\"borgen275\" /><ref name=\"dahl28\" /> Though dismayed at the living conditions he experienced, Quisling nonetheless concluded that \"the [[Bolshevik]]s have got an extraordinarily strong hold on Russian society\" and marvelled at how [[Leon Trotsky]] had managed to mobilise the [[Red Army]] forces so well;<ref name=\"dahl28\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=28\u201329}}.</ref> by contrast, in granting too many rights to the people of Russia, the [[Russian Provisional Government]] under [[Alexander Kerensky]] had brought about its own downfall. When the legation was recalled in December 1918, Quisling became the Norwegian military's expert on Russian affairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=32\u201334, 38}}.</ref>\n\n=== Travels ===\n{{rquote|right|Quisling replied [that] the Russian people needed wise leadership and proper training [that they suffered from] indifference, a lack of clearly defined goals with conviction and a happy-go-lucky attitude [and that] it is impossible to accomplish anything without willpower, determination and concentration.|Alexandra recounts a conversation with her soon-to-be husband|{{harvnb|Yourieff|2007|p=93}}}}\n[[File:Vidkun Quisling og hans kone Maria..jpg|thumb|Quisling and his second wife, [[Maria Quisling|Maria]]]]\nIn September 1919, Quisling departed Norway to become an intelligence officer with the Norwegian delegation in [[Helsinki]], a post that combined diplomacy and politics.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=38\u201339}}.</ref> In the autumn of 1921, Quisling left Norway once again, this time at the request of explorer and humanitarian [[Fridtjof Nansen]], and in January 1922 arrived in the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian]] capital [[Kharkov]] to help with the [[League of Nations]] humanitarian relief effort there.<ref name=\"Cohen2000\">{{cite book|author=Maynard M.

Alexandra wrote in her memoirs that Quisling declared his love for her,<ref>{{harvnb|Yourieff|2007|p=100}}.</ref> but based on his letters home and investigations undertaken by his cousins, it appears that there was never any question of romantic involvement between the two. Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the girl out of poverty by providing her with a Norwegian passport and financial security.<ref name=\"dahl45\" />\n\nHaving left Ukraine in September 1922, Quisling and Asja returned to Kharkov in February 1923 to prolong aid efforts, with Nansen describing Quisling's work as \"absolutely indispensable.\"<ref name=\"dahl45\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=45\u201347}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|p=33}}.</ref> Quisling found the situation much improved and, with no fresh challenges, found it a more boring trip than his last. He did however meet [[Maria Quisling|Maria Vasiljevna Pasetchnikova]] ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0301\u044f \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u0301\u0441\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430}}), a Ukrainian more than ten years his junior. Her diaries from the time \"indicate a blossoming love affair\" during the summer of 1923, despite Quisling's marriage to Asja the year before.<ref name=\"dahl45\" /> She recalled that she was impressed by his fluent command of the Russian language,  his Aryan appearance, and his gracious demeanour.<ref>{{harvnb|Quisling|1980|pp=30\u201331}}</ref> Quisling apparently married Pasetchnikova in Kharkov on 10 September 1923, although no legal documentation has been discovered. Quisling's biographer, Dahl, believes that in all likelihood the second marriage was never official.<ref name=\"dahl48\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=48\u201349}}.</ref> Regardless, the couple behaved as though they were married, and celebrated their wedding anniversary. Soon after the wedding, the aid mission came to an end and the trio left the Ukraine, and from the summer of 1923 onwards they planned to spend a year in Paris. Maria wanted to see Western Europe; Quisling wanted to get some rest following bouts of stomach pain that had lasted all winter.<ref name=\"dahl48\" />\n\n==== Paris, Eastern Europe and Norway ====\nThe stay in Paris required a temporary discharge from the army, which Quisling slowly grew to understand was permanent: army cutbacks meant that there would be no position available for him when he returned.<ref name=\"dahl50\" />{{refn|Increasingly bitter over the treatment he had received from the military, he eventually took up a post in the reserves on the reduced salary of a captain, and received a promotion to major in 1930.<ref name=\"dahl50\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=50}}.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} Quisling devoted much of his time in the French capital to study, reading works of political theory and working on his philosophical project, which he called ''Universism''. On 2 October 1923, he persuaded the Oslo daily newspaper ''[[Tidens Tegn]]'' to publish an article he had written calling for [[diplomatic recognition]] of the [[Soviet government]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|p=30}}.</ref> Quisling's stay in Paris did not last as long as planned, and in late 1923 he started work on Nansen's new [[repatriation]] project in the Balkans, arriving in [[Sofia]] in November. He spent the next two months travelling constantly with his wife Maria. In January she returned to Paris to look after Asja, who took on the role of the couple's foster-daughter; Quisling joined them in February.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=53\u201354}}.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1924, the trio returned to Norway where Asja subsequently left to live with an aunt in [[Nice, France|Nice]] and never returned.<ref name=\"dahl54\" /> Although Quisling promised to provide for her well-being, his payments were irregular, and over the coming years he would miss a number of opportunities to visit.<ref>{{harvnb|Yourieff|2007|pp=450\u2013452}}.</ref> Back in Norway, and to his later embarrassment, Quisling found himself drawn into the communist Norwegian labour movement. Among other policies, he fruitlessly advocated a people's [[militia]] to protect the country against [[reactionary]] attacks,<ref name=\"dahl54\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=54\u201356}}.</ref> and asked members of the movement whether they would like to know what information the General Staff had on them, but he got no response. Although this brief attachment to the far-left seems unlikely given Quisling's later political direction, Dahl suggests that, following a conservative childhood, he was by this time \"unemployed and dispirited&nbsp;... deeply resentful of the General Staff&nbsp;... [and] in the process of becoming politically more radical.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=57}}.</ref> Dahl adds that Quisling's political views at this time could be summarised as \"a fusion of socialism and nationalism,\" with definite sympathies for the Soviets in Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=58}}.</ref>\n\n==== Russia and the rouble scandal ====\n[[File:Dupuis-Nansen-Carle-Savio-Quisling.jpg|thumb|right|The Armenia commission of the League of Nations. 19 June 1925.

The pair began a tour of [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]], where they hoped to help repatriate native Armenians via a number of projects proposed for funding by the [[League of Nations]]. Despite Quisling's substantial efforts, however, the projects were all rejected. In May 1926, Quisling found another job with long-time friend and fellow Norwegian [[Frederik Prytz]] in Moscow, working as a liaison between Prytz and the Soviet authorities who owned half of Prytz's firm Onega Wood.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=59\u201362}}.</ref> He stayed in the job until Prytz prepared to close down the business in early 1927, when Quisling found new employment as a diplomat. British diplomatic affairs in Russia were being managed by Norway, and he became their new legation secretary; Maria joined him late in 1928. A massive scandal broke when Quisling and Prytz were accused of using diplomatic channels to smuggle millions of [[roubles]] onto the [[black market]]s, a much-repeated claim that was later used to support a charge of \"[[moral bankruptcy]],\" but neither it nor the charge that Quisling spied for the British has ever been substantiated.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=62\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nThe harder line now developing in Russian politics led Quisling to distance himself from Bolshevism. The Soviet government had rejected outright his Armenian proposals, and obstructed an attempt by Nansen to help with the 1928 Ukrainian famine. Quisling took these rebuffs as a personal insult; in 1929, with the British now keen to take back control of their own diplomatic affairs, he left Russia.<ref name=\"dahl67\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=67\u201369}}.</ref> He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for his services to Britain,<ref name=\"dahl67\" /> an honour revoked by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |title=People |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764097,00.html |work=Time Magazine |page=1 |date=24 June 1940|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> By this time, Quisling had also been awarded the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Romanian Crown Order]] and the Yugoslav [[Order of St. Sava]] for his earlier humanitarian efforts.<ref name=\"dahl67\" />\n\n== Early political career ==\n\n===Final return to Norway===\nHaving spent nine of the previous twelve years abroad, but with no practical experience in party politics outside the Norwegian Army, Quisling returned to Norway in December 1929, bringing with him a plan for change he termed ''Norsk Aktion,'' meaning \"Norwegian Action.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Borgen|1999|p=278}}.</ref> The planned organisation consisted of national, regional and local units with the intention of recruiting in the style of the [[Soviet Communist Party]]. Like ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]'' of the French right, it advocated radical constitutional changes. The [[Parliament of Norway]], or ''Storting,'' was to become [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] with the second chamber made up of Soviet-style elected representatives from the working population.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=4\u20135}}.</ref> Quisling focused more on organisation than the practicalities of government; for instance, all members of ''Norsk Aktion'' were to have their own designation in a militaristic hierarchy.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=7}}.</ref>\n\nQuisling next sold a large number of antiques and works of art that he had acquired cheaply in post-revolutionary Russia.<ref name=\"dahl12\" /> His collection stretched to some 200 paintings, including works claimed to be by [[Rembrandt]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne|C\u00e9zanne]] and numerous other masters. The collection, including \"veritable treasures,\" had been insured for almost 300,000 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]].<ref name=\"dahl12\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=12\u201313}}.</ref> In the spring of 1930, he again joined up with Prytz, who was back in Norway. They participated in regular group meetings that included middle-aged officers and business people, since described as \"the textbook definition of a [[Fascism|Fascist]] initiative group,\" through which Prytz appeared determined to launch Quisling into politics.<ref name=\"dahl70\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=70\u201373}}.</ref>\n\nAfter Nansen died on 13 May 1930, Quisling used his friendship with the editor of the ''Tidens Tegn'' newspaper to get his analysis of Nansen onto the front page.

Meanwhile, he and Prytz founded a new political movement, ''Nordisk folkereisning i Norge,'' or \"Nordic popular rising in Norway,\" with a central committee of 31 and Quisling as its ''[[F\u00fchrer|f\u00f8rer]]'' \u2013 a one-man executive committee \u2013 though Quisling seemed to have had no particular attachment to the term.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=73\u201376}}.</ref> The first meeting of the league took place on 17 March 1931, stating the purpose of the movement was to \"eliminate the imported and depraved communist insurgency.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|pp=54\u201355}}.</ref>\n\n=== Defence minister ===\nQuisling left ''Nordisk folkereisning i Norge'' in May 1931 to serve as defence minister in the [[Senterpartiet|Agrarian]] government of [[Peder Kolstad]], despite being neither an Agrarian nor a friend of Kolstad.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|p=64}}.</ref> He had been suggested to Kolstad for the post by [[Thorvald Aadahl]], editor of the Agrarian newspaper ''[[Nationen]],'' who was in turn influenced by Prytz.<ref name=\"dahl76\"/> The appointment came as a surprise to many in the Parliament of Norway.<ref>{{harvnb|Cohen|2000|p=51}}.</ref> Quisling's first action in the post was to deal with the aftermath of the [[Battle of Menstad]], an \"extremely bitter\" labour dispute, by sending in troops.<ref name=\"dahl76\"/><ref name=\"ringdal31\">{{harvnb|Ringdal|1989|p=31}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|pp=85\u201387}}.</ref> After narrowly avoiding criticism by the left wing over his handling of the dispute, and the revelation of his earlier \"militia\" plans, Quisling turned his attention to the perceived threat posed by communists.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|pp=76\u201380}}.</ref> He created a list of the [[Revolutionary Trade Union Opposition]] leadership, who had been the alleged agitators at Menstad; a number of them were eventually charged with [[subversion]] and violence against the police.<ref name=\"dahl76\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=76\u201378}}.</ref> Quisling's policies also resulted in the establishment of a permanent militia called the ''Leidang'' which, unlike the body he had previously planned, was to be counter-revolutionary. Despite the ready availability of junior officers in the reserve following defence cuts, only seven units were established in 1934, and funding restrictions meant that the enterprise included less than a thousand men before it faded away.<ref name=\"dahl78\"/> Sometime during the period 1930\u201333, Quisling's first wife, Asja, received notice of the annulment of her marriage to him.<ref>{{harvnb|Yourieff|2007|p=467}}.</ref>\n\nIn mid-1932 ''Nordisk folkereisning i Norge'' was forced to confirm that even though Quisling remained in the cabinet, he would not become a member of the party. They further stated that the party programme had no basis in fascism of any kind, including the [[Nazi|National Socialism]] model.<ref name=\"dahl78\" /> This did not dampen criticism of Quisling, who remained constantly in the headlines, although he was gradually earning a reputation as a disciplined and efficient administrator.<ref name=\"dahl78\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=78\u201381}}.</ref> After he was attacked in his office by a knife-wielding assailant who threw ground pepper in his face on 2 February 1932, some newspapers, instead of focusing on the attack itself, suggested that the assailant had been the jealous husband of one of Quisling's cleaners; others, especially those aligned with the Labour Party, posited that the whole thing had been staged.<ref name=\"dahl80\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|pp=83\u201384}}.</ref> In November 1932, Labour politician [[Johan Nygaardsvold]] put this theory to Parliament,<ref>{{harvnb|Hayes|1971|p=86}}</ref> prompting suggestions that charges of slander be brought against him.<ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|p=109}}.</ref> No charges were brought, and the identity of the assailant has never been confirmed.

In the coming months, tens of thousands of Norwegians followed suit and Quisling's summer was full of speeches to packed political rallies.<ref name=\"dahl83\"/> In Parliament, however, Quisling's speech was viewed as political suicide; not only was his evidence weak, but questions were raised as to why the information had not been handed over much sooner if the revolutionary threat were so serious.<ref name=\"dahl83\"/>\n\n=== Popular party leader ===\nOver the course of 1932 and into 1933, Prytz's influence over ''Nordisk folkereisning i Norge'' weakened and lawyer [[Johan Bernhard Hjort]] assumed the leadership role. Hjort was keen to work with Quisling because of his new-found popularity, and they devised a new programme of right-wing policies including proscription of revolutionary parties including those funded by foreign bodies such as [[Comintern]], the suspension of the voting rights for people in receipt of [[social welfare]], agricultural debt relief, and an audit of public finances.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=89\u201390}}.</ref> In 1932, during the [[Olaf Kullmann|Kullmann Affair]], Quisling turned on the prime minister for questioning his hard-line stance over pacifist agitator Captain [[Olaf Kullmann]]. In a memorandum laying out his proposals for economic and social reform distributed to the entire cabinet, Quisling called for the prime minister to stand down.<ref name=\"dahl92\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=92\u201393}}.</ref> As the government began to collapse, Quisling's personal popularity reached new heights; he was referred to as \"man of the year,\" and there were expectations of forthcoming electoral success.<ref name=\"dahl92\" />\n\nDespite the new programme, some of Quisling's circle still favoured a cabinet coup. He later said he had even considered the use of force to overthrow the government but, in late February, it was the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] that brought them down. With the assistance of Hjort and Prytz, ''Nordisk folkereisning i Norge'' quickly became a political party, ''[[Nasjonal Samling]],'' or NS, literally \"National Unity,\" ready to contest the forthcoming October election. Quisling was mildly disappointed and would have preferred to head a national movement, not just one of seven political parties. ''Nasjonal Samling'' soon afterwards announced it would support candidates from other parties if they supported its key aim of \"establishing a strong and stable national government independent of ordinary party politics.\" Although not an overnight success in the already crowded political spectrum, the party slowly gained support. With its Nazi-inspired belief in the central authority of a strong ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip|F\u00fchrer]]'', as well as its powerful propaganda elements, it gained support from many among the Oslo upper classes, and began to give the impression that \"big money\" lay behind it.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref>\n\nIncreased support also materialised when the ''Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp,'' the Norwegian Farmers' Aid Association, sought financial aid from ''Nasjonal Samling,'' who in turn gained political influence and a useful existing network of well-trained party officers. Quisling's party never managed a grand anti-socialist coalition, however, in part because of competition from the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] for right-wing votes.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=97\u201399}}.</ref> Though Quisling remained unable to demonstrate any skill as an orator, his reputation for scandal nonetheless ensured that the electorate were aware of ''Nasjonal Samling's'' existence. As a result, the party showed only moderate success in the [[1933 Norwegian parliamentary election|October elections]], with 27,850 votes\u2014approximately two per cent of the national vote, and about three and a half per cent of the vote in constituencies where it fielded candidates.<ref name=\"dahl99\" /> This made it the fifth largest party in Norway, out-polling the Communists but not the Conservative, Labour, Liberal or Agrarian parties, and failing to secure a single seat in Parliament.<ref name=\"dahl99\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=99\u2013100}}.</ref>\n\n=== ''F\u00f8rer'' of a party in decline ===\nAfter the underwhelming election results, Quisling's attitude to negotiation and compromise hardened.<ref name=\"dahl100\" /> A final attempt to form a coalition of the right in March 1934 came to nothing, and from late 1933, Quisling's ''Nasjonal Samling'' began to carve out its own form of national socialism. With no leader in Parliament, however, the party struggled to introduce the constitutional reform bill needed to achieve its lofty ambitions. When Quisling tried to introduce the bill directly, it was swiftly rejected,<ref name=\"dahl100\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=100\u2013105}}.</ref> and the party went into decline. In the summer of 1935, headlines quoted Quisling telling opponents that \"heads [would] roll\" as soon as he achieved power. The threat irreparably damaged the image of his party, and over the following few months several high-ranking members resigned, including [[Kai Fjell]] and Quisling's brother J\u00f8rgen.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=105\u2013109}}.</ref>\n\nQuisling began to familiarise himself with the international fascist movement, attending the [[1934 Montreux Fascist conference]] in December. For his party, the association with [[Italian fascism]] could not have come at a worse time, so soon after headlines of illegal [[Abyssinia crisis|Italian incursions into Abyssinia]].<ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|pp=204\u2013205}}.</ref> On his return trip from Montreux, he met Nazi [[ideologue]] and foreign policy theorist [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and though he preferred to see his own policies as a synthesis of Italian fascism and German Nazism, by the time of the 1936 elections, Quisling had in part become the \"Norwegian Hitler\" that his opponents had long accused him of being.<ref name=\"dahl110\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=110\u2013117}}.</ref> Part of this was due to his hardening [[anti-Semitic]] stance, associating Judaism with Marxism, liberalism and, increasingly, anything else he found objectionable, and part as a result of ''Nasjonal Samling's'' growing similarity to the German Nazi Party. Despite receiving an unexpected boost when the Norwegian government acceded to Soviet demands to arrest Leon Trotsky, the party's election campaign never gained momentum. Although Quisling sincerely believed he had the support of around 100,000 voters, and declared to his party that they would win an absolute minimum of ten seats, ''Nasjonal Samling'' managed to poll just 26,577, fewer than in 1933 when they had fielded candidates in only half the districts.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=117\u2013126}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|p=236}}.</ref> Under this pressure, the party split in two, with Hjort leading the breakaway group; although fewer than fifty members left immediately, many more drifted away during 1937.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=128}}.</ref>\n\nDwindling party membership created many problems for Quisling, especially financial ones. For years he had been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one [[Frans Hals]] painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the [[Great Depression]], even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=130\u2013133}}.</ref> His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned [[Constitution of Norway|constitutional reform]] of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.<ref name=\"dahl134\" />\n\n== World War II ==\n\n=== Coming of war ===\nIn 1939, Quisling turned his attention towards Norway's preparations for the anticipated European war, which he believed involved a drastic increase in the country's defence spending to guarantee its neutrality. Meanwhile, Quisling presented lectures entitled \"The Jewish problem in Norway\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Maynard M. Cohen|title=A Stand Against Tyranny: Norway's Physicians and the Nazis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cmx6u2GF80C&pg=PA53|date=1 September 2000|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=0-8143-2934-9|pages=53\u2013}}</ref> and supported [[Adolf Hitler]] in what appeared to be growing future conflict. Despite condemning ''[[Kristallnacht]],'' he sent the German leader a fiftieth-birthday greeting thanking him for \"saving Europe from Bolshevism and Jewish domination\".<ref name=\"dahl134\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=134\u2013137}}.</ref> Quisling also contended that should an Anglo-Russian alliance make neutrality impossible, Norway would have \"to go with Germany.\"<ref name=\"dahl137\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=137\u2013142}}.</ref> Invited to the country in the summer of 1939, he began a tour of a number of German and Danish cities. He was received particularly well in Germany, which promised funds to boost ''Nasjonal Samling's'' standing in Norway, and hence spread pro-Nazi sentiment. When war broke out on 1 September 1939, Quisling felt vindicated by both the event and the immediate superiority displayed by the German army. He remained outwardly confident that, despite its size, his party would soon become the centre of political attention.<ref name=\"dahl137\" />\n\nFor the next nine months, Quisling continued to lead a party that was at best peripheral to Norwegian politics.<ref name=\"dahl137\" /> He was nonetheless active, and in October 1939 he worked with Prytz on an ultimately unsuccessful plan for peace between Britain, France and Germany and their eventual participation in a new economic union. Quisling also mused on how Germany ought to go on the offensive against its ally the Soviet Union, and on 9 December travelled to Germany to present his multi-faceted plans.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=142\u2013149}}.</ref> After impressing German officials, he won an audience with Hitler himself, scheduled for 14 December, whereupon he received firm advice from his contacts that the most useful thing he could do would be to ask for Hitler's help with a pro-German coup in Norway,{{refn|Quisling considered the fourth and constitutionally dubious session of the Parliament of Norway, due to open on 10 January 1940, as the mostly likely time for ''Nasjonal Samling'' to face an exploitable crisis.

Thereafter, Norway would maintain official neutrality as long as possible, and finally the country would fall under German rather than British control.<ref>{{cite book|title=The German Northern Theater of Operations 1940\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nw0VAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA8|publisher=Brill Archive|pages=8\u2013|id=GGKEY:BQN0CQURHS1}}</ref> It is not clear how much Quisling himself understood about the strategic implications of such a move, and he instead relied on his future Minister of Domestic Affairs, [[Albert Viljam Hagelin|Albert Hagelin]], who was fluent in German, to put the relevant arguments to German officials in Berlin during pre-meeting talks, even though Hagelin was prone to damaging exaggeration at times.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=149\u2013152}}.</ref> Quisling and his German contacts almost certainly went away with different views as to whether they had agreed upon the necessity of a German invasion.<ref name=\"dahl153\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=153\u2013156}}.</ref>\n\nOn 14 December 1939, Quisling met Hitler. The German leader promised to respond to any British invasion of Norway ([[Plan R 4]]), perhaps pre-emptively, with a German counter-invasion, but found Quisling's plans for both a Norwegian coup and an Anglo-German peace unduly optimistic. Nonetheless, Quisling would still receive funds to bolster ''Nasjonal Samling.''{{refn|Immediately after the meeting on 14 December, Hitler ordered his staff to draw up preparations for an invasion of Norway.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=157}}.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} The two men met again four days later, and afterwards Quisling wrote a memorandum that explicitly told Hitler that he did not consider himself a National Socialist.<ref name=\"dahl153\" /> As German machinations continued, Quisling was intentionally kept in the dark. He was also incapacitated by a severe bout of illness, probably [[nephritis]] in both kidneys, for which he refused hospitalisation. Though he returned to work on 13 March 1940, he remained ill for several weeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=160\u2013162}}.</ref> In the meantime, the [[Altmark Incident]] complicated Norway's efforts to maintain its neutrality. Hitler himself remained in two minds over whether an occupation of Norway should require an invitation from the Norwegian government. Finally, Quisling received his summons on 31 March, and reluctantly travelled to [[Copenhagen]] to meet with Nazi intelligence officers who asked him for information on Norwegian defences and defence protocols. He returned to Norway on 6 April and, on 8 April, the British [[Operation Wilfred]] commenced, bringing Norway into the war. With [[Allied campaign in Norway|Allied forces in Norway]], Quisling expected a characteristically swift German response.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=162\u2013170}}.</ref>\n\n=== German invasion and coup d'\u00e9tat ===\n{{see also|Quisling regime#1940 coup}}\n\nIn the early hours of 9 April 1940, [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|Germany invaded Norway]] by air and sea, as \"Operation ''Weser\u00fcbung,\"'' or \"Operation Weser Exercise,\" intending to capture King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]] and the government of Prime Minister [[Johan Nygaardsvold]]. However, alert to the possibility of invasion, [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative]] [[President of the Storting|President of the Parliament]] [[C. J.

After hours of discussion, Quisling and his German counterparts decided that an immediate coup was necessary, though this was not the preferred option of either Germany's ambassador [[Curt Br\u00e4uer]] or the German Foreign Ministry.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=170\u2013172}}.</ref>\n\nIn the afternoon, Quisling was told by German liaison [[Hans-Wilhelm Scheidt]] that should he set up a government, it would have Hitler's personal approval. Quisling drew up a list of ministers and, although it had merely relocated some {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=}} to [[Elverum]], accused the legitimate government of having \"fled.\"{{refn|The option of a \"Danish solution\"\u2014welcoming the invaders in order to avoid conflict\u2014was still on the table.

He also revoked an earlier order to mobilise against the German invasion.<ref name=\"dahl172\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Ringdal|1989|p=58}}.</ref> He still lacked legitimacy. Two orders\u2014the first, to a friend in the military (Colonel Hans Sommerfeldt Hiorth, the commanding officer of the army regiment at Elverum<ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|p=377}}.</ref>) to arrest the government, and the second, to the [[Kristian Welhaven|Oslo chief of police]]\u2014were both ignored. At 22:00, Quisling resumed broadcasting, repeating his earlier message and reading out a list of new ministers. Hitler lent his support as promised, and recognised the new Norwegian government under Quisling within 24 hours.<ref name=\"dahl172\" /> Norwegian batteries were still firing on the German invasion force, and at 03:00 on 10 April, Quisling acceded to a German request to halt the resistance of the [[Bol\u00e6rne]] fortress.{{refn|Though now accepted, this charge was later one of the few for which the jury at Quisling's trial did not find sufficient evidence.<ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|p=755}}.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}<ref>{{harvnb|Hayes|1971|p=221}}.</ref> As a result of actions such as these, it was claimed at the time that Quisling's seizure of power in a [[puppet government]] had been part of the German plan all along.<ref>{{harvnb|Block (ed.)|1940|pp=669\u2013670}}.</ref>\n\nQuisling now reached the high-water mark of his political power. On 10 April, Br\u00e4uer travelled to Elverum where the legitimate [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Nygaardsvold government]] now sat. On Hitler's orders, he demanded that King Haakon appoint Quisling head of a new government, thereby securing a peaceful transition of power. Haakon rejected this demand.<ref name=\"dahl175\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=175\u2013178}}</ref> He went further in a meeting with his cabinet, letting it be known that he would sooner abdicate than appoint any government headed by Quisling. Hearing this, the government unanimously voted to support the king's stance,<ref name=\"hoidal384\">{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|p=384}}.</ref> and urged the people to continue their resistance.<ref name=\"dahl175\" /> With his popular support gone, Quisling ceased to be of use to Hitler. Germany retracted its support for his rival government, preferring instead to build up its own independent governing commission. In this way, Quisling was manoeuvred out of power by Br\u00e4uer and a coalition of his former allies, including Hjort, who now saw him as a liability. Even his political allies, including Prytz, deserted him.<ref name=\"dahl175\" />\n\nIn return, Hitler wrote to Quisling thanking him for his efforts and guaranteeing him some sort of position in the new government. The transfer of power on these terms was duly enacted on 15 April, with Hitler still confident the [[Administrative Council (Norway)|Administrative Council]] would receive the backing of the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=183}}.</ref> Quisling's domestic and international reputation both hit new lows, casting him as both a traitor and a failure.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=183\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\n=== Head of the government ===\n{{see also|Quisling regime}}\nOnce the king had declared the German commission unlawful, it became clear that he would never be won over. An impatient Hitler appointed a German, [[Josef Terboven]], as the new Norwegian ''[[Reichskommissar]],'' or Governor-General, on 24 April, reporting directly to him. Despite Hitler's assurances, Terboven wanted to make sure that there would be no room in the government for the ''Nasjonal Samling'' nor its leader Quisling, with whom he did not get along.<ref name=\"dahl188\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=188\u2013194}}.</ref> Terboven eventually accepted a certain ''Nasjonal Samling'' presence in the government during June, but remained unconvinced about Quisling. As a result, on 25 June, Terboven forced Quisling to step down as leader of the ''Nasjonal Samling'' and take a temporary leave of absence in Germany.<ref name=\"dahl188\" /> Quisling remained there until 20 August, while Rosenberg and Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], whom he had met on his earlier visit to Berlin, negotiated on his behalf. In the end, Quisling returned \"in triumph,\" having won Hitler over in a meeting on 16 August.

By the time he returned on 13 December, he had agreed to raise volunteers to fight with the German ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS). In January, SS head [[Heinrich Himmler]] travelled to Norway to oversee preparations. Quisling clearly believed that if Norway supported Nazi Germany on the battlefield, there would be no reason for Germany to annex it. To this end, he opposed plans to have a German SS brigade loyal only to Hitler installed in Norway.<ref name=\"dahl219\" /> In the process, he also toughened his attitude to the country harbouring the exiled king, the United Kingdom, which he no longer saw as a Nordic ally. Finally, Quisling aligned Norwegian policy on Jews with that of Germany, giving a speech in Frankfurt on 26 March 1941 in which he argued for compulsory exile, but warned against [[Final Solution|extermination]].<ref name=\"dahl219\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=219\u2013225}}.</ref>\n\nIn May, Quisling was shattered by the death of his mother Anna, as the two had been particularly close. At the same time, the political crisis over Norwegian independence deepened, with Quisling threatening Terboven with his resignation over the issue of finance. In the end, the Reichskommissar agreed to compromise on the issue, but Quisling had to concede on the SS issue: A brigade was formed, but as a branch of the ''Nasjonal Samling.''<ref name=\"dahl219\" />\n\n[[File:\u00c6reskompanier, Vidkun Quisling, Josef Terboven og norske polititropper (8618020299).jpg|thumb|Vidkun Quisling (left) and Reichskommissar Josef Terboven (center) inspect an honorary partnership of [[Statspolitiet]] (State Police) officers in 1942]]\n[[File:Quisling Terboven Hirden.jpg|thumb|Quisling (left) and Terboven (right) in front of an honorary partnership of the [[paramilitary]] [[Hirden]]]]\nMeanwhile, the government line hardened, with Communist Party leaders arrested and trade unionists intimidated. On 10 September 1941, [[Viggo Hansteen]] and [[Rolf Wickstr\u00f8m]] were executed and many more imprisoned following the [[milk strike]] in Oslo. Hansteen's execution was later seen as a watershed moment, dividing the occupation into its more innocent and more deadly phases.<ref name=\"dahl225\" /> The same year ''[[Statspolitiet]]'' (\"the State Police\"), abolished in 1937, was reestablished to assist the [[Gestapo]] in Norway, and radio sets were confiscated across the country. Though these were all Terboven's decisions, Quisling agreed with them and went on to denounce the government-in-exile as \"traitors.\" As a result of the toughened stance, an informal \"ice front\" emerged, with ''Nasjonal Samling'' supporters ostracised from society.<ref name=\"dahl225\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=225\u2013232}}.</ref> Quisling remained convinced this was an anti-German sentiment that would fade away once Berlin had handed power over to ''Nasjonal Samling.'' However, the only concessions he won in 1941 were having the heads of ministries promoted to official ministers of the government and independence for the party secretariat.<ref name=\"dahl232\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=232\u2013237}}.</ref>\n\nIn January 1942, Terboven announced the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved the transfer of power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful it would happen, since Germany and Norway were in the midst of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], while Terboven insisted that the ''Reichskommissariat'' would remain in power until such peace came about.<ref name=\"dahl232\" /> Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=240\u2013242}}.</ref>\n\nAfter a brief postponement, an announcement was made on 1 February 1942, detailing how the cabinet had elected Quisling to the post of [[Minister-President]] of the national government.<ref>{{harvnb|Borgen|1999|p=284}}.</ref><ref name=\"dahl247\" /> The appointment was accompanied by a banquet, rallying, and other celebrations by the ''Nasjonal Samling'' members. In his first speech, Quisling committed the government to closer ties with Germany. The only change to the Constitution was the reinstatement of the [[History of the Jews in Norway|ban on Jewish entry into Norway]], which had been [[Norwegian Constitution#Development|abolished in 1851]].<ref name=\"dahl247\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=247\u2013249}}.</ref>\n\n=== Minister President ===\n[[File:Quisling's office at the Royal Palace 1945.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white image of a large room, with two large windows on the back wall, with two more walls coming away from this wall at right angles.

On the walls that do not have windows, one has a large map of northern Europe, whilst the other wall has a large doorway leading out of the room.|Quisling's office at the Royal Palace, into which he moved in February 1942]]\n\nHis new position gave Quisling a security of tenure he had not previously enjoyed, although the ''Reichskommissariat'' remained outside his control. A month later, in February 1942, Quisling made his first state visit to Berlin. It was a productive trip, in which all key issues of Norwegian independence were discussed\u2014but [[Joseph Goebbels]] in particular remained unconvinced of Quisling's credentials, noting that it was \"unlikely\" he would \"... ever make a great statesman.\"<ref name=\"dahl250\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=250\u2013255}}.</ref>\n\nBack at home, Quisling was now less concerned about ''Nasjonal Samling's'' membership and even wanted action to clean up the membership list, including purging it of drunkards. On 12 March 1942, Norway officially became a one-party state. In time, criticism of, and resistance to, the party was criminalised, though Quisling expressed regret for having to take this step, hoping that every Norwegian would freely come around to accept his government.<ref name=\"dahl250\" />\n\nThis optimism was short-lived. In the course of the summer of 1942, Quisling lost any ability he might have had to sway public opinion by attempting to force children into the ''Nasjonal Samlings Ungdomsfylking'' youth organisation, which was modelled on the [[Hitler Youth]]. This move prompted a mass resignation of teachers from their professional body and churchmen from their posts, along with large-scale civil unrest. His attempted indictment of Bishop [[Eivind Berggrav]] proved similarly controversial, even amongst his German allies. Quisling now toughened his stance, telling Norwegians that they would have the new regime forced upon them \"whether they like it or not.\" On 1 May 1942, the German High Command noted that \"organised resistance to Quisling has started\" and Norway's peace talks with Germany stalled as a result.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=255\u2013264}}.</ref> On 11 August 1942, Hitler postponed any further peace negotiations until the war ended. Quisling was admonished and learned that Norway would not get the independence he so greatly yearned for. As an added insult, for the first time he was forbidden to write letters directly to Hitler.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=269\u2013271}}.</ref>\n\nQuisling had earlier pushed for a corporate alternative to the Parliament of Norway, the ''Storting,'' which he called a ''Riksting.'' It would comprise two chambers, the ''N\u00e6ringsting'' (Economic Chamber) and ''Kulturting'' (Cultural Chamber). Now, in advance of ''Nasjonal Samling's'' eighth and last national convention on 25 September 1942 and becoming increasingly distrustful of professional bodies, he changed his mind. The ''Riksting'' became an advisory body while the ''F\u00f8rerting,'' or Leader Council, and parliamentary chambers were now to be independent bodies subordinate to their respective ministries.{{refn|Only the Cultural Chamber actually came into being with the Economic Chamber postponed because of unrest within the professional bodies it was supposed to represent.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=271\u2013276}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=275\u2013276}}.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nAfter the convention, support for ''Nasjonal Samling,'' and Quisling personally, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including the accidental death of fellow politician [[Gulbrand Lunde]], were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, such as the shooting of ten well-known residents of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] and its environs in [[Martial law in Trondheim in 1942|October 1942]]. In addition, the ''[[lex Eilifsen]]'' ''ex-post facto'' law of August 1943, which led to the first death sentence passed by the regime, was widely seen as a blatant violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the [[Final Solution]], would destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.<ref name=\"dahl279\" />\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1001-500, Vidkun Quisling, Autogramm schreibend.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A middle-aged man in a dark coloured suit is writing on a pad of paper.

On 26 October 1942, German forces, with help from the Norwegian police, arrested 300 registered male Jews in Norway and sent them to [[concentration camp]]s, most in [[Berg, Norway|Berg]] and manned by ''[[Hirden]],'' the paramilitary wing of ''Nasjonal Samling.''<ref name=\"hoidal597\" />  Most controversially, the Jews' property was confiscated by the state.{{refn|Property confiscations were enabled by a law of 26 October 1942.

There is evidence to suggest that Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944 that they were awaiting repatriation to a [[Madagascar Plan|new Jewish homeland in Madagascar]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=288\u2013289}}.</ref>{{refn|In reality, their destination was the extermination camp at [[Auschwitz]].

In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom,<ref name=\"dahl297\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=297\u2013305}}.</ref> an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=316}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Den Norske Legion.

In 1942 he passed 231 laws, 166 in 1943, and 139 in 1944. Social policy was the one area that still received significant attention. By that autumn, Quisling and [[Anton Mussert|Mussert]] in the Netherlands could be satisfied they had at least survived.<ref name=\"dahl306\" /> In 1944, the weight problems Quisling had been having during the preceding two years also eased.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=328}}.</ref>\n\nDespite the increasingly dire military outlook in 1943 and 1944, ''Nasjonal Samling's'' position at the head of the government, albeit with its ambiguous relationship to the ''Reichskommissariat,'' remained unassailable.<ref name=\"dahl306\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=306\u2013308, 325}}.</ref> Nevertheless, the Germans exerted increasing control over law and order in Norway. Following the deportation of the Jews, Germany deported Norwegian officers and finally attempted to deport students from the [[University of Oslo]]. Even Hitler was incensed by the scale of the arrests.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=319}}.</ref> Quisling became entangled in a similar debacle in early 1944 when he forced compulsory military service on elements of the ''Hirden,'' causing a number of members to resign to avoid being drafted.<ref name=\"dahl345\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=345\u2013350}}.</ref>\n\nOn 20 January 1945, Quisling made what would be his final trip to visit Hitler. He promised Norwegian support in the final phase of the war if Germany agreed to a peace deal that would remove Norway's affairs from German intervention. This proposal grew out of a fear that as German forces retreated southwards through Norway, the occupation government would have to struggle to keep control in northern Norway. To the horror of the Quisling regime, the Nazis instead decided on a [[scorched earth]] policy in northern Norway, going so far as to shoot Norwegian civilians who refused to evacuate the region.<ref name=\"dahl345\" /> The period was also marked by increasing civilian casualties from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air raids, and mounting [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance to the government]] within occupied Norway. The meeting with the German leader proved unsuccessful and upon being asked to sign the execution order of thousands of Norwegian \"saboteurs,\" Quisling refused, an act of defiance that so enraged Terboven, acting on Hitler's orders, that he stormed out of the negotiations.<ref name=\"dahl345\" /> On recounting the events of the trip to a friend, Quisling broke down in tears, convinced the Nazi refusal to sign a peace agreement would seal his reputation as a traitor.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=353}}.</ref>\n\nQuisling spent the last months of the war trying to prevent Norwegian deaths in the showdown that was developing between German and Allied forces in Norway. The regime worked for the safe repatriation of Norwegians held in German [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s. Privately, Quisling had long accepted that National Socialism would be defeated. Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945 left him free to pursue publicly his chosen end-game, a na\u00efve offer of a transition to a power-sharing government with the government-in-exile.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=358\u2013360}}.</ref>\n\nOn 7 May, Quisling ordered police not to offer armed resistance to the Allied advance except in self-defence or against overt members of the Norwegian resistance movement. The same day, Germany announced it would surrender unconditionally, making Quisling's position untenable.<ref name=\"dahl364\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=364\u2013366}}.</ref> A realist, Quisling met military leaders of the resistance on the following day to discuss how he would be arrested. Quisling declared whilst he did not want to be treated as a common criminal, he did not want preferential treatment compared to his ''Nasjonal Samling'' colleagues. He argued he could have kept his forces fighting until the end, but had chosen not to so as to avoid turning \"Norway into a battlefield.\" Instead, he tried to ensure a peaceful transition. In return, the resistance offered full trials for all accused ''Nasjonal Samling'' members after the war, and its leadership agreed he could be incarcerated in a house rather than a prison complex.<ref name=\"dahl364\" />\n\n== Arrest, trial, death, and legacy ==\n{{see also|Legal purge in Norway after World War II}}\n\nThe civil leadership of the resistance, represented by lawyer [[Sven Arntzen]], demanded Quisling be treated like any other murder suspect and, on 9 May 1945, Quisling and his ministers turned themselves in to police.<ref name=\"dahl371\" /> Quisling was transferred to Cell 12 in [[M\u00f8llergata 19]], the main police station in Oslo. The cell was equipped with a tiny table, a basin, and a hole in the wall for a toilet bucket.<ref>{{harvnb|Bratteli|Myhre|1992|p=43}}.</ref>\n\nAfter ten weeks being constantly watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he was transferred to [[Akershus Fortress]] and awaited trial as part of the [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|legal purge]].<ref name=\"dahl371\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=371\u2013373}}.</ref> Despite initially losing weight and suffering from [[polyneuritis]], his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with [[Henrik Bergh]], a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act in the best interests of Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.<ref name=\"dahl374\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=374\u2013378}}.</ref>\n\nInitially, Quisling's charges related to the coup, including his revocation of the mobilisation order, to his time as ''Nasjonal Samling'' leader and to his actions as Minister President, such as assisting the enemy and illegally attempting to alter the constitution. Finally, he was accused of [[Gunnar Eilifsen]]'s murder. Whilst not contesting the key facts, he denied all charges on the grounds that he had always worked for a free and prosperous Norway, and submitted a sixty-page response.<ref name=\"dahl374\" /> On 11 July 1945, a further indictment was brought, adding a raft of new charges, including more murders, theft, embezzlement and, most worrying of all for Quisling, the charge of conspiring with Hitler over the invasion and occupation of Norway.<ref name=\"dahl380\" />\n\n{{Rquote|right|I know that the Norwegian people have sentenced me to death, and that the easiest course for me would be to take my own life.

Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.<ref name=\"dahl328\"/>\n\nPost-war interpretations of Quisling's character are similarly mixed. After the war collaborationist behaviour was popularly viewed as a result of mental deficiency, leaving the personality of the clearly more intelligent Quisling an \"enigma.\" He was instead seen as weak, paranoid, intellectually sterile and power-hungry: ultimately \"muddled rather than thoroughly corrupted.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoberman |first=John M. |title=Vidkun Quisling's Psychological Image |journal=Scandinavian Studies |year=1974 |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=242\u2013264 |pmid=11635923}}</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian sociologist [[Johan Galtung]] described Quisling as a mini-Hitler with a CMT (chosenness-myth-trauma) complex, or alternatively, megalo-paranoia, more often diagnosed in modern times as [[narcissistic personality disorder]].

There are a number of small chairs and tables around the room.|Quisling's library included the works of a number of eminent philosophers.]]\n\nQuisling was interested in science, Eastern religions and metaphysics, eventually building up a library that included the works of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. He kept up with developments in the realm of [[quantum physics]], but did not keep up with more current philosophical ideas.<ref name=\"dahl8\"/> He blended philosophy and science into a new religion he called Universism, or Universalism, which was a unified explanation of everything. His original writings stretched to a claimed two thousand pages.<ref name=\"dahl8\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref> He rejected the basic teachings of orthodox Christianity and established a new theory of life, which he called ''Universism,'' a term borrowed from a textbook which [[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot]] had written on [[Chinese philosophy]]. De Groot's book argued that Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism were all part of a world religion that De Groot called Universism. Quisling described how his philosophy \"... followed from the universal [[theory of relativity]], of which the [[Special theory of relativity|specific]] and [[General theory of relativity|general theories of relativity]] are special instances.\" Quisling wanted universism to be the official state religion of his new Norway, and he said \"the positing of such a system depends on the progress of science.\"<ref name=\"dahl8\" />\n\nHis ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' was divided into four parts: an introduction, a description of mankind's apparent progression from individual to increasing complex consciousnesses, a section on his tenets of morality and law, and a final section on science, art, politics, history, race and religion. The conclusion was to be titled ''The World's Organic Classification and Organisation,'' but the work remained unfinished. Generally, Quisling worked on it infrequently during his time in politics. The biographer [[Hans Fredrik Dahl]] describes this as \"fortunate\" since Quisling would \"never have won recognition\" as a philosopher.<ref name=\"dahl8\" />\n\nDuring his trial and particularly after being sentenced, Quisling became interested once more in Universism. He saw the events of the war as part of the move towards the establishment of God's kingdom on earth and justified his actions in those terms. During the first week of October, he wrote a fifty-page document titled ''Universistic Aphorisms,'' which represented \"... an almost ecstatic revelation of truth and the light to come, which bore the mark of nothing less than a prophet.\"<ref name=\"dahl410\" /> The document was also notable for its attack on the [[materialism]] of National Socialism. In addition, he simultaneously worked on a sermon, ''Eternal Justice,'' which reiterated his key beliefs, including reincarnation.<ref name=\"dahl410\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=410\u2013412}}.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[F\u00f8rergarde]]\n* [[Benedict Arnold]]\n* [[Wang Jingwei]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Cite book |title=Current Biography Yearbook |title-link=Current Biography |year=1940 |location=New York, United States |publisher=H.

He first came to international prominence as a close collaborator of explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]], organizing [[humanitarian relief]] during the [[Russian famine of 1921]] in [[Volga region|Povolzhye]]. He was posted as a Norwegian diplomat to the Soviet Union, and for some time also managed British diplomatic affairs there. He returned to Norway in 1929, and served as [[Minister of Defence (Norway)|Minister of Defence]] in [[List of Norwegian governments|the governments]] of [[Peder Kolstad]] (1931\u201332) and [[Jens Hundseid]] (1932\u201333), representing the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Farmers' Party]].\n\nIn 1933, Quisling left the Farmers' Party and founded the fascist party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (National Union). Although he achieved some popularity after his attacks on the [[Left-wing politics|political left]], his party failed to win any seats in the [[Storting]] and by 1940 it was still little more than peripheral. On 9 April 1940, with the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]] in progress, he attempted to seize power in the world's first radio-broadcast ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]],'' but failed after the Germans refused to support his government.  From 1942 to 1945 he served as [[Prime Minister of Norway]], heading the Norwegian state administration jointly with the German [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|civilian administrator]] [[Josef Terboven]]. His pro-Nazi [[puppet government]], known as the [[Quisling regime]], was dominated by ministers from Nasjonal Samling. The [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] government participated in Germany's genocidal [[Final Solution]].\n\nQuisling was put on trial during the [[legal purge in Norway after World War II]]. He was found guilty of charges including [[embezzlement]], [[murder]] and [[high treason]] against the Norwegian state, and was sentenced to [[capital punishment|death]]. He was [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] at [[Akershus Fortress]], Oslo, on 24 October 1945. The word \"[[quisling]]\" became a byword for \"collaborator\" or \"traitor\" in several languages, reflecting the contempt with which Quisling's conduct has been regarded, both at the time and since his death.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Familien Quisling ca. 1915..jpg|thumb|Vidkun Quisling (far left) with his family, {{circa}}&nbsp;1915]]\n\n=== Background ===\nVidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonss\u00f8n Quisling ({{Audio|IPA Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonss\u00f8n Quisling.ogg|Norwegian pronunciation}}) was born on 18 July 1887 in [[Fyresdal]], in the Norwegian county of [[Telemark]]. He was the son of [[Church of Norway]] pastor and [[genealogist]] Jon Lauritz Qvisling (1844\u20131930) and his wife Anna Caroline Bang (1860\u20131941),<ref name=\"borgen273\">{{harvnb|Borgen|1999|p=273}}.</ref> the daughter of J\u00f8rgen Bang, [[ship-owner]] and at the time the richest man in the town of [[Grimstad]] in South Norway.<ref name=\"juritzen11\">{{harvnb|Juritzen|1988|p=11}}</ref> The elder Quisling had lectured in Grimstad in the 1870s; one of his pupils was Bang, whom he married on 28 May 1886, following a long engagement. The newly-wed couple promptly moved to Fyresdal, where Vidkun and his younger siblings were born.<ref name=\"juritzen11\" />\n\nThe family name derives from ''Quislinus,'' a [[Latinisation of names|Latinised name]] invented by Quisling's ancestor Lauritz Ibsen Quislin (1634\u20131703), based on the village of Kvislemark near [[Slagelse]], Denmark, whence he had emigrated.<ref>{{harvnb|Juritzen|1988|p=12}}.</ref> Having two brothers and a sister,<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=6, 13\u201314}}.</ref> the young Quisling was \"shy and quiet but also loyal and helpful, always friendly, occasionally breaking into a warm smile.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=21}}.</ref> Private letters later found by historians also indicate a warm and affectionate relationship between the family members.<ref>{{harvnb|Juritzen|1988|p=15}}.</ref> From 1893 to 1900, his father was a [[chaplain]] for the [[Str\u00f8ms\u00f8]] borough in [[Drammen]]. Here, Vidkun went to school for the first time. He was bullied by other students at the school for his Telemark dialect, but proved a successful student.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|p=10}}.</ref> In 1900, the family moved to [[Skien]] when his father was appointed [[Provost (religion)|provost]] of the city.<ref name=\"borgen275\">{{harvnb|Borgen|1999|p=275}}.</ref>\n\nAcademically Quisling proved talented in [[humanities]], particularly history, and [[natural sciences]]; he specialised in mathematics. At this point, however, his life had no clear direction.<ref name=\"dahl6\" /> In 1905, Quisling enrolled at the [[Norwegian Military Academy]], having received the highest entrance examination score of the 250 applicants that year.<ref name=\"dahl6\" /> Transferring in 1906 to the [[Norwegian Military College]], he graduated with the highest score since the college's inception in 1817, and was rewarded by an audience with [[Haakon VII of Norway|the King]].<ref name=\"borgen275\" /><ref name=\"dahl6\" /> On 1 November 1911, he joined the army General Staff.<ref name=\"dahl6\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> Norway was neutral in the [[First World War]]; Quisling detested the peace movement, though the high human cost of the war did temper his views.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=25}}.</ref> In March 1918, he was sent to Russia as an attach\u00e9 at the Norwegian [[legation]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], to take advantage of the five years he had spent studying the country.<ref name=\"borgen275\" /><ref name=\"dahl28\" /> Though dismayed at the living conditions he experienced, Quisling nonetheless concluded that \"the [[Bolshevik]]s have got an extraordinarily strong hold on Russian society\" and marvelled at how [[Leon Trotsky]] had managed to mobilise the [[Red Army]] forces so well;<ref name=\"dahl28\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=28\u201329}}.</ref> by contrast, in granting too many rights to the people of Russia, the [[Russian Provisional Government]] under [[Alexander Kerensky]] had brought about its own downfall.

Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the girl out of poverty by providing her with a Norwegian passport and financial security.<ref name=\"dahl45\" />\n\nHaving left Ukraine in September 1922, Quisling and Asja returned to Kharkov in February 1923 to prolong aid efforts, with Nansen describing Quisling's work as \"absolutely indispensable.\"<ref name=\"dahl45\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=45\u201347}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|p=33}}.</ref> Quisling found the situation much improved and, with no fresh challenges, found it a more boring trip than his last.

Quisling's biographer, Dahl, believes that in all likelihood the second marriage was never official.<ref name=\"dahl48\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=48\u201349}}.</ref> Regardless, the couple behaved as though they were married, and celebrated their wedding anniversary. Soon after the wedding, the aid mission came to an end and the trio left the Ukraine, and from the summer of 1923 onwards they planned to spend a year in Paris. Maria wanted to see Western Europe; Quisling wanted to get some rest following bouts of stomach pain that had lasted all winter.<ref name=\"dahl48\" />\n\n==== Paris, Eastern Europe and Norway ====\nThe stay in Paris required a temporary discharge from the army, which Quisling slowly grew to understand was permanent: army cutbacks meant that there would be no position available for him when he returned.<ref name=\"dahl50\" />{{refn|Increasingly bitter over the treatment he had received from the military, he eventually took up a post in the reserves on the reduced salary of a captain, and received a promotion to major in 1930.<ref name=\"dahl50\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=50}}.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} Quisling devoted much of his time in the French capital to study, reading works of political theory and working on his philosophical project, which he called ''Universism''. On 2 October 1923, he persuaded the Oslo daily newspaper ''[[Tidens Tegn]]'' to publish an article he had written calling for [[diplomatic recognition]] of the [[Soviet government]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|p=30}}.</ref> Quisling's stay in Paris did not last as long as planned, and in late 1923 he started work on Nansen's new [[repatriation]] project in the Balkans, arriving in [[Sofia]] in November. He spent the next two months travelling constantly with his wife Maria. In January she returned to Paris to look after Asja, who took on the role of the couple's foster-daughter; Quisling joined them in February.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=53\u201354}}.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1924, the trio returned to Norway where Asja subsequently left to live with an aunt in [[Nice, France|Nice]] and never returned.<ref name=\"dahl54\" /> Although Quisling promised to provide for her well-being, his payments were irregular, and over the coming years he would miss a number of opportunities to visit.<ref>{{harvnb|Yourieff|2007|pp=450\u2013452}}.</ref> Back in Norway, and to his later embarrassment, Quisling found himself drawn into the communist Norwegian labour movement. Among other policies, he fruitlessly advocated a people's [[militia]] to protect the country against [[reactionary]] attacks,<ref name=\"dahl54\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=54\u201356}}.</ref> and asked members of the movement whether they would like to know what information the General Staff had on them, but he got no response. Although this brief attachment to the far-left seems unlikely given Quisling's later political direction, Dahl suggests that, following a conservative childhood, he was by this time \"unemployed and dispirited&nbsp;... deeply resentful of the General Staff&nbsp;... [and] in the process of becoming politically more radical.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=57}}.</ref> Dahl adds that Quisling's political views at this time could be summarised as \"a fusion of socialism and nationalism,\" with definite sympathies for the Soviets in Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=58}}.</ref>\n\n==== Russia and the rouble scandal ====\n[[File:Dupuis-Nansen-Carle-Savio-Quisling.jpg|thumb|right|The Armenia commission of the League of Nations. 19 June 1925.

The pair began a tour of [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]], where they hoped to help repatriate native Armenians via a number of projects proposed for funding by the [[League of Nations]]. Despite Quisling's substantial efforts, however, the projects were all rejected. In May 1926, Quisling found another job with long-time friend and fellow Norwegian [[Frederik Prytz]] in Moscow, working as a liaison between Prytz and the Soviet authorities who owned half of Prytz's firm Onega Wood.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=59\u201362}}.</ref> He stayed in the job until Prytz prepared to close down the business in early 1927, when Quisling found new employment as a diplomat. British diplomatic affairs in Russia were being managed by Norway, and he became their new legation secretary; Maria joined him late in 1928. A massive scandal broke when Quisling and Prytz were accused of using diplomatic channels to smuggle millions of [[roubles]] onto the [[black market]]s, a much-repeated claim that was later used to support a charge of \"[[moral bankruptcy]],\" but neither it nor the charge that Quisling spied for the British has ever been substantiated.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=62\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nThe harder line now developing in Russian politics led Quisling to distance himself from Bolshevism. The Soviet government had rejected outright his Armenian proposals, and obstructed an attempt by Nansen to help with the 1928 Ukrainian famine. Quisling took these rebuffs as a personal insult; in 1929, with the British now keen to take back control of their own diplomatic affairs, he left Russia.<ref name=\"dahl67\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=67\u201369}}.</ref> He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for his services to Britain,<ref name=\"dahl67\" /> an honour revoked by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |title=People |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764097,00.html |work=Time Magazine |page=1 |date=24 June 1940|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> By this time, Quisling had also been awarded the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Romanian Crown Order]] and the Yugoslav [[Order of St. Sava]] for his earlier humanitarian efforts.<ref name=\"dahl67\" />\n\n== Early political career ==\n\n===Final return to Norway===\nHaving spent nine of the previous twelve years abroad, but with no practical experience in party politics outside the Norwegian Army, Quisling returned to Norway in December 1929, bringing with him a plan for change he termed ''Norsk Aktion,'' meaning \"Norwegian Action.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Borgen|1999|p=278}}.</ref> The planned organisation consisted of national, regional and local units with the intention of recruiting in the style of the [[Soviet Communist Party]].

Despite the ready availability of junior officers in the reserve following defence cuts, only seven units were established in 1934, and funding restrictions meant that the enterprise included less than a thousand men before it faded away.<ref name=\"dahl78\"/> Sometime during the period 1930\u201333, Quisling's first wife, Asja, received notice of the annulment of her marriage to him.<ref>{{harvnb|Yourieff|2007|p=467}}.</ref>\n\nIn mid-1932 ''Nordisk folkereisning i Norge'' was forced to confirm that even though Quisling remained in the cabinet, he would not become a member of the party. They further stated that the party programme had no basis in fascism of any kind, including the [[Nazi|National Socialism]] model.<ref name=\"dahl78\" /> This did not dampen criticism of Quisling, who remained constantly in the headlines, although he was gradually earning a reputation as a disciplined and efficient administrator.<ref name=\"dahl78\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=78\u201381}}.</ref> After he was attacked in his office by a knife-wielding assailant who threw ground pepper in his face on 2 February 1932, some newspapers, instead of focusing on the attack itself, suggested that the assailant had been the jealous husband of one of Quisling's cleaners; others, especially those aligned with the Labour Party, posited that the whole thing had been staged.<ref name=\"dahl80\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Hartmann|1970|pp=83\u201384}}.</ref> In November 1932, Labour politician [[Johan Nygaardsvold]] put this theory to Parliament,<ref>{{harvnb|Hayes|1971|p=86}}</ref> prompting suggestions that charges of slander be brought against him.<ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|p=109}}.</ref> No charges were brought, and the identity of the assailant has never been confirmed.

In the coming months, tens of thousands of Norwegians followed suit and Quisling's summer was full of speeches to packed political rallies.<ref name=\"dahl83\"/> In Parliament, however, Quisling's speech was viewed as political suicide; not only was his evidence weak, but questions were raised as to why the information had not been handed over much sooner if the revolutionary threat were so serious.<ref name=\"dahl83\"/>\n\n=== Popular party leader ===\nOver the course of 1932 and into 1933, Prytz's influence over ''Nordisk folkereisning i Norge'' weakened and lawyer [[Johan Bernhard Hjort]] assumed the leadership role. Hjort was keen to work with Quisling because of his new-found popularity, and they devised a new programme of right-wing policies including proscription of revolutionary parties including those funded by foreign bodies such as [[Comintern]], the suspension of the voting rights for people in receipt of [[social welfare]], agricultural debt relief, and an audit of public finances.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=89\u201390}}.</ref> In 1932, during the [[Olaf Kullmann|Kullmann Affair]], Quisling turned on the prime minister for questioning his hard-line stance over pacifist agitator Captain [[Olaf Kullmann]]. In a memorandum laying out his proposals for economic and social reform distributed to the entire cabinet, Quisling called for the prime minister to stand down.<ref name=\"dahl92\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=92\u201393}}.</ref> As the government began to collapse, Quisling's personal popularity reached new heights; he was referred to as \"man of the year,\" and there were expectations of forthcoming electoral success.<ref name=\"dahl92\" />\n\nDespite the new programme, some of Quisling's circle still favoured a cabinet coup. He later said he had even considered the use of force to overthrow the government but, in late February, it was the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] that brought them down. With the assistance of Hjort and Prytz, ''Nordisk folkereisning i Norge'' quickly became a political party, ''[[Nasjonal Samling]],'' or NS, literally \"National Unity,\" ready to contest the forthcoming October election. Quisling was mildly disappointed and would have preferred to head a national movement, not just one of seven political parties. ''Nasjonal Samling'' soon afterwards announced it would support candidates from other parties if they supported its key aim of \"establishing a strong and stable national government independent of ordinary party politics.\" Although not an overnight success in the already crowded political spectrum, the party slowly gained support. With its Nazi-inspired belief in the central authority of a strong ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip|F\u00fchrer]]'', as well as its powerful propaganda elements, it gained support from many among the Oslo upper classes, and began to give the impression that \"big money\" lay behind it.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref>\n\nIncreased support also materialised when the ''Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp,'' the Norwegian Farmers' Aid Association, sought financial aid from ''Nasjonal Samling,'' who in turn gained political influence and a useful existing network of well-trained party officers. Quisling's party never managed a grand anti-socialist coalition, however, in part because of competition from the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] for right-wing votes.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=97\u201399}}.</ref> Though Quisling remained unable to demonstrate any skill as an orator, his reputation for scandal nonetheless ensured that the electorate were aware of ''Nasjonal Samling's'' existence. As a result, the party showed only moderate success in the [[1933 Norwegian parliamentary election|October elections]], with 27,850 votes\u2014approximately two per cent of the national vote, and about three and a half per cent of the vote in constituencies where it fielded candidates.<ref name=\"dahl99\" /> This made it the fifth largest party in Norway, out-polling the Communists but not the Conservative, Labour, Liberal or Agrarian parties, and failing to secure a single seat in Parliament.<ref name=\"dahl99\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=99\u2013100}}.</ref>\n\n=== ''F\u00f8rer'' of a party in decline ===\nAfter the underwhelming election results, Quisling's attitude to negotiation and compromise hardened.<ref name=\"dahl100\" /> A final attempt to form a coalition of the right in March 1934 came to nothing, and from late 1933, Quisling's ''Nasjonal Samling'' began to carve out its own form of national socialism. With no leader in Parliament, however, the party struggled to introduce the constitutional reform bill needed to achieve its lofty ambitions. When Quisling tried to introduce the bill directly, it was swiftly rejected,<ref name=\"dahl100\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=100\u2013105}}.</ref> and the party went into decline. In the summer of 1935, headlines quoted Quisling telling opponents that \"heads [would] roll\" as soon as he achieved power. The threat irreparably damaged the image of his party, and over the following few months several high-ranking members resigned, including [[Kai Fjell]] and Quisling's brother J\u00f8rgen.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=105\u2013109}}.</ref>\n\nQuisling began to familiarise himself with the international fascist movement, attending the [[1934 Montreux Fascist conference]] in December. For his party, the association with [[Italian fascism]] could not have come at a worse time, so soon after headlines of illegal [[Abyssinia crisis|Italian incursions into Abyssinia]].<ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|pp=204\u2013205}}.</ref> On his return trip from Montreux, he met Nazi [[ideologue]] and foreign policy theorist [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and though he preferred to see his own policies as a synthesis of Italian fascism and German Nazism, by the time of the 1936 elections, Quisling had in part become the \"Norwegian Hitler\" that his opponents had long accused him of being.<ref name=\"dahl110\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=110\u2013117}}.</ref> Part of this was due to his hardening [[anti-Semitic]] stance, associating Judaism with Marxism, liberalism and, increasingly, anything else he found objectionable, and part as a result of ''Nasjonal Samling's'' growing similarity to the German Nazi Party. Despite receiving an unexpected boost when the Norwegian government acceded to Soviet demands to arrest Leon Trotsky, the party's election campaign never gained momentum. Although Quisling sincerely believed he had the support of around 100,000 voters, and declared to his party that they would win an absolute minimum of ten seats, ''Nasjonal Samling'' managed to poll just 26,577, fewer than in 1933 when they had fielded candidates in only half the districts.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=117\u2013126}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|p=236}}.</ref> Under this pressure, the party split in two, with Hjort leading the breakaway group; although fewer than fifty members left immediately, many more drifted away during 1937.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=128}}.</ref>\n\nDwindling party membership created many problems for Quisling, especially financial ones. For years he had been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one [[Frans Hals]] painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the [[Great Depression]], even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=130\u2013133}}.</ref> His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned [[Constitution of Norway|constitutional reform]] of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.<ref name=\"dahl134\" />\n\n== World War II ==\n\n=== Coming of war ===\nIn 1939 Quisling turned his attention towards Norway's preparations for the anticipated European war, which he believed involved a drastic increase in the country's defence spending to guarantee its neutrality. Meanwhile, Quisling presented lectures entitled \"The Jewish problem in Norway\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Maynard M. Cohen|title=A Stand Against Tyranny: Norway's Physicians and the Nazis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cmx6u2GF80C&pg=PA53|date=1 September 2000|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=0-8143-2934-9|pages=53\u2013}}</ref> and supported [[Adolf Hitler]] in what appeared to be growing future conflict. Despite condemning ''[[Kristallnacht]],'' he sent the German leader a fiftieth-birthday greeting thanking him for \"saving Europe from Bolshevism and Jewish domination\".<ref name=\"dahl134\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=134\u2013137}}.</ref> In 1939, Quisling contended that, should an Anglo-Russian alliance make neutrality impossible, Norway would have \"to go with Germany.\"<ref name=\"dahl137\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=137\u2013142}}.</ref> Invited to the country in the summer of 1939, he began a tour of a number of German and Danish cities. He was received particularly well in Germany, which promised funds to boost ''Nasjonal Samling's'' standing in Norway, and hence spread pro-Nazi sentiment. When war broke out on 1 September 1939, Quisling felt vindicated by both the event and the immediate superiority displayed by the German army. He remained outwardly confident that, despite its size, his party would soon become the centre of political attention.<ref name=\"dahl137\" />\n\nFor the next nine months, Quisling continued to lead a party that was at best peripheral to Norwegian politics.<ref name=\"dahl137\" /> He was nonetheless active, and in October 1939 he worked with Prytz on an ultimately unsuccessful plan for peace between Britain, France and Germany and their eventual participation in a new economic union. Quisling also mused on how Germany ought to go on the offensive against its ally the Soviet Union, and on 9 December travelled to Germany to present his multi-faceted plans.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=142\u2013149}}.</ref> After impressing German officials, he won an audience with Hitler himself, scheduled for 14 December, whereupon he received firm advice from his contacts that the most useful thing he could do would be to ask for Hitler's help with a pro-German coup in Norway,{{refn|Quisling considered the fourth and constitutionally dubious session of the Parliament of Norway, due to open on 10 January 1940, as the mostly likely time for ''Nasjonal Samling'' to face an exploitable crisis.

The German leader promised to respond to any British invasion of Norway ([[Plan R 4]]), perhaps pre-emptively, with a German counter-invasion, but found Quisling's plans for both a Norwegian coup and an Anglo-German peace unduly optimistic. Nonetheless, Quisling would still receive funds to bolster ''Nasjonal Samling.''{{refn|Immediately after the meeting on 14 December, Hitler ordered his staff to draw up preparations for an invasion of Norway.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=157}}.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} The two men met again four days later, and afterwards Quisling wrote a memorandum that explicitly told Hitler that he did not consider himself a National Socialist.<ref name=\"dahl153\" /> As German machinations continued, Quisling was intentionally kept in the dark. He was also incapacitated by a severe bout of illness, probably [[nephritis]] in both kidneys, for which he refused hospitalisation. Though he returned to work on 13 March 1940, he remained ill for several weeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=160\u2013162}}.</ref> In the meantime, the [[Altmark Incident]] complicated Norway's efforts to maintain its neutrality. Hitler himself remained in two minds over whether an occupation of Norway should require an invitation from the Norwegian government. Finally, Quisling received his summons on 31 March, and reluctantly travelled to [[Copenhagen]] to meet with Nazi intelligence officers who asked him for information on Norwegian defences and defence protocols. He returned to Norway on 6 April and, on 8 April, the British [[Operation Wilfred]] commenced, bringing Norway into the war. With [[Allied campaign in Norway|Allied forces in Norway]], Quisling expected a characteristically swift German response.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=162\u2013170}}.</ref>\n\n=== German invasion and coup d'\u00e9tat ===\n{{see also|Quisling regime#1940 coup}}\n\nIn the early hours of 9 April 1940, [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|Germany invaded Norway]] by air and sea, as \"Operation ''Weser\u00fcbung,\"'' or \"Operation Weser Exercise,\" intending to capture King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]] and the government of Prime Minister [[Johan Nygaardsvold]]. However, alert to the possibility of invasion, [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative]] [[President of the Storting|President of the Parliament]] [[C. J.

Two orders\u2014the first, to a friend in the military (Colonel Hans Sommerfeldt Hiorth, the commanding officer of the army regiment at Elverum<ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|p=377}}.</ref>) to arrest the government, and the second, to the [[Kristian Welhaven|Oslo chief of police]]\u2014were both ignored. At 22:00, Quisling resumed broadcasting, repeating his earlier message and reading out a list of new ministers. Hitler lent his support as promised, and recognised the new Norwegian government under Quisling within 24 hours.<ref name=\"dahl172\" /> Norwegian batteries were still firing on the German invasion force, and at 03:00 on 10 April, Quisling acceded to a German request to halt the resistance of the [[Bol\u00e6rne]] fortress.{{refn|Though now accepted, this charge was later one of the few for which the jury at Quisling's trial did not find sufficient evidence.<ref>{{harvnb|H\u00f8idal|1989|p=755}}.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}<ref>{{harvnb|Hayes|1971|p=221}}.</ref> As a result of actions such as these, it was claimed at the time that Quisling's seizure of power in a [[puppet government]] had been part of the German plan all along.<ref>{{harvnb|Block (ed.)|1940|pp=669\u2013670}}.</ref>\n\nQuisling now reached the high-water mark of his political power. On 10 April, Br\u00e4uer travelled to Elverum where the legitimate [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Nygaardsvold government]] now sat. On Hitler's orders, he demanded that King Haakon appoint Quisling head of a new government, thereby securing a peaceful transition of power. Haakon rejected this demand.<ref name=\"dahl175\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=175\u2013178}}</ref> He went further in a meeting with his cabinet, letting it be known that he would sooner abdicate than appoint any government headed by Quisling.

Germany retracted its support for his rival government, preferring instead to build up its own independent governing commission. In this way, Quisling was manoeuvred out of power by Br\u00e4uer and a coalition of his former allies, including Hjort, who now saw him as a liability. Even his political allies, including Prytz, deserted him.<ref name=\"dahl175\" />\n\nIn return, Hitler wrote to Quisling thanking him for his efforts and guaranteeing him some sort of position in the new government. The transfer of power on these terms was duly enacted on 15 April, with Hitler still confident the [[Administrative Council (Norway)|Administrative Council]] would receive the backing of the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=183}}.</ref> Quisling's domestic and international reputation both hit new lows, casting him as both a traitor and a failure.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=183\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\n=== Head of the government ===\n{{see also|Quisling regime}}\nOnce the king had declared the German commission unlawful, it became clear that he would never be won over. An impatient Hitler appointed a German, [[Josef Terboven]], as the new Norwegian ''[[Reichskommissar]],'' or Governor-General, on 24 April, reporting directly to him. Despite Hitler's assurances, Terboven wanted to make sure that there would be no room in the government for the ''Nasjonal Samling'' nor its leader Quisling, with whom he did not get along.<ref name=\"dahl188\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=188\u2013194}}.</ref> Terboven eventually accepted a certain ''Nasjonal Samling'' presence in the government during June, but remained unconvinced about Quisling. As a result, on 25 June, Terboven forced Quisling to step down as leader of the ''Nasjonal Samling'' and take a temporary leave of absence in Germany.<ref name=\"dahl188\" /> Quisling remained there until 20 August, while Rosenberg and Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], whom he had met on his earlier visit to Berlin, negotiated on his behalf. In the end, Quisling returned \"in triumph,\" having won Hitler over in a meeting on 16 August. The ''Reichskommissar'' would now have to accommodate Quisling as leader of the government, then allow him to rebuild the ''Nasjonal Samling'' and bring more of his men into the cabinet.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=194\u2013200}}.</ref> Terboven complied and addressed the Norwegian people in a radio broadcast in which he asserted that the ''Nasjonal Samling'' would be the only political party allowed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Norway: Commission State |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802044-1,00.html |work=Time Magazine |page=1 |date=7 October 1940 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vidkun Quisling Kundgebung Kolosseum.

By the time he returned on 13 December, he had agreed to raise volunteers to fight with the German ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS). In January, SS head [[Heinrich Himmler]] travelled to Norway to oversee preparations. Quisling clearly believed that if Norway supported Nazi Germany on the battlefield, there would be no reason for Germany to annex it. To this end, he opposed plans to have a German SS brigade loyal only to Hitler installed in Norway.<ref name=\"dahl219\" /> In the process, he also toughened his attitude to the country harbouring the exiled king, the United Kingdom, which he no longer saw as a Nordic ally. Finally, Quisling aligned Norwegian policy on Jews with that of Germany, giving a speech in Frankfurt on 26 March 1941 in which he argued for compulsory exile, but warned against [[Final Solution|extermination]].<ref name=\"dahl219\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=219\u2013225}}.</ref>\n\nIn May, Quisling was shattered by the death of his mother Anna, as the two had been particularly close. At the same time, the political crisis over Norwegian independence deepened, with Quisling threatening Terboven with his resignation over the issue of finance. In the end, the Reichskommissar agreed to compromise on the issue, but Quisling had to concede on the SS issue: A brigade was formed, but as a branch of the ''Nasjonal Samling.''<ref name=\"dahl219\" />\n\n[[File:\u00c6reskompanier, Vidkun Quisling, Josef Terboven og norske polititropper (8618020299).jpg|thumb|Vidkun Quisling (left) and Reichskommissar Josef Terboven (center) inspect an honorary partnership of [[Statspolitiet]] (State Police) officers in 1942]]\n[[File:Quisling Terboven Hirden.jpg|thumb|Quisling (left) and Terboven (right) in front of an honorary partnership of the [[paramilitary]] [[Hirden]]]]\nMeanwhile, the government line hardened, with Communist Party leaders arrested and trade unionists intimidated. On 10 September 1941, [[Viggo Hansteen]] and [[Rolf Wickstr\u00f8m]] were executed and many more imprisoned following the [[milk strike]] in Oslo. Hansteen's execution was later seen as a watershed moment, dividing the occupation into its more innocent and more deadly phases.<ref name=\"dahl225\" /> The same year ''[[Statspolitiet]]'' (\"the State Police\"), abolished in 1937, was reestablished to assist the [[Gestapo]] in Norway, and radio sets were confiscated across the country. Though these were all Terboven's decisions, Quisling agreed with them and went on to denounce the government-in-exile as \"traitors.\" As a result of the toughened stance, an informal \"ice front\" emerged, with ''Nasjonal Samling'' supporters ostracised from society.<ref name=\"dahl225\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=225\u2013232}}.</ref> Quisling remained convinced this was an anti-German sentiment that would fade away once Berlin had handed power over to ''Nasjonal Samling.'' However, the only concessions he won in 1941 were having the heads of ministries promoted to official ministers of the government and independence for the party secretariat.<ref name=\"dahl232\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=232\u2013237}}.</ref>\n\nIn January 1942, Terboven announced the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved the transfer of power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful it would happen, since Germany and Norway were in the midst of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], while Terboven insisted that the ''Reichskommissariat'' would remain in power until such peace came about.<ref name=\"dahl232\" /> Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=240\u2013242}}.</ref>\n\nAfter a brief postponement, an announcement was made on 1 February 1942, detailing how the cabinet had elected Quisling to the post of [[Minister-President]] of the national government.<ref>{{harvnb|Borgen|1999|p=284}}.</ref><ref name=\"dahl247\" /> The appointment was accompanied by a banquet, rallying, and other celebrations by the ''Nasjonal Samling'' members. In his first speech, Quisling committed the government to closer ties with Germany. The only change to the Constitution was the reinstatement of the [[History of the Jews in Norway|ban on Jewish entry into Norway]], which had been [[Norwegian Constitution#Development|abolished in 1851]].<ref name=\"dahl247\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=247\u2013249}}.</ref>\n\n=== Minister President ===\n[[File:Quisling's office at the Royal Palace 1945.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white image of a large room, with two large windows on the back wall, with two more walls coming away from this wall at right angles.

On the walls that do not have windows, one has a large map of northern Europe, whilst the other wall has a large doorway leading out of the room.|Quisling's office at the Royal Palace, into which he moved in February 1942]]\n\nHis new position gave Quisling a security of tenure he had not previously enjoyed, although the ''Reichskommissariat'' remained outside his control. A month later, in February 1942, Quisling made his first state visit to Berlin. It was a productive trip, in which all key issues of Norwegian independence were discussed\u2014but [[Joseph Goebbels]] in particular remained unconvinced of Quisling's credentials, noting that it was \"unlikely\" he would \"... ever make a great statesman.\"<ref name=\"dahl250\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=250\u2013255}}.</ref>\n\nBack at home, Quisling was now less concerned about ''Nasjonal Samling's'' membership and even wanted action to clean up the membership list, including purging it of drunkards. On 12 March 1942, Norway officially became a one-party state. In time, criticism of, and resistance to, the party was criminalised, though Quisling expressed regret for having to take this step, hoping that every Norwegian would freely come around to accept his government.<ref name=\"dahl250\" />\n\nThis optimism was short-lived. In the course of the summer of 1942, Quisling lost any ability he might have had to sway public opinion by attempting to force children into the ''Nasjonal Samlings Ungdomsfylking'' youth organisation, which was modelled on the [[Hitler Youth]]. This move prompted a mass resignation of teachers from their professional body and churchmen from their posts, along with large-scale civil unrest. His attempted indictment of Bishop [[Eivind Berggrav]] proved similarly controversial, even amongst his German allies. Quisling now toughened his stance, telling Norwegians that they would have the new regime forced upon them \"whether they like it or not.\" On 1 May 1942, the German High Command noted that \"organised resistance to Quisling has started\" and Norway's peace talks with Germany stalled as a result.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=255\u2013264}}.</ref> On 11 August 1942, Hitler postponed any further peace negotiations until the war ended. Quisling was admonished and learned that Norway would not get the independence he so greatly yearned for. As an added insult, for the first time he was forbidden to write letters directly to Hitler.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=269\u2013271}}.</ref>\n\nQuisling had earlier pushed for a corporate alternative to the Parliament of Norway, the ''Storting,'' which he called a ''Riksting.'' It would comprise two chambers, the ''N\u00e6ringsting'' (Economic Chamber) and ''Kulturting'' (Cultural Chamber). Now, in advance of ''Nasjonal Samling's'' eighth and last national convention on 25 September 1942 and becoming increasingly distrustful of professional bodies, he changed his mind. The ''Riksting'' became an advisory body while the ''F\u00f8rerting,'' or Leader Council, and parliamentary chambers were now to be independent bodies subordinate to their respective ministries.{{refn|Only the Cultural Chamber actually came into being with the Economic Chamber postponed because of unrest within the professional bodies it was supposed to represent.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=271\u2013276}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=275\u2013276}}.</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nAfter the convention, support for ''Nasjonal Samling,'' and Quisling personally, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including the accidental death of fellow politician [[Gulbrand Lunde]], were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, such as the shooting of ten well-known residents of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] and its environs in [[Martial law in Trondheim in 1942|October 1942]]. In addition, the ''[[lex Eilifsen]]'' ''ex-post facto'' law of August 1943, which led to the first death sentence passed by the regime, was widely seen as a blatant violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the [[Final Solution]], would destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.<ref name=\"dahl279\" />\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1001-500, Vidkun Quisling, Autogramm schreibend.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A middle-aged man in a dark coloured suit is writing on a pad of paper.

On 26 October 1942, German forces, with help from the Norwegian police, arrested 300 registered male Jews in Norway and sent them to [[concentration camp]]s, most in [[Berg, Norway|Berg]] and manned by ''[[Hirden]],'' the paramilitary wing of ''Nasjonal Samling.''<ref name=\"hoidal597\" />  Most controversially, the Jews' property was confiscated by the state.{{refn|Property confiscations were enabled by a law of 26 October 1942.

There is evidence to suggest that Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944 that they were awaiting repatriation to a [[Madagascar Plan|new Jewish homeland in Madagascar]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=288\u2013289}}.</ref>{{refn|In reality, their destination was the extermination camp at [[Auschwitz]].

In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom,<ref name=\"dahl297\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=297\u2013305}}.</ref> an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=316}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Den Norske Legion.

In 1942 he passed 231 laws, 166 in 1943, and 139 in 1944. Social policy was the one area that still received significant attention. By that autumn, Quisling and [[Anton Mussert|Mussert]] in the Netherlands could be satisfied they had at least survived.<ref name=\"dahl306\" /> In 1944, the weight problems Quisling had been having during the preceding two years also eased.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=328}}.</ref>\n\nDespite the increasingly dire military outlook in 1943 and 1944, ''Nasjonal Samling's'' position at the head of the government, albeit with its ambiguous relationship to the ''Reichskommissariat,'' remained unassailable.<ref name=\"dahl306\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=306\u2013308, 325}}.</ref> Nevertheless, the Germans exerted increasing control over law and order in Norway. Following the deportation of the Jews, Germany deported Norwegian officers and finally attempted to deport students from the [[University of Oslo]]. Even Hitler was incensed by the scale of the arrests.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=319}}.</ref> Quisling became entangled in a similar debacle in early 1944 when he forced compulsory military service on elements of the ''Hirden,'' causing a number of members to resign to avoid being drafted.<ref name=\"dahl345\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=345\u2013350}}.</ref>\n\nOn 20 January 1945, Quisling made what would be his final trip to visit Hitler. He promised Norwegian support in the final phase of the war if Germany agreed to a peace deal that would remove Norway's affairs from German intervention. This proposal grew out of a fear that as German forces retreated southwards through Norway, the occupation government would have to struggle to keep control in northern Norway. To the horror of the Quisling regime, the Nazis instead decided on a [[scorched earth]] policy in northern Norway, going so far as to shoot Norwegian civilians who refused to evacuate the region.<ref name=\"dahl345\" /> The period was also marked by increasing civilian casualties from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air raids, and mounting [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance to the government]] within occupied Norway. The meeting with the German leader proved unsuccessful and upon being asked to sign the execution order of thousands of Norwegian \"saboteurs,\" Quisling refused, an act of defiance that so enraged Terboven, acting on Hitler's orders, that he stormed out of the negotiations.<ref name=\"dahl345\" /> On recounting the events of the trip to a friend, Quisling broke down in tears, convinced the Nazi refusal to sign a peace agreement would seal his reputation as a traitor.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=353}}.</ref>\n\nQuisling spent the last months of the war trying to prevent Norwegian deaths in the showdown that was developing between German and Allied forces in Norway. The regime worked for the safe repatriation of Norwegians held in German [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s. Privately, Quisling had long accepted that National Socialism would be defeated. Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945 left him free to pursue publicly his chosen end-game, a na\u00efve offer of a transition to a power-sharing government with the government-in-exile.<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=358\u2013360}}.</ref>\n\nOn 7 May, Quisling ordered police not to offer armed resistance to the Allied advance except in self-defence or against overt members of the Norwegian resistance movement. The same day, Germany announced it would surrender unconditionally, making Quisling's position untenable.<ref name=\"dahl364\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=364\u2013366}}.</ref> A realist, Quisling met military leaders of the resistance on the following day to discuss how he would be arrested. Quisling declared whilst he did not want to be treated as a common criminal, he did not want preferential treatment compared to his ''Nasjonal Samling'' colleagues. He argued he could have kept his forces fighting until the end, but had chosen not to so as to avoid turning \"Norway into a battlefield.\" Instead, he tried to ensure a peaceful transition. In return, the resistance offered full trials for all accused ''Nasjonal Samling'' members after the war, and its leadership agreed he could be incarcerated in a house rather than a prison complex.<ref name=\"dahl364\" />\n\n== Arrest, trial, death, and legacy ==\n{{see also|Legal purge in Norway after World War II}}\n\nThe civil leadership of the resistance, represented by lawyer [[Sven Arntzen]], demanded Quisling be treated like any other murder suspect and, on 9 May 1945, Quisling and his ministers turned themselves in to police.<ref name=\"dahl371\" /> Quisling was transferred to Cell 12 in [[M\u00f8llergata 19]], the main police station in Oslo.

Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act in the best interests of Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.<ref name=\"dahl374\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=374\u2013378}}.</ref>\n\nInitially, Quisling's charges related to the coup, including his revocation of the mobilisation order, to his time as ''Nasjonal Samling'' leader and to his actions as Minister President, such as assisting the enemy and illegally attempting to alter the constitution. Finally, he was accused of [[Gunnar Eilifsen]]'s murder. Whilst not contesting the key facts, he denied all charges on the grounds that he had always worked for a free and prosperous Norway, and submitted a sixty-page response.<ref name=\"dahl374\" /> On 11 July 1945, a further indictment was brought, adding a raft of new charges, including more murders, theft, embezzlement and, most worrying of all for Quisling, the charge of conspiring with Hitler over the invasion and occupation of Norway.<ref name=\"dahl380\" />\n\n{{Rquote|right|I know that the Norwegian people have sentenced me to death, and that the easiest course for me would be to take my own life.

One who was ''quisling'' was in the act of committing treason.<ref>{{harvnb|Block (ed.)|1940|p=669}}.</ref>\n\n== Personality ==\nTo his supporters, Quisling was regarded as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, knowledgeable and with an eye for detail. Balanced and gentle to a fault, he was believed to care deeply about his people and maintained high moral standards throughout.<ref name=\"dahl328\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=328\u2013331}}.</ref> To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.<ref name=\"dahl328\"/>\n\nPost-war interpretations of Quisling's character are similarly mixed. After the war collaborationist behaviour was popularly viewed as a result of mental deficiency, leaving the personality of the clearly more intelligent Quisling an \"enigma.\" He was instead seen as weak, paranoid, intellectually sterile and power-hungry: ultimately \"muddled rather than thoroughly corrupted.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoberman |first=John M. |title=Vidkun Quisling's Psychological Image |journal=Scandinavian Studies |year=1974 |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=242\u2013264 |pmid=11635923}}</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian sociologist [[Johan Galtung]] described Quisling as a mini-Hitler with a CMT (chosenness-myth-trauma) complex, or alternatively, megalo-paranoia, more often diagnosed in modern times as [[narcissistic personality disorder]]. He was \"well installed in his personality,\" but unable to gain a following among his own people as the population did not provide a mirror for Quisling's ideology. In short, he was \"a dictator and a clown on the wrong stage with the wrong script.\"<ref name=\"Galtung192193\">{{harvnb|Galtung|1997|pp=192\u2013193}}.</ref> As quoted by Dahl, psychiatrist Professor [[Gabriel Langfeldt]] stated Quisling's ultimate philosophical goals \"fitted the classic description of the [[paranoia|paranoid]] [[megalomania]]c more exactly than any other case [he had] ever encountered.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|p=10}}.</ref>\n\nDuring his time in office, Quisling rose early, often having completed several hours of work before arriving at the office between 9:30 and 10:00. He liked to intervene in virtually all government matters, reading all letters addressed to him or his chancellery personally and marking a surprising number for action.<ref name=\"dahl321\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=321\u2013322}}.</ref> Quisling was independently minded, made several key decisions on the spot and, unlike his German counterpart, he liked to follow procedure to ensure that government remained \"a dignified and civilised\" affair throughout.<ref name=\"dahl321\" /> He took a personal interest in the administration of Fyresdal, where he was born.<ref name=\"dahl328\" />\n\nHe rejected [[Master race|German racial supremacy]] and instead saw the Norwegian race as the progenitor of northern Europe, tracing his own family tree in his spare time.<ref name=\"dahl328\" /> Party members did not receive preferential treatment,<ref name=\"dahl321\" /> though Quisling did not himself share in the wartime hardships of his fellow Norwegians. Nevertheless, many gifts went unused and he did not live extravagantly.<ref name=\"dahl328\" />\n\n== Religious and philosophical views {{anchor|Universism}} ==\n[[File:Quisling library.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white image of a room with a wood panelled ceiling, with a large fireplace and bookshelves on two sides of the room. At the far end of the room is a glass fronted double door leading away. There are a number of small chairs and tables around the room.|Quisling's library included the works of a number of eminent philosophers.]]\n\nQuisling was interested in science, Eastern religions and metaphysics, eventually building up a library that included the works of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. He kept up with developments in the realm of [[quantum physics]], but did not keep up with more current philosophical ideas.<ref name=\"dahl8\"/> He blended philosophy and science into a new religion he called Universism, or Universalism, which was a unified explanation of everything. His original writings stretched to a claimed two thousand pages.<ref name=\"dahl8\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref> He rejected the basic teachings of orthodox Christianity and established a new theory of life, which he called ''Universism,'' a term borrowed from a textbook which [[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot]] had written on [[Chinese philosophy]]. De Groot's book argued that Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism were all part of a world religion that De Groot called Universism. Quisling described how his philosophy \"... followed from the universal [[theory of relativity]], of which the [[Special theory of relativity|specific]] and [[General theory of relativity|general theories of relativity]] are special instances.\" Quisling wanted universism to be the official state religion of his new Norway, and he said \"the positing of such a system depends on the progress of science.\"<ref name=\"dahl8\" />\n\nHis ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' was divided into four parts: an introduction, a description of mankind's apparent progression from individual to increasing complex consciousnesses, a section on his tenets of morality and law, and a final section on science, art, politics, history, race and religion. The conclusion was to be titled ''The World's Organic Classification and Organisation,'' but the work remained unfinished. Generally, Quisling worked on it infrequently during his time in politics. The biographer [[Hans Fredrik Dahl]] describes this as \"fortunate\" since Quisling would \"never have won recognition\" as a philosopher.<ref name=\"dahl8\" />\n\nDuring his trial and particularly after being sentenced, Quisling became interested once more in Universism. He saw the events of the war as part of the move towards the establishment of God's kingdom on earth and justified his actions in those terms. During the first week of October, he wrote a fifty-page document titled ''Universistic Aphorisms,'' which represented \"... an almost ecstatic revelation of truth and the light to come, which bore the mark of nothing less than a prophet.\"<ref name=\"dahl410\" /> The document was also notable for its attack on the [[materialism]] of National Socialism. In addition, he simultaneously worked on a sermon, ''Eternal Justice,'' which reiterated his key beliefs, including reincarnation.<ref name=\"dahl410\">{{harvnb|Dahl|1999|pp=410\u2013412}}.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[F\u00f8rergarde]]\n* [[Benedict Arnold]]\n* [[Wang Jingwei]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Cite book |title=Current Biography Yearbook |title-link=Current Biography |year=1940 |location=New York, United States |publisher=H.

The present DNA analysis' resolution is not high enough to determine their relationships to different species of ''[[Anas]]'', but [[biogeography]] strongly suggests that their closest living relative is the widespread [[Pacific black duck]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n<!-- From the [[DNA sequence]]s it has been estimated that the ancestors of the moa-nalo reached the Hawaiian Islands about 3.6 million years ago (calibration used may recently have turned out to be erroneous - In that case, cite a source for the problem), by which time the genus ''Anas'' was already distributed worldwide. There they increased in size, but must have retained the ability to fly until they had spread to the newer islands. They seem to have lost the power of flight by the time the main island of Hawai{{okina}}i had emerged from the sea (400,000 years ago); there, their [[ecological niche|niche]] was filled by one or two species of now extinct giant ''[[Branta]]'' goose presumably related to the surviving [[Nene (bird)|n\u0113n\u0113]]. -->\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Cyanea platyphylla.jpg|thumb|A sapling of ''Cyanea platyphylla'', showing the prickles that probably evolved as a defense against feeding by moa-nalo.]]\n[[Image:Chelychelychen quassus.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of ''Chelychelychen quassus'']]\nThe unusual shape and size of the moa-nalo can be attributed to their role in the [[ecology]] of prehistoric Hawai{{okina}}i. A study of [[coprolite]]s (fossil dung) of ''Thambetochen chauliodous'' found in Pu{{okina}}u Naio Cave on lowland Maui has shown they were [[Folivore|folivorous]], at least in [[Hawaiian tropical dry forests#Prehistoric dry forests|dry shrub]] or [[mesic forest]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s eating particularly fronds from [[fern]]s (possibly ''[[Asplenium nidus]]'' or ''[[Dryopteris wallichiana]]''). This conclusion is backed up by the shapes of their beaks (James & Burney 1997). This indicates they were the principal [[Herbivory|browser]]s on the island.\nThe presence of prominent spines on the leaves and soft young stems of several [[Hawaiian lobelioids]] in the genus ''[[Hawaiian lobelioids#Cyanea|Cyanea]]''\u2014unusual in an island flora where such defenses are frequently lost, as in the ''[[Rubus hawaiensis|{{okina}}\u0101kala]]'' (Hawaiian [[Rubus|raspberry]])\u2014suggests that the ''Cyanea'' evolved these thorn-like prickles on new growth because they protect against browsing by the moa-nalo. The moa-nalo themselves filled the [[ecological niche|niche]] of herbivore usually filled by mammals such as [[goat]]s and [[deer]], or the [[giant tortoise]]s of [[Gal\u00e1pagos]] and other [[archipelago]]es. This has implications for the ecology of Hawaiian Islands today, as a major group of species have been lost.\n\nLike island [[taxa]] from [[Mauritius]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Polynesia]], the moa-nalo were unused to [[mammal]]s and were easily taken by hunters or the animals that were introduced and became [[feral]], such as [[domestic pig]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Giant tortoise]]s, found on several archipelagos around the world\n* [[Island gigantism]]\n* [[Late Quaternary prehistoric birds]]\n* [[Moa]], enormous extinct flightless [[ratite]]s, formerly the largest herbivores in New Zealand\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n* '''James''', Helen F. & '''Burney''', David A.

They represent four [[species]] in three [[genus|genera]] so far:\n\n* ''Chelychelynechen quassus'' ([[turtle-jawed moa-nalo]]) from Kaua{{okina}}i\n* ''Ptaiochen pau'' ([[small-billed moa-nalo]]) from Maui\n* ''Thambetochen xanion'' ([[O'ahu moa-nalo]]) from O{{okina}}ahu\n* ''Thambetochen chauliodous'' ([[Maui Nui large-billed moa-nalo]]) from Maui, L\u0101na{{okina}}i and Moloka{{okina}}i ([[Maui Nui]])\n\n''Chelychelynechen'', meaning turtle-jawed goose, had a large, heavy bill like that of a [[tortoise]], while the other two genera, ''Thambetochen'' and ''Ptaiochen'', all had serrations in their bills known as pseudoteeth, similar to those of [[merganser]]s. All species were [[Flightless bird|flightless]] and large, with an average mass of {{convert|4|-|7.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Evolution==\n[[Image:Thambetochen xanion.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of ''Thambetochen xanion'']]\n[[File:Thambetochen xanion (1).jpg|thumb|Rostrum and sternum of ''Thambetochen xanion'']]\nSome moa-nalo fossils have been found to contain traces of [[mitochondrial DNA]] which were compared to living duck species in order to establish their place in the duck family, [[Anatidae]].<ref name=Sorenson>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rspb.1999.0907|pmc = 1690346|title = Relationships of the extinct moa-nalos, flightless Hawaiian waterfowl, based on ancient DNA|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The present DNA analysis' resolution is not high enough to determine their relationships to different species of ''[[Anas]]'', but [[biogeography]] strongly suggests that their closest living relative is the widespread [[Pacific black duck]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n<!-- From the [[DNA sequence]]s it has been estimated that the ancestors of the moa-nalo reached the Hawaiian Islands about 3.6 million years ago (calibration used may recently have turned out to be erroneous - In that case, cite a source for the problem), by which time the genus ''Anas'' was already distributed worldwide. There they increased in size, but must have retained the ability to fly until they had spread to the newer islands. They seem to have lost the power of flight by the time the main island of Hawai{{okina}}i had emerged from the sea (400,000 years ago); there, their [[ecological niche|niche]] was filled by one or two species of now extinct giant ''[[Branta]]'' goose presumably related to the surviving [[Nene (bird)|n\u0113n\u0113]]. -->\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Cyanea platyphylla.jpg|thumb|A sapling of ''Cyanea platyphylla'', showing the prickles that probably evolved as a defense against feeding by moa-nalo.]]\n[[Image:Chelychelychen quassus.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of ''Chelychelychen quassus'']]\nThe unusual shape and size of the moa-nalo can be attributed to their role in the [[ecology]] of prehistoric Hawai{{okina}}i. A study of [[coprolite]]s (fossil dung) of ''Thambetochen chauliodous'' found in Pu{{okina}}u Naio Cave on lowland Maui has shown they were [[Folivore|folivorous]], at least in [[Hawaiian tropical dry forests#Prehistoric dry forests|dry shrub]] or [[mesic forest]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s eating particularly fronds from [[fern]]s (possibly ''[[Asplenium nidus]]'' or ''[[Dryopteris wallichiana]]''). This conclusion is backed up by the shapes of their beaks (James & Burney 1997). This indicates they were the principal [[Herbivory|browser]]s on the island.\nThe presence of prominent spines on the leaves and soft young stems of several [[Hawaiian lobelioids]] in the genus ''[[Hawaiian lobelioids#Cyanea|Cyanea]]''\u2014unusual in an island flora where such defenses are frequently lost, as in the ''[[Rubus hawaiensis|{{okina}}\u0101kala]]'' (Hawaiian [[Rubus|raspberry]])\u2014suggests that the ''Cyanea'' evolved these thorn-like prickles on new growth because they protect against browsing by the moa-nalo. The moa-nalo themselves filled the [[ecological niche|niche]] of herbivore usually filled by mammals such as [[goat]]s and [[deer]], or the [[giant tortoise]]s of [[Gal\u00e1pagos]] and other [[archipelago]]es. This has implications for the ecology of Hawaiian Islands today, as a major group of species have been lost.\n\nLike island [[taxa]] from [[Mauritius]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Polynesia]], the moa-nalo were unused to [[mammal]]s and were easily taken by hunters or the animals that were introduced and became [[feral]], such as [[domestic pig]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Giant tortoise]]s, found on several archipelagos around the world\n* [[Island gigantism]]\n* [[Late Quaternary prehistoric birds]]\n* [[Moa]], enormous extinct flightless [[ratite]]s, formerly the largest herbivores in New Zealand\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n* '''James''', Helen F. & '''Burney''', David A.

Mugwort was used to repel insects \u2013 especially moths \u2013 from gardens. Mugwort has also been used from ancient times as a remedy against fatigue and to protect travelers against evil spirits and wild animals.

The famous Chinese poet [[S\u016b Sh\u00ec]] in the 11th century mentioned it in one of his poems. There are even older poems and songs that can be tracked back to 3 BC. It was often called {{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|l\u00f3uh\u0101o}} ({{lang|zh|\u848c\u84bf}}) or {{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|\u00e0ic\u01ceo}} ({{lang|zh|\u827e\u8349}}) in Mandarin. Mugwort can be prepared as a cold dish or can be [[stir fry|stir-fried]] with fresh or smoked meat. The [[Hakka]] [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese]] also use it to make ''[[chh\u00fa-khak-k\u00e9]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u9f20\u9eb9\u7cbf}}), doughy sweet dumplings. Mugwort is also used as a flavoring and colorant for a seasonal rice dish.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Bite of China: The Story of Staple Food|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCgYUKPNCug|accessdate=20 February 2013|language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nIn [[traditional Chinese medicine]], mugwort is used in a pulverized and aged form \u2013 called ''{{linktext|moxa}}'' in English (from Japanese ''mogusa'') \u2013 to perform [[moxibustion]], that is, to burn on specific [[acupuncture point]]s on the patient's body to achieve therapeutic effects.\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany, known as {{wikt-lang|de|Beifu\u00df}}, it is mainly used to [[seasoning|season]] goose, especially the roast goose traditionally eaten for Christmas.\n\n===Japan===\nMugwort \u2013 or {{nihongo||\u84ec|[[yomogi]]}} \u2013 is used in a number of Japanese dishes, including ''[[y\u014dkan]]'', a dessert, or ''[[kusa mochi]]'', also known as ''yomogi [[mochi]]''.\n\nMugwort [[rice cake]]s, or ''kusa mochi'' are used for Japanese sweets called ''[[daifuku]]'' (literally 'great luck'). To make these, take a small amount of mochi and stuff it or wrap it round a filling of fruit or sweetened [[adzuki]] (red bean) paste. Traditional ''daifuku'' can be pale green, white or pale pink and are covered in a fine layer of [[potato starch]] to prevent sticking.\n\nMugwort is a vital ingredient of ''kusa mochi'' (rice cake with mugwort) and ''hishi mochi'' (lozenge rice cake), which is served at the [[Doll Festival]] in March. In addition, the fuzz on the underside of the mugwort leaves is gathered and used in [[moxibustion]]. In some regions in Japan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shejapan.com/jtyeholder/jtye/living/wagashi/wagashi3.html|title=YOMOGI|first=KAMANEKO WORKSHOP K.Okaeda|last=Kamaneko@msn.com|website=www.shejapan.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> there is an ancient custom of hanging ''yomogi'' and [[iris (plant)|iris]] leaves together outside homes in order to keep evil spirits away. It is said that evil spirits dislike their smell. The juice is said to be effective at stopping bleeding, lowering fevers and purging the stomach of impurities. It can also be boiled and taken to relieve colds and coughs.\n\n===Korea===\nIn both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], mugwort \u2013 {{transl|ko|ssuk}} ({{lang|ko|\uc465}}) \u2013 is used in soups and salads. A traditional soup containing mugwort and clams is {{transl|ko|ssukguk}} ({{lang|ko|\uc465\uad6d}}), made in spring from the young plants just before they bloom. Another dish is named {{transl|ko|ssukbeomul}} ({{lang|ko|\uc465\ubc84\ubb3c}}), in which the mugwort is mixed with [[rice flour]], sugar, salt and water and is then steamed.\n\nIt is a common ingredient in [[rice cake]]s, teas, [[soup]]s, and [[pancake]]s. \nKnown as a blood cleanser, it is believed to have different medicinal properties depending on the region it is collected in.

Traditional ''daifuku'' can be pale green, white or pale pink and are covered in a fine layer of [[potato starch]] to prevent sticking.\n\nMugwort is a vital ingredient of ''kusa mochi'' (rice cake with mugwort) and ''hishi mochi'' (lozenge rice cake), which is served at the [[Doll Festival]] in March.
