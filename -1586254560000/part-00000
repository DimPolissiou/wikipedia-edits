A fleet of more than a hundred ships of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral [[Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam|Jacob van Wassenaer, Lord Obdam]] attacked an English fleet of equal size commanded by [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] forty miles east of the port of [[Lowestoft]] in [[Suffolk]]. Although it was a substantial English victory, the escape of the bulk of the Dutch fleet deprived England of the chance of ending the war quickly with a single decisive victory. As a result, the Dutch were able to make good their losses by building new and better-armed ships and improving their organisation and discipline. Their Dutch fleets would not be so badly organised or ill-disciplined in the remaining battles of this war and, in Obdam's replacement, [[Michiel de Ruyter]], they had gained a superb tactician and leader.\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] resulted from long-standing commercial tensions between England and the Netherlands, which escalated from 1664 following English provocations in North America and West Africa.<ref>Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War'', p.73</ref> Despite diplomatic negotiations to avoid the outbreak of war, each country refused to compromise, and hostile acts by each side continued.<ref>Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War'', pp.95, 98-9</ref> The English ambassador in France reported that [[Louis XIV of France]] would probably evade his treaty obligations and refuse to be drawn into war with England if the Dutch could be provoked into declaring war: following English attacks on Dutch convoys, one off Cadiz and the other in the English Channel, the [[Dutch Republic]] did declare war on England on 4 March 1665.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.67-9</ref>\n\nAt the start of the war, both sides considered an early decisive battle was desirable, as English government finances could not sustain a long war, and as an English blockade of Dutch ports and attacks on their merchant and fishing fleets would soon bring about the ruin of the Dutch economy.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.69-70</ref> After an early English blockade which took place in April and May was broken off through its ships' lack of supplies, the Dutch were desperate to prevent a second blockade. The [[Grand Pensionary]] and leading Dutch politician, [[Johan de Witt]] and other members of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States-General]], formed a commission to supervise Obdam,<ref>Bruijn, ''The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'', p.70</ref> which gave him detailed instructions comprising 26 articles, ordering him to attack the English aggressively when and where he could do them most damage. However, these instructions gave Obdam little guidance on how he should do so.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.79, 83</ref><ref name=\"Warnsinck 287\">Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.287</ref>\n\nAlthough the Dutch had ordered the construction of many new warships, during and after the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], including several comparable to the all but the largest English ships to augment the existing fleet, not all of these were completed or fitted out by 1665.<ref>Bruijn, ''The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'', pp.64-6</ref> To complete Oddam's fleet, eighteen older warships that had been laid up after the First Anglo-Dutch War were reactivated, and several very large [[Dutch East India Company]] built hybrid ships were added. These could be used for carrying cargo, as convoy escorts or in battle, although they were not as strongly built as pure warships.<ref>Bruijn, ''The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'', p.74</ref> Perhaps realising that his fleet was still too inferior in organisation, training, discipline and firepower to challenge the English successfully in a decisive battle, Obdam prepared to postpone the fight until the wind turned favourable in order to seek a limited confrontation, with his fleet in a defensive [[leeward]] position from which it could disengage quickly and return to its ports without openly disobeying orders.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.83-5</ref> However, this opportunistic attitude and lack of a clear strategic plan was a significant cause of his defeat and death.<ref>Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)''. p.131</ref>\n\nThe instructions issued by the commission headed by de Witt insisted on specifying that the Dutch fleet's order of battle should involve its division into a seven squadrons with a total of 21 flag officers for political reasons.<ref name=\"Warnsinck 287\"/><ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.79</ref> Each of the five [[Dutch admiralties]] had its own set of flag officers, including many recently appointed ones. Each of the three smaller admiralties insisted on having its own squadron, so the larger Admiralties of Amsterdam and the Maas (i.e. [[Rotterdam]]) then split their forces in two squadrons, each of similar size to those of the smaller admiralties. This resulted in seven squadrons, each with three flag officers; several were led by Lieutenant Admirals of equal rank to Obdam, who commanded his own squadron as well as the whole fleet. As the seven squadrons were not subdivided, the 14 subordinate flag officers had no clear function, except as potential replacements for their leaders.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.288</ref> In addition, several squadrons had ships or flag officers from more than one admiralty, complicating their chain of command.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.79-80</ref> Both national fleets could only be made as large as they were by employing armed merchants: the English used 24 of these,<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.43-4</ref> the Dutch twelve.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.46-7</ref>\n\nOn 11 June, a ship detached from the English fleet sighted the Dutch fleet sailing from the east with a light following breeze, and the fleet tried to close in on the Dutch against an adverse wind. At 4pm, the strength of the turning tide and a near calm forced the English fleet to anchor, and the Dutch did not make use of the favourable current to attack them, but also anchored, so avoiding battle that day.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.83-4</ref> Obdam certainly wished to fight and had clear orders to do so, but an easterly breeze would prevent the Dutch fleet from retreating if it were outfought, and his waiting for a westerly breeze may have saved the bulk of the Dutch fleet from destruction by allowing it to withdraw after the resulting battle.<ref name=\"Fox 85\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.85</ref> On 12 June the wind again blew from the east, and again Obdam declined to attack, despite holding the [[weather gage]]. The two fleets sailed westward for most of the day, until the wind veered to a southerly, then a southwesterly, direction overnight. By dawn, the wind had strengthened and was from a direction between southwest and south, which slightly favoured the English fleet. Obdam decided to attack and he now approached the enemy,<ref name=\"Fox 85\"/> possibly fearing that if the wind became more westerly, it would favour the English fleet even more.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', pp.300-1</ref>\n\nThe English fleet of 109 ships carried 4,542 guns and 22,055 men; it consisted of three squadrons:<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.318-20</ref>\n# [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] commanded the van, the White Squadron\n# James himself commanded the centre , the Red Squadron, and\n# [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich]], commanded the rearguard, the Blue Squadron\n\nThe Dutch fleet of 103 ships carrying 4,869 guns and 21,613 men had no fewer than seven squadrons:<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.324-6</ref>\n# First squadron, from the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]], commanded by van Wassenaer himself in {{ship|Dutch ship|Eendracht|1655|2}}\n# Second squadron, mainly from the Admiralties of Zeeland and the Maas, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral [[Johan Evertsen]] on ''Hof van Zeeland''\n# Third squadron from the Admiralty of Amsterdam, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral [[Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer]] on ''Groot Hollandia''\n# Fourth squadron, mainly from the [[Admiralty of Friesland|Frisian fleet]] with some East Indies Company ships, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral [[Auke Stellingwerf]] on ''Sevenwolden''\n# Fifth squadron from the Admiralty of Amsterdam, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Cornelis Tromp]] on ''Liefde''\n# Sixth squadron, mainly from the Admiralties of Zeeland and the Maas, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Cornelis Evertsen the Elder]] on ''Vlissingen'' and\n# Seventh squadron from the [[Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier|Admiralty of the Northern Quarter commanded]] by Vice Admiral [[Volckert Schram]] on ''Wapen van Nassau''\n\n== Battle ==\n{{further|Order of battle at the Battle of Lowestoft}}\n=== Morning ===\nIt is difficult to give a fully coherent account of the battle, and more so to recover the intentions of the commanders, particularly those of Obdam who did not survive the battle.<ref name=\"Fox 85\"/> He had, on 12 June, sent all of his silverware and other valuables home, which perhaps shows his state of mind.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.299</ref> Although Obdam has been accused of lack both of leadership and tactical insight, masked in earlier battles where [[Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer]], who had been promoted to be a lieutenant-admiral at Lowestoft, had been his [[flag captain]].<ref>Bruijn, ''The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'', p.73</ref> Although the English found Obdam's behaviour puzzling, his tactical decisions may relate to his appreciation that his out-gunned, poorly organised fleet could only succeed in battle under ideal conditions and needed to be able to disengage if it risked defeat.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.83, 85</ref> After their defeat, the surviving Dutch flag officers, in order to exonerate themselves, pretended their fleet had followed the original written orders, blaming misfortune and cowardice among the merchant captains for the disaster.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.124</ref>\n\nIn the early morning of the 13th, both fleets were about 40 miles southeast of [[Lowestoft]], with the Dutch fleet southeast of the English fleet. The wind was described as a \"fine chasing gale\", implying a strong but not excessive wind, from a direction between southwest and south. Just before dawn, at around 4am, Obdam made a sudden westward dash to regain the weather gage, trying to pass to the south of the English fleet. In Sandwich's account, Sir Christopher Myngs, leading the English van, immediately moved southeast to prevent this, and was able to retain the weather gage, forcing the leading Dutch ships to steer northwest, the two fleets passing in opposite directions but at some distance. As Obdam's move surprised his own fleet, it was left in some confusion.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.85-6</ref><ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.302</ref> An alternative interpretation was that the wind was blowing from the northwest and van Wassenaer tried to engage the English from a defensive leeward position, his favorite tactic,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} however, Warnsinck's detailed account from a Dutch perspective confirms a southwest wind was blowing.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', pp.302-3</ref>\n\nDuring this first pass, the ''[[Great Charity]]'' (originally an Amsterdam Directors' ship the ''Groote Liefde'', which was captured during the [[Battle of Portland]] in 1653) became isolated to the east of the Dutch line and was boarded and captured by captain [[Jan den Haen]], the later admiral, who immediately returned with his prize to the Netherlands. This obviously unsound practice would be prohibited in the Dutch fleet after this battle.<ref name=\"Warnsinck 305\">Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.305</ref> Another English ship, the merchantman ''John & Abigail'' was also isolated, but eventually managed to rejoin the English fleet.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.86</ref>\n\nLater an English victory tune \"The Dutch Armado A Meer Bravado\" declared: \"Fortune was pleasant when she lent the Dutch our 'Charity' a thing they wanted much.\"\n\n[[File:The Battle of Lowestoft, 3 June 1665 - Engagement between the English and Dutch Fleets by Adriaen Van Diest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Battle of Lowestoft'' by [[Adriaen Van Diest]], {{circa|1670s}}]]\nAfter this, there was a second pass that needed each fleet to reverse course. Penn had inserted a new article in the fleet's Fighting Instructions requiring it to [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]] from the rear, so reversing the order of the fleet, but Penn later recounted that displaying the signal for this manoeuvre was delayed until after the Dutch fleet had already started to turn. Prince Rupert in the van, realising there was a problem, ordered his Red Squadron to reverse course while maintaining the same order, although his leading division under Myngs at first missed Rupert's signal. Penn then cancelled his first order and the Duke led the centre and rear of his squadron to the northwest, but his leading division under Lawson ignored his admiral's turn until the Blue Squadron under Sandwich began its own turn. This left a large gap to the rear of Rupert's White Squadron. Fortunately for the English, the Dutch fleet was sufficiently far to the north to be unable to take immediate advantage of this gap and, from 6am to 7am, the two fleets were not engaged.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.87-8</ref>\n\nPenn's solution to the developing Dutch threat, was bold: soon after 7am<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.306</ref> he steered the ''Royal Charles'' and the bulk of the Red Squadron to the west to form a second battleline to prevent Obdam gaining the weather gage. The Dutch made no attempt to do so, whether because of Penn's manoeuvre or because their ships could not steer sufficiently westward against a southwesterly wind. In addition, Sandwich's Blue Squadron had largely closed the gap left by Rupert's squadron,<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.307</ref> and had formed in a rather disordered line behind him, with Lawson's division following Sandwich.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.88-9</ref> The fighting during this pass was at a closer range than in the first one, and the Dutch ships attempted to break through the English line: although three of their ships temporarily succeeded, they were soon forced back.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.90</ref>\n\nOnce the whole Dutch fleet was opposite the English, James and Penn decided to attempt the manoeuvre of tacking from the rear a second time. This required careful coordination and timing, but it was achieved under fire, such that Lawson's division now led Sandwich, with Rupert in the rear.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', pp.306-7</ref> Following this, the two fleets were now moving in the same northwesterly direction at the same speed from about 8am. Up to this point, casualties had been relatively light, but in the heavy fighting that followed, the Frisian commander, Lieutenant-Admiral Auke Stellingwerf, was cut in two and the veteran Lieutenant-Admiral Kortenaer, probably the most competent Dutch commander present, was fatally wounded, both by cannonballs. [[Quartermaster]] Ate Stinstra then took command of Kortenaer's ship.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.91-2</ref><ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.304</ref>\n\nAll reports of the stage of the battle from late morning to midday are fragmentary. Although the English fleet had become disarranged through executing its tacking manoeuvres, the Dutch were in greater disarray and many Dutch ships failed to remain in a coherent line of battle.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.91</ref> In theory, their being in a leeward position would have given the Dutch guns greater range, allowing them to destroy the rigging of the English ships from a safe distance  with [[chain shot]], but in reality the seven squadrons began to block each other's line of fire. In addition, those flag officers and captains most hungry for battle quickly left the less enthusiastic officers and older ships behind, while company ships were untrained in the tactics of fighting in formation.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.86-7</ref><ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.309</ref> As far as can be established, Kortenaer's squadron led the Dutch fleet, ranged against Lawson, followed by Johan Evertsen and Obdam, who were mainly opposing Sandwich's squadron, with Tromp and Cornelis Evertsen towards the rear, facing Rupert. The ships of the Dutch fourth and seventh squadrons were scattered throughout the line, and most of the English Red Squadron formed a separate line to the west of the main area of combat, remaining almost out of range of Dutch gunfire for several hours.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.92-4</ref> Around midday, Lawson's flagship, the ''Royal Oak'', left the line having suffered significant damage, with Lawson himself wounded. He was quickly replaced by [[Joseph Jordan]], who soon returned the flagship to lead its division.<ref name=\"Fox 93\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.93</ref>\n\n=== Afternoon ===    \nThe long gunnery contest continued until around 2pm, with the Dutch putting significant pressure on the English Blue Squadron, while holding their own elsewhere, because much of the Red Squadron was largely inactive. However, James and Penn began to send reinforcements to assist Sandwich around noon.<ref name=\"Fox 93\"/> The fiercest fighting if the early afternoon was between Obdam's and Sandwich's squadrons, the latter of which was concentrating its fire and heavily damaging the opposing Dutch ships.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.310</ref> Obdam's flagship ''Eendracht'' and about five other large Dutch ships tried to break through Sandwich's squadron, and men from the giant Dutch East Indies ship ''Oranje'' under its captain Bastian Senten boarded and temporarily took over one of Sandwich's ships, the ''Montague''.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.94</ref><ref>Leven en bedryf van den vermaarden zeeheld Cornelis Tromp, Graaf ..., Volume 1.</ref> However James and Penn sent the ''Old James'' of 68 guns under [[James Ley, 3rd Earl of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]] against the ''Oranje'', whiled he and Penn sailed the {{ship|HMS|Royal Charles|1655|2}} against the ''Eendracht'' in support of Sandwich's flagship {{ship|English ship|Prince Royal|1610|2}}. These reinforcements forced Senten to recall his boarders and the Dutch to abandon their attempted breakthrough: this attempt and its repulse created considerable disorder among the Dutch ships.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.94-5</ref>\n\nBoth Sandwich, who was close to the centre of the action and, simultaneously but independently, Rupert further away, noticed the Dutch disarray, and embarked on attacks which were to decide the outcome of the battle. Sandwich attempted to break through the Dutch centre and four of the Dutch ships trying to oppose him ran into one another. As these ships failed to surrender, they were later attacked an English fireship, and only one escaped being  burned.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.313</ref> Other Dutch ships retreated.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.95, 98</ref> To the north, Tromp and Cornelis Evertsen tried to seize the weather gage from Rupert, who retained it while continuing to inflict severe damage to his opponents.<ref name=\"Fox 95\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.95</ref>\n\nWhile these two English attacks were taking place, the Duke of York attacked the ''Eendracht''. A Dutch chain-shot from Obdam's flagship narrowly missed James and killed several of his courtiers on the ''Royal Charles'', the Hon. Richard Boyle (son of [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington]]), [[Charles MacCarty, Viscount Muskerry|Viscount Muskerry]] and the [[Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth|Earl of Falmouth]]. The last, who was untalented and little regarded was decapitated, leading the poet [[Andrew Marvell]], using the pseudonym [[John Denham (poet)|John Denham]]) to write a brutal epitaph: \"His shattered head the fearless Duke disdains, and gave the last first proof that he had Brains\".<ref name=\"Fox 95\"/> However, casualties on the ''Eendracht'' were even more severe, with Obdam being killed on its quarterdeck by a cannon ball and, a few minutes after his death, at about 3pm, its magazine exploded without warning, destroying the ship and killing all but five of its crew.<ref name=\"Fox 95\u201396\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.95\u201396</ref>\n\nThe loss of the flagship and death of its commander, just as the English Blue and White squadrons were attacking, seriously affected Dutch morale, which was further damaged by the uncertainty over his successor.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.315</ref> The next most senior flag officer was Johan Evertsen of Zeeland, who was distrusted by the politicians of the dominant province of Holland, who had therefore nominated Egbert Kortenaer to be Obdam's successor before the battle. Kortenaer had been fatally wounded and was incapable of command, but Stinstra, his flag captain kept Kortenaer's flag as admiral of the third Squadron flying and, unnerved by the explosion of the ''Eendracht'', he fled the battle, followed by many ships of that squadron, which assumed that they should follow their leader's flag.<ref name=\"Warnsinck 305\"/> Seeing, as he thought, Kortenaer had abdicated his responsibility, Johan Evertsen raised a pendant showing he commanded the fleet, but Cornelis Tromp, the senior Amsterdam officer also raised a command pendant adding to the confusion, as three ships claimed to be fleet flagship.<ref name=\"Fox 95\u201396\"/>\n\nBy this stage, any semblance of lines of battle had disappeared, and the battle took on the appearance of a gigantic and shapeless m\u00eal\u00e9e, although the more aggressive English fleet was in fact forcing many of the Dutch ships, unnerved by the loss of the ''Eendracht'' or following Kortenaer's flag in the ''Groot Hollandia'', to retreat. A complete Dutch rout was prevented only by what ships rallied to Evertsen or Tromp and the action of the ''Oranje'', which fought off several opponents for around two hours until, shattered and sinking it surrendered and was burned.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', pp.316-7</ref> These Dutch forces allowed the bulk of their fleet, which had lost all cohesion by around 6pm, to gain a headstart on any English pursuit. During this stage, the Earl of Marlborough and the [[Charles Weston, 3rd Earl of Portland|Earl of Portland]] were killed and the ships of Lawson's division of the Red Squadron and Teddiman's division of the Blue Squadron joined the main battle forcing more Dutch ships to retreat.<ref name=\"Fox 97\u201398, 100\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.97\u201398, 100</ref>        \n\nBetween 6pm and 9pm, the larger English ships concentrated, on forcing first Evertsen and then Tromp into retreat and mopping-up Dutch ships too damaged to escape, capturing three.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.98, 100</ref> Tromp later claimed that his rearguard action prevented greater losses, as many of the fleeing Dutch ships' crews were demoralised and would not fight any English pursuers.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.318</ref> As Sandwich had broken through the Dutch fleet, it disintegrated in its flight into a number of separate bodies, escaping to different ports. Tromp led one group to [[Texel]], followed by Rupert, Johan Evertsen retreated with another contingent to the [[Maas (river)|Maas]] pursued by the rest of the English fleet, and other ships headed for the [[Scheldt]].<ref name=\"Fox 97\u201398, 100\"/> However, the English commanders did not order a general chase by releasing their faster ships to overtake the slower of the Dutch fugitives, but remained in squadron. At around 9pm, Sandwich even ordered his squadron to shorten sail so that the White Squadron could catch up and the Duke of York assume command.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.98-9</ref>\n\nMuch more damaging, however, was the decision taken for the ''Royal Charles'' to reduce sail during the night. Significant controversy surrounds this incident, and several explanations have been proposed to explain it. An account which relies on the reported testimonies of Penn and Harman suggests that [[Henry Brouncker, 3rd Viscount Brouncker|Lord Henry Brouncker]], James' master of the bedchamber, either from fear or because he had promised the Duchess of York to keep the Duke from danger, first approached William Penn, the [[Captain of the Fleet]] asking him to slacken sail, reminding him that the Duke was [[heir presumptive]] and that his death would be a disaster. Penn refused, stating that only James could order this, but he then went below. Brouncker next approached the captain of the ''Royal Charles'' [[John Harman (Admiral)|John Harman]], this time pretending that the order to take in sail did come from James. When ''Royal Charles'' reduced sail in the course of the night, the rest of the English fleet followed suit.<ref name=\"Fox 99\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.99</ref> According to another account, Penn was said to have remarked that James, having narrowly escaped death in the battle, had lost his nerve completely.<ref> David Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' (1936) p. 288.</ref> Brouncker later fled for his life rather than face a Parliamentary enquiry after the war, which could have condemned him.<ref name=\"Fox 99\"/>\n\nWhen, on the morning of 14 June, the fastest English frigates were sent ahead of the main fleet, they captured six Dutch ships, some of which defended themselves honourably, but others offered little resistance: these were in addition to three captures on the previous evening. The results of what had been a notable victory were less than might have been expected, firstly through the rearguard actions of Tromp and Johan Evertsen which allowed many Dutch ships to disengage from the battle and secondly the failure to release the faster frigates from the main fleet in pursuit of the fleeing Dutch, which could have been ordered as early as 6pm.<ref name=\"Warnsinck 305\"/> These small but fast ships had taken little part in the main action, but their activities on the morning of 14 June showed what could have been achieved. The controversial slowing-down of the whole fleet at night simply exacerbated this earlier failure.<ref name=\"Fox 99\u2013100\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.99-100</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe English lost only one ship, the captured ''Great Charity'' mentioned above. Eight Dutch ships were sunk by the English; six of these were burnt in two separate incidents when they got entangled while fleeing, and each group was set ablaze by a [[fire ship]]: this happened to the ''Tergoes'' entangling with the company ship the ''Maarseveen'' and the merchantman the ''Swanenburg''; and also to the ''Koevorden'', the ''Stad Utrecht'' and the ''Prinse Maurits''. The earlier mentioned company ship the ''Oranje'' was set on fire after being reduced to a wreck when fighting off several English ships. The first to attack was one of the Duke of York's squadron, the ''Mary'' under captain [[Jeremiah Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Jeremiah Smith]], which lost 99 men of its crew in this action, followed later by the {{HMS|Royal Oak|1674|2}}, the {{HMS|Essex|1653|2}} and the {{HMS|Royal Katherine|1664|2}}. According to some accounts, the ''Oranje'' lost half of its crew of 400 before succumbing, a severely wounded Senten (rumoured to be an expatriate Scotsman) was picked up by an English vessel and shortly after he also died.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.97-8</ref> During the Dutch flight, the English captured nine more ships: ''Hilversum'', ''Delft'', ''Zeelandia'', ''Wapen van Edam'' and ''Jonge Prins''; the VOC-ship ''Nagelboom'' and the merchants ''Carolus Quintus'', ''Mars'' and ''Geldersche Ruyter''. ''Tromp'' was captured but escaped.<ref name=\"Fox 99\u2013100\"/> Eight older ships had to be written off later, as the costs of repairing them would have exceeded their value.\n\nThe English had lost one flag officer, Rear-Admiral [[Robert Samsun]] during the battle, while Vice-Admiral [[John Lawson (naval officer)|Lawson]] was mortally wounded and died three weeks after the battle. Notable English admirals and captains present at the battle included [[William Penn (Royal Navy officer)|William Penn]] in the {{HMS|Royal Charles|1655|2}}, [[Christopher Myngs]] and [[George Ayscue]].<ref name=\"Fox 100\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.100</ref>\n\nThe escape of most of the Dutch fleet was more significant than its losses, as only its destruction as a fighting force would have given England the early victory it needed.<ref name=\"Fox 100\"/> That possibility became more remote as senior Dutch sea officers and politicians began to consider the reasons for the disaster at Lowestoft, and identified three principal causes. The first was the lack of discipline that was dealt with by severely punishing the worst offenders while rewarding success.<ref name=\"Fox 126\u2013127\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.126\u2013127</ref> The second was tactical, as the favoured Dutch tactic of the undisciplined m\u00eal\u00e9e, with individual ships boarding and capturing their opponent and, in many cases, leaving the battle with their prize, was ineffective against English gunnery on ships fighting in line. Although de Ruyter did partially revert to m\u00eal\u00e9e tactics in the last day of the [[Four Days Battle]].<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.262</ref>, fighting in line became the standard tactic in new Fighting Instructions approved by the States General in August 1665.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.127-8</ref> The final cause was the inferiority of Dutch ships which, though well-constructed, were generally smaller and more lightly armed than those of other maritime nations. Although there had been a significant building programme after the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], only ''Eendracht'' and ''Groot Hollandia'', built as fleet flagship, were comparable to English ships of the [[third-rate]]. Although from 1660 the Dutch embarked on an expansion programme, many where smaller ships and only one exceeded the size of the ''Eendracht'', equaling an English [[second-rate]]. This building programme was greatly expanded after the outbreak of the war, but none of its ships had been completed by the time of Lowestoft.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.130-2</ref>\n\nCompared with the Dutch fleet at the [[Four Days' Battle]] in June 1666, Obdam had a fleet comprising many older and smaller vessels and fewer modern ones. It relied strongly on the East Indies Company's ships and other merchantmen, although these did not have the resilience of true warships. There were no East Indies Company ships in the battles of 1666, and the few merchant ships present were not in the line of battle but acted as auxiliaries.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.132</ref>\n\nAlthough Tromp and Evertsen were ordered by the commissioners from the States General to return to sea with as many ships as possible,<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.322</ref>  in the recriminations that followed the battle, Tromp refused, denouncing a number of captains for disobedience or cowardice, and the States General formed a commission to inspect the ships and question the captains of those that seemed to have suffered little damage. Although about two dozen ships showed were found to have suffered little damage, only ten captains were charged with cowardice<ref name=\"Fox 126\u2013127\"/><ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.324</ref> Nine captains were brought to trial: three were shot before the fleet, three exiled and three dismissed from their commands.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.325</ref> A tenth captain, Laurens Heemskerck, who had fled from the Netherlands in 1665, fearing he would be tried for cowardice in the battle, was afterwards condemned ''[[in absentia]]'' to perpetual banishment from the Netherlands. Heemskerck assisted England in planning the [[Holmes's Bonfire|attack on the Vlie]] and later, in 1672, fought on the French side against his countrymen at the [[Battle of Solebay]].<ref> A. J. Van der Aa, (1867). ''Biographische Woordenboek der Nederlandenen''. p.349</ref> Although there was considerable dissatisfaction with the conduct of a number of ships' crews, the States General did mot investigate these, considering that the fault lay with their captains. There were also disputes about who should be promoted to fill the places of the two deceased admirals.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.101</ref>\n\nThe Dutch attempted to learn lessons from their defeat. The [[Admiralty of Zeeland]] instructed its flag officers and captains to avoid lengthy and disadvantageous gun battles and to practice drills aimed at boarding and capturing enemy ships, and in August 1665 the deputies of the States General in discussion with Tromp and other admirals issued revised combat instruction that became the basis of Dutch naval tactics for the rest of the Second Anglo-Dutch War and also for the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The main points of these instruction were the division of the fleet into three distinct squadrons, each with a clear chain of command, improved signaling and the application of the principle of the concentration of superior force against part of the enemy fleet. These instructions implicitly criticised the division of the fleet at Lowestoft into seven squadrons with unclear chains of command but also Obdam's cautious tactics.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', pp.325-6</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flagmen of Lowestoft]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Bruijn, Jaap R.

A fleet of more than a hundred ships of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral [[Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam|Jacob van Wassenaer, Lord Obdam]] attacked an English fleet of equal size commanded by [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] forty miles east of the port of [[Lowestoft]] in [[Suffolk]]. Although it was a substantial English victory, the escape of the bulk of the Dutch fleet deprived England of the chance of ending the war quickly with a single decisive victory. As a result, the Dutch were able to make good their losses by building new and better-armed ships and improving their organisation and discipline. Their Dutch fleets would not be so badly organised or ill-disciplined in the remaining battles of this war and, in Obdam's replacement, [[Michiel de Ruyter]], they had gained a superb tactician and leader. \n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] resulted from long-standing commercial tensions between England and the Netherlands, which escalated from 1664 following English provocations in North America and West Africa.<ref>Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War'', p.73</ref> Despite diplomatic negotiations to avoid the outbreak of war, each country refused to compromise, and hostile acts by each side continued.<ref>Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War'', pp.95, 98-9</ref> The English ambassador in France reported that [[Louis XIV of France]] would probably evade his treaty obligations and refuse to be drawn into war with England if the Dutch could be provoked into declaring war: following English attacks on Dutch convoys, one off Cadiz and the other in the English Channel, the [[Dutch Republic]] did declare war on England on 4 March 1665.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.67-9</ref>\n\nAt the start of the war, both sides considered an early decisive battle was desirable, as English government finances could not sustain a long war, and as an English blockade of Dutch ports and attacks on their merchant and fishing fleets would soon bring about the ruin of the Dutch economy.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.69-70</ref> After an early English blockade which took place in April and May was broken off through its ships' lack of supplies, the Dutch were desperate to prevent a second blockade. The [[Grand Pensionary]] and leading Dutch politician, [[Johan de Witt]] and other members of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States-General]], formed a commission to supervise Obdam,<ref>Bruijn, ''The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'', p.70</ref> which gave him detailed instructions comprising 26 articles, ordering him to attack the English aggressively when and where he could do them most damage. However, these instructions gave Obdam little guidance on how he should do so.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.79, 83</ref><ref name=\"Warnsinck 287\">Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.287</ref>\n\nAlthough the Dutch had ordered the construction of many new warships, during and after the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], including several comparable to the all but the largest English ships to augment the existing fleet, not all of these were completed or fitted out by 1665.<ref>Bruijn, ''The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'', pp.64-6</ref> To complete Oddam's fleet, eighteen older warships that had been laid up after the First Anglo-Dutch War were reactivated, and several very large [[Dutch East India Company]] built hybrid ships were added. These could be used for carrying cargo, as convoy escorts or in battle, although they were not as strongly built as pure warships.<ref>Bruijn, ''The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'', p.74</ref> Perhaps realising that his fleet was still too inferior in organisation, training, discipline and firepower to challenge the English successfully in a decisive battle, Obdam prepared to postpone the fight until the wind turned favourable in order to seek a limited confrontation, with his fleet in a defensive [[leeward]] position from which it could disengage quickly and return to its ports without openly disobeying orders.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.83-5</ref> However, this opportunistic attitude and lack of a clear strategic plan was a significant cause of his defeat and death.<ref>Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)''. p.131</ref>\n\nThe instructions issued by the commission headed by de Witt insisted on specifying that the Dutch fleet's order of battle should involve its division into a seven squadrons with a total of 21 flag officers for political reasons.<ref name=\"Warnsinck 287\"/><ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.79</ref> Each of the five [[Dutch admiralties]] had its own set of flag officers, including many recently appointed ones. Each of the three smaller admiralties insisted on having its own squadron, so the larger Admiralties of Amsterdam and the Maas (i.e. [[Rotterdam]]) then split their forces in two squadrons, each of similar size to those of the smaller admiralties. This resulted in seven squadrons, each with three flag officers; several were led by Lieutenant Admirals of equal rank to Obdam, who commanded his own squadron as well as the whole fleet. As the seven squadrons were not subdivided, the 14 subordinate flag officers had no clear function, except as potential replacements for their leaders.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.288</ref> In addition, several squadrons had ships or flag officers from more than one admiralty, complicating their chain of command.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.79-80</ref> Both national fleets could only be made as large as they were by employing armed merchants: the English used 24 of these,<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.43-4</ref> the Dutch twelve.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.46-7</ref>\n\nOn 11 June, a ship detached from the English fleet sighted the Dutch fleet sailing from the east with a light following breeze, and the fleet tried to close in on the Dutch against an adverse wind. At 4pm, the strength of the turning tide and a near calm forced the English fleet to anchor, and the Dutch did not make use of the favourable current to attack them, but also anchored, so avoiding battle that day.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.83-4</ref> Obdam certainly wished to fight and had clear orders to do so, but an easterly breeze would prevent the Dutch fleet from retreating if it were outfought, and his waiting for a westerly breeze may have saved the bulk of the Dutch fleet from destruction by allowing it to withdraw after the resulting battle.<ref name=\"Fox 85\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.85</ref> On 12 June the wind again blew from the east, and again Obdam declined to attack, despite holding the [[weather gage]]. The two fleets sailed westward for most of the day, until the wind veered to a southerly, then a southwesterly, direction overnight. By dawn, the wind had strengthened and was from a direction between southwest and south, which slightly favoured the English fleet. Obdam decided to attack and he now approached the enemy,<ref name=\"Fox 85\"/> possibly fearing that if the wind became more westerly, it would favour the English fleet even more.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', pp.300-1</ref>\n\nThe English fleet of 109 ships carried 4,542 guns and 22,055 men; it consisted of three squadrons:<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.318-20</ref>\n# [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] commanded the van, the White Squadron\n# James himself commanded the centre , the Red Squadron, and\n# [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich]], commanded the rearguard, the Blue Squadron\n\nThe Dutch fleet of 103 ships carrying 4,869 guns and 21,613 men had no fewer than seven squadrons:<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.324-6</ref>\n# First squadron, from the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]], commanded by van Wassenaer himself in {{ship|Dutch ship|Eendracht|1655|2}}\n# Second squadron, mainly from the Admiralties of Zeeland and the Maas, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral [[Johan Evertsen]] on ''Hof van Zeeland''\n# Third squadron from the Admiralty of Amsterdam, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral [[Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer]] on ''Groot Hollandia''\n# Fourth squadron, mainly from the [[Admiralty of Friesland|Frisian fleet]] with some East Indies Company ships, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral [[Auke Stellingwerf]] on ''Sevenwolden''\n# Fifth squadron from the Admiralty of Amsterdam, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Cornelis Tromp]] on ''Liefde''\n# Sixth squadron, mainly from the Admiralties of Zeeland and the Maas, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Cornelis Evertsen the Elder]] on ''Vlissingen'' and\n# Seventh squadron from the [[Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier|Admiralty of the Northern Quarter commanded]] by Vice Admiral [[Volckert Schram]] on ''Wapen van Nassau''\n\n== Battle ==\n{{further|Order of battle at the Battle of Lowestoft}}\n=== Morning ===\nIt is difficult to give a fully coherent account of the battle, and more so to recover the intentions of the commanders, particularly those of Obdam who did not survive the battle.<ref name=\"Fox 85\"/> He had, on 12 June, sent all of his silverware and other valuables home, which perhaps shows his state of mind.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.299</ref> Although Obdam has been accused of lack both of leadership and tactical insight, masked in earlier battles where [[Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer]], who had been promoted to be a lieutenant-admiral at Lowestoft, had been his [[flag captain]].<ref>Bruijn, ''The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'', p.73</ref> Although the English found Obdam's behaviour puzzling, his tactical decisions may relate to his appreciation that his out-gunned, poorly organised fleet could only succeed in battle under ideal conditions and needed to be able to disengage if it risked defeat.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.83, 85</ref> After their defeat, the surviving Dutch flag officers, in order to exonerate themselves, pretended their fleet had followed the original written orders, blaming misfortune and cowardice among the merchant captains for the disaster.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.124</ref>\n\nIn the early morning of the 13th, both fleets were about 40 miles southeast of [[Lowestoft]], with the Dutch fleet southeast of the English fleet. The wind was described as a \"fine chasing gale\", implying a strong but not excessive wind, from a direction between southwest and south. Just before dawn, at around 4am, Obdam made a sudden westward dash to regain the weather gage, trying to pass to the south of the English fleet. In Sandwich's account, Sir Christopher Myngs, leading the English van, immediately moved southeast to prevent this, and was able to retain the weather gage, forcing the leading Dutch ships to steer northwest, the two fleets passing in opposite directions but at some distance. As Obdam's move surprised his own fleet, it was left in some confusion.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.85-6</ref><ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.302</ref> An alternative interpretation was that the wind was blowing from the northwest and van Wassenaer tried to engage the English from a defensive leeward position, his favorite tactic,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} however, Warnsinck's detailed account from a Dutch perspective confirms a southwest wind was blowing.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', pp.302-3</ref>\n\nDuring this first pass, the ''[[Great Charity]]'' (originally an Amsterdam Directors' ship the ''Groote Liefde'', which was captured during the [[Battle of Portland]] in 1653) became isolated to the east of the Dutch line and was boarded and captured by captain [[Jan den Haen]], the later admiral, who immediately returned with his prize to the Netherlands. This obviously unsound practice would be prohibited in the Dutch fleet after this battle.<ref name=\"Warnsinck 305\">Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.305</ref> Another English ship, the merchantman ''John & Abigail'' was also isolated, but eventually managed to rejoin the English fleet.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.86</ref>\n\nLater an English victory tune \"The Dutch Armado A Meer Bravado\" declared: \"Fortune was pleasant when she lent the Dutch our 'Charity' a thing they wanted much.\"\n\n[[File:The Battle of Lowestoft, 3 June 1665 - Engagement between the English and Dutch Fleets by Adriaen Van Diest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Battle of Lowestoft'' by [[Adriaen Van Diest]], {{circa|1670s}}]]\nAfter this, there was a second pass that needed each fleet to reverse course. Penn had inserted a new article in the fleet's Fighting Instructions requiring it to [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]] from the rear, so reversing the order of the fleet, but Penn later recounted that displaying the signal for this manoeuvre was delayed until after the Dutch fleet had already started to turn. Prince Rupert in the van, realising there was a problem, ordered his Red Squadron to reverse course while maintaining the same order, although his leading division under Myngs at first missed Rupert's signal. Penn then cancelled his first order and the Duke led the centre and rear of his squadron to the northwest, but his leading division under Lawson ignored his admiral's turn until the Blue Squadron under Sandwich began its own turn. This left a large gap to the rear of Rupert's White Squadron. Fortunately for the English, the Dutch fleet was sufficiently far to the north to be unable to take immediate advantage of this gap and, from 6am to 7am, the two fleets were not engaged.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.87-8</ref>\n\nPenn's solution to the developing Dutch threat, was bold: soon after 7am<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.306</ref> he steered the ''Royal Charles'' and the bulk of the Red Squadron to the west to form a second battleline to prevent Obdam gaining the weather gage. The Dutch made no attempt to do so, whether because of Penn's manoeuvre or because their ships could not steer sufficiently westward against a southwesterly wind. In addition, Sandwich's Blue Squadron had largely closed the gap left by Rupert's squadron,<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.307</ref> and had formed in a rather disordered line behind him, with Lawson's division following Sandwich.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.88-9</ref> The fighting during this pass was at a closer range than in the first one, and the Dutch ships attempted to break through the English line: although three of their ships temporarily succeeded, they were soon forced back.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.90</ref>\n\nOnce the whole Dutch fleet was opposite the English, James and Penn decided to attempt the manoeuvre of tacking from the rear a second time. This required careful coordination and timing, but it was achieved under fire, such that Lawson's division now led Sandwich, with Rupert in the rear.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', pp.306-7</ref> Following this, the two fleets were now moving in the same northwesterly direction at the same speed from about 8am. Up to this point, casualties had been relatively light, but in the heavy fighting that followed, the Frisian commander, Lieutenant-Admiral Auke Stellingwerf, was cut in two and the veteran Lieutenant-Admiral Kortenaer, probably the most competent Dutch commander present, was fatally wounded, both by cannonballs. [[Quartermaster]] Ate Stinstra then took command of Kortenaer's ship.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.91-2</ref><ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.304</ref>\n\nAll reports of the stage of the battle from late morning to midday are fragmentary. Although the English fleet had become disarranged through executing its tacking manoeuvres, the Dutch were in greater disarray and many Dutch ships failed to remain in a coherent line of battle.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.91</ref> In theory, their being in a leeward position would have given the Dutch guns greater range, allowing them to destroy the rigging of the English ships from a safe distance  with [[chain shot]], but in reality the seven squadrons began to block each other's line of fire. In addition, those flag officers and captains most hungry for battle quickly left the less enthusiastic officers and older ships behind, while company ships were untrained in the tactics of fighting in formation.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.86-7</ref><ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.309</ref> As far as can be established, Kortenaer's squadron led the Dutch fleet, ranged against Lawson, followed by Johan Evertsen and Obdam, who were mainly opposing Sandwich's squadron, with Tromp and Cornelis Evertsen towards the rear, facing Rupert. The ships of the Dutch fourth and seventh squadrons were scattered throughout the line, and most of the English Red Squadron formed a separate line to the west of the main area of combat, remaining almost out of range of Dutch gunfire for several hours.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.92-4</ref> Around midday, Lawson's flagship, the ''Royal Oak'', left the line having suffered significant damage, with Lawson himself wounded. He was quickly replaced by [[Joseph Jordan]], who soon returned the flagship to lead its division.<ref name=\"Fox 93\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.93</ref>\n\n=== Afternoon ===     \nThe long gunnery contest continued until around 2pm, with the Dutch putting significant pressure on the English Blue Squadron, while holding their own elsewhere, because much of the Red Squadron was largely inactive. However, James and Penn began to send reinforcements to assist Sandwich around noon.<ref name=\"Fox 93\"/> The fiercest fighting if the early afternoon was between Obdam's and Sandwich's squadrons, the latter of which was concentrating its fire and heavily damaging the opposing Dutch ships.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.310</ref> Obdam's flagship ''Eendracht'' and about five other large Dutch ships tried to break through Sandwich's squadron, and men from the giant Dutch East Indies ship ''Oranje'' under its captain Bastian Senten boarded and temporarily took over one of Sandwich's ships, the ''Montague''.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.94</ref><ref>Leven en bedryf van den vermaarden zeeheld Cornelis Tromp, Graaf ..., Volume 1.</ref> However James and Penn sent the ''Old James'' of 68 guns under [[James Ley, 3rd Earl of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]] against the ''Oranje'', whiled he and Penn sailed the {{ship|HMS|Royal Charles|1655|2}} against the ''Eendracht'' in support of Sandwich's flagship {{ship|English ship|Prince Royal|1610|2}}. These reinforcements forced Senten to recall his boarders and the Dutch to abandon their attempted breakthrough: this attempt and its repulse created considerable disorder among the Dutch ships.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.94-5</ref>\n\nBoth Sandwich, who was close to the centre of the action and, simultaneously but independently, Rupert further away, noticed the Dutch disarray, and embarked on attacks which were to decide the outcome of the battle. Sandwich attempted to break through the Dutch centre and four of the Dutch ships trying to oppose him ran into one another. As these ships failed to surrender, they were later attacked an English fireship, and only one escaped being  burned.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.313</ref> Other Dutch ships retreated.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.95, 98</ref> To the north, Tromp and Cornelis Evertsen tried to seize the weather gage from Rupert, who retained it while continuing to inflict severe damage to his opponents.<ref name=\"Fox 95\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.95</ref>\n\nWhile these two English attacks were taking place, the Duke of York attacked the ''Eendracht''. A Dutch chain-shot from Obdam's flagship narrowly missed James and killed several of his courtiers on the ''Royal Charles'', the Hon. Richard Boyle (son of [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington]]), [[Charles MacCarty, Viscount Muskerry|Viscount Muskerry]] and the [[Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth|Earl of Falmouth]]. The last, who was untalented and little regarded was decapitated, leading the poet [[Andrew Marvell]], using the pseudonym [[John Denham (poet)|John Denham]]) to write a brutal epitaph: \"His shattered head the fearless Duke disdains, and gave the last first proof that he had Brains\".<ref name=\"Fox 95\"/> However, casualties on the ''Eendracht'' were even more severe, with Obdam being killed on its quarterdeck by a cannon ball and, a few minutes after his death, at about 3pm, its magazine exploded without warning, destroying the ship and killing all but five of its crew.<ref name=\"Fox 95\u201396\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.95\u201396</ref>\n\nThe loss of the flagship and death of its commander, just as the English Blue and White squadrons were attacking, seriously affected Dutch morale, which was further damaged by the uncertainty over his successor.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.315</ref> The next most senior flag officer was Johan Evertsen of Zeeland, who was distrusted by the politicians of the dominant province of Holland, who had therefore nominated Egbert Kortenaer to be Obdam's successor before the battle. Kortenaer had been fatally wounded and was incapable of command, but Stinstra, his flag captain kept Kortenaer's flag as admiral of the third Squadron flying and, unnerved by the explosion of the ''Eendracht'', he fled the battle, followed by many ships of that squadron, which assumed that they should follow their leader's flag.<ref name=\"Warnsinck 305\"/> Seeing, as he thought, Kortenaer had abdicated his responsibility, Johan Evertsen raised a pendant showing he commanded the fleet, but Cornelis Tromp, the senior Amsterdam officer also raised a command pendant adding to the confusion, as three ships claimed to be fleet flagship.<ref name=\"Fox 95\u201396\"/>\n\nBy this stage, any semblance of lines of battle had disappeared, and the battle took on the appearance of a gigantic and shapeless m\u00eal\u00e9e, although the more aggressive English fleet was in fact forcing many of the Dutch ships, unnerved by the loss of the ''Eendracht'' or following Kortenaer's flag in the ''Groot Hollandia'', to retreat. A complete Dutch rout was prevented only by what ships rallied to Evertsen or Tromp and the action of the ''Oranje'', which fought off several opponents for around two hours until, shattered and sinking it surrendered and was burned.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', pp.316-7</ref> These Dutch forces allowed the bulk of their fleet, which had lost all cohesion by around 6pm, to gain a headstart on any English pursuit. During this stage, the Earl of Marlborough and the [[Charles Weston, 3rd Earl of Portland|Earl of Portland]] were killed and the ships of Lawson's division of the Red Squadron and Teddiman's division of the Blue Squadron joined the main battle forcing more Dutch ships to retreat.<ref name=\"Fox 97\u201398, 100\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.97\u201398, 100</ref>         \n\nBetween 6pm and 9pm, the larger English ships concentrated, on forcing first Evertsen and then Tromp into retreat and mopping-up Dutch ships too damaged to escape, capturing three.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.98, 100</ref> Tromp later claimed that his rearguard action prevented greater losses, as many of the fleeing Dutch ships' crews were demoralised and would not fight any English pursuers.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.318</ref> As Sandwich had broken through the Dutch fleet, it disintegrated in its flight into a number of separate bodies, escaping to different ports. Tromp led one group to [[Texel]], followed by Rupert, Johan Evertsen retreated with another contingent to the [[Maas (river)|Maas]] pursued by the rest of the English fleet, and other ships headed for the [[Scheldt]].<ref name=\"Fox 97\u201398, 100\"/> However, the English commanders did not order a general chase by releasing their faster ships to overtake the slower of the Dutch fugitives, but remained in squadron. At around 9pm, Sandwich even ordered his squadron to shorten sail so that the White Squadron could catch up and the Duke of York assume command.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.98-9</ref>\n\nMuch more damaging, however, was the decision taken for the ''Royal Charles'' to reduce sail during the night. Significant controversy surrounds this incident, and several explanations have been proposed to explain it. An account which relies on the reported testimonies of Penn and Harman suggests that [[Henry Brouncker, 3rd Viscount Brouncker|Lord Henry Brouncker]], James' master of the bedchamber, either from fear or because he had promised the Duchess of York to keep the Duke from danger, first approached William Penn, the [[Captain of the Fleet]] asking him to slacken sail, reminding him that the Duke was [[heir presumptive]] and that his death would be a disaster. Penn refused, stating that only James could order this, but he then went below. Brouncker next approached the captain of the ''Royal Charles'' [[John Harman (Admiral)|John Harman]], this time pretending that the order to take in sail did come from James. When ''Royal Charles'' reduced sail in the course of the night, the rest of the English fleet followed suit.<ref name=\"Fox 99\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.99</ref> According to another account, Penn was said to have remarked that James, having narrowly escaped death in the battle, had lost his nerve completely.<ref> David Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' (1936) p. 288.</ref> Brouncker later fled for his life rather than face a Parliamentary enquiry after the war, which could have condemned him.<ref name=\"Fox 99\"/>\n\nWhen, on the morning of 14 June, the fastest English frigates were sent ahead of the main fleet, they captured six Dutch ships, some of which defended themselves honourably, but others offered little resistance: these were in addition to three captures on the previous evening. The results of what had been a notable victory were less than might have been expected, firstly through the rearguard actions of Tromp and Johan Evertsen which allowed many Dutch ships to disengage from the battle and secondly the failure to release the faster frigates from the main fleet in pursuit of the fleeing Dutch, which could have been ordered as early as 6pm.<ref name=\"Warnsinck 305\"/> These small but fast ships had taken little part in the main action, but their activities on the morning of 14 June showed what could have been achieved. The controversial slowing-down of the whole fleet at night simply exacerbated this earlier failure.<ref name=\"Fox 99\u2013100\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.99-100</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe English lost only one ship, the captured ''Great Charity'' mentioned above. Eight Dutch ships were sunk by the English; six of these were burnt in two separate incidents when they got entangled while fleeing, and each group was set ablaze by a [[fire ship]]: this happened to the ''Tergoes'' entangling with the company ship the ''Maarseveen'' and the merchantman the ''Swanenburg''; and also to the ''Koevorden'', the ''Stad Utrecht'' and the ''Prinse Maurits''. The earlier mentioned company ship the ''Oranje'' was set on fire after being reduced to a wreck when fighting off several English ships. The first to attack was one of the Duke of York's squadron, the ''Mary'' under captain [[Jeremiah Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Jeremiah Smith]], which lost 99 men of its crew in this action, followed later by the {{HMS|Royal Oak|1674|2}}, the {{HMS|Essex|1653|2}} and the {{HMS|Royal Katherine|1664|2}}. According to some accounts, the ''Oranje'' lost half of its crew of 400 before succumbing, a severely wounded Senten (rumoured to be an expatriate Scotsman) was picked up by an English vessel and shortly after he also died.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.97-8</ref> During the Dutch flight, the English captured nine more ships: ''Hilversum'', ''Delft'', ''Zeelandia'', ''Wapen van Edam'' and ''Jonge Prins''; the VOC-ship ''Nagelboom'' and the merchants ''Carolus Quintus'', ''Mars'' and ''Geldersche Ruyter''. ''Tromp'' was captured but escaped.<ref name=\"Fox 99\u2013100\"/> Eight older ships had to be written off later, as the costs of repairing them would have exceeded their value.\n\nThe English had lost one flag officer, Rear-Admiral [[Robert Samsun]] during the battle, while Vice-Admiral [[John Lawson (naval officer)|Lawson]] was mortally wounded and died three weeks after the battle. Notable English admirals and captains present at the battle included [[William Penn (Royal Navy officer)|William Penn]] in the {{HMS|Royal Charles|1655|2}}, [[Christopher Myngs]] and [[George Ayscue]].<ref name=\"Fox 100\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.100</ref>\n\nThe escape of most of the Dutch fleet was more significant than its losses, as only its destruction as a fighting force would have given England the early victory it needed.<ref name=\"Fox 100\"/> That possibility became more remote as senior Dutch sea officers and politicians began to consider the reasons for the disaster at Lowestoft, and identified three principal causes. The first was the lack of discipline that was dealt with by severely punishing the worst offenders while rewarding success.<ref name=\"Fox 126\u2013127\">Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.126\u2013127</ref> The second was tactical, as the favoured Dutch tactic of the undisciplined m\u00eal\u00e9e, with individual ships boarding and capturing their opponent and, in many cases, leaving the battle with their prize, was ineffective against English gunnery on ships fighting in line. Although de Ruyter did partially revert to m\u00eal\u00e9e tactics in the last day of the [[Four Days Battle]].<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.262</ref>, fighting in line became the standard tactic in new Fighting Instructions approved by the States General in August 1665.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.127-8</ref> The final cause was the inferiority of Dutch ships which, though well-constructed, were generally smaller and more lightly armed than those of other maritime nations. Although there had been a significant building programme after the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], only ''Eendracht'' and ''Groot Hollandia'', built as fleet flagship, were comparable to English ships of the [[third-rate]]. Although from 1660 the Dutch embarked on an expansion programme, many where smaller ships and only one exceeded the size of the ''Eendracht'', equaling an English [[second-rate]]. This building programme was greatly expanded after the outbreak of the war, but none of its ships had been completed by the time of Lowestoft.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', pp.130-2</ref>\n\nCompared with the Dutch fleet at the [[Four Days' Battle]] in June 1666, Obdam had a fleet comprising many older and smaller vessels and fewer modern ones. It relied strongly on the East Indies Company's ships and other merchantmen, although these did not have the resilience of true warships. There were no East Indies Company ships in the battles of 1666, and the few merchant ships present were not in the line of battle but acted as auxiliaries.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.132</ref>\n\nAlthough Tromp and Evertsen were ordered by the commissioners from the States General to return to sea with as many ships as possible,<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.322</ref>  in the recriminations that followed the battle, Tromp refused, denouncing a number of captains for disobedience or cowardice, and the States General formed a commission to inspect the ships and question the captains of those that seemed to have suffered little damage. Although about two dozen ships showed were found to have suffered little damage, only ten captains were charged with cowardice<ref name=\"Fox 126\u2013127\"/><ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.324</ref> Nine captains were brought to trial: three were shot before the fleet, three exiled and three dismissed from their commands.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', p.325</ref> A tenth captain, Laurens Heemskerck, who had fled from the Netherlands in 1665, fearing he would be tried for cowardice in the battle, was afterwards condemned ''[[in absentia]]'' to perpetual banishment from the Netherlands. Heemskerck assisted England in planning the [[Holmes's Bonfire|attack on the Vlie]] and later, in 1672, fought on the French side against his countrymen at the [[Battle of Solebay]].<ref> A. J. Van der Aa, (1867). ''Biographische Woordenboek der Nederlandenen''. p.349</ref> Although there was considerable dissatisfaction with the conduct of a number of ships' crews, the States General did mot investigate these, considering that the fault lay with their captains. There were also disputes about who should be promoted to fill the places of the two deceased admirals.<ref>Fox, ''The Four Days Battle of 1666'', p.101</ref>\n\nThe Dutch attempted to learn lessons from their defeat. The [[Admiralty of Zeeland]] instructed its flag officers and captains to avoid lengthy and disadvantageous gun battles and to practice drills aimed at boarding and capturing enemy ships, and in August 1665 the deputies of the States General in discussion with Tromp and other admirals issued revised combat instruction that became the basis of Dutch naval tactics for the rest of the Second Anglo-Dutch War and also for the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The main points of these instruction were the division of the fleet into three distinct squadrons, each with a clear chain of command, improved signaling and the application of the principle of the concentration of superior force against part of the enemy fleet. These instructions implicitly criticised the division of the fleet at Lowestoft into seven squadrons with unclear chains of command but also Obdam's cautious tactics.<ref>Warnsinck, ''Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen'', pp.325-6</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Flagmen of Lowestoft]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Bruijn, Jaap R.

Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include [[deliberation]], [[cognition]], [[idea]]tion, [[discourse]] and [[imagination]].\n\nThinking is sometimes described as a \"higher\" [[cognitive]] function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of [[cognitive psychology]]. It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use [[tools]]; to understand [[causality|cause and effect]]; to recognize patterns of significance; to comprehend and [[world disclosure|disclose]] unique contexts of experience or activity; and to respond to the world in a meaningful way.\n\n[[Memory]] is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in [[philosophy]], the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of [[cognitive psychology]]. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called [[cognitive neuroscience]], a marriage between [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].\n\n[[Imagination]] is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, [[image]]s, ideas or other [[qualia]] in the mind. It is a characteristically [[Subjectivity|subjective]] ''activity'', rather than a direct or passive experience. The term is technically used in [[psychology]] for the process of reviving in the mind [[perception|percepts]] of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as \"[[wikt:Imaging|imaging]]\" or \"[[wikt:Imagery|imagery]]\" or to speak of it as \"reproductive\" as opposed to \"productive\" or \"constructive\" imagination. Things imagined are said to be seen in the \"[[mind's eye]]\". Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures (or histories), to \"see\" things from another's perspective, and to change the way something is perceived, including to make decisions to respond to, or enact, what is imagined.\n\n[[Consciousness]] in [[Mammal|mammals]] (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide [[consciousness]] into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.<ref name=\"Bl\">Ned Block: \"On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness\" in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.\n\n==Mental content==\nMental contents are those items that are thought of as being \"in\" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include [[thought]]s, [[concept]]s, [[memories]], [[emotion]]s, [[percept]]s and [[intention]]s. Philosophical theories of mental content include [[internalism]], [[externalism]], [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] and [[intentionality]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/ | title=Narrow Mental Content | encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Memetics===\n[[Memetics]] is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]], which was originated by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in the 1980s. It is an [[evolutionary model]] of cultural [[information transfer]]. A [[meme]], analogous to a [[gene]], is an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour (etc.) \"hosted\" in one or more individual minds, and can reproduce itself from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief, is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself.\n\n==Relation to the brain==\n{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience}}\n\nIn animals, the [[brain]], or ''encephalon'' ([[Greek (language)|Greek]] for \"in the head\"), is the control center of the [[central nervous system]], responsible for [[thought]]. In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the [[skull]] and close to the primary sensory apparatus of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[equilibrioception]], [[taste]] and [[olfaction]]. While all [[vertebrate]]s have a brain, most [[invertebrate]]s have either a centralized brain or collections of individual [[ganglion|ganglia]]. Primitive animals such as [[sponge]]s do not have a brain at all. Brains can be extremely complex. For example, the [[human brain]] contains around 86 billion [[neuron]]s, each linked to as many as 10,000 others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whishaw|first=Bryan Kolb, Ian Q.|title=An Introduction to Brain and Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-7691-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIBEEP2b1MIC|edition=3rd |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=72}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Sherwood|first=Lauralee|title=Fundamentals of Human Physiology|year=2011|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-8400-6225-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jl4rLDuewo4C|edition=4th |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=91}}</ref>\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between the brain and the mind&nbsp;\u2013 [[mind\u2013body problem]] is one of the central issues in the history of [[philosophy]]&nbsp;\u2013 is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically.<ref>Patricia Smith Churchland, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hAeFMFW3rDUC ''Neurophilosophy: toward a unified science of the mind-brain''], MIT Press, 1989</ref> There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the answer: dualism, materialism, and idealism.

For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.\n\nThe most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].<ref name=\"Kim\">Kim, J., \"Mind-Body Problem\", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''.

At the systems level, neuroscientists investigate how [[biological neural networks]] form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as [[reflex]]es, [[multisensory integration]], [[motor coordination]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[emotion|emotional responses]], [[learning]], and [[memory]].  The underlying physical basis of [[learning]] and [[memory]] is likely dynamic changes in [[gene expression]] that occur in [[brain]] [[neurons]].  Such expression changes are introduced by [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] mechanisms.  Epigenetic regulation of gene expression ordinarily involves chemical modification of [[DNA]] or DNA-associated [[histone]] proteins.  Such chemical modifications can cause long-lasting changes in gene expression.  Epigenetic mechanisms employed in learning and memory include the [[DNA methylation|methylation]] and [[DNA demethylation|demethylation]] of [[neuron]]al DNA as well as [[histone methylation|methylation]], [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|acetylation and deacetylation]] of neuronal histone proteins. \n\nAt a larger scale, efforts in [[computational neuroscience]] have developed large-scale models that simulate simple, functioning brains.<ref name=\"Spaun\"/> As of 2012, such models include the [[thalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[prefrontal cortex]], [[motor cortex]], and [[occipital cortex]], and consequentially simulated brains can learn, respond to visual stimuli, coordinate motor responses, form short-term memories, and learn to respond to patterns.

Historically, psychology differed from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain. Modern psychological science incorporates [[Psychophysiology|physiological]] and [[neuropsychology|neurological]] processes into its conceptions of [[perception]], [[cognition]], behaviour, and [[mental disorders]].\n\n==Mental health==\n{{Main|Mental health}}\n\nBy analogy with the health of the body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or [[mental health]]. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines mental health as \"A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life.\" According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), there is no one \"official\" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how \"mental health\" is defined. In general, most experts agree that \"mental health\" and \"[[mental disorder]]\" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.\n\nOne way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to \"bounce back,\" or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.\n\n[[Psychotherapy]] is an [[interpersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid [[wikt:Client|clients]] in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of [[well-being]] and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, [[dialogue]], [[communication]] and [[behavior]] change and that are designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a [[family]]). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken [[conversation]], though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[art]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained [[therapist]] and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with [[psychoanalysis]]; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.\n\n==Non-human minds==\n\n===Animal intelligence===\n[[Animal cognition]], or cognitive ethology, is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of [[comparative psychology]], but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Much of what used to be considered under the title of \"animal intelligence\" is now thought of under this heading. [[Animal language acquisition]], attempting to discern or understand the degree to which animal cognition can be revealed by [[linguistics]]-related study, has been controversial among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]].\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2007}}\n{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}\n\n[[File:Forest of synthetic pyramidal dendrites grown using Cajal's laws of neuronal branching.png|thumb|[[Computer simulation]] of the branching architecture of the [[dendrite]]s of [[pyramidal neuron]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/image.pcbi.v06.i08 | title = PLoS Computational Biology Issue Image &#124; Vol. 6(8) August 2010 | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = ev06.ei08 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>]] In 1950 [[Alan M. Turing]] published \"Computing machinery and intelligence\" in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', in which he proposed that machines could be tested for intelligence using questions and answers. This process is now named the [[Turing Test]]. The term [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) was first used by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] who considered it to mean \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines\".<ref>What is Artificial Intelligence? by John McCarthy [http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html Stanford University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118212402/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html |date=2015-11-18 }}</ref> It can also refer to [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] as exhibited by an artificial (''man-made'', ''non-natural'', ''manufactured'') entity. AI is studied in overlapping fields of [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[engineering]], dealing with intelligent [[behavior]], [[learn]]ing and [[adaptation]] and usually developed using customized [[machine]]s or [[computer]]s.\n\nResearch in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include [[control system|control]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning and scheduling]], the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]], [[natural language]], [[speech recognition|speech]] and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, [[knowledge mining]], [[software]] applications, [[strategy games]] like [[computer chess]] and other [[video game]]s. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially [[natural language understanding]] and [[connectionism]] (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.\n\nThe debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of [[artificial intelligence]]. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.\n\n==In religion==\nMany religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind. These are often tightly connected to their [[mythology]] and ideas of [[afterlife]].\n\nThe [[India]]n [[philosopher]]-sage [[Sri Aurobindo]] attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his [[integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|integral psychology]], as have many philosophers and [[New religious movement]]s. [[Judaism]] teaches that \"moach shalit al halev\", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. [[Christianity]] has tended to see the mind as distinct from the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''[[nous]]'') and sometimes further distinguished from the [[spirit]]. [[Esotericism|Western esoteric traditions]] sometimes refer to a [[mental body]] that exists on a plane other than the physical. [[Hinduism]]'s various philosophical schools have debated whether the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Sanskrit ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') is distinct from, or identical to, ''[[Brahman]]'', the [[divinity|divine]] [[reality]]. [[Taoism]] sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the [[Human body|body]]. [[Confucianism]] sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{See also|Buddhism and psychology|Vij\u00f1\u0101na|\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101|Shentong|Rangtong|Yogacara}}\n\nBuddhist teachings explain the moment-to-moment manifestation of the mind-stream.<ref name=\"Karunamuni2017\"/><ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/><ref name=\"Karunamuni2017\"/> The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.\n\nAccording to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher [[Dharmakirti]], the mind has two fundamental qualities: \"clarity and cognizes\". If something is not those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. \"Clarity\" refers to the fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and \"cognizes\" that it functions to know or perceive objects.<ref>Gyatso, [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]], ''Understanding the Mind'': The Nature and Power of the Mind, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-78-4}}</ref> \"Knowing\" refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind \u2013 whose function is to cognize an object \u2013 existing without cognizing an object.\n\nMind, in Buddhism, is also described as being \"space-like\" and \"illusion-like\". Mind is space-like in the sense that it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, mind is illusion-like in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being \"space and illusion\" and being \"space-like\" and \"illusion-like\". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.\n\nBuddhism posits that there is no inherent, unchanging identity (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is \u2013 by itself or themselves \u2013 the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves \"the person\". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or ''[[skandha]]s'' and nothing else.\n\nIn the same way, \"mind\" is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is \"Awareness\", in Buddhism. \"Mind\" is that part of experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term \"mind\". There is also not \"objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between\". There is a third thing called \"awareness\" which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called \"awareness\" and a third thing called \"experiencer who is aware of the experience\". This awareness is deeply related to \"no-self\" because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.\n\nClearly, the experience arises and is known by mind, but there is a third thing calls [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] what is the \"real experiencer of the experience\" that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels. (Maha Sathipatthana Sutta.)\n# Body\n# Sensations (Changes of the body mind.)\n# Mind,\n# Contents of the mind. (Changes of the body mind.)\n\nTo be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion. This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with  Craving and Aversion. This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now. This is the way of Buddhism, with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds (and persons).\n\n===Mortality of the mind===\n{{Main|Consciousness after death}}\nDue to the [[mind\u2013body problem]], a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to one's conscious mind as one's body dies. During [[brain death]] all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases. According to some neuroscientific views which see these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is sometimes called \"[[eternal oblivion]]\".

Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include [[deliberation]], [[cognition]], [[idea]]tion, [[discourse]] and [[imagination]].\n\nThinking is sometimes described as a \"higher\" [[cognitive]] function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of [[cognitive psychology]]. It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use [[tools]]; to understand [[causality|cause and effect]]; to recognize patterns of significance; to comprehend and [[world disclosure|disclose]] unique contexts of experience or activity; and to respond to the world in a meaningful way.\n\n[[Memory]] is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in [[philosophy]], the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of [[cognitive psychology]]. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called [[cognitive neuroscience]], a marriage between [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].\n\n[[Imagination]] is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, [[image]]s, ideas or other [[qualia]] in the mind. It is a characteristically [[Subjectivity|subjective]] ''activity'', rather than a direct or passive experience. The term is technically used in [[psychology]] for the process of reviving in the mind [[perception|percepts]] of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as \"[[wikt:Imaging|imaging]]\" or \"[[wikt:Imagery|imagery]]\" or to speak of it as \"reproductive\" as opposed to \"productive\" or \"constructive\" imagination. Things imagined are said to be seen in the \"[[mind's eye]]\". Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures (or histories), to \"see\" things from another's perspective, and to change the way something is perceived, including to make decisions to respond to, or enact, what is imagined.\n\n[[Consciousness]] in [[Mammal|mammals]] (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide [[consciousness]] into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.<ref name=\"Bl\">Ned Block: \"On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness\" in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.\n\n==Mental content==\nMental contents are those items that are thought of as being \"in\" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include [[thought]]s, [[concept]]s, [[memories]], [[emotion]]s, [[percept]]s and [[intention]]s. Philosophical theories of mental content include [[internalism]], [[externalism]], [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] and [[intentionality]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/ | title=Narrow Mental Content | encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Memetics===\n[[Memetics]] is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]], which was originated by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in the 1980s. It is an [[evolutionary model]] of cultural [[information transfer]]. A [[meme]], analogous to a [[gene]], is an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour (etc.) \"hosted\" in one or more individual minds, and can reproduce itself from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief, is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself.\n\n==Relation to the brain==\n{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience}}\n\nIn animals, the [[brain]], or ''encephalon'' ([[Greek (language)|Greek]] for \"in the head\"), is the control center of the [[central nervous system]], responsible for [[thought]]. In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the [[skull]] and close to the primary sensory apparatus of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[equilibrioception]], [[taste]] and [[olfaction]]. While all [[vertebrate]]s have a brain, most [[invertebrate]]s have either a centralized brain or collections of individual [[ganglion|ganglia]]. Primitive animals such as [[sponge]]s do not have a brain at all. Brains can be extremely complex.

For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.\n\nThe most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].<ref name=\"Kim\">Kim, J., \"Mind-Body Problem\", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''.

The underlying physical basis of [[learning]] and [[memory]] is likely dynamic changes in [[gene expression]] that occur in [[brain]] [[neurons]].

Epigenetic regulation of gene expression ordinarily involves chemical modification of [[DNA]] or DNA-associated [[histone]] proteins.

Historically, psychology differed from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain. Modern psychological science incorporates [[Psychophysiology|physiological]] and [[neuropsychology|neurological]] processes into its conceptions of [[perception]], [[cognition]], behaviour, and [[mental disorders]].\n\n==Mental health==\n{{Main|Mental health}}\n\nBy analogy with the health of the body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or [[mental health]]. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines mental health as \"A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life.\" According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), there is no one \"official\" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how \"mental health\" is defined. In general, most experts agree that \"mental health\" and \"[[mental disorder]]\" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.\n\nOne way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to \"bounce back,\" or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.\n\n[[Psychotherapy]] is an [[interpersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid [[wikt:Client|clients]] in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of [[well-being]] and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, [[dialogue]], [[communication]] and [[behavior]] change and that are designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a [[family]]). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken [[conversation]], though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[art]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained [[therapist]] and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with [[psychoanalysis]]; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.\n\n==Non-human minds==\n\n===Animal intelligence===\n[[Animal cognition]], or cognitive ethology, is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of [[comparative psychology]], but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Much of what used to be considered under the title of \"animal intelligence\" is now thought of under this heading.

Examples include [[control system|control]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning and scheduling]], the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]], [[natural language]], [[speech recognition|speech]] and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, [[knowledge mining]], [[software]] applications, [[strategy games]] like [[computer chess]] and other [[video game]]s. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially [[natural language understanding]] and [[connectionism]] (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.\n\nThe debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of [[artificial intelligence]]. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.\n\n==In religion==\nMany religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind. These are often tightly connected to their [[mythology]] and ideas of [[afterlife]].\n\nThe [[India]]n [[philosopher]]-sage [[Sri Aurobindo]] attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his [[integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|integral psychology]], as have many philosophers and [[New religious movement]]s. [[Judaism]] teaches that \"moach shalit al halev\", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. [[Christianity]] has tended to see the mind as distinct from the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''[[nous]]'') and sometimes further distinguished from the [[spirit]]. [[Esotericism|Western esoteric traditions]] sometimes refer to a [[mental body]] that exists on a plane other than the physical. [[Hinduism]]'s various philosophical schools have debated whether the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Sanskrit ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') is distinct from, or identical to, ''[[Brahman]]'', the [[divinity|divine]] [[reality]]. [[Taoism]] sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the [[Human body|body]]. [[Confucianism]] sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{See also|Buddhism and psychology|Vij\u00f1\u0101na|\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101|Shentong|Rangtong|Yogacara}}\n\nBuddhist teachings explain the moment-to-moment manifestation of the mind-stream.<ref name=\"Karunamuni2017\"/><ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/><ref name=\"Karunamuni2017\"/> The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.\n\nAccording to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher [[Dharmakirti]], the mind has two fundamental qualities: \"clarity and cognizes\". If something is not those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. \"Clarity\" refers to the fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and \"cognizes\" that it functions to know or perceive objects.<ref>Gyatso, [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]], ''Understanding the Mind'': The Nature and Power of the Mind, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-78-4}}</ref> \"Knowing\" refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind \u2013 whose function is to cognize an object \u2013 existing without cognizing an object.\n\nMind, in Buddhism, is also described as being \"space-like\" and \"illusion-like\". Mind is space-like in the sense that it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, mind is illusion-like in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being \"space and illusion\" and being \"space-like\" and \"illusion-like\". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.\n\nBuddhism posits that there is no inherent, unchanging identity (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is \u2013 by itself or themselves \u2013 the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves \"the person\". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or ''[[skandha]]s'' and nothing else.\n\nIn the same way, \"mind\" is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is \"Awareness\", in Buddhism. \"Mind\" is that part of experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term \"mind\". There is also not \"objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between\". There is a third thing called \"awareness\" which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called \"awareness\" and a third thing called \"experiencer who is aware of the experience\". This awareness is deeply related to \"no-self\" because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.\n\nClearly, the experience arises and is known by mind, but there is a third thing calls [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] what is the \"real experiencer of the experience\" that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels. (Maha Sathipatthana Sutta.)\n# Body\n# Sensations (Changes of the body mind.)\n# Mind,\n# Contents of the mind. (Changes of the body mind.)\n\nTo be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion. This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with  Craving and Aversion. This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now. This is the way of Buddhism, with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds (and persons).\n\n===Mortality of the mind===\n{{Main|Consciousness after death}}\nDue to the [[mind\u2013body problem]], a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to one's conscious mind as one's body dies. During [[brain death]] all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases. According to some neuroscientific views which see these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is sometimes called \"[[eternal oblivion]]\". The belief that some [[spirit]]ual or [[incorporeal]] component ([[soul]]) exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term \"[[afterlife]]\".\n\n==In pseudoscience==\n===Parapsychology===\n[[Parapsychology]] is a study of certain types of [[paranormal phenomena]], or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal or not have any scientific basis <ref>[http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }}, Retrieved February 10, 2007</ref>, for instance, [[precognition]], [[telekinesis]] and [[telepathy]].\n\nThe term is based on the Greek [[:wikt:para-|para]] (beside/beyond), [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] (soul/mind), and [[logos]] (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in or before 1889.<ref name = \"EncyOccult\"/> [[J.B.
