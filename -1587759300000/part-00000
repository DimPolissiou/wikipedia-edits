General Electric improved the fan module and the high-pressure compressor stage-1 [[blisk]] in the GE-90-115 turbofan, as well as reduced clearances between the tips of the turbine blades and the shroud during cruise. These improvements, of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the 787, were stated by GE to lower fuel burn by 0.5%. Boeing's wing modifications were intended to deliver the remainder. Boeing stated that every 1% improvement in the 777-300ER's fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another {{cvt|75|nmi}} on the same load of fuel, or add ten passengers or {{cvt|2400|lb}} of cargo to a \"load limited\" flight.<ref>Norris, Guy. \"Mind the gap\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, February 16 \u2013 March 1, 2015, pp. 42-3.</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, additional details of the improvement package were unveiled.  The 777-300ER was to shed {{cvt|1800|lb}} by replacing the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, similar to those used on the 787. The new flight control software was to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless of the extent to which pilots command the elevators. Boeing was also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip was to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a \"poor man's airfoil\" by Boeing; this was originally developed for the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-12]] project. Another change involved elevator trim bias. These changes were to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.<ref>Norris, Guy. \"Sharpened edge\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, March 16\u201329, 2015, pp. 26-8.</ref>\n\nMindful of the long time required to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower prices for the existing product. In January 2015, United Airlines ordered ten 777-300ERs, normally costing around US$150 million each but paid around US$130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://leehamnews.com/2015/01/20/odds-and-ends-bbds-sheridan-to-nordic-united-and-777s/ |title= United and 777-300ERs |date= January 20, 2015 |publisher= Leeham News |accessdate= January 21, 2015}}</ref>  The roll-out of the prototype 777X, a 777-9 model, occurred on March 13, 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Norris |first1=Guy |title=Boeing Unveils 777-9 In Low-Key Event |url=https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/boeing-unveils-777-9-low-key-event |work=aviationweek.com |date=March 14, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2019}}, Boeing lists prices for the 777-200ER, -200LR, 777F, -300ER, 777-8, and 777-9 variants.

The prototype was rolled out on April 9, 1994, and first flew on June 12, 1994. The 777 first entered commercial service with United Airlines on June 7, 1995. Longer range variants were launched on February 29, 2000 and were first delivered on April 29, 2004.\n\n<!--design-->\nIt is the largest [[twinjet]] and has a typical 3-class capacity of 301 to 368 passengers, with a [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of {{convert|5240|to|8555|nmi|km|lk=in}}.\nIt is recognizable for its large-diameter [[turbofan]] engines, six wheels on each main [[landing gear]], fully circular fuselage cross-section,<ref>{{Harvnb|Birtles|1998|pp=52}}</ref> and a blade-shaped tail cone.<ref name=boeingjets/> It has [[fly-by-wire]] controls, a first for Boeing. \nIt initially competed with the out-of-production [[Airbus A340]] and [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]], and currently competes with the [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]] and the newer [[Airbus A350 XWB]]. \n\n<!--variants-->\nThe original 777 with a [[maximum takeoff weight]] (MTOW) of {{cvt|545,000-660,000|lb|t}} was produced in two fuselage lengths: the initial -200 was followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997; and the {{cvt|33.25|ft|adj=on}} longer 777-300 in 1998. Those 777 Classics were powered with {{cvt|77,200-98000|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric GE90]], [[Pratt & Whitney PW4000]], or [[Rolls-Royce Trent 800]] engines.<ref name=Flight1sep2017/> The longer range 777-300ER with a MTOW of {{cvt|766,000-775,000|lb|t}} entered service in 2004, the ultra long-range 777-200LR in 2006, and the 777F [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]] in 2009. These [[long haul]] variants feature {{cvt|110,000\u2013115,300|lbf|kN}} GE90 engines and extended [[Wingtip device#Raked wingtip|raked wingtips]].

General Electric improved the fan module and the high-pressure compressor stage-1 [[blisk]] in the GE-90-115 turbofan, as well as reduced clearances between the tips of the turbine blades and the shroud during cruise. These improvements, of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the 787, were stated by GE to lower fuel burn by 0.5%. Boeing's wing modifications were intended to deliver the remainder. Boeing stated that every 1% improvement in the 777-300ER's fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another {{cvt|75|nmi}} on the same load of fuel, or add ten passengers or {{cvt|2400|lb}} of cargo to a \"load limited\" flight.<ref>Norris, Guy. \"Mind the gap\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, February 16 \u2013 March 1, 2015, pp. 42-3.</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, additional details of the improvement package were unveiled.  The 777-300ER was to shed {{cvt|1800|lb}} by replacing the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, similar to those used on the 787. The new flight control software was to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless of the extent to which pilots command the elevators. Boeing was also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip was to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a \"poor man's airfoil\" by Boeing; this was originally developed for the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-12]] project. Another change involved elevator trim bias. These changes were to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.<ref>Norris, Guy. \"Sharpened edge\". Aviation Week & Space Technology, March 16\u201329, 2015, pp. 26-8.</ref>\n\nMindful of the long time required to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower prices for the existing product. In January 2015, United Airlines ordered ten 777-300ERs, normally costing around US$150 million each but paid around US$130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://leehamnews.com/2015/01/20/odds-and-ends-bbds-sheridan-to-nordic-united-and-777s/ |title= United and 777-300ERs |date= January 20, 2015 |publisher= Leeham News |accessdate= January 21, 2015}}</ref>  The roll-out of the prototype 777X, a 777-9 model, occurred on March 13, 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Norris |first1=Guy |title=Boeing Unveils 777-9 In Low-Key Event |url=https://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/boeing-unveils-777-9-low-key-event |work=aviationweek.com |date=March 14, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2019}}, Boeing lists prices for the 777-200ER, -200LR, 777F, -300ER, 777-8, and 777-9 variants.
