It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to August 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], the last other major candidate in the Democratic primary, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden and Trump are respectively the oldest and second-oldest major party presumptive nominees in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if he is elected and inaugurated, Biden will also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

Here are the odds.|last=Chamings|first=Andrew|date=April 8, 2020|website=[[SFGate]]|language=en|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>--> Biden is the first former vice president to become the presumptive nominee of any major political parties in the United States since [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] in which the Democratic Party nominated former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] ([[George H. W. Bush]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[Al Gore]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic spread in the United States, and the subsequent effects like the stay-at-home order and social distancing guidelines by local governments, all presidential candidates are unable to hold campaign rallies and public gathering. As a result, in April, at the daily White House coronavirus briefing, Trump played a campaign-style propaganda praising him of his early response to the pandemic while lambasting his opponent and the press as \"fake news media\" in the process.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Breuninger |first1=Kevin |last2=Pramuk |first2=Jacob |title=Trump plays campaign-style video in White House coronavirus briefing touting his 'decisive action' |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/coronavirus-trump-plays-campaign-style-video-in-white-house-briefing.html |website=CNBC |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=April 21, 2020 |language=en |date=14 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Trump plays campaign-style video attacking press at White House briefing \u2013 video |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/14/trump-plays-campaign-style-video-attacking-press-at-white-house-briefing-video |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=14 April 2020}}</ref> According to Trump, it was the media who initially 'downplaying the effects of the virus.'<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=David |title=Wounded by media scrutiny, Trump turned a briefing into a presidential tantrum |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/trump-coronavirus-meltdown-media-authority |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=14 April 2020}}</ref> This behavior led to allegations by pundits and the press, that Trump is using the daily White House coronavirus briefings to replace his campaign rallies and benefit him politically.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dale |first1=Daniel |title=Trump uses daily coronavirus briefings to replace campaign rallies |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/politics/trump-coronavirus-briefings-rallies/index.html |website=CNN |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref> \n\nIn early April, Trump and Biden held a \"cordial\" phone call to discuss the effects of the coronavirus, where Biden provided advice for the president in resolving the pandemic.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Saenz |first1=Arlette |title=Biden campaign launches counterattack on Trump over coronavirus and China |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/17/politics/biden-campaign-trump-coronavirus-china/index.html |website=CNN |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn April 6, the Supreme Court and Republicans in the State Legislature of Wisconsin rebuffed Wisconsin Governor [[Tony Evers]]'s request to move the election in Wisconsin to June.

W. Bush]] and [[George W.

This would require a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination. The last time this did not occur was the nomination of [[Adlai Stevenson II]] at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"ssKcA\" /> Meanwhile, six states will use [[Ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] in the primaries: Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming for all voters; and Iowa and Nevada for absentee voters.<ref name=\"7VCs8\" />\n\nAfter [[Hillary Clinton]]'s loss in the [[2016 United States presidential election|previous]] election, the Democratic Party was seen largely as leaderless<ref name=\"BGA13\" /> and fractured between the [[centrist]] Clinton wing and the more [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]] wing of the party, echoing the rift brought up in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 primary]] election.<ref name=\"YGlMQ\" /><ref name=\"le0En\" />\n\nThis divide between the establishment and progressive wings of the party has been reflected in several elections leading up to the 2020 primaries, most notably in 2017 with the election for [[Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, 2017|DNC chair]] between moderate-backed [[Tom Perez]] and progressive-backed [[Keith Ellison]]:<ref name=\"rrgRf\" /> Perez was elected chairman, and Ellison was appointed the [[Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee|deputy chair]], a largely ceremonial role. In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged Buttigieg in the February 11 [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22. [[Joe Biden]] then won the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina primary]], causing Buttigieg, [[Amy Klobuchar]], and [[Tom Steyer]] to abandon their campaigns (Buttigieg and Klobuchar then immediately endorsed Biden).

The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to August 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], the last other major candidate in the Democratic primary, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden and Trump are respectively the oldest and second-oldest major party presumptive nominees in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if he is elected and inaugurated, Biden will also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

W. Bush]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[Al Gore]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts.

Located at the head of [[Tokyo Bay]], the prefecture forms part of the [[Kant\u014d region]] on the [[Pacific]] coast of the main island of [[Honshu]]. Tokyo is the political, economic, and cultural center of Japan, as well as the seat of the [[Emperor of Japan]] and the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]]. The [[Greater Tokyo Area]], which includes several neighboring prefectures, is the [[List of cities by GDP|largest urban economy]] and the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous metropolitan area]] in the world, with more than 38.1 million residents {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}.\n\nOriginally a small fishing village named [[Edo]], the city became a prominent political center under ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], who made the city his headquarters in 1603. By the end of the 18th century, Edo had become one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding one million. In 1868, the imperial capital in [[Kyoto]] mas moved to the city following the [[Meiji Restoration|end of the shogunate]], and it was renamed Tokyo (literally \"eastern capital\").

Edo was first fortified by the [[Edo clan]], in the late twelfth century. In 1457, [[\u014cta D\u014dkan]] built [[Edo Castle]]. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was transferred from [[Mikawa Province]] (his lifelong base) to [[Kant\u014d region]]. When he became ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent [[Edo period]], Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo and Paris: Urban Life and the State in the Early Modern Era |last=McClain, James|first=James |year=1994 |page=13 |isbn=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> But Edo was Tokugawa's home and was not [[capital of Japan]].

On July 1, 1943, Tokyo City was merged with {{Nihongo|Tokyo Prefecture|\u6771\u4eac\u5e9c|T\u014dky\u014d-fu}} forming the current \"metropolitan prefecture\". As a result, unlike other [[Wards of Japan|city wards]] in Japan, these wards are not conterminous with a larger incorporated city.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWhile falling under the jurisdiction of Tokyo Metropolitan Government, each ward is also a [[borough]] with its own elected leader and council, like other cities of Japan. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City).\n\nThe wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.<ref>\n[http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview06.htm The Structure of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208194646/http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview06.htm |date=December 8, 2014 }}  (Tokyo government webpage)\n</ref>\n\nThe special wards of Tokyo are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"810px\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | Special Wards of Tokyo\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | Place Name\n!\n!Map of the Special Wards\n|-\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Romanization of Japanese|R\u014dmaji]]\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Kanji]]\n!Color\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" \"width: 20px;\" | 1\n|[[Adachi, Tokyo|Adachi]]\n|\u8db3\u7acb\u533a\n|Red\n| rowspan=\"23\" |[[File:Tokyo special wards map.svg|alt=|border|center|399x399px|A map of Tokyo's Special Wards]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2\n|[[Arakawa, Tokyo|Arakawa]]\n| \u8352\u5ddd\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3\n|[[Bunky\u014d|Bunkyo]]\n| \u6587\u4eac\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 4\n|[[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]]\n| \u5343\u4ee3\u7530\u533a\n|Orange\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 5\n|[[Ch\u016b\u014d, Tokyo|Ch\u016b\u014d]]\n| \u4e2d\u592e\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 6\n|[[Edogawa, Tokyo|Edogawa]]\n| \u6c5f\u6238\u5ddd\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 7\n|[[Itabashi]]\n| \u677f\u6a4b\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 8\n|[[Katsushika]]\n| \u845b\u98fe\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 9\n|[[Kita, Tokyo|Kita]]\n|\u5317\u533a\n|Orange\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 10\n|[[K\u014dt\u014d]]\n|\u6c5f\u6771\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n|11\n|[[Meguro]]\n|\u76ee\u9ed2\u533a\n|Orange\n|-\n|12\n|[[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]\n|\u6e2f\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n|13\n|[[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano]]\n|\u4e2d\u91ce\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n|14\n|[[Nerima]]\n|\u7df4\u99ac\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n|15\n|[[\u014cta, Tokyo|\u014cta]]\n|\u5927\u7530\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n|16\n|[[Setagaya]]\n|\u4e16\u7530\u8c37\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n|17\n|[[Shibuya]]\n|\u6e0b\u8c37\u533a\n|Red\n|-\n|18\n|[[Shinagawa]]\n|\u54c1\u5ddd\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n|19\n|[[Shinjuku]]\n|\u65b0\u5bbf\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n|20\n|[[Suginami]]\n|\u6749\u4e26\u533a\n|Orange\n|-\n|21\n|[[Sumida, Tokyo|Sumida]]\n|\u58a8\u7530\u533a\n|Orange\n|-\n|22\n|[[Tait\u014d]]\n|\u53f0\u6771\u533a\n|Red\n|-\n|23\n|[[Toshima]]\n|\u8c4a\u5cf6\u533a\n|Red\n|}\n\n\nThe \"three central wards\" of Tokyo \u2013 Chiyoda, Ch\u016b\u014d and Minato \u2013 are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.<ref>[http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview03.htm The Population of Tokyo \u2013 Tokyo Metropolitan Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223114634/http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview03.htm |date=December 23, 2008}} (Retrieved on July 4, 2009)</ref> Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former [[Tokyo City]], yet is one of the least populated wards.

Located at the head of [[Tokyo Bay]], the prefecture forms part of the [[Kant\u014d region]] on the [[Pacific]] coast of the main island of [[Honshu]]. Tokyo is the political, economic, and cultural center of Japan, as well as the seat of the [[Emperor of Japan]] and the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]]. The [[Greater Tokyo Area]], which includes several neighboring prefectures, is the [[List of cities by GDP|largest urban economy]] and the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous metropolitan area]] in the world, with more than 38.1 million residents {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}.\n\nOriginally a fishing village named {{nihongo|[[Edo]]|\u6c5f\u6238}}, the city became a prominent political center under ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], who made the city his headquarters in 1603. By the end of the 18th century, Edo had become one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding one million. In 1868, the imperial capital in [[Kyoto]] mas moved to the city following the [[Meiji Restoration|end of the shogunate]], and it was renamed Tokyo (literally \"eastern capital\"). The city was devastated by the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake]], and again by [[Bombing of Tokyo|Allied firebombing]] during [[World War II]]. In the 1950s, Tokyo began a period of rapid reconstruction and expansion, going on to lead the country's [[Japanese economic miracle|post-war recovery and economic boom]]. Since 1943, the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] has administered the prefecture's [[special wards of Tokyo|23 special urban wards]], various [[bedroom communities|bed towns]] in the western area, and [[Tokyo Islands|two outlying island chains]].\n\nTokyo is categorized as an [[global city|Alpha+ city]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]]. Part of an industrial region that includes the neighboring cities of [[Yokohama]], [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], and [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]], the city is Japan's leading center of manufacturing, business, and finance. {{As of|2019}}, Tokyo hosted 36 of the [[Fortune Global 500]] companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/global500/2019/|title=Global 500|website=Fortune|language=en|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref> In 2020, it ranked third on the [[Global Financial Centres Index]], behind only [[New York City]] and [[London]].<ref name=GFCI>{{cite web|url=https://www.longfinance.net/media/documents/GFCI_27_Full_Report_2020.03.26_v1.1_.pdf|title=The Global Financial Centres Index 27|date=March 2020|publisher=Long Finance|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe city has hosted multiple international events, including the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] and three G7 Summits ([[5th G7 summit|1979]], [[12th G7 summit|1986]], and [[19th G7 summit|1993]]); it will also host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] and [[2020 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]]. Tokyo is a leading center for [[Research and development in Japan|research and development]] and is represented by several major [[List of universities in Tokyo|universities]], notably the [[University of Tokyo]]. The city is the primary hub for Japan's [[Shinkansen]] bullet train system, and is served by an extensive network of rail and subways. Notable districts within Tokyo include [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]] (the site of the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] and [[National Diet Building]]), [[Shinjuku]] (the city's administrative center), and [[Shibuya]] (a commercial and business hub).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{anchor|idEtymology}} Tokyo was originally known as {{Nihongo4|[[Edo]]|[[wikt:\u6c5f\u6238|\u6c5f\u6238]]}}, a [[kanji]] compound of [[wikt:\u6c5f|\u6c5f]] (''e'', \"cove, inlet\") and [[wikt:\u6238|\u6238]] (''to'', \"entrance, gate, door\").<ref name=naruto-san>Room, Adrian.

In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was transferred from [[Mikawa Province]] (his lifelong base) to [[Kant\u014d region]]. When he became ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling.

Particularly important in [[diabetes management]], a blood glucose test is typically performed by piercing the [[skin]] (typically, on the finger) to draw blood, then applying the blood to a chemically active disposable 'test-strip'.  Different manufacturers use different technology, but most systems measure an electrical characteristic, and use this to determine the glucose level in the blood. The test is usually referred to as capillary blood glucose.\n\nHealthcare professionals advise patients with [[diabetes mellitus]] on the appropriate monitoring regimen for their condition. Most people with [[type 2 diabetes]] test at least once per day. The [[Mayo Clinic]] generally recommends that diabetics who use insulin (all [[Type 1 diabetes|type 1 diabetics]] and many [[Type 2 diabetes|type 2 diabetics]]) test their blood sugar more often (4\u20138 times per day for type 1 diabetics, 2 or more times per day for type 2 diabetics),<ref name=\"Mayo SMBG Guide\">{{cite web|title=Blood sugar testing: Why, when and how|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/in-depth/blood-sugar/art-20046628|website=mayoclinic.org|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref> both to assess the effectiveness of their prior insulin dose and to help determine their next insulin dose.\n\n==Purpose==\nBlood glucose monitoring reveals individual patterns of blood glucose changes, and helps in the planning of meals, activities, and at what time of day to take medications.<ref name=medlineplus>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003438.htm MedlinePlus > Blood glucose monitoring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122232739/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003438.htm |date=22 January 2010 }} Update Date: 6/17/2008.

Sample sizes vary from 30 to 0.3 &mu;l. Test times vary from 5 seconds to 2 minutes (modern meters typically require less than 15 seconds).]]\nA '''blood glucose meter''' is an electronic device for measuring the blood glucose level. A relatively small drop of blood is placed on a disposable test strip which interfaces with a digital meter. Within several seconds, the level of blood glucose will be shown on the digital display.\n\nNeeding only a small drop of blood for the meter means that the time and effort required for testing is reduced and the compliance of diabetic people to their testing regimens is improved. Although the cost of using blood glucose meters seems high, it is believed to be a cost benefit relative to the avoided medical costs of the [[complications of diabetes]].\n\nRecent advances include:{{Citation needed|reason=Citations are required for each advancement, as well as proof that they are advancements.|date=April 2017}}\n*  alternate site testing, the use of blood drops from places other than the finger, usually the palm or forearm. This alternate site testing uses the same test strips and meter, is practically pain free, and gives the finger tips a needed break if they become sore.  The disadvantage of this technique is that there is usually less blood flow to alternate sites, which prevents the reading from being accurate when the blood sugar level is changing.\n*  no coding systems.  Older systems required 'coding' of the strips to the meter.  This carried a risk of 'miscoding', which can lead to inaccurate results. Two approaches have resulted in systems that no longer require coding.  Some systems are 'autocoded', where technology is used to code each strip to the meter.  And some are manufactured to a 'single code', thereby avoiding the risk of miscoding.\n*  multi-test systems. Some systems use a cartridge or a disc containing multiple test strips.  This has the advantage that the user doesn't have to load individual strips each time, which is convenient and can enable quicker testing.\n*  downloadable meters.  Most newer systems come with software that allows the user to download meter results to a computer.  This information can then be used, together with health care professional guidance, to enhance and improve diabetes management.  The meters usually require a connection cable, unless they are designed to work wirelessly with an insulin pump, are designed to plug directly into the computer, or use an infrared connection.\n\n==Continuous glucose monitoring==\nA [[continuous glucose monitor]] determines glucose levels on a continuous basis (every few minutes). A typical system consists of:\n* a disposable glucose sensor placed just under the skin, which is worn for a few days until replacement\n* a link from the sensor to a non-implanted transmitter which communicates to a radio receiver\n* an electronic receiver worn like a pager (or insulin pump) that displays glucose levels with nearly continuous updates, as well as monitors rising and falling trends.\n\nContinuous glucose monitors measure the concentration of glucose in a sample of [[interstitial fluid]].  Shortcomings of CGM systems due to this fact are:\n* continuous systems must be calibrated with a traditional blood glucose measurement (using current technology) and therefore require both the CGM system and occasional \"fingerstick\"\n* glucose levels in interstitial fluid lag behind blood glucose values\nPatients therefore require traditional fingerstick measurements for calibration (typically twice per day) and are often advised to use fingerstick measurements to confirm hypo- or hyperglycemia before taking corrective action.\n\nThe lag time discussed above has been reported to be about 5 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wentholt IM, Vollebregt MA, Hart AA, Hoekstra JB, DeVries JH | title = Comparison of a needle-type and a microdialysis continuous glucose monitor in type 1 diabetic patients | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 28 | issue = 12 | pages = 2871\u20136 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16306547 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.28.12.2871 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Steil GM, Rebrin K, Mastrototaro J, Bernaba B, Saad MF | title = Determination of plasma glucose during rapid glucose excursions with a subcutaneous glucose sensor | journal = Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 27\u201331 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12725704 | doi = 10.1089/152091503763816436 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilhelm B, Forst S, Weber MM, Larbig M, Pf\u00fctzner A, Forst T | title = Evaluation of CGMS during rapid blood glucose changes in patients with type 1 diabetes | journal = Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 146\u201355 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16734545 | doi = 10.1089/dia.2006.8.146 }}</ref>  Anecdotally, some users of the various systems report lag times of up to 10\u201315 minutes. This lag time is insignificant when blood sugar levels are relatively consistent. However, blood sugar levels, when changing rapidly, may read in the normal range on a CGM system while in reality the patient is already experiencing symptoms of an out-of-range blood glucose value and may require treatment. Patients using CGM are therefore advised to consider both the absolute value of the blood glucose level given by the system as well as any trend in the blood glucose levels. For example, a patient using CGM with a blood glucose of 100&nbsp;mg/dl on their CGM system might take no action if their blood glucose has been consistent for several readings, while a patient with the same blood glucose level but whose blood glucose has been dropping steeply in a short period of time might be advised to perform a fingerstick test to check for hypoglycemia.\n\nContinuous monitoring allows examination of how the blood glucose level reacts to insulin, exercise, food, and other factors. The additional data can be useful for setting correct [[insulin]] dosing ratios for food intake and correction of hyperglycemia. Monitoring during periods when blood glucose levels are not typically checked (e.g. overnight) can help to identify problems in insulin dosing (such as basal levels for insulin pump users or long-acting insulin levels for patients taking injections). Monitors may also be equipped with alarms to alert patients of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia so that a patient can take corrective action(s) (after fingerstick testing, if necessary) even in cases where they do not feel symptoms of either condition. While the technology has its limitations, studies have demonstrated that patients with continuous sensors experience less hyperglycemia and also reduce their [[glycosylated hemoglobin]] levels.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Garg S, Zisser H, Schwartz S, Bailey T, Kaplan R, Ellis S, Jovanovic L | title = Improvement in glycemic excursions with a transcutaneous, real-time continuous glucose sensor: a randomized controlled trial | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 44\u201350 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16373894 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.29.1.44 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Deiss D, Bolinder J, Riveline JP, Battelino T, Bosi E, Tubiana-Rufi N, Kerr D, Phillip M | title = Improved glycemic control in poorly controlled patients with type 1 diabetes using real-time continuous glucose monitoring | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 2730\u20132 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17130215 | doi = 10.2337/dc06-1134 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/557c68c15d2f648a0a97589731b45e08e9c83ed9 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>Mastrototaro, J.J., Cooper, K.W., Soundararajan, G., Sanders, J.B., and Shah, R.B.

However, an increasing number of insurance companies do cover continuous glucose monitoring supplies (both the receiver and disposable sensors) on a case-by-case basis if the patient and doctor show a specific need. The lack of insurance coverage is exacerbated by the fact that disposable sensors must be frequently replaced. Some sensors have been U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved for 7- and 3-day use, (although some patients wear sensors for longer than the recommended period) and the receiving meters likewise have finite lifetimes (less than 2 years and as little as 6 months). This is one factor in the slow uptake in the use of sensors that have been marketed in the United States.\n\nThe principles, history and recent developments of operation of electrochemical glucose biosensors are discussed in a chemical review by [[Joseph Wang]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang J | title = Electrochemical glucose biosensors | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 814\u201325 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18154363 | doi = 10.1021/cr068123a | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/20af38a0a507313e77832c0aba1db30d02053d83 }}</ref>\n\n==Glucose sensing bio-implants==\nInvestigations on the use of test strips have shown that the required self-injury acts as a psychological barrier restraining the patients from sufficient glucose control.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} As a result, [[Complications of diabetes mellitus|secondary diseases]] are caused by excessive glucose levels. A significant improvement of diabetes therapy might be achieved with an implantable sensor that would continuously monitor blood sugar levels within the body and transmit the measured data outside. The burden of regular blood testing would be taken from the patient, who would instead follow the course of their glucose levels on an intelligent device like a laptop or a smart phone.\n\nGlucose concentrations do not necessarily have to be measured in blood vessels, but may also be determined in the [[interstitial fluid]], where the same levels prevail \u2013 with a time lag of a few minutes \u2013 due to its connection with the [[capillary system]]. However, the enzymatic glucose detection scheme used in single-use test strips is not directly suitable for [[implant (medicine)|implants]]. One main problem is caused by the varying supply of oxygen, by which glucose is converted to [[glucono delta-lactone|glucono lactone]] and H{{sub|2}}O{{sub|2}} by [[glucose oxidase]].

Particularly important in [[diabetes management]], a blood glucose test is typically performed by piercing the [[skin]] (typically, on the finger) to draw blood, then applying the blood to a chemically active disposable 'test-strip'.  Different manufacturers use different technology, but most systems measure an electrical characteristic, and use this to determine the glucose level in the blood. The test is usually referred to as capillary blood glucose.\n\nHealthcare professionals advise patients with [[diabetes mellitus]] on the appropriate monitoring regimen for their condition.

The [[Mayo Clinic]] generally recommends that diabetics who use insulin (all [[Type 1 diabetes|type 1 diabetics]] and many [[Type 2 diabetes|type 2 diabetics]]) test their blood sugar more often (4\u20138 times per day for type 1 diabetics, 2 or more times per day for type 2 diabetics),<ref name=\"Mayo SMBG Guide\">{{cite web|title=Blood sugar testing: Why, when and how|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/in-depth/blood-sugar/art-20046628|website=mayoclinic.org|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref> both to assess the effectiveness of their prior insulin dose and to help determine their next insulin dose.\n\n==Purpose==\nBlood glucose monitoring reveals individual patterns of blood glucose changes, and helps in the planning of meals, activities, and at what time of day to take medications.<ref name=medlineplus>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003438.htm MedlinePlus > Blood glucose monitoring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122232739/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003438.htm |date=22 January 2010 }} Update Date: 6/17/2008.

Sample sizes vary from 30 to 0.3 &mu;l. Test times vary from 5 seconds to 2 minutes (modern meters typically require less than 15 seconds).]]\nA '''blood glucose meter''' is an electronic device for measuring the blood glucose level. A relatively small drop of blood is placed on a disposable test strip which interfaces with a digital meter. Within several seconds, the level of blood glucose will be shown on the digital display.\n\nNeeding only a small drop of blood for the meter means that the time and effort required for testing is reduced and the compliance of diabetic people to their testing regimens is improved. Although the cost of using blood glucose meters seems high, it is believed to be a cost benefit relative to the avoided medical costs of the [[complications of diabetes]].\n\nRecent advances include:{{Citation needed|reason=Citations are required for each advancement, as well as proof that they are advancements.|date=April 2017}}\n*  alternate site testing, the use of blood drops from places other than the finger, usually the palm or forearm. This alternate site testing uses the same test strips and meter, is practically pain free, and gives the finger tips a needed break if they become sore.  The disadvantage of this technique is that there is usually less blood flow to alternate sites, which prevents the reading from being accurate when the blood sugar level is changing.\n*  no coding systems.  Older systems required 'coding' of the strips to the meter.  This carried a risk of 'miscoding', which can lead to inaccurate results. Two approaches have resulted in systems that no longer require coding.  Some systems are 'autocoded', where technology is used to code each strip to the meter.  And some are manufactured to a 'single code', thereby avoiding the risk of miscoding.\n*  multi-test systems. Some systems use a cartridge or a disc containing multiple test strips.  This has the advantage that the user doesn't have to load individual strips each time, which is convenient and can enable quicker testing.\n*  downloadable meters.  Most newer systems come with software that allows the user to download meter results to a computer.  This information can then be used, together with health care professional guidance, to enhance and improve diabetes management.  The meters usually require a connection cable, unless they are designed to work wirelessly with an insulin pump, are designed to plug directly into the computer, or use an infrared connection.\n\n==Continuous glucose monitoring==\nA [[continuous glucose monitor]] determines glucose levels on a continuous basis (every few minutes). A typical system consists of:\n* a disposable glucose sensor placed just under the skin, which is worn for a few days until replacement\n* a link from the sensor to a non-implanted transmitter which communicates to a radio receiver\n* an electronic receiver worn like a pager (or insulin pump) that displays glucose levels with nearly continuous updates, as well as monitors rising and falling trends.\n\nContinuous glucose monitors measure the concentration of glucose in a sample of [[interstitial fluid]].  Shortcomings of CGM systems due to this fact are:\n* continuous systems must be calibrated with a traditional blood glucose measurement (using current technology) and therefore require both the CGM system and occasional \"fingerstick\"\n* glucose levels in interstitial fluid lag behind blood glucose values\nPatients therefore require traditional fingerstick measurements for calibration (typically twice per day) and are often advised to use fingerstick measurements to confirm hypo- or hyperglycemia before taking corrective action.\n\nThe lag time discussed above has been reported to be about 5 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wentholt IM, Vollebregt MA, Hart AA, Hoekstra JB, DeVries JH | title = Comparison of a needle-type and a microdialysis continuous glucose monitor in type 1 diabetic patients | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 28 | issue = 12 | pages = 2871\u20136 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16306547 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.28.12.2871 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Steil GM, Rebrin K, Mastrototaro J, Bernaba B, Saad MF | title = Determination of plasma glucose during rapid glucose excursions with a subcutaneous glucose sensor | journal = Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 27\u201331 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12725704 | doi = 10.1089/152091503763816436 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilhelm B, Forst S, Weber MM, Larbig M, Pf\u00fctzner A, Forst T | title = Evaluation of CGMS during rapid blood glucose changes in patients with type 1 diabetes | journal = Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 146\u201355 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16734545 | doi = 10.1089/dia.2006.8.146 }}</ref>  Anecdotally, some users of the various systems report lag times of up to 10\u201315 minutes. This lag time is insignificant when blood sugar levels are relatively consistent. However, blood sugar levels, when changing rapidly, may read in the normal range on a CGM system while in reality the patient is already experiencing symptoms of an out-of-range blood glucose value and may require treatment. Patients using CGM are therefore advised to consider both the absolute value of the blood glucose level given by the system as well as any trend in the blood glucose levels. For example, a patient using CGM with a blood glucose of 100&nbsp;mg/dl on their CGM system might take no action if their blood glucose has been consistent for several readings, while a patient with the same blood glucose level but whose blood glucose has been dropping steeply in a short period of time might be advised to perform a fingerstick test to check for hypoglycemia.\n\nContinuous monitoring allows examination of how the blood glucose level reacts to insulin, exercise, food, and other factors. The additional data can be useful for setting correct [[insulin]] dosing ratios for food intake and correction of hyperglycemia. Monitoring during periods when blood glucose levels are not typically checked (e.g. overnight) can help to identify problems in insulin dosing (such as basal levels for insulin pump users or long-acting insulin levels for patients taking injections). Monitors may also be equipped with alarms to alert patients of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia so that a patient can take corrective action(s) (after fingerstick testing, if necessary) even in cases where they do not feel symptoms of either condition. While the technology has its limitations, studies have demonstrated that patients with continuous sensors experience less hyperglycemia and also reduce their [[glycosylated hemoglobin]] levels.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Garg S, Zisser H, Schwartz S, Bailey T, Kaplan R, Ellis S, Jovanovic L | title = Improvement in glycemic excursions with a transcutaneous, real-time continuous glucose sensor: a randomized controlled trial | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 44\u201350 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16373894 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.29.1.44 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Deiss D, Bolinder J, Riveline JP, Battelino T, Bosi E, Tubiana-Rufi N, Kerr D, Phillip M | title = Improved glycemic control in poorly controlled patients with type 1 diabetes using real-time continuous glucose monitoring | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 2730\u20132 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17130215 | doi = 10.2337/dc06-1134 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/557c68c15d2f648a0a97589731b45e08e9c83ed9 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>Mastrototaro, J.J., Cooper, K.W., Soundararajan, G., Sanders, J.B., and Shah, R.B.

However, an increasing number of insurance companies do cover continuous glucose monitoring supplies (both the receiver and disposable sensors) on a case-by-case basis if the patient and doctor show a specific need. The lack of insurance coverage is exacerbated by the fact that disposable sensors must be frequently replaced. Some sensors have been U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved for 7- and 3-day use, (although some patients wear sensors for longer than the recommended period) and the receiving meters likewise have finite lifetimes (less than 2 years and as little as 6 months). This is one factor in the slow uptake in the use of sensors that have been marketed in the United States.\n\nThe principles, history and recent developments of operation of electrochemical glucose biosensors are discussed in a chemical review by [[Joseph Wang]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang J | title = Electrochemical glucose biosensors | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 814\u201325 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18154363 | doi = 10.1021/cr068123a | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/20af38a0a507313e77832c0aba1db30d02053d83 }}</ref>\n\n==Glucose sensing bio-implants==\nInvestigations on the use of test strips have shown that the required self-injury acts as a psychological barrier restraining the patients from sufficient glucose control.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} As a result, [[Complications of diabetes mellitus|secondary diseases]] are caused by excessive glucose levels. A significant improvement of diabetes therapy might be achieved with an implantable sensor that would continuously monitor blood sugar levels within the body and transmit the measured data outside. The burden of regular blood testing would be taken from the patient, who would instead follow the course of their glucose levels on an intelligent device like a laptop or a smart phone.\n\nGlucose concentrations do not necessarily have to be measured in blood vessels, but may also be determined in the [[interstitial fluid]], where the same levels prevail \u2013 with a time lag of a few minutes \u2013 due to its connection with the [[capillary system]]. However, the enzymatic glucose detection scheme used in single-use test strips is not directly suitable for [[implant (medicine)|implants]]. One main problem is caused by the varying supply of oxygen, by which glucose is converted to [[glucono delta-lactone|glucono lactone]] and H{{sub|2}}O{{sub|2}} by [[glucose oxidase]].
