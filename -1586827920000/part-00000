It is the sixth installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Peter Outerbridge]], and [[Shawnee Smith]].\n\n''Saw VI'' continues the franchise's focus on the posthumous effects of the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] and the progression of his successor, [[Mark Hoffman]]. In this film, Hoffman sets a series of traps for an insurance executive, [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]], and his employees. Meanwhile, the FBI trails [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]], now suspected of being Jigsaw's last accomplice, and Hoffman is drawn into motion to protect his secret identity.\n\nGreutert served as editor for all the previous ''Saw'' films before making his directorial debut with ''Saw VI''. Melton and Dunstan, the writers for both ''[[Saw IV]]'' and ''[[Saw V]]'', returned to write the screenplay and [[Charlie Clouser]], who provided the score for all previous ''Saw'' films, composed the [[Saw VI: Original Motion Picture Score|score]]. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] from March to May 2009 with a budget of $11 million.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 23, 2009, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. In Spain it was the first film to receive a [[Motion picture content rating system#Spain|Pel\u00edcula X]] rating for violence (a rating usually reserved for [[pornographic film]]s); the rating restricted screenings to eight select theaters in that country. It was released almost a year later on October 8, 2010 in Spain with an \"18\" rating, after the producers had the offensive content edited out, according to the rating board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2010/08/04/spain_drops_xrating_on_saw_vi|title=Spain Drops X-Rating On 'Saw VI'|date=August 4, 2010|accessdate= May 18, 2015}}</ref> With gross receipts of $14 million in its opening weekend, ''Saw VI'' placed second to ''[[Paranormal Activity]]''{{'s}} $21 million. ''Saw VI'' went on to gross over $68 million worldwide, the lowest-grossing ''Saw'' film to date, but still a financial success compared to its small budget. Reviews were mixed, with some criticizing the acting and others praising Greutert's directing, improvement over the last few installments and the film's contribution to the [[Healthcare reform debate in the United States|debate on healthcare reform in the United States]]. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw 3D]]'', was released in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo [[Predatory lending|predatory lenders]] wake up in a room with a caged-in scale, wearing head harnesses with screws aimed at their temples, and the one who sets more flesh weight on their scale will survive. The overweight Eddie cuts fat from his torso, but Simone chops off her arm, and Eddie is killed when the timer expires. Meanwhile, Detective Mark Hoffman exits the glass coffin to safety and sees Agent Peter Strahm\u2019s corpse; he also notices that Strahm's right hand was unharmed. As he reviews Eddie\u2019s and Simone\u2019s game footage, he is called over by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who found Strahm's fingerprints at the scene. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed the autopsies for all of the Jigsaw victims so far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie's flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter. The agents intend to find Seth Baxter's audio tape to prove Strahm's involvement.\n\nWhile at the hospital to meet with Simone, Hoffman is met by reporter Pamela Jenkins, who claims to have found something at the meatpacking plant, but he dismisses her. He later meets with Jill Tuck at her clinic, and tells her that he is taking control of the games. Jill gives him five envelopes from the box left to her in John Kramer's will, each containing photos of people to be tested. After he leaves, a flashback reveals that John brought Amanda Young to Jill, who had deemed her a lost cause, as proof that his methods work. A later flashback, as Jill delivers a package from the box to the hospital, shows that Jill met with John at the [[Saw IV|Gideon Meatpacking Plant]] before his death, where he gave her the box's key and his promise that she would be protected when the games ended.\n\nWilliam Easton, an insurance executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed to heart disease after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned [[zoo]], where he and his janitor, Hank, awaken in [[vise]]s designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into [[oxygen mask]]s strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs, or he will never see his family again. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his breath, and is killed by the vise. William's other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a [[hanging]] room, a [[Steambath|steam room]], and a [[carousel]] trap. Flashbacks show that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic, and took issue with his formula for only deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.\n\nThe game is viewed by a woman named Tara and her son Brent from a cage below the observation room, which contains a tank of [[hydrofluoric acid]] and a switch marked \"Live\" and \"Die\". Pamela awakens in another cage on the other side of the room. During the game, Hoffman is called away by Erickson and Perez, who found the Seth Baxter audio tape and are having it unscrambled by an offsite technician. They inform him that abnormalities were found in Strahm's fingerprints, and Erickson eventually reveals their knowledge of Strahm's death. When his voice is unscrambled from the tape, Hoffman kills everyone in the room, with Perez mockingly telling him that everyone already knows of his involvement before she dies. He then plants fingerprints using Strahm's severed hand, before dowsing fuel on the room and setting it on fire to destroy the evidence.\n\nHe returns to the observation room and finds [[Saw III|the letter that he wrote to Amanda]] in which he had used his knowledge of her role in Jill's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Dr. Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches the end of his path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape from John that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily shifts the switch to \"Die\", causing a bed of needles to swing down and inject hydrofluoric acid into William's body, killing him as Brent, Tara, and Pamela watch in horror. Jill restrains Hoffman, and locks a new Reverse Bear Trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope from John's will, which contains his photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds, but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand to free his wrist restraints, and jams the trap in window bars as it activates. He then pulls his head free, ripping open his cheek in the process and screams in agony.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as [[List of Saw characters#Dan Erickson|Agent Dan Erickson]]\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]]\n* [[Peter Outerbridge]] as [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]]\n* [[Athena Karkanis]] as [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Agent Lindsey Perez]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* Samantha Lemole as [[List of Saw characters#Pamela Jenkins|Pamela Jenkins]]\n* [[Tanedra Howard]] as [[List of Saw characters#Simone|Simone]]\n* Marty Moreau as [[List of Saw characters#Eddie|Eddie]]\n* Shawn Ahmed as [[List of Saw characters#Addy and Allen|Allen]]\n* Janelle Hutchison as [[List of Saw characters#Addy and Allen|Addy]]\n* [[Gerry Mendicino]] as [[List of Saw characters#Hank|Hank]]\n* [[Caroline Cave]] as [[List of Saw characters#Debbie|Debbie]]\n* [[George Newbern]] as [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]]\n* [[Shauna MacDonald]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brent and Tara Abbott|Tara Abbott]]\n* [[Devon Bostick]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brent and Tara Abbott|Brent Abbott]]\n* [[Darius McCrary]] as [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|Dave]]\n* Shawn Mathieson as [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|Josh]]\n* [[Melanie Scrofano]] as [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|Gena]]\n* [[Karen Cliche]] as [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|Shelby]]\n* [[James Gilbert (actor)|James Gilbert]] as [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|Aaron]]\n* Larissa Gomes as [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|Emily]]\n* Billy Otis as [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil Adams]]\n* James Van Patten as [[List of Saw characters#Adam Heffner|Dr. Heffner]]\n* [[Mpho Koaho]] as [[List of Saw characters#Timothy Young|Timothy Young]]\n* Ginger Busch as [[List of Saw characters#Sachi|Sachi]]\n* [[Scott Patterson]] as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Agent Peter Strahm]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\nOn {{nowrap|May 14, 2008}}, [[Bloody Disgusting]] reported that [[Kevin Greutert]], the editor of the first five films in the [[Saw (franchise)|franchise]], would make his directorial debut with ''Saw VI''.<ref name=\"Kevin Greutert To Direct Saw VI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12258 |title='Saw VI' To Be Directed By Kevin Greutert |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |publisher=The Collective |date=May 14, 2008 |accessdate=May 20, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sVYisV3N?url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12258 |archivedate=September 5, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Newcomer to the series, Andrew Coutts replaced him as [[film editor|editor]] for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17580 |title='Saw VI' Director Having a 'Mind-Numbingly Complex' Experience |work=Bloody Disgusting |publisher=The Collective |date=June 8, 2009 |accessdate=September 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sVYKw9sH?url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17580 |archivedate=September 5, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Saw VI'' marked David Armstrong's last time to serve as [[cinematographer]] of the series.<ref name=\"B-D Chats With the Cast and Crew\">{{cite web|title=B-D Chats With the Cast and Crew of 'Saw VI', New Traps Revealed! |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/16277 |last=Pereira |first=Mike |work=Bloody Disgusting |publisher=The Collective |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=May 21, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5n3mavzfr?url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/16277 |archivedate=January 26, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Mark Burg]] and [[Oren Koules]] again served as producers, with [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]], creators of the series, executive producing.

It is the sixth installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Peter Outerbridge]], and [[Shawnee Smith]].\n\n''Saw VI'' continues the franchise's focus on the posthumous effects of the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] and the progression of his successor, [[Mark Hoffman]]. In this film, Hoffman sets a series of traps for an insurance executive, [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]], and his employees. Meanwhile, the FBI trails [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]], now suspected of being Jigsaw's last accomplice, and Hoffman is drawn into motion to protect his secret identity.\n\nGreutert served as editor for all the previous ''Saw'' films before making his directorial debut with ''Saw VI''. Melton and Dunstan, the writers for both ''[[Saw IV]]'' and ''[[Saw V]]'', returned to write the screenplay and [[Charlie Clouser]], who provided the score for all previous ''Saw'' films, composed the [[Saw VI: Original Motion Picture Score|score]]. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] from March to May 2009 with a budget of $11 million.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 23, 2009, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. In Spain it was the first film to receive a [[Motion picture content rating system#Spain|Pel\u00edcula X]] rating for violence (a rating usually reserved for [[pornographic film]]s); the rating restricted screenings to eight select theaters in that country. It was released almost a year later on October 8, 2010 in Spain with an \"18\" rating, after the producers had the offensive content edited out, according to the rating board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2010/08/04/spain_drops_xrating_on_saw_vi|title=Spain Drops X-Rating On 'Saw VI'|date=August 4, 2010|accessdate= May 18, 2015}}</ref> With gross receipts of $14 million in its opening weekend, ''Saw VI'' placed second to ''[[Paranormal Activity]]''{{'s}} $21 million. ''Saw VI'' went on to gross over $68 million worldwide, the lowest-grossing ''Saw'' film to date, but still a financial success compared to its small budget. Reviews were mixed, with some criticizing the acting and others praising Greutert's directing, improvement over the last few installments and the film's contribution to the [[Healthcare reform debate in the United States|debate on healthcare reform in the United States]]. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw 3D]]'', was released in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo [[Predatory lending|predatory lenders]] wake up in a room with a caged-in scale, wearing head harnesses with screws aimed at their temples, and the one who sets more flesh weight on their scale will survive. The overweight Eddie cuts fat from his torso, but Simone chops off her arm, and Eddie is killed when the timer expires. Meanwhile, Detective Mark Hoffman exits the glass coffin to safety and sees Agent Peter Strahm\u2019s corpse; he also notices that Strahm's right hand was unharmed. As he reviews Eddie\u2019s and Simone\u2019s game footage, he is called over by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who found Strahm's fingerprints at the scene. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed the autopsies for all of the Jigsaw victims so far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie's flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter. The agents intend to find Seth Baxter's audio tape to prove Strahm's involvement.\n\nWhile at the hospital to meet with Simone, Hoffman is met by reporter Pamela Jenkins, who claims to have found something at the meatpacking plant, but he dismisses her. He later meets with Jill Tuck at her clinic, and tells her that he is taking control of the games. Jill gives him five envelopes from the box left to her in John Kramer's will, each containing photos of people to be tested. After he leaves, a flashback reveals that John brought Amanda Young to Jill, who had deemed her a lost cause, as proof that his methods work. A later flashback, as Jill delivers a package from the box to the hospital, shows that Jill met with John at the [[Saw IV|Gideon Meatpacking Plant]] before his death, where he gave her the box's key and his promise that she would be protected when the games ended.\n\nWilliam Easton, an insurance executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed to heart disease after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned [[zoo]], where he and his janitor, Hank, awaken in [[vise]]s designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into [[oxygen mask]]s strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs, or he will never see his family again. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his breath, and is killed by the vise. William's other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a [[hanging]] room, a [[Steambath|steam room]], and a [[carousel]] trap. Flashbacks show that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic, and took issue with his formula for only deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.\n\nThe game is viewed by a woman named Tara and her son Brent from a cage below the observation room, which contains a tank of [[hydrofluoric acid]] and a switch marked \"Live\" and \"Die\". Pamela awakens in another cage on the other side of the room. During the game, Hoffman is called away by Erickson and Perez, who found the Seth Baxter audio tape and are having it unscrambled by an offsite technician. They inform him that abnormalities were found in Strahm's fingerprints, and Erickson eventually reveals their knowledge of Strahm's death. When his voice is unscrambled from the tape, Hoffman kills everyone in the room, with Perez mockingly telling him that everyone already knows of his involvement before she dies. He then plants fingerprints using Strahm's severed hand, before dowsing fuel on the room and setting it on fire to destroy the evidence.\n\nHe returns to the observation room and finds [[Saw III|the letter that he wrote to Amanda]] in which he had used his knowledge of her role in Jill's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Dr. Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches the end of his path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape from John that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily shifts the switch to \"Die\", causing a bed of needles to swing down and inject hydrofluoric acid into William's body, killing him as Brent, Tara, and Pamela watch in horror. Jill restrains Hoffman, and locks a new Reverse Bear Trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope from John's will, which contains his photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds, but no key.

It stars Whannell, [[Cary Elwes]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Monica Potter]], [[Michael Emerson]], [[Ken Leung]], and [[Tobin Bell]]. It is the first installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. In it, Whannell and Elwes portray two men who awake to find themselves chained in a large dilapidated bathroom, with one being ordered to kill the other or his family will die. The screenplay was written by Whannell, who co-created the story with Wan in their screenwriting debuts respectively.\n\nThe screenplay was written in 2001, but after failed attempts to get the script produced in Wan and Whannell's home country of Australia, they were urged to travel to Los Angeles. In order to help attract producers they shot a [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] short film [[Saw (2003 film)|of the same name]] from a scene out of the script. This proved successful in 2003 as producers from [[Evolution Entertainment]] were immediately attached and also formed a horror genre production label, [[Twisted Pictures]]. The film was given a small budget of $1.2 million and shot for 18 days.\n\n''Saw'' was first screened on January 19, 2004, before released in North America on October 29, 2004, by [[Lions Gate Films]]. Compared to its low budget, ''Saw'' performed very well at the box office, grossing more than $100 million worldwide and becoming, at the time, one of the most profitable horror films since ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996). The film was theatrically re-released, to select theatres, on October 31, 2014 to celebrate its tenth anniversary.<ref name=\"IGNAug2014\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/27/saw-returning-to-theaters-for-its-10th-anniversary|title=Saw returning to theatres for its 10th anniversary|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|date=August 28, 2014|accessdate=August 28, 2014}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Saw II]]'', was released in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nPhotographer Adam awakens in a dilapitated bathtub, with his ankle chained to a pipe. Across the room is [[Oncology|oncologist]] Dr Lawrence Gordon with a corpse between them holding a [[revolver]] and a [[microcassette]] recorder. Both men find a tape in their pockets, and Adam retrieves the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two [[hacksaw]]s inside the toilet, which they try to use to cut through their chains, but Adam's saw breaks. Lawrence realizes the saws are meant to be used on their feet, and identifies their captor as the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]], whom Lawrence knows of because he was once a suspect.\n\nFlashbacks reveal that Lawrence, while discussing the terminal brain cancer of a patient named John Kramer, was approached by Detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who found his penlight at the scene of one of Jigsaw's \"games\". Lawrence's alibi cleared him, but he agreed to view the testimony of [[heroin]] addict [[Amanda Young]], the only known survivor of one of Jigsaw's traps who believes the killer helped her.\n\nIn the present, Lawrence's wife Alison and daughter Diana are held captive at home as their captor watches Adam and Lawrence through a hidden camera. The house is simultaneously watched by Tapp, having been discharged from the police and becoming obsessed with the Jigsaw case, eventually finding Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from Amanda's game. There, he and Sing apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap. However, Jigsaw escaped after slashing Tapp's throat and Sing was killed by a shotgun trap. Convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp has continued to stalk him.\n\nIn the bathroom, Lawrence finds a box containing two cigarettes, a lighter, and a one-way cellphone, and recalls his abduction in a parking garage by a pig-masked figure. He and Adam stage Adam's death with a cigarette dipped in the corpse's poisoned blood, but the plan fails when Adam is electrically shocked through his ankle chain. Adam recalls his own abduction: in his photo development room when the power went out, he found [[Billy the Puppet|a puppet]] and was attacked by the same pig-masked figure. Alison calls Lawrence at gunpoint and tells him not to trust Adam, who admits that he was paid to take photos of Lawrence, many of which were in the bag containing the hacksaws. Adam reveals his knowledge of Lawrence's affair with one of his medical students, whom he had visited the night he was abducted; revealing why Lawrence is being \"tested\". After Adam describes the man who hired him, Lawrence realizes it was Tapp. Adam finds a photo he did not take, of a man staring out a window of Lawrence's house, whom Lawrence identifies as Zep, an orderly at his hospital. As the clock strikes six, Zep moves to kill Alison and Diana.\n\nAlison frees herself and fights Zep for his gun, after he calls Lawrence. The struggle attracts Tapp's attention, and he saves Alison and Diana and chases Zep to the sewers, where he is shot in the chest after a brief struggle. Lawrence, only aware of gunshots and screaming, is shocked and loses reach of the cellphone. In desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse's revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Lawrence according to \"the rules\", but Adam, having survived, bludgeons Zep to death with the toilet tank lid. As Lawrence crawls out of the room, Adam searches Zep's body for a key and finds another tape, which reveals that Zep was another victim following rules to obtain an antidote for a slow-acting poison he was given. As the tape ends, the corpse rises and is revealed to be John Kramer, the real Jigsaw Killer. He reveals that the key to Adam's chain went down the bathtub drain when Adam first woke up. Horrified, Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep's gun, but John shocks him with a remote. John shuts off the lights, and yells \"Game Over\" before sealing the door and leaving a helpless Adam to die.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n[[File:Shawnee Smith gfdl.png|thumb|upright|It took one day for [[Shawnee Smith]]'s scenes to be shot, which Wan described as \"physically taxing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/interview130.htm |title=The Arrow Interviews James Wan |last=Fallon |first=John |publisher=[[JoBlo.com]] |year=2004 |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323061516/http://www.joblo.com/arrow/interview130.htm |archivedate=March 23, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence \"Larry\" Gordon]]\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]]\n* [[Danny Glover]] as [[David Tapp]]\n* [[Monica Potter]] as [[List of Saw characters#Alison and Diana Gordon|Alison Gordon]]\n* [[Michael Emerson]] as [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]]\n* [[Ken Leung]] as [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Detective Steven Sing]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as [[List of Saw characters#Allison Kerry|Detective Allison Kerry]]\n* Mike Butters as [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]\n* [[Paul Gutrecht]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mark Wilson|Mark]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Makenzie Vega]] as [[List of Saw characters#Alison and Diana Gordon|Diana Gordon]]\n* [[Ned Bellamy]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Ridenhour|Jeff Ridenhour]]\n* [[Alexandra Bokyun Chun]] as [[List of Saw characters#Carla Song|Carla]]\n* [[Oren Koules]] as [[List of Saw characters#Donnie Greco|Donnie Greco]]\n* [[Benito Martinez (actor)|Benito Martinez]] as Brett\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:James Wan and Leigh Whannell Saw 3D premiere.jpg|thumb|left|Wan (left) and Whannell (right).]]\nAfter finishing film school, Australian director [[James Wan]] and Australian writer [[Leigh Whannell]] wanted to write and fund a film.<ref name=\"AVClub\">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/saw-creators-leigh-whannell-and-james-wan,46975/ |title=Saw creators Leigh Whannell and James Wan |last=Tobias |first=Scott |work=[[The A.V.

It stars Whannell, [[Cary Elwes]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Monica Potter]], [[Michael Emerson]], [[Ken Leung]], and [[Tobin Bell]]. It is the first installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. In it, Whannell and Elwes portray two men who awake to find themselves chained in a large dilapidated bathroom, with one being ordered to kill the other or his family will die. The screenplay was written by Whannell, who co-created the story with Wan in their screenwriting debuts respectively.\n\nThe screenplay was written in 2001, but after failed attempts to get the script produced in Wan and Whannell's home country of Australia, they were urged to travel to Los Angeles. In order to help attract producers they shot a [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] short film [[Saw (2003 film)|of the same name]] from a scene out of the script. This proved successful in 2003 as producers from [[Evolution Entertainment]] were immediately attached and also formed a horror genre production label, [[Twisted Pictures]]. The film was given a small budget of $1.2 million and shot for 18 days.\n\n''Saw'' was first screened on January 19, 2004, before released in North America on October 29, 2004, by [[Lions Gate Films]]. Compared to its low budget, ''Saw'' performed very well at the box office, grossing more than $100 million worldwide and becoming, at the time, one of the most profitable horror films since ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996). The film was theatrically re-released, to select theatres, on October 31, 2014 to celebrate its tenth anniversary.<ref name=\"IGNAug2014\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/27/saw-returning-to-theaters-for-its-10th-anniversary|title=Saw returning to theatres for its 10th anniversary|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|date=August 28, 2014|accessdate=August 28, 2014}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Saw II]]'', was released in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nPhotographer Adam awakens in a dilapitated bathtub, with his ankle chained to a pipe. Across the room is [[Oncology|oncologist]] Dr Lawrence Gordon with a corpse between them holding a [[revolver]] and a [[microcassette]] recorder. Both men find a tape in their pockets, and Adam retrieves the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two [[hacksaw]]s inside the toilet, which they try to use to cut through their chains, but Adam's saw breaks. Lawrence realizes the saws are meant to be used on their feet, and identifies their captor as the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]], whom Lawrence knows of because he was once a suspect.\n\nFlashbacks reveal that Lawrence, while discussing the terminal brain cancer of a patient named John Kramer, was approached by Detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who found his penlight at the scene of one of Jigsaw's \"games\". Lawrence's alibi cleared him, but he agreed to view the testimony of [[heroin]] addict [[Amanda Young]], the only known survivor of one of Jigsaw's traps who believes the killer helped her.\n\nIn the present, Lawrence's wife Alison and daughter Diana are held captive at home as their captor watches Adam and Lawrence through a hidden camera. The house is simultaneously watched by Tapp, having been discharged from the police and becoming obsessed with the Jigsaw case, eventually finding Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from Amanda's game. There, he and Sing apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap. However, Jigsaw escaped after slashing Tapp's throat and Sing was killed by a shotgun trap. Convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp has continued to stalk him.\n\nIn the bathroom, Lawrence finds a box containing two cigarettes, a lighter, and a one-way cellphone, and recalls his abduction in a parking garage by a pig-masked figure. He and Adam stage Adam's death with a cigarette dipped in the corpse's poisoned blood, but the plan fails when Adam is electrically shocked through his ankle chain. Adam recalls his own abduction: in his photo development room when the power went out, he found [[Billy the Puppet|a puppet]] and was attacked by the same pig-masked figure. Alison calls Lawrence at gunpoint and tells him not to trust Adam, who admits that he was paid to take photos of Lawrence, many of which were in the bag containing the hacksaws. Adam reveals his knowledge of Lawrence's affair with one of his medical students, whom he had visited the night he was abducted; revealing why Lawrence is being \"tested\". After Adam describes the man who hired him, Lawrence realizes it was Tapp. Adam finds a photo he did not take, of a man staring out a window of Lawrence's house, whom Lawrence identifies as Zep, an orderly at his hospital. As the clock strikes six, Zep moves to kill Alison and Diana.\n\nAlison frees herself and fights Zep for his gun, after he calls Lawrence. The struggle attracts Tapp's attention, and he saves Alison and Diana and chases Zep to the sewers, where he is shot in the chest after a brief struggle. Lawrence, only aware of gunshots and screaming, is shocked and loses reach of the cellphone. In desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse's revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Lawrence according to \"the rules\", but Adam, having survived, bludgeons Zep to death with the toilet tank lid. As Lawrence crawls out of the room, Adam searches Zep's body for a key and finds another tape, which reveals that Zep was another victim following rules to obtain an antidote for a slow-acting poison he was given. As the tape ends, the corpse rises and is revealed to be John Kramer, the real Jigsaw Killer. He reveals that the key to Adam's chain went down the bathtub drain when Adam first woke up. Horrified, Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep's gun, but John shocks him with a remote. John shuts off the lights, and yells \"Game Over\" before sealing the door and leaving a helpless Adam to die.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n[[File:Shawnee Smith gfdl.png|thumb|upright|It took one day for [[Shawnee Smith]]'s scenes to be shot, which Wan described as \"physically taxing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/interview130.htm |title=The Arrow Interviews James Wan |last=Fallon |first=John |publisher=[[JoBlo.com]] |year=2004 |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323061516/http://www.joblo.com/arrow/interview130.htm |archivedate=March 23, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence \"Larry\" Gordon]]\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]]\n* [[Danny Glover]] as [[David Tapp]]\n* [[Monica Potter]] as [[List of Saw characters#Alison and Diana Gordon|Alison Gordon]]\n* [[Michael Emerson]] as [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]]\n* [[Ken Leung]] as [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Detective Steven Sing]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as [[List of Saw characters#Allison Kerry|Detective Allison Kerry]]\n* Mike Butters as [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]\n* [[Paul Gutrecht]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mark Wilson|Mark]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Makenzie Vega]] as [[List of Saw characters#Alison and Diana Gordon|Diana Gordon]]\n* [[Ned Bellamy]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Ridenhour|Jeff Ridenhour]]\n* [[Alexandra Bokyun Chun]] as [[List of Saw characters#Carla Song|Carla]]\n* [[Oren Koules]] as [[List of Saw characters#Donnie Greco|Donnie Greco]]\n* [[Benito Martinez (actor)|Benito Martinez]] as Brett\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:James Wan and Leigh Whannell Saw 3D premiere.jpg|thumb|left|Wan (left) and Whannell (right).]]\nAfter finishing film school, Australian director [[James Wan]] and Australian writer [[Leigh Whannell]] wanted to write and fund a film.<ref name=\"AVClub\">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/saw-creators-leigh-whannell-and-james-wan,46975/ |title=Saw creators Leigh Whannell and James Wan |last=Tobias |first=Scott |work=[[The A.V.

By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, \"I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'.\"<ref name=\"SawRevisted\" /> Before instantaneously writing the word \"Saw\" in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. \"It was one of those moments that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be.

I mean, ''Seven'' is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt ''Seven'' was that close to our film. I guess if you stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo ''Seven''. What we always liked about ''Saw'', though, was the fact that the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see.\"<ref name=\"TheArrowWhannell\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'s}} Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to ''Seven'' saying, \"In a blatant imitation of ''Seven'', ''Saw'' features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing.\"<ref name=\"EWReview\" /> Richard J. Leskosky of [[Champaign\u2013Urbana metropolitan area|Champaign-Urbana]]'s ''The News-Gazette'' said \"''Saw'' wants to be taken as another ''Seven''. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Improbable ' Saw ' surprises, but still not worth a see |last=J.

In light of its measly $1.2 million price tag the film's quality relative to bigger-budget horror films is striking. It also takes itself seriously, which came as a breath of fresh air following the trend of wimpy tongue-in-cheek horror that had dominated the multiplexes post-''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]''.

It is the seventh installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], and [[Cary Elwes]].\n\nThe film focuses on a man who falsely claims to be a Jigsaw survivor, becoming a local celebrity. However, he soon finds himself part of a real Jigsaw game where he must ultimately save his wife. Meanwhile, [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]] reveals to an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs officer]] that rogue [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]] is the man responsible for the recent Jigsaw games, and Hoffman hunts her down.\n\nAn eighth installment<!-- Not the same eighth installment as \"Jigsaw\" (2017 film). --> was planned, but the decrease in the [[Saw VI#Box office|box office performance for ''Saw VI'']] compared to previous installments led to ''Saw 3D'' being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for ''Saw VIII'' being incorporated into ''Saw 3D''. ''[[Saw V]]'' director [[David Hackl]] was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] announced that Greutert, who directed the sixth film, would direct. [[Principal photography]] took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D digital camera system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in [[post-production]].\n\n''Saw 3D'' was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on October 22, 2010, by Lionsgate, but was pushed back a week from its original release date of October 22, 2010, to October 29, 2010; it was released a day earlier in the United Kingdom and Australia. ''Saw 3D'' opened at number one making over $22.5 million. It was eventually followed by an eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nTwo men, Brad and Ryan, awaken in a Metropolitan Storefront, bound at the wrists to opposite sides of a worktable with a circular saw in front of each of them. Their mutual lover, Dina, is suspended above a third saw, and [[Billy the Puppet|Jigsaw's puppet]] informs the men that Dina has been manipulating both of them, driving them into criminal activity to fulfill her material desires. They are given a choice \u2014 either Brad or Ryan can be killed, or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut by the saw. However, Ryan notices Dina is only cheering for whoever's winning, making him realize she's only using them, so he makes peace with Brad, and they allow Dina to die instead.\n\nAfter witnessing [[Mark Hoffman]]'s survival and being attacked, Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an internal affairs detective from the precinct where he works, and incriminates him in exchange for protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman for years, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang \u2014 Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara \u2014 and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including [[Saw (2004 film)|Lawrence Gordon]], who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a [[self-help]] guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying a story of his own survival. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Bobby awakens in a cage in an abandoned asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Bobby's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist; Suzanne, his lawyer; and Cale, his best friend and co-conspirator, all in separate traps representing the [[three wise monkeys]] and all of them are killed despite his efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Bobby finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap he claimed to have survived: he must drive two hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a [[brazen bull]] capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.\n\nGibson eventually discovers the game's location and sends a [[SWAT]] team, who are sealed in another room and killed by toxic gas. Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse sitting in front of several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic [[turret gun]] rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her jaws apart.\n\nAfter destroying his workshop, Hoffman is attacked and subdued by three pig-masked figures, one of whom is Lawrence Gordon. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Gordon has assisted him ever since.

The storyline for a ''Saw VIII'' was combined into ''Saw VII''; this decision was primarily due to [[Saw VI#Box office|''Saw VI''{{'s}} below average box office performance]].<ref name=\"SawVIII\"/><ref name=\"QA With Patrick Melton\"/>  On July&nbsp;22, 2010, in an interview with ''[[USA Today]]'' the producers confirmed that ''Saw VII'' will officially end the film series.<ref name=\"usatoday\"/> Burg told [[Reuters]] that, \"In every ''Saw'' movie, we left questions open and in ''Saw VII'' we answer every question the audience has ever had\".

Melton explained that, \"He has a lot of ideas, but it's a bit hard and extreme to implement all of these ideas because sets have been built, people have been cast, props have been bought or created, and with the ''Saw'' films they are so specific in set design because of the traps. It becomes very problematic and difficult to change things a whole bunch right in the middle of it\".<ref name=\"Patrick Melton Talks The Collector 2\"/>\n\n''Saw 3D'' was originally intended to be two separate films. According to Melton and Dunstan, \"It was our original intention to make the final ''Saw'' in two parts, but when ''[Saw] VI'' didn't do so well, the studio got nervous and we were only allowed to make one more.\"<ref name=\"2Parts\">http://bloody-disgusting.com/exclusives/3404119/previous-saw-entry-supposed-split-two-exclusive/</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{see also|List of Saw characters}}\n[[File:Gina Holden Elizabeth Rowin Saw 3D premiere cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Gina Holden]] (Joyce) at the film's premiere.]]\n<!-- NOTE: It's from David Hackl's OFFICIAL twitter feed.

Before choosing 3D, Burg and others viewed a minute of the original ''Saw'' film rendered in 3D and were pleased, which led to them choosing 3D for the seventh film.<ref name=\"Collider\"/>  The sets and traps were designed to take advantage of 3D.<ref name=\"IGN Interview about 3D\"/> To continue the fast pace of the previous films, the SI-3D cameras' light weight allowed three-quarters of film to be shot [[Hand-held camera|handheld]]. ''Saw 3D'' was Greutert's first time directing a 3D film. He said in an interview with ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' that composing a shot in 3D was tricky compared to 2D; he explained, \"If you've got both cameras looking at a subject and there's a very bright sheen on the side of the person's arm that only one camera can see, there's a good chance that when you look at a composite of the two images that sheen will not register in 3D space. It looks like a mistake. These things aren't an issue at all in 2D but in 3D are obsessively problematic\".<ref name=\"PopularMechanics\"/> Given the cost of filming in 3D, Greutert said the budget was $17 million, the most expensive of the series.<ref name=\"budget\"/> [[Principal photography]] began on February 8, 2010, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and wrapped on April 12, 2010.<ref name=\"bd7\"/><ref name=\"Saw VII Wraps\"/> Filming took place mostly at Toronto's [[Cinespace Film Studios]].<ref name=\"Cinespace\"/>\n\n[[File:Kevin Greutert and Elizabeth Rowin at Comic Con 2010.jpg|thumb|left|''Saw 3D'' director Kevin Greutert and his wife, actress Elizabeth Rowin, at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2010.]]\nWhen determining the style of 3D shooting they wanted to use, Burg felt that the audience would want several moments where objects move into the audience, comparing this to ''[[My Bloody Valentine 3D]]''. He acknowledged that this method would be used, but expressed an interest in shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of [[first-person shooter]] video games being rendered in 3D.<ref name=\"Collider\"/> Dunstan added that \"It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments. We've had a very flat surface to try to get a reaction out of you. Now, we get to push out a bit and envelop the viewer, still maintaining the patterns that have worked and been successful, but also to raise it up a notch.\"<ref name=\"Collider\"/>  Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an \"interesting experience\".<ref name= \"Tobin\" /> Mandylor called the 3D shoot \"more tedious and longer\".<ref name=\"pressUK\"/> Flannery described the 3D aspect as being \"[not] shot in 3D so that you can, per&nbsp;se, see blood coming directly at you. It's in 3D for the texture and the depth, for the architecture, to get a sense that you're in the scene but there's no 'we want to see blood coming at the lens' it's nothing like that.

They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary!

Online|E! Online]]'' gave the film a \"B\". He called the film's gore \"over-the-top\" and \"in your face\" while admitting the film had an \"unusual amount of self-parody\". He said the central storyline of the films was beginning to feel \"played out\".<ref name=\"E! Review Oct28\"/> Rob Nelson of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review. He called the film \"relentlessly repugnant\" that would please fans, but offer no surprise. He went on to say, \"Apart from these limb-pulling setpieces, tech credits appear fairly shoddy, as do any 3D effects that don't include flying viscera. The editing relies on lazy flashbacks, while the dialogue remains as horrific as the killings.\"<ref name=\"Variety review Oct28\"/>  Kim Newman of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film two out of five stars, calling it \"a step down from last year's much more pointed ''[[Saw VI]]''\". He criticized the repetition of the plot but thought bringing back Jigsaw survivors was a \"nice idea\". He closed his review with, \"There are a scattering of infallibly cringe-making horrors, but on the whole ''Saw 3D'' could do with more depth\".<ref name=\"EmpireReview Oct28\"/>\n\nEric Goldman of [[IGN|IGN Movies]] gave the film two out of five stars. He was unhappy with the little screen time Bell and Elwes had been given, saying that the time the film did spend with them didn't have much impact. He said the traps were a step down from ''Saw VI'', but did point out his favorite and highlight of the film as the \"garage trap\". About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said \"The 3D is used as you might expect it to be \u2013 which is to say, this is no [[James Cameron]] immersive experience. Instead, blades jut out of the screen, and there is some fun had with blood and guts literally shooting forward at several points\".<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>  Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a mixed review. He said ''Saw 3D'' is \"consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions\", but said most of the film's traps lack the \"[[Rube Goldberg]]-style cleverness that marked the series\".  Scheck went on to say that it was \"unfortunate\" the creators killed Bell's character so early in the series and called Mandylor's character (Hoffman) an \"exceedingly bland stand-in\". He called the visual impact of the 3D \"negligible\".<ref name=\"THRreviewOct29\"/> \n[[File:James Wan and Leigh Whannell Saw 3D premiere.jpg|thumb|right|Creators of the ''Saw'' franchise, [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]] at the premiere.]]\n\nRoger Moore of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' gave the film one out of five stars saying, \"It's all bunk and has been for years. These are all no-win scenarios. Whatever moral lessons were presented in the earliest ''Saw'' films seem to have been dispensed with as the movies grow more and more gruesome, with filmmakers caught up in 'What would it look like if somebody's jaw was ripped out, or their skin was glued to a car seat?' Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise\".<ref name=\"Orlando Sentinel Oct28\"/>  Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film the most \"straightforward\" of the series and the \"most consistently (though not inventively) violent\". He ended his review saying, \"If you see the film in a theater equipped with [[RealD 3D]] and [[Dolby Digital|Dolby sound]], you'll come away with a pretty good idea of what it would feel like to have flying body parts hit you in the face\".<ref name=\"NYTreviewOct29\"/> \n[[File:Cary Elwes Saw 3D premiere cropped.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Cary Elwes|Elwes]] reprises his role as [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], last seen in the [[Saw (2004 film)|first film]], in newly filmed scenes as opposed to flashbacks or [[Stock footage|archive footage]].]]\nElizabeth Weitzman of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave the film one out of five stars. She criticized the lack of Bell's screentime saying, \"What the filmmakers of the last four ''Saw'' movies have somehow overlooked is that Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is the linchpin of these films. It's right there in the title, so you'd think they'd realize what they lost when they killed him off in ''Saw III''. But it's been downhill ever since, and we hit bottom today\". She admitted that the performances have become \"painfully stilted\" and called the script \"a jumble of nothing punctuated by barely-trying death traps\". She went on to say, \"It's also disappointing to watch a once-original franchise morph into a generic slasher series, in which random people are killed in banal ways just to up the body count\" and closed her review with, \"No matter how much money ''The Final Chapter'' makes over Halloween weekend, it's time to acknowledge that this game is over\".<ref name=\"NYDailyreviewOct29\"/>\n\n[[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called the film the \"most gruesome and least coherent of the seven movies\". He felt that some of the film's \"games\" were just randomly forced into the film, saying that kind of \"episodic approach\" and 3D works for a \"far more innovative series like ''[[Jackass 3D]]''\".  Morris closed his review by saying \"This alleged final edition trashes the perverse morality of [Jigsaw's] legacy to make him the [[Jerry Springer]] of gore\".<ref name=\"BostonReviewOct30\"/> Jason Anderson of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' gave the film two out of four stars.  He praised ''Saw 3D''{{'}}s plot for not being as confusing as previous films, for which he described as having to \"generally require an encyclopedic knowledge of the series' many plot strands\" in order to understand them. He thought Greutert gave the film a \"pulpy energy\" and described the film's traps and gore as having an \"unpretentious sensibility\" to films by [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]].<ref name=\"TorontoStarOct30\"/> Alan Jones of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' gave the film four out of five stars saying, \"though the film initially borders on parody, once the ever-ingenious trapping begins \u2013 using fishhooks, superglue, ovens and dental equipment \u2013 the chills run on turbo drive right through to the greatest hits flashback finale\". He implied that the \"shock scenarios\" were borrowed from sources such as, ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' and the work of [[Lucio Fulci]]. Jones said the 3D did not add to the experience saying \"the CGI blood splatter something of a distraction to the almost Shakespearean crescendo of anguish and carnage\".<ref name=\"RadioTimes\"/> The film was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] for \"Worst Eye-Gouging Misuse of 3D\", but it lost to ''[[The Last Airbender]]''.\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Jigsaw (2017 film)}}\nAlthough ''Saw 3D'' was intended to be the finale for the film series,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bowles|first1=Scott|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|website=USA Today|accessdate=18 February 2016}}</ref> it was reported in February 2016 that an eighth film under the working title ''Saw: Legacy'' was being developed.

It is the seventh installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], and [[Cary Elwes]].\n\nThe film focuses on a man who falsely claims to be a Jigsaw survivor, becoming a local celebrity. However, he soon finds himself part of a real Jigsaw game where he must ultimately save his wife. Meanwhile, [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]] reveals to an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs officer]] that rogue [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]] is the man responsible for the recent Jigsaw games, and Hoffman hunts her down.\n\nAn eighth installment<!-- Not the same eighth installment as \"Jigsaw\" (2017 film). --> was planned, but the decrease in the [[Saw VI#Box office|box office performance for ''Saw VI'']] compared to previous installments led to ''Saw 3D'' being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for ''Saw VIII'' being incorporated into ''Saw 3D''. ''[[Saw V]]'' director [[David Hackl]] was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] announced that Greutert, who directed the sixth film, would direct. [[Principal photography]] took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D digital camera system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in [[post-production]].\n\n''Saw 3D'' was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on October 22, 2010, by Lionsgate, but was pushed back a week from its original release date of October 22, 2010, to October 29, 2010; it was released a day earlier in the United Kingdom and Australia. ''Saw 3D'' opened at number one making over $22.5 million. It was eventually followed by an eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nTwo men, Brad and Ryan, awaken in a Metropolitan Storefront, bound at the wrists to opposite sides of a worktable with a circular saw in front of each of them. Their mutual lover, Dina, is suspended above a third saw, and [[Billy the Puppet|Jigsaw's puppet]] informs the men that Dina has been manipulating both of them, driving them into criminal activity to fulfill her material desires. They are given a choice \u2014 either Brad or Ryan can be killed, or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut by the saw. However, Ryan notices Dina is only cheering for whoever's winning, making him realize she's only using them, so he makes peace with Brad, and they allow Dina to die instead.\n\nAfter witnessing [[Mark Hoffman]]'s survival and being attacked, Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an internal affairs detective from the precinct where he works, and incriminates him in exchange for protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman for years, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang \u2014 Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara \u2014 and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including [[Saw (2004 film)|Lawrence Gordon]], who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a [[self-help]] guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying a story of his own survival. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Bobby awakens in a cage in an abandoned asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Bobby's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist; Suzanne, his lawyer; and Cale, his best friend and co-conspirator, all in separate traps representing the [[three wise monkeys]] and all of them are killed despite his efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Bobby finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap he claimed to have survived: he must drive two hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a [[brazen bull]] capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.\n\nGibson eventually discovers the game's location and sends a [[SWAT]] team, who are sealed in another room and killed by toxic gas. Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse sitting in front of several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic [[turret gun]] rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her jaws apart.\n\nAfter destroying his workshop, Hoffman is attacked and subdued by three pig-masked figures, one of whom is Lawrence Gordon. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Gordon has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, which contained a videotape, in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. As a result, Gordon has Hoffman brought to the bathroom from the first film and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. When Hoffman tries to reach for the [[hacksaw]] used to sever Gordon's leg, in an effort to escape, Gordon throws it out of the room, turns off the lights and yells \"Game Over\", before sealing the door, leaving Hoffman to die.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]]\n* [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] as [[List of Saw characters#Bobby Dagen|Bobby \nDagen]]\n* [[Chad Donella]] as [[List of Saw characters#Matt Gibson|Detective Matt Gibson]]\n* [[Gina Holden]] as [[List of Saw characters#Joyce Dagen|Joyce Dagen]]\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer/Jigsaw]]\n* Laurence Anthony as [[List of Saw characters#Rogers|Rogers]]\n* [[Dean Armstrong]] as [[List of Saw characters#Cale|Cale]]\n* [[Naomi Snieckus]] as [[List of Saw characters#Nina|Nina]]\n* Rebecca Marshall as [[List of Saw characters#Suzanne|Suzanne]]\n* James Van Patten as [[List of Saw characters#Adam Heffner|Dr. Heffner]]\n* [[Sebastian Pigott]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Brad]]\n* [[Jon Cor]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Ryan]]\n* Anne Greene as  [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Dina]]\n* [[Chester Bennington]] as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Evan]]\n* Dru Viergever as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Dan]]\n* [[Gabby West]] as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Kara]]\n* Benjamin Clost as [[List of Saw characters#Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara|Jake]]\n* [[Olunik\u00e9 Adeliyi]] as [[List of Saw characters#Sidney|Sidney]]\n* [[Ishan Morris|Ish Morris]] as Alex\n* [[Tanedra Howard]] as [[List of Saw characters#Simone|Simone]]\n* [[Shauna MacDonald]] as [[List of Saw characters#Brent and Tara Abbott|Tara Abbott]]\n* Janelle Hutchison as [[List of Saw characters#Addy and Allen|Addy]]\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mallick|Mallick]]\n* Larissa Gomes as [[List of Saw characters#Carousel Room Victims|Emily]]\n* Kevin Rushton as [[List of Saw characters#Trevor|Trevor]]\n* [[Noam Jenkins]] as [[List of Saw characters#Michael Marks|Michael Marks]]\n* [[Carlos D\u00edaz (actor)|Carlos D\u00edaz]] as Coroner Worker\n* [[Rachel Wilson]] as Mother\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Saw VII filming Metro Hall Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|A scene being constructed at the [[Metro Hall]] of Toronto in April 2010.]]\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported in July 2009 that [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] [[Green-light|greenlit]] ''Saw VII'' and announced [[David Hackl]] would return to direct, his last film being ''[[Saw V]]''.

The storyline for a ''Saw VIII'' was combined into ''Saw VII''; this decision was primarily due to [[Saw VI#Box office|''Saw VI''{{'s}} below average box office performance]].<ref name=\"SawVIII\"/><ref name=\"QA With Patrick Melton\"/>  On July&nbsp;22, 2010, in an interview with ''[[USA Today]]'' the producers confirmed that ''Saw VII'' will officially end the film series.<ref name=\"usatoday\"/> Burg told [[Reuters]] that, \"In every ''Saw'' movie, we left questions open and in ''Saw VII'' we answer every question the audience has ever had\". He added that, \"even new viewers will be able to follow and get caught up to speed\".<ref name=\"reuters\"/>\n\nIn January 2010, [[Kevin Greutert]], who made his directorial debut with the sixth film, was about to begin work on [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s ''[[Paranormal Activity 2]]'' when [[Twisted Pictures]] suddenly dismissed Hackl and forced Greutert on the project by exercising a \"contractual clause\" in his contract, much to Greutert's dismay.<ref name=\"Greutert director\"/><ref name=\"LAtimes\"/><ref name=\"bd6\" /><ref name=\"bd6-2\" /> When Greutert arrived on set two weeks before filming began, he performed a \"compressive re-write\" of the script.  Melton explained that, \"He has a lot of ideas, but it's a bit hard and extreme to implement all of these ideas because sets have been built, people have been cast, props have been bought or created, and with the ''Saw'' films they are so specific in set design because of the traps. It becomes very problematic and difficult to change things a whole bunch right in the middle of it\".<ref name=\"Patrick Melton Talks The Collector 2\"/>\n\n''Saw 3D'' was originally intended to be two separate films.

Before choosing 3D, Burg and others viewed a minute of the original ''Saw'' film rendered in 3D and were pleased, which led to them choosing 3D for the seventh film.<ref name=\"Collider\"/>  The sets and traps were designed to take advantage of 3D.<ref name=\"IGN Interview about 3D\"/> To continue the fast pace of the previous films, the SI-3D cameras' light weight allowed three-quarters of film to be shot [[Hand-held camera|handheld]]. ''Saw 3D'' was Greutert's first time directing a 3D film. He said in an interview with ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' that composing a shot in 3D was tricky compared to 2D; he explained, \"If you've got both cameras looking at a subject and there's a very bright sheen on the side of the person's arm that only one camera can see, there's a good chance that when you look at a composite of the two images that sheen will not register in 3D space. It looks like a mistake. These things aren't an issue at all in 2D but in 3D are obsessively problematic\".<ref name=\"PopularMechanics\"/> Given the cost of filming in 3D, Greutert said the budget was $17 million, the most expensive of the series.<ref name=\"budget\"/> [[Principal photography]] began on February 8, 2010, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and wrapped on April 12, 2010.<ref name=\"bd7\"/><ref name=\"Saw VII Wraps\"/> Filming took place mostly at Toronto's [[Cinespace Film Studios]].<ref name=\"Cinespace\"/>\n\n[[File:Kevin Greutert and Elizabeth Rowin at Comic Con 2010.jpg|thumb|left|''Saw 3D'' director Kevin Greutert and his wife, actress Elizabeth Rowin, at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2010.]]\nWhen determining the style of 3D shooting they wanted to use, Burg felt that the audience would want several moments where objects move into the audience, comparing this to ''[[My Bloody Valentine 3D]]''. He acknowledged that this method would be used, but expressed an interest in shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of [[first-person shooter]] video games being rendered in 3D.<ref name=\"Collider\"/> Dunstan added that \"It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments. We've had a very flat surface to try to get a reaction out of you. Now, we get to push out a bit and envelop the viewer, still maintaining the patterns that have worked and been successful, but also to raise it up a notch.\"<ref name=\"Collider\"/>  Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an \"interesting experience\".<ref name= \"Tobin\" /> Mandylor called the 3D shoot \"more tedious and longer\".<ref name=\"pressUK\"/> Flannery described the 3D aspect as being \"[not] shot in 3D so that you can, per&nbsp;se, see blood coming directly at you. It's in 3D for the texture and the depth, for the architecture, to get a sense that you're in the scene but there's no 'we want to see blood coming at the lens' it's nothing like that.

About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said \"The 3D is used as you might expect it to be \u2013 which is to say, this is no [[James Cameron]] immersive experience.

She went on to say, \"It's also disappointing to watch a once-original franchise morph into a generic slasher series, in which random people are killed in banal ways just to up the body count\" and closed her review with, \"No matter how much money ''The Final Chapter'' makes over Halloween weekend, it's time to acknowledge that this game is over\".<ref name=\"NYDailyreviewOct29\"/>\n\n[[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called the film the \"most gruesome and least coherent of the seven movies\".

Morris closed his review by saying \"This alleged final edition trashes the perverse morality of [Jigsaw's] legacy to make him the [[Jerry Springer]] of gore\".<ref name=\"BostonReviewOct30\"/> Jason Anderson of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' gave the film two out of four stars.  He praised ''Saw 3D''{{'}}s plot for not being as confusing as previous films, for which he described as having to \"generally require an encyclopedic knowledge of the series' many plot strands\" in order to understand them. He thought Greutert gave the film a \"pulpy energy\" and described the film's traps and gore as having an \"unpretentious sensibility\" to films by [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]].<ref name=\"TorontoStarOct30\"/> Alan Jones of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' gave the film four out of five stars saying, \"though the film initially borders on parody, once the ever-ingenious trapping begins \u2013 using fishhooks, superglue, ovens and dental equipment \u2013 the chills run on turbo drive right through to the greatest hits flashback finale\". He implied that the \"shock scenarios\" were borrowed from sources such as, ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' and the work of [[Lucio Fulci]]. Jones said the 3D did not add to the experience saying \"the CGI blood splatter something of a distraction to the almost Shakespearean crescendo of anguish and carnage\".<ref name=\"RadioTimes\"/> The film was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] for \"Worst Eye-Gouging Misuse of 3D\", but it lost to ''[[The Last Airbender]]''.\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Jigsaw (2017 film)}}\nAlthough ''Saw 3D'' was intended to be the finale for the film series,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bowles|first1=Scott|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|website=USA Today|accessdate=18 February 2016}}</ref> it was reported in February 2016 that an eighth film under the working title ''Saw: Legacy'' was being developed.

It is the second installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Donnie Wahlberg]], [[Tobin Bell]], [[Shawnee Smith]], [[Erik Knudsen]], [[Franky G]], [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]], [[Glenn Plummer]], [[Beverly Mitchell]], and [[Dina Meyer]].\n\nThe film features [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]] being apprehended by the police, but trapping the arresting officer in one of his own games while showing another game of eight people \u2014 including the officer's son \u2014 in progress on TV monitors at another location. It also explores some of John Kramer's backstory, providing a partial explanation of his reason for becoming Jigsaw.\n\nAfter the financial success of 2004's ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', a sequel was immediately green-lit. Leigh Whannell and [[James Wan]] were busy preparing for their next film and were unable to write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called ''The Desperate'' before ''Saw'' was released and was looking for a producer but many studios rejected it. [[Gregg Hoffman]] received the script and showed it to his partners [[Mark Burg]] and [[Oren Koules]]. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into ''Saw II''. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.\n\n''Saw II'' was released in the United States on October 28, 2005, by [[Lions Gate Films]]. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film was a financial success. It opened with $31.9 million and grossed $88 million in the United States and Canada. It has remained the highest grossing ''Saw'' film in those countries. Bell was nominated for \"Best Villain\" at the [[2006 MTV Movie Awards]] for his role as Jigsaw in the film. ''Saw II'' was released to [[DVD]] on February 14, 2006, and topped charts its first week, selling more than 3 million units. At the time, it was the fastest-selling theatrical DVD in Lions Gate's history. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw III]]'', was released in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=July 2019}}\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nInformant Michael Marks awakens in a room with a spike-filled mask locked around his neck. A videotape informs him that in order to unlock the device, he must cut into his eye to obtain the key. He sets off the timer and finds the scalpel, but cannot bring himself to retrieve the key and is killed after sixty seconds when the mask closes.\n\nAt the scene of Michael's game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]], and calls him in. Despite not wanting to be involved in the case, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Officer Daniel Rigg in leading a [[SWAT]] team to the factory, which produced the lock from Michael's trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]], who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; including his only known survivor [[Amanda Young]], and Eric's estranged son Daniel. The other victims are Xavier, Gus, Jonas, Laura, Addison, and Obi. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them all within two hours, but John assures Eric that if he follows the rules of his own game, by simply talking with John, he will see Daniel again. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.\n\nThe victims are informed by a microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; one is in the room's safe, and they have the combination with the \"numbers in the back of their mind\". Xavier ignores a warning note and uses the key provided with the cassette on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole as Gus looks through it, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the door opens, but with no success. After discovering a door, the group travel to the basement where Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes. He inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes as well. In another room, Xavier's test is to go into a pit full of needles and retrieve the key to the door in two minutes, but he instead throws Amanda into the pit and forces her to do it. Pressured, she searches through the needle pit until finally retrieving the key, which she gives to Xavier, but he runs out of time to unlock the door containing the antidote. Throughout the game, the victims discuss connections between them and determine that each has been incarcerated before, excluding Daniel.\n\nMeanwhile, John passes the time with both idle and cryptic chat, eventually telling Eric that his survival of a suicide attempt after his diagnosis is the true reason for his games. Then, he destroys several of John's documents and sketches at Kerry's suggestion, but fails to provoke John. As the tech team arrives, John reveals the connection between the victims: Eric has framed all of them for various crimes.\n\nHaving left the others, Xavier returns to the safe room and finds a colored number on the back of Gus' neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent and dies; after finding the clue revealing Daniel's identity, Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box containing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades. Xavier enters the room, reads Addison\u2019s number, and leaves her to die. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room, which leads to the bathroom from [[Saw (2004 film)|the first film]]. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he cannot read his own number, so he cuts a piece of the back of his neck off. As he approaches Amanda as an attempt to kill her, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps in the way and slashes his throat with a hacksaw, killing him.\n\nHaving seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John and forces him to lead him to the house. John's sitting area is revealed to be an elevator, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place \"before\" they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe, and a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda suddenly appears in the doorway, and yells \"Game Over\" before sealing the door, leaving Eric to die.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Erik Knudsen]] as [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]\n* [[Franky G]] as [[List of Saw characters#Xavier Chavez|Xavier]]\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jonas Singer|Jonas]]\n* [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] as [[List of Saw characters#Addison Corday|Addison]]\n* [[Beverley Mitchell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Laura Hunter|Laura]]\n* Timothy Burd as [[List of Saw characters#Obi Tate|Obi]]\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as [[Allison Kerry|Detective Allison Kerry]]\n* [[Lyriq Bent]] as [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]]\n* Noam Jenkins as [[List of Saw characters#Michael Marks|Michael Marks]]\n* Tony Nappo as [[List of Saw characters#Gus Colyard|Gus]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:Saw two banned poster.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The original teaser poster showing two bloody severed fingers that was banned by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].]]\n''Saw II'' was immediately [[Green-light|green-lit]] after ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]''{{'}}s successful opening weekend a year earlier.<ref name=\"IGNFeb2005\">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/586/586613p1.html |title=IGN Interviews James Wan and Leigh Whannell |last=Otto |first=Jeff |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212164031/http://movies.ign.com/articles/586/586613p1.html |archivedate=February 12, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Producers needed a script for a sequel <ref name=\"FilmMonthly\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/Profiles/Articles/LeighWhannell/LeighWhannell.html \n |title=Leigh Returns to the Saw \n |last=Fischer \n |first=Paul \n |work=Film Monthly \n |date=October 26, 2005 \n |accessdate=August 22, 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617eiopaX \n |archivedate=August 22, 2011 \n |url-status=live \n}}</ref> but [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]], director and writer of ''Saw'', were working on [[Universal Pictures]]'s ''[[Dead Silence]]''.

In order for this to be done safely, four people, over a period of four days, removed the needle tips from syringes and replaced them with fiber optic tips. They modified a total of 120,000 fake needles. However, this number was insufficient and the pit had to be filled with styrofoam and other materials to make it appear to have more needles. The needles that were apparently stuck into Smith were actually blunted syringes stuck into padding under her clothing. For certain shots, a fake arm was used.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[David Hackl]] (production designer), Jim Murray (property master), Darren Lynn Bousman (writer/director) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Needle Pit |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Darren Lynn Bousman CC.JPG|thumb|right|''Saw II'' was Bousman's first feature film.]]\nBousman came up with an idea whereby a character's hands would get stuck in some sort of vessel and this resulted in the \"Hand Trap\". It proved to be a challenge but after much discussion, Hackl, property master Jim Murray and art director Michele Brady came up with a suitable design. They arranged a glass box suspended by chains from the ceiling which contained a hypodermic needle with the antidote and which had two hand-holes on the underside. As soon as Vaugier's character Addison put her hands into the holes razor blades would close in on her hands and any attempt to withdraw from the trap would cause her to bleed to death. In order for the trap to be used safely, the prop builders made the handcuffs move inside the box and fake blades that would retract from the actress's hands, thus allowing her to slide her hands out. Hackl subsequently commented that the character did not have to put her hands into the trap as there was a lock with a key on the other side box that would have opened the contraption.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://machinedesign.com/article/how-to-engineer-a-nightmare-1023 |title=How to Engineer a Nightmare |last=Shapiro |first=Jessica |journal=[[Machine Design]] |volume=80 |issue=20 |pages=22\u201323 |date=October 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62GdveX3S |archivedate=October 7, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite video |people=David Hackl (production designer) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Hand Trap |medium=DVD |publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe original idea for the \"Furnace Trap\" came from the house having been a [[Crematory|crematorium]] at some point, but this would have involved turning the house into a funeral parlor, so it was instead decided that the furnace would be part of the house's boiler system. The furnace was visualized in the form of a computer model so that Bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed. Using the computer model as a guide, the furnace was constructed in three days using cement board and tin with removable sides and top so Timothy Burd (Obi) could be filmed crawling inside. The furnace produced real flames and, in place of Burd, a stunt man using a fire retardant gel crawled into the fire.<ref>{{cite video |people=David Hackl (production designer) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Furnace |medium=DVD |publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums -->\n| name         = Saw II: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        =\n| caption      ={{deletable image-caption|Wednesday, 13 November 2019|PROD}}\n| alt          = \n| released     = {{Start date|2005|10|25}}\n| recorded     = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = {{hlist|[[Industrial metal]]|[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]|[[alternative metal]]|[[nu metal]]}}\n| length       = {{Duration|m=54|s=46}}\n| label        = [[Image Entertainment]]\n| producer     = {{hlist|[[Mark Burg]] <small>([[Executive producer|{{abbr|exec.|executive producer}}]])</small>|[[Gregg Hoffman]] <small>(exec.)</small>|[[Oren Koules]] <small>(exec.)</small>|Jonathan Platt|Jonathan Scott Miller|Martin Shore|Stu Song}}\n| prev_title   = [[Saw (soundtrack)|Saw: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]\n| prev_year    = 2004\n| next_title   = [[Saw III (soundtrack)|Saw III: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]\n| next_year    = 2006\n| misc         = \n}}\nThe ''Saw II'' soundtrack was released on October 25, 2005 by [[RLJE Films|Image Entertainment]].<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> The video for \"[[Forget to Remember]]\" was also directed by Bousman.<ref>{{cite video|title=Saw II Commentary|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]|people=Darren Lynn Bousman, Donnie Wahlberg and Beverly Mitchell|date=2006 | accessdate=August 26, 2011|time=1:29:11\u2013 1:29:13}}</ref>\n\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = \n| extra_column = Artist\n| title1 = Irresponsible Hate Anthem (Venus Head Trap Mix)\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Scott Putesky|Daisy Berkowitz]]|[[Madonna Wayne Gacy]]|[[Marilyn Manson]]|[[Twiggy Ramirez]]}}\n| extra1 = [[Marilyn Manson]]\n| length1 = 3:39\n| title2 = Sound Effects and Overdramatics\n| writer2 = {{hlist|[[Quinn Allman]]|[[The Used|Jeph Howard]]|[[Bert McCracken]]|[[Branden Steineckert]]}}\n| extra2 = [[The Used]]\n| length2 = 3:28\n| title3 = [[Forget to Remember]]\n| writer3 = {{hlist|[[Chad Gray]]|[[Ryan Martinie]]|[[Matthew McDonough]]|[[Greg Tribbett]]}}\n| extra3 = [[Mudvayne]]\n| length3 = 3:33\n| title4 = September\n| writer4 = {{hlist|Chris Hamilton|Mike Kennedy|Nick Rowe|[[Hellyeah|Kyle Sanders]]|Tim Williams}}\n| extra4 = [[Bloodsimple]]\n| length4 = 3:38\n| title5 = Blood (Empty Promises)\n| writer5 = {{hlist|[[Papa Roach|Dave Buckner]]|[[Papa Roach|Tobin Esperance]]|[[Jerry Horton]]|[[Jacoby Shaddix]]}}\n| extra5 = [[Papa Roach]]\n| length5 = 2:56\n| title6 = REV 22:20 (REV 4:20 Mix)\n| writer6 = {{hlist|[[Maynard James Keenan]]|[[Danny Lohner]]}}\n| extra6 = [[Puscifer]]\n| length6 = 4:47\n| title7 = [[Next (Sevendust album)|Pieces]]\n| writer7 = [[Sevendust]]\n| extra7 = [[Sevendust]]\n| length7 = 3:06\n| title8 = Rodent (Ken \"Hiwatt\" Marshall/DDT Mix)\n| writer8 = {{hlist|[[Al Jourgensen]]|[[Skinny Puppy]]}}\n| extra8 = [[Skinny Puppy]]\n| length8 = 5:00\n| title9 = [[Burn the Witch (Queens of the Stone Age song)|Burn the Witch]] ([[Unkle|UNKLE]] Variation)\n| writer9 = {{hlist|[[Joey Castillo]]|[[Josh Homme]]|[[Troy Van Leeuwen]]}}\n| extra9 = [[Queens of the Stone Age]]\n| length9 = 3:04\n| title10 = Holy\n| writer10 = {{hlist|Shaun Bivens|Tony Providence|Allen Richardson}}\n| extra10 = [[A Band Called Pain]]\n| length10 = 3:43\n| title11 = [[Enter the Chicken#Three Fingers|Three Fingers]]\n| writer11 = {{hlist|Buckethead|[[Dan Monti]]|[[Saul Williams]]}}\n| extra11 = [[Buckethead|Buckethead and Friends]] & [[Saul Williams]]\n| length11 = 3:00\n| title12 = Home Invasion Robbery\n| writer12 = [[The Legion of Doom (mash up group)|The Legion of Doom]]\n| extra12 = [[The Legion of Doom (mash up group)|The Legion of Doom]]\n| length12 = 4:10\n| title13 = Caliente (Dark Entries)\n| writer13 = {{hlist|[[Daniel Ash]]|[[Kevin Haskins]]|[[David J]]|[[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]]}}\n| extra13 = [[Revolting Cocks]], [[Gibby Haynes]] & [[Al Jourgensen]]\n| length13 = 4:28\n| title14 = Step Up\n| writer14 = {{hlist|Andrew Gerold|[[Jim Kaufman]]|[[John Travis (producer)|John Travis]]|[[Ron Underwood (musician)|Ron Underwood]]}}\n| extra14 = [[Opiate for the Masses]]\n| length14 = 3:24\n| title15 = Don't Forget the Rules\n| writer15 = [[Charlie Clouser]]\n| extra15 = [[Charlie Clouser]]\n| length15 = 5:00\n| total_length = 54:46\n}}\n\n==Release==\n''Saw II'' was released in New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom on {{nowrap|October 28, 2005}}; and {{nowrap|November 17, 2005}} in Australia.

It is the second installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Donnie Wahlberg]], [[Tobin Bell]], [[Shawnee Smith]], [[Erik Knudsen]], [[Franky G]], [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]], [[Glenn Plummer]], [[Beverly Mitchell]], and [[Dina Meyer]].\n\nThe film features [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]] being apprehended by the police, but trapping the arresting officer in one of his own games while showing another game of eight people \u2014 including the officer's son \u2014 in progress on TV monitors at another location. It also explores some of John Kramer's backstory, providing a partial explanation of his reason for becoming Jigsaw.\n\nAfter the financial success of 2004's ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', a sequel was immediately green-lit. Leigh Whannell and [[James Wan]] were busy preparing for their next film and were unable to write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called ''The Desperate'' before ''Saw'' was released and was looking for a producer but many studios rejected it. [[Gregg Hoffman]] received the script and showed it to his partners [[Mark Burg]] and [[Oren Koules]]. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into ''Saw II''. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.\n\n''Saw II'' was released in the United States on October 28, 2005, by [[Lions Gate Films]]. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film was a financial success. It opened with $31.9 million and grossed $88 million in the United States and Canada. It has remained the highest grossing ''Saw'' film in those countries. Bell was nominated for \"Best Villain\" at the [[2006 MTV Movie Awards]] for his role as Jigsaw in the film. ''Saw II'' was released to [[DVD]] on February 14, 2006, and topped charts its first week, selling more than 3 million units. At the time, it was the fastest-selling theatrical DVD in Lions Gate's history. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw III]]'', was released in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=July 2019}}\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nInformant Michael Marks awakens in a room with a spike-filled mask locked around his neck. A videotape informs him that in order to unlock the device, he must cut into his eye to obtain the key. He sets off the timer and finds the scalpel, but cannot bring himself to retrieve the key and is killed after sixty seconds when the mask closes.\n\nAt the scene of Michael's game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]], and calls him in. Despite not wanting to be involved in the case, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Officer Daniel Rigg in leading a [[SWAT]] team to the factory, which produced the lock from Michael's trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]], who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; including his only known survivor [[Amanda Young]], and Eric's estranged son Daniel. The other victims are Xavier, Gus, Jonas, Laura, Addison, and Obi. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them all within two hours, but John assures Eric that if he follows the rules of his own game, by simply talking with John, he will see Daniel again. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.\n\nThe victims are informed by a microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; one is in the room's safe, and they have the combination with the \"numbers in the back of their mind\". Xavier ignores a warning note and uses the key provided with the cassette on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole as Gus looks through it, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the door opens, but with no success. After discovering a door, the group travel to the basement where Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes. He inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes as well. In another room, Xavier's test is to go into a pit full of needles and retrieve the key to the door in two minutes, but he instead throws Amanda into the pit and forces her to do it. Pressured, she searches through the needle pit until finally retrieving the key, which she gives to Xavier, but he runs out of time to unlock the door containing the antidote. Throughout the game, the victims discuss connections between them and determine that each has been incarcerated before, excluding Daniel.\n\nMeanwhile, John passes the time with both idle and cryptic chat, eventually telling Eric that his survival of a suicide attempt after his diagnosis is the true reason for his games. Then, he destroys several of John's documents and sketches at Kerry's suggestion, but fails to provoke John. As the tech team arrives, John reveals the connection between the victims: Eric has framed all of them for various crimes.\n\nHaving left the others, Xavier returns to the safe room and finds a colored number on the back of Gus' neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent and dies; after finding the clue revealing Daniel's identity, Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box containing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades. Xavier enters the room, reads Addison\u2019s number, and leaves her to die. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room, which leads to the bathroom from [[Saw (2004 film)|the first film]]. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he cannot read his own number, so he cuts a piece of the back of his neck off. As he approaches Amanda as an attempt to kill her, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps in the way and slashes his throat with a hacksaw, killing him.\n\nHaving seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John and forces him to lead him to the house. John's sitting area is revealed to be an elevator, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place \"before\" they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe, and a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda suddenly appears in the doorway, and yells \"Game Over\" before sealing the door, leaving Eric to die.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Erik Knudsen]] as [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]\n* [[Franky G]] as [[List of Saw characters#Xavier Chavez|Xavier]]\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jonas Singer|Jonas]]\n* [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] as [[List of Saw characters#Addison Corday|Addison]]\n* [[Beverley Mitchell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Laura Hunter|Laura]]\n* Timothy Burd as [[List of Saw characters#Obi Tate|Obi]]\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as [[Allison Kerry|Detective Allison Kerry]]\n* [[Lyriq Bent]] as [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]]\n* Noam Jenkins as [[List of Saw characters#Michael Marks|Michael Marks]]\n* Tony Nappo as [[List of Saw characters#Gus Colyard|Gus]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:Saw two banned poster.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The original teaser poster showing two bloody severed fingers that was banned by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].]]\n''Saw II'' was immediately [[Green-light|green-lit]] after ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]''{{'}}s successful opening weekend a year earlier.<ref name=\"IGNFeb2005\">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/586/586613p1.html |title=IGN Interviews James Wan and Leigh Whannell |last=Otto |first=Jeff |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212164031/http://movies.ign.com/articles/586/586613p1.html |archivedate=February 12, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Producers needed a script for a sequel <ref name=\"FilmMonthly\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/Profiles/Articles/LeighWhannell/LeighWhannell.html \n |title=Leigh Returns to the Saw \n |last=Fischer \n |first=Paul \n |work=Film Monthly \n |date=October 26, 2005 \n |accessdate=August 22, 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617eiopaX \n |archivedate=August 22, 2011 \n |url-status=live \n}}</ref> but [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]], director and writer of ''Saw'', were working on [[Universal Pictures]]'s ''[[Dead Silence]]''.

In order for this to be done safely, four people, over a period of four days, removed the needle tips from syringes and replaced them with fiber optic tips. They modified a total of 120,000 fake needles. However, this number was insufficient and the pit had to be filled with styrofoam and other materials to make it appear to have more needles. The needles that were apparently stuck into Smith were actually blunted syringes stuck into padding under her clothing. For certain shots, a fake arm was used.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[David Hackl]] (production designer), Jim Murray (property master), Darren Lynn Bousman (writer/director) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Needle Pit |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Darren Lynn Bousman CC.JPG|thumb|right|''Saw II'' was Bousman's first feature film.]]\nBousman came up with an idea whereby a character's hands would get stuck in some sort of vessel and this resulted in the \"Hand Trap\". It proved to be a challenge but after much discussion, Hackl, property master Jim Murray and art director Michele Brady came up with a suitable design. They arranged a glass box suspended by chains from the ceiling which contained a hypodermic needle with the antidote and which had two hand-holes on the underside. As soon as Vaugier's character Addison put her hands into the holes razor blades would close in on her hands and any attempt to withdraw from the trap would cause her to bleed to death. In order for the trap to be used safely, the prop builders made the handcuffs move inside the box and fake blades that would retract from the actress's hands, thus allowing her to slide her hands out. Hackl subsequently commented that the character did not have to put her hands into the trap as there was a lock with a key on the other side box that would have opened the contraption.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://machinedesign.com/article/how-to-engineer-a-nightmare-1023 |title=How to Engineer a Nightmare |last=Shapiro |first=Jessica |journal=[[Machine Design]] |volume=80 |issue=20 |pages=22\u201323 |date=October 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62GdveX3S |archivedate=October 7, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite video |people=David Hackl (production designer) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Hand Trap |medium=DVD |publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe original idea for the \"Furnace Trap\" came from the house having been a [[Crematory|crematorium]] at some point, but this would have involved turning the house into a funeral parlor, so it was instead decided that the furnace would be part of the house's boiler system. The furnace was visualized in the form of a computer model so that Bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed.

Meanwhile, a bed-ridden John Kramer has his apprentice [[Amanda Young]] kidnap [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|Dr. Lynn Denlon]], who is tasked with keeping John alive for one final test before he dies.\n\nDevelopment began right after the successful opening weekend of ''[[Saw II]]''. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] from May to June 2006. Whannell aimed to make the story more emotional than previous installments, particularly with the Amanda and Jigsaw storyline. The film is dedicated to producer [[Gregg Hoffman]] who died on December 4, 2005.\n\n''Saw III'' was released in the United States on {{nowrap|October 27, 2006}}, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. It was a financial success, opening to $33.6 million and grossing $80.2 million in the United States and Canada. It is the highest-grossing film of the series in the international market with $84.6 million and the highest-grossing film in the series overall with $164.9 million worldwide. It received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Bell was nominated for \"Best Villain\" at the [[2007 MTV Movie Awards]] and the film received nominations for a [[Saturn Award]] as \"Best Horror Film\". The film was released to [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on {{nowrap|January 23, 2007}}, and topped the charts selling 2.5 million units in its first week. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw IV]]'', was released in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Saw II|After being left in the bathroom to die]], [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]] breaks his foot with a toilet lid to escape his shackle. Six months later, the aftermath of a Jigsaw \"game\" is discovered by a [[SWAT]] team. The victim, Troy, had to rip chains from his body in order to escape from a bomb. Detective Allison Kerry arrives at the scene, and points out that the room's exit was welded shut, breaking [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]]'s [[modus operandi]] of giving his victims a chance to survive. While reviewing the videotape, she is abducted and awakens in a harness hooked into her ribs. Even though she retrieves the key from a beaker of acid and unlocks the harness, she is unable to remove it and is killed when time runs out.\n\nDr. Lynn Denlon is abducted from the hospital she works at, and brought to the bedridden John Kramer. His apprentice, Amanda Young, locks a shotgun collar around Lynn's neck that is connected to John's heart rate monitor, and will detonate if John dies or Lynn moves out of range. She is instructed by Amanda to keep him alive until another victim has completed his game. The other victim, Jeff, wakes up in a box and learns that he must undergo tests, which will lead him to the man who killed his son, Dylan, in a drunk driving accident. Jeff became unstable and vengeful as a result and now neglects his daughter, Corbett.\n\nJeff's first test leads him into a meat freezer. He finds Danica Scott, the only witness to the accident, who refused to testify in court; she is stripped naked and chained at the wrists between two poles, which begin spraying her with ice-cold water. Jeff attempts to reach the key, which is behind frozen bars after Danica persuades Jeff to help her, but she freezes to death before he can retrieve it.\n\nIn his next test, Judge Halden, who gave Dylan's killer six months in jail, is chained at the neck to the bottom of a pit. Rotted pig corpses are dropped into a rack of circular saws, slowly filling the vat, but Halden persuades Jeff to help him. Jeff sets fire to a furnace full of Dylan's toys in order to retrieve the key, and saves Halden before he drowns.\n\nHis third test involves Timothy Young, Dylan's killer, who is strapped to a machine called \"The Rack\" that will twist his limbs and neck until they break. The key is tied to the trigger of an enclosed shotgun. The shotgun goes off, after Jeff retrieves the key, killing Halden in the process. Jeff tries to stop the machine before Timothy's neck breaks, but fails.\n\nMeanwhile, Lynn is forced to perform an improvised surgery to relieve pressure on John's brain with a conventional drill. Amanda grows increasingly jealous of Lynn's interaction with John, who continues to reprimand her for being rude. It is only when John suffers a seizure that Amanda is willing to cooperate with Lynn. During the surgery, John hallucinates about [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|another woman]] and declares his love out loud. This upsets Amanda and when she leaves, she finds a letter which drives her to hysterics. Amanda returns with the news that Jeff has completed his tests, but refuses to remove Lynn's collar. She reveals that she no longer believes in John's philosophy, and has been creating inescapable traps. She also reveals that she fought with Detective Matthews after he escaped the bathroom, and left him for dead.\n\nRefusing to listen to John's warnings, Amanda shoots Lynn just as Jeff arrives. Jeff, who is revealed to be Lynn's husband, retaliates by shooting Amanda with a gun provided by John after his tests. As Amanda dies, John reveals that Lynn's test was actually hers: aware of her modus operandi, and unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy, John decided to test her. John then addresses Jeff, offering to call an ambulance for Lynn if he accepts one last test: he can choose to kill John or forgive him. Jeff tells John he forgives him, but slashes his throat with a power saw. The door to the room seals as John plays a final tape, which tells Jeff that he has failed his final test by killing John, the only person who knows the whereabouts of his daughter. The tape ends as John dies, and Lynn's collar detonates, killing her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff Denlon]]\n* [[Bahar Soomekh]] as [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|Lynn Denlon]]\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as [[List of Saw characters#Allison Kerry|Detective Allison Kerry]]\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]]\n* [[Mpho Koaho]] as [[List of Saw characters#Timothy Young|Timothy Young]]\n* [[Barry Flatman]] as [[List of Saw characters#Judge Halden|Judge Halden]]\n* [[Lyriq Bent]] as [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Lieutenant Daniel Rigg]]\n* [[J.

It is the third installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Shawnee Smith]], [[Angus Macfadyen]], [[Bahar Soomekh]], [[Dina Meyer]], [[Donnie Wahlberg]], and Whannell.\n\nThe story follows [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a man who, after his son is killed by a drunk driver, is put through a series of tests by [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]] in order to try to get him to let go of his vengeance for the man that killed his son. Meanwhile, a bed-ridden John Kramer has his apprentice [[Amanda Young]] kidnap [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|Dr. Lynn Denlon]], who is tasked with keeping John alive for one final test before he dies.\n\nDevelopment began right after the successful opening weekend of ''[[Saw II]]''. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] from May to June 2006. Whannell aimed to make the story more emotional than previous installments, particularly with the Amanda and Jigsaw storyline. The film is dedicated to producer [[Gregg Hoffman]] who died on December 4, 2005.\n\n''Saw III'' was released in the United States on {{nowrap|October 27, 2006}}, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. It was a financial success, opening to $33.6 million and grossing $80.2 million in the United States and Canada. It is the highest-grossing film of the series in the international market with $84.6 million and the highest-grossing film in the series overall with $164.9 million worldwide. It received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Bell was nominated for \"Best Villain\" at the [[2007 MTV Movie Awards]] and the film received nominations for a [[Saturn Award]] as \"Best Horror Film\". The film was released to [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on {{nowrap|January 23, 2007}}, and topped the charts selling 2.5 million units in its first week. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw IV]]'', was released in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Saw II|After being left in the bathroom to die]], [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]] breaks his foot with a toilet lid to escape his shackle. Six months later, the aftermath of a Jigsaw \"game\" is discovered by a [[SWAT]] team. The victim, Troy, had to rip chains from his body in order to escape from a bomb. Detective Allison Kerry arrives at the scene, and points out that the room's exit was welded shut, breaking [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]]'s [[modus operandi]] of giving his victims a chance to survive. While reviewing the videotape, she is abducted and awakens in a harness hooked into her ribs. Even though she retrieves the key from a beaker of acid and unlocks the harness, she is unable to remove it and is killed when time runs out.\n\nDr. Lynn Denlon is abducted from the hospital she works at, and brought to the bedridden John Kramer. His apprentice, Amanda Young, locks a shotgun collar around Lynn's neck that is connected to John's heart rate monitor, and will detonate if John dies or Lynn moves out of range. She is instructed by Amanda to keep him alive until another victim has completed his game. The other victim, Jeff, wakes up in a box and learns that he must undergo tests, which will lead him to the man who killed his son, Dylan, in a drunk driving accident. Jeff became unstable and vengeful as a result and now neglects his daughter, Corbett.\n\nJeff's first test leads him into a meat freezer. He finds Danica Scott, the only witness to the accident, who refused to testify in court; she is stripped naked and chained at the wrists between two poles, which begin spraying her with ice-cold water. Jeff attempts to reach the key, which is behind frozen bars after Danica persuades Jeff to help her, but she freezes to death before he can retrieve it.\n\nIn his next test, Judge Halden, who gave Dylan's killer six months in jail, is chained at the neck to the bottom of a pit. Rotted pig corpses are dropped into a rack of circular saws, slowly filling the vat, but Halden persuades Jeff to help him. Jeff sets fire to a furnace full of Dylan's toys in order to retrieve the key, and saves Halden before he drowns.\n\nHis third test involves Timothy Young, Dylan's killer, who is strapped to a machine called \"The Rack\" that will twist his limbs and neck until they break. The key is tied to the trigger of an enclosed shotgun. The shotgun goes off, after Jeff retrieves the key, killing Halden in the process. Jeff tries to stop the machine before Timothy's neck breaks, but fails.\n\nMeanwhile, Lynn is forced to perform an improvised surgery to relieve pressure on John's brain with a conventional drill. Amanda grows increasingly jealous of Lynn's interaction with John, who continues to reprimand her for being rude. It is only when John suffers a seizure that Amanda is willing to cooperate with Lynn. During the surgery, John hallucinates about [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|another woman]] and declares his love out loud. This upsets Amanda and when she leaves, she finds a letter which drives her to hysterics. Amanda returns with the news that Jeff has completed his tests, but refuses to remove Lynn's collar. She reveals that she no longer believes in John's philosophy, and has been creating inescapable traps. She also reveals that she fought with Detective Matthews after he escaped the bathroom, and left him for dead.\n\nRefusing to listen to John's warnings, Amanda shoots Lynn just as Jeff arrives. Jeff, who is revealed to be Lynn's husband, retaliates by shooting Amanda with a gun provided by John after his tests. As Amanda dies, John reveals that Lynn's test was actually hers: aware of her modus operandi, and unwilling to allow a murderer to continue his legacy, John decided to test her. John then addresses Jeff, offering to call an ambulance for Lynn if he accepts one last test: he can choose to kill John or forgive him. Jeff tells John he forgives him, but slashes his throat with a power saw. The door to the room seals as John plays a final tape, which tells Jeff that he has failed his final test by killing John, the only person who knows the whereabouts of his daughter. The tape ends as John dies, and Lynn's collar detonates, killing her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff Denlon]]\n* [[Bahar Soomekh]] as [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|Lynn Denlon]]\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as [[List of Saw characters#Allison Kerry|Detective Allison Kerry]]\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]]\n* [[Mpho Koaho]] as [[List of Saw characters#Timothy Young|Timothy Young]]\n* [[Barry Flatman]] as [[List of Saw characters#Judge Halden|Judge Halden]]\n* [[Lyriq Bent]] as [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Lieutenant Daniel Rigg]]\n* [[J.

It is the fourth installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]], the third directed by Bousman. The film stars [[Lyriq Bent]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Scott Patterson]], [[Tobin Bell]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Athena Karkanis]], [[Justin Louis]], and [[Donnie Wahlberg]].\n\nThe film continues the story of the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]]'s obsession with teaching people the value of their lives and occurs roughly at the same time as the [[Saw III|previous installment]]. Despite Jigsaw's death, the film focuses on his ability to manipulate people into continuing his work. The story follows Officer Daniel Rigg being put through a series of tests in order to try to let go of his obsession with saving everyone, while at the same time attempting to save his partner.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 26, 2007, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. It received generally negative reviews from critics. Despite this, the film was a box office success, grossing $139 million worldwide. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw V]]'', was released in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nA wax-coated [[microcassette]] is found in [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]'s stomach during his autopsy, and reveals to Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] that, despite his death, the games will continue and he will be tested. Elsewhere, two men \u2013 one with his eyes sewn shut, the other with his mouth sewn shut \u2013 awaken in a [[mausoleum]], chained at the neck to a winch. The blinded man panics and activates the winch before attacking the muted man, who kills him to get a key from his collar to free himself.\n\nFour days after [[List of Saw characters#Allison Kerry|Allison Kerry's]] death in the previous film, a [[SWAT]] team led by Hoffman and Officer [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Daniel Rigg]] find her body, and Hoffman warns Rigg against breaking through an unsecured door to reach her. The scene is also investigated by Agents [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] and [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]], Kerry's FBI contacts, who received a message and key from her. Noting John and [[Amanda Young]]'s physical limitations, Strahm speculates that a third accomplice was involved and soon becomes suspicious of Rigg, who has developed an obsession with saving people in the six months since the disappearance of detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]]. That night, Rigg is attacked in his home; he awakens and watches a video from Jigsaw, which is where he learns that Eric is still alive and has ninety minutes to save himself, with Hoffman's life at risk as well. Meanwhile, he must play his own game in order to face and overcome his obsession.\n\nRigg finds a pimp named Brenda bound to a chair in his living room, and accidentally activates the trap, which slowly tears her scalp off. He manages to free her, but kills her in self-defense when she attacks him with a knife in order to evade arrest. Rigg is then led to a motel and instructed to abduct the owner, Ivan Landsness, who Rigg learns is a serial rapist. He forces Ivan into a trap, which requires Ivan to blind both of his eyes as payment for photographing and videotaping his crimes, in order to escape. However, Ivan only blinds one of his eyes, and the trap dismembers him.\n\nNext, Rigg is led to a school where he once investigated the abuse of a young student, committed by her father but not proven. Rigg finds that the student\u2019s parents are impaled by metal spikes: Rex, who has already died from blood loss, and his also abused wife Morgan, who has remained alive at his expense by pulling the spikes from both of their bodies. The spikes were flesh wounds for Morgan but crucial arteries for Rex. Rigg gives her a key to free herself then turns on a fire alarm and goes to the location of his final test.\n\nWhile investigating Rigg's apartment, the agents find a clue that leads them to [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]], John's ex-wife. Jill reveals that John worked in civil engineering and property development, and she miscarried her son Gideon after seven months when Cecil Adams, a drug addict, slammed a door into her stomach while robbing her rehab clinic. The loss of their son destroyed their marriage and made John become insane and develop his life tests. At the motel, the agents learn that the room was rented out to a lawyer named Art Blank, John's partner from his previous work and the survivor of the mausoleum trap from the beginning of the film, who vanished two weeks prior. Art is revealed to be the man overseeing the current game when he hands Eric a gun. At the school, the agents learn that all three victims, along with Jill, were Art's clients. Strahm and Perez find a puppet and a tape recorder in another room, which plays a cryptic message for Perez and the forecast that Strahm will kill an innocent person. Its face explodes and sends shrapnel into Perez' face. After she is hospitalized, Strahm furiously questions Jill. He learns how John ended his work with Art after falling into his depression, and that Cecil became the first victim of John's \"games\". Strahm connects her story and a prior clue to the Gideon Meatpacking Plant, the location of Rigg's final test.\n\nStrahm arrives after Rigg, but ends up following [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff Denlon]], the protagonist in ''[[Saw III]]''. He finds him in the sickroom from the previous film, with the dead corpses of John, Amanda and others lying around, and is forced to kill Jeff in self-defense when he demands his daughter back. It now becomes clear that this happened only moments after Jeff had killed John and Amanda in ''Saw III''. Meanwhile, Art pulls out a device which will free him, Eric, and Hoffman once the timer expires; if used before then, a pair of pincers will sever his spine. Rigg finds them and is yelled at and ultimately shot by Eric to prevent him from entering the room too early, but as he breaks in with one second to spare, two overhead ice blocks are released that swing down and crush Eric's head, killing him. Rigg shoots and kills Art, believing he is responsible for the game, only to learn from Art's tape recorder that his interference and continued obsession to save people, while they should have saved themselves, caused Eric's death. Hoffman, the actual accomplice, releases himself from the chair, but leaves Rigg to die. He then seals Strahm in the sickroom, and leaves the plant. The scene then cuts to Hoffman at the morgue, revealing that John's autopsy took place ''after'' the events of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Lyriq Bent]] as [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Daniel Rigg]]\n* [[Scott Patterson]] as [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Agent Peter Strahm]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]]\n* [[Athena Karkanis]] as [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Agent Lindsey Perez]]\n* [[Louis Ferreira|Justin Louis]] as [[List of Saw characters#Art Blank|Art Blank]]\n* Simon Reynolds as Officer Lamanna\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Bahar Soomekh]] as [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|Lynn Denlon]]\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as [[List of Saw characters#Allison Kerry|Detective Kerry]]\n* Mike Realba as [[List of Saw characters#Fisk|Detective Fisk]]\n* [[Marty Adams]] as [[List of Saw characters#Ivan Landsness|Ivan Landsness]]\n* Sarain Boylan as [[List of Saw characters#Brenda|Brenda]]\n* Billy Otis as [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil Adams]]\n* James Van Patten as [[List of Saw characters#Adam Heffner|Dr. Heffner]]\n* Kevin Rushton as [[List of Saw characters#Trevor|Trevor]]\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Vagrant\n* Ingrid Hart as [[List of Saw characters#Tracy Rigg|Tracy Rigg]]\n* [[Niamh Wilson]] as [[List of Saw characters#Corbett Denlon|Corbett Denlon]]\n* [[Janet Land]] as [[List of Saw characters#Morgan and Rex|Morgan]]\n* [[Ron Lea]] as [[List of Saw characters#Morgan and Rex|Rex]]\n* [[Tony Nappo]] as [[List of Saw characters#Gus Colyard|Gus]]\n* [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] as [[List of Saw characters#Addison Corday|Addison]]\n* [[Noam Jenkins]] as [[List of Saw characters#Michael Marks|Michael]]\n* Mike Butters as [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]\n* [[J.

It is the fourth installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]], the third directed by Bousman. The film stars [[Lyriq Bent]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Scott Patterson]], [[Tobin Bell]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Athena Karkanis]], [[Justin Louis]], and [[Donnie Wahlberg]].\n\nThe film continues the story of the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]]'s obsession with teaching people the value of their lives and occurs roughly at the same time as the [[Saw III|previous installment]]. Despite Jigsaw's death, the film focuses on his ability to manipulate people into continuing his work. The story follows Officer Daniel Rigg being put through a series of tests in order to try to let go of his obsession with saving everyone, while at the same time attempting to save his partner.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 26, 2007, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. It received generally negative reviews from critics. Despite this, the film was a box office success, grossing $139 million worldwide. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw V]]'', was released in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nA wax-coated [[microcassette]] is found in [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]'s stomach during his autopsy, and reveals to Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] that, despite his death, the games will continue and he will be tested. Elsewhere, two men \u2013 one with his eyes sewn shut, the other with his mouth sewn shut \u2013 awaken in a [[mausoleum]], chained at the neck to a winch. The blinded man panics and activates the winch before attacking the muted man, who kills him to get a key from his collar to free himself.\n\nFour days after [[List of Saw characters#Allison Kerry|Allison Kerry's]] death in the previous film, a [[SWAT]] team led by Hoffman and Officer [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Daniel Rigg]] find her body, and Hoffman warns Rigg against breaking through an unsecured door to reach her. The scene is also investigated by Agents [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]] and [[List of Saw characters#Lindsey Perez|Lindsey Perez]], Kerry's FBI contacts, who received a message and key from her. Noting John and [[Amanda Young]]'s physical limitations, Strahm speculates that a third accomplice was involved and soon becomes suspicious of Rigg, who has developed an obsession with saving people in the six months since the disappearance of detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]]. That night, Rigg is attacked in his home; he awakens and watches a video from Jigsaw, which is where he learns that Eric is still alive and has ninety minutes to save himself, with Hoffman's life at risk as well. Meanwhile, he must play his own game in order to face and overcome his obsession.\n\nRigg finds a pimp named Brenda bound to a chair in his living room, and accidentally activates the trap, which slowly tears her scalp off. He manages to free her, but kills her in self-defense when she attacks him with a knife in order to evade arrest. Rigg is then led to a motel and instructed to abduct the owner, Ivan Landsness, who Rigg learns is a serial rapist. He forces Ivan into a trap, which requires Ivan to blind both of his eyes as payment for photographing and videotaping his crimes, in order to escape. However, Ivan only blinds one of his eyes, and the trap dismembers him.\n\nNext, Rigg is led to a school where he once investigated the abuse of a young student, committed by her father but not proven. Rigg finds that the student\u2019s parents are impaled by metal spikes: Rex, who has already died from blood loss, and his also abused wife Morgan, who has remained alive at his expense by pulling the spikes from both of their bodies. The spikes were flesh wounds for Morgan but crucial arteries for Rex. Rigg gives her a key to free herself then turns on a fire alarm and goes to the location of his final test.\n\nWhile investigating Rigg's apartment, the agents find a clue that leads them to [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]], John's ex-wife. Jill reveals that John worked in civil engineering and property development, and she miscarried her son Gideon after seven months when Cecil Adams, a drug addict, slammed a door into her stomach while robbing her rehab clinic. The loss of their son destroyed their marriage and made John become insane and develop his life tests. At the motel, the agents learn that the room was rented out to a lawyer named Art Blank, John's partner from his previous work and the survivor of the mausoleum trap from the beginning of the film, who vanished two weeks prior. Art is revealed to be the man overseeing the current game when he hands Eric a gun. At the school, the agents learn that all three victims, along with Jill, were Art's clients. Strahm and Perez find a puppet and a tape recorder in another room, which plays a cryptic message for Perez and the forecast that Strahm will kill an innocent person. Its face explodes and sends shrapnel into Perez' face. After she is hospitalized, Strahm furiously questions Jill. He learns how John ended his work with Art after falling into his depression, and that Cecil became the first victim of John's \"games\". Strahm connects her story and a prior clue to the Gideon Meatpacking Plant, the location of Rigg's final test.\n\nStrahm arrives after Rigg, but ends up following [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff Denlon]], the protagonist in ''[[Saw III]]''. He finds him in the sickroom from the previous film, with the dead corpses of John, Amanda and others lying around, and is forced to kill Jeff in self-defense when he demands his daughter back. It now becomes clear that this happened only moments after Jeff had killed John and Amanda in ''Saw III''. Meanwhile, Art pulls out a device which will free him, Eric, and Hoffman once the timer expires; if used before then, a pair of pincers will sever his spine. Rigg finds them and is yelled at and ultimately shot by Eric to prevent him from entering the room too early, but as he breaks in with one second to spare, two overhead ice blocks are released that swing down and crush Eric's head, killing him. Rigg shoots and kills Art, believing he is responsible for the game, only to learn from Art's tape recorder that his interference and continued obsession to save people, while they should have saved themselves, caused Eric's death.

It is the eighth installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars <!-- Casting is per the billing block. Do NOT change. -->[[Matt Passmore]], [[Callum Keith Rennie]], [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]], and Hannah Emily Anderson. The film picks up over a decade after the death of the eponymous [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw killer]], during the police investigation of a new succession of murders that fit his ''[[modus operandi]]''.\n\n2010's ''[[Saw 3D]]'' was originally deemed the final installment of the series, before [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] commissioned the production of ''Jigsaw'' from a pitch by Stolberg and Goldfinger.\n\nFilming began in November 2016, with post-production following in January. The film was released in the United States on October 27, 2017, by Lionsgate. ''Jigsaw'' received mostly unfavorable reviews<!-- The Metacritic rating states \"unfavorable reviews\". There is no source for \"Mixed reviews\". --> from critics but was a commercial success, grossing $102.9 million worldwide against a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nTen years after [[Saw III|the death of John Kramer]], criminal Edgar Munsen is shot and apprehended by Detectives Hunt and Halloran after activating a [[Triggering device|remote trigger]]. Meanwhile, five people \u2013 Mitch, Anna, Ryan, Carly, and an unconscious man \u2013 are held captive in a barn with chains around their necks. A tape recording from John Kramer explains they must give a sacrifice of blood and confess their sins. The chains pull them towards a wall of buzzsaws. Most of the group survive by cutting themselves to offer blood, but the unconscious man awakens too late to escape.\n\nTheir next test reveals that Carly is a [[theft|purse snatcher]], who accidentally caused the death of an [[Asthma|asthmatic woman]]. To save the others from being [[Hanging|hanged]], she must inject herself with one of three needles \u2013 one containing an antidote to a [[poison]] in her system, one containing [[Saline (medicine)|saline]], and one containing [[acid]]. She refuses, so Ryan stabs her with all three to save himself, killing her.\n\nHalloran and Detective Hunt investigate the discovery of bodies that appear to be the unconscious man and Carly. Halloran becomes suspicious of [[pathology|pathologists]] Logan Nelson, who is a [[veteran]] and former doctor whose wife was killed two years prior, and Eleanor Bonneville. Later, Munsen goes missing from the hospital. His body is found inside John's grave when it is exhumed by the police.\n\nRyan attempts to escape through a door with the words \"No Exit\" on it, but his leg crashes through loose floorboards, and is ensnared by wires. A tape recorder found next to his leg reveal that he is being punished for breaking the rules and that he must pull a lever to sever his leg and be \"set free\". Exploring the room, Anna and Mitch walk inside a [[silo]] and are trapped inside. A recording reveals they will be killed unless Ryan pulls the lever. Ryan pulls the lever, severing his leg, while saving Anna and Mitch.\n\nEleanor reveals to Logan that she is a [[fandom|fangirl]] of the Jigsaw case, and has built replicas of many of his traps in her [[studio]]. She is worried this might incriminate her. Hunt follows them and informs Halloran.\n\nThe next test reveals Mitch sold a [[motorcycle]] with a faulty brake to John's nephew, resulting in his death. Mitch will be killed by a spiral-shaped blade unless he can reach a [[Parking brake|brake]]. Anna attempts to help him, but he is killed. Halloran finds a corpse appearing to be Mitch in Eleanor\u2019s studio and calls for Logan and Eleanor\u2019s arrest.\n\nLogan convinces Hunt to let them go, as both suspect Halloran. Eleanor deduces the game's location and she and Logan depart for the barn. Halloran pursues them. Meanwhile, Hunt finds pieces of flesh in Halloran's freezer, fitting Jigsaw's [[Modus operandi|M.O.]] and implicating Halloran as the killer.\n\nAnna is drugged while attempting to escape, and awakens to find herself and Ryan chained in a room with a still-living John Kramer. John reveals that Anna [[Infanticide|suffocated her baby]] and [[Frameup|framed her husband]] while Ryan caused the death of several friends in a car accident. John tells them they have gotten his message backwards. He places a shotgun between them and tells them it is the key to their survival. Anna attempts to shoot Ryan, but the gun [[Booby trap|backfires and kills her]]. Ryan realizes that the keys to his and Anna's chains were in the gun and were destroyed when Anna fired it, leaving him to die.\n\nLogan and Eleanor are ambushed by Halloran at the barn. Eleanor escapes, while Halloran is drugged by an unseen assailant. Logan and Halloran awaken in collars rigged with [[Laser cutting|laser cutters]]. They are told to confess their sins to survive and may choose who goes first. Halloran forces Logan to go first. Logan confesses that he mislabeled John's x-rays years prior, causing his [[cancer]] to go undiagnosed. Despite confessing, Logan is killed. Then, Halloran admits to allowing criminals to walk free for personal gain and his collar deactivates.\n\nLogan reveals that he is still alive and that the barn games occurred [[Nonlinear narrative|ten years prior]]. He was the man who appeared to die in the first game, but John, having decided Logan shouldn't die over an honest mistake, saved him and recruited him as his first [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]]. The bodies that were found were actually the bodies of criminals Halloran allowed to walk free, which Logan placed into the same tests that took place at Tuck's Pig Farm ten years ago. Logan also reveals that Munsen, one of the criminals Halloran let go, killed his wife. However, because Halloran broke the rules and forced Logan to go first, he will die and be framed as the killer. Logan reactivates the collar around Halloran's neck, killing him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Matt Passmore]] as [[List of Saw characters#Logan Nelson|Logan Nelson]]\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as [[List of Saw characters#Detective Halloran|Detective Halloran]]\n* [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]] as [[List of Saw characters#Detective Keith Hunt|Detective Keith Hunt]]\n* Hannah Emily Anderson as [[List of Saw characters#Eleanor Bonneville|Eleanor Bonneville]]\n* [[Laura Vandervoort]] as [[List of Saw characters#Anna|Anna]]\n* [[Paul Braunstein]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jigsaw|Ryan]]\n* [[Mandela Van Peebles]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mitch|Mitch]]\n* [[Brittany Allen]] as [[List of Saw characters#Carly|Carly]]\n* Josiah Black as [[List of Saw characters#Edgar Munsen|Edgar Munsen]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''[[Saw 3D]]'' was intended to be the final ''Saw'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|last1=Bowles|first1=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett]]|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref> The film was set to be split into two parts, but [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] only allowed the filmmakers to make one more film after ''[[Saw VI]]'' under-performed at the box office.

It is the eighth installment in the [[Saw (film series)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars <!-- Casting is per the billing block. Do NOT change. -->[[Matt Passmore]], [[Callum Keith Rennie]], [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]], and Hannah Emily Anderson. The film picks up over a decade after the death of the eponymous [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw killer]], during the police investigation of a new succession of murders that fit his ''[[modus operandi]]''.\n\n2010's ''[[Saw 3D]]'' was originally deemed the final installment of the series, before [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] commissioned the production of ''Jigsaw'' from a pitch by Stolberg and Goldfinger.\n\nFilming began in November 2016, with post-production following in January. The film was released in the United States on October 27, 2017, by Lionsgate. ''Jigsaw'' received mostly unfavorable reviews<!-- The Metacritic rating states \"unfavorable reviews\". There is no source for \"Mixed reviews\". --> from critics but was a commercial success, grossing $102.9 million worldwide against a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nTen years after [[Saw III|the death of John Kramer]], criminal Edgar Munsen is shot and apprehended by Detectives Hunt and Halloran after activating a [[Triggering device|remote trigger]]. Meanwhile, five people \u2013 Mitch, Anna, Ryan, Carly, and an unconscious man \u2013 are held captive in a barn with chains around their necks. A tape recording from John Kramer explains they must give a sacrifice of blood and confess their sins. The chains pull them towards a wall of buzzsaws. Most of the group survive by cutting themselves to offer blood, but the unconscious man awakens too late to escape.\n\nTheir next test reveals that Carly is a [[theft|purse snatcher]], who accidentally caused the death of an [[Asthma|asthmatic woman]]. To save the others from being [[Hanging|hanged]], she must inject herself with one of three needles \u2013 one containing an antidote to a [[poison]] in her system, one containing [[Saline (medicine)|saline]], and one containing [[acid]]. She refuses, so Ryan stabs her with all three to save himself, killing her.\n\nHalloran and Detective Hunt investigate the discovery of bodies that appear to be the unconscious man and Carly. Halloran becomes suspicious of [[pathology|pathologists]] Logan Nelson, who is a [[veteran]] and former doctor whose wife was killed two years prior, and Eleanor Bonneville. Later, Munsen goes missing from the hospital. His body is found inside John's grave when it is exhumed by the police.\n\nRyan attempts to escape through a door with the words \"No Exit\" on it, but his leg crashes through loose floorboards, and is ensnared by wires. A tape recorder found next to his leg reveal that he is being punished for breaking the rules and that he must pull a lever to sever his leg and be \"set free\". Exploring the room, Anna and Mitch walk inside a [[silo]] and are trapped inside. A recording reveals they will be killed unless Ryan pulls the lever. Ryan pulls the lever, severing his leg, while saving Anna and Mitch.\n\nEleanor reveals to Logan that she is a [[fandom|fangirl]] of the Jigsaw case, and has built replicas of many of his traps in her [[studio]]. She is worried this might incriminate her. Hunt follows them and informs Halloran.\n\nThe next test reveals Mitch sold a [[motorcycle]] with a faulty brake to John's nephew, resulting in his death. Mitch will be killed by a spiral-shaped blade unless he can reach a [[Parking brake|brake]]. Anna attempts to help him, but he is killed. Halloran finds a corpse appearing to be Mitch in Eleanor\u2019s studio and calls for Logan and Eleanor\u2019s arrest.\n\nLogan convinces Hunt to let them go, as both suspect Halloran. Eleanor deduces the game's location and she and Logan depart for the barn. Halloran pursues them. Meanwhile, Hunt finds pieces of flesh in Halloran's freezer, fitting Jigsaw's [[Modus operandi|M.O.]] and implicating Halloran as the killer.\n\nAnna is drugged while attempting to escape, and awakens to find herself and Ryan chained in a room with a still-living John Kramer. John reveals that Anna [[Infanticide|suffocated her baby]] and [[Frameup|framed her husband]] while Ryan caused the death of several friends in a car accident. John tells them they have gotten his message backwards. He places a shotgun between them and tells them it is the key to their survival. Anna attempts to shoot Ryan, but the gun [[Booby trap|backfires and kills her]]. Ryan realizes that the keys to his and Anna's chains were in the gun and were destroyed when Anna fired it, leaving him to die.\n\nLogan and Eleanor are ambushed by Halloran at the barn. Eleanor escapes, while Halloran is drugged by an unseen assailant. Logan and Halloran awaken in collars rigged with [[Laser cutting|laser cutters]]. They are told to confess their sins to survive and may choose who goes first. Halloran forces Logan to go first. Logan confesses that he mislabeled John's x-rays years prior, causing his [[cancer]] to go undiagnosed. Despite confessing, Logan is killed. Then, Halloran admits to allowing criminals to walk free for personal gain and his collar deactivates.\n\nLogan reveals that he is still alive and that the barn games occurred [[Nonlinear narrative|ten years prior]]. He was the man who appeared to die in the first game, but John, having decided Logan shouldn't die over an honest mistake, saved him and recruited him as his first [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]]. The bodies that were found were actually the bodies of criminals Halloran allowed to walk free, which Logan placed into the same tests that took place at Tuck's Pig Farm ten years ago. Logan also reveals that Munsen, one of the criminals Halloran let go, killed his wife. However, because Halloran broke the rules and forced Logan to go first, he will die and be framed as the killer. Logan reactivates the collar around Halloran's neck, killing him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Details|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw cast members|List of Saw characters}}\n* [[Matt Passmore]] as [[List of Saw characters#Logan Nelson|Logan Nelson]]\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as [[List of Saw characters#Detective Halloran|Detective Halloran]]\n* [[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]] as [[List of Saw characters#Detective Keith Hunt|Detective Keith Hunt]]\n* Hannah Emily Anderson as [[List of Saw characters#Eleanor Bonneville|Eleanor Bonneville]]\n* [[Laura Vandervoort]] as [[List of Saw characters#Anna|Anna]]\n* [[Paul Braunstein]] as [[List of Saw characters#Jigsaw|Ryan]]\n* [[Mandela Van Peebles]] as [[List of Saw characters#Mitch|Mitch]]\n* [[Brittany Allen]] as [[List of Saw characters#Carly|Carly]]\n* Josiah Black as [[List of Saw characters#Edgar Munsen|Edgar Munsen]]\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''[[Saw 3D]]'' was intended to be the final ''Saw'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|last1=Bowles|first1=Scott|date=July 22, 2010|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett]]|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref> The film was set to be split into two parts, but [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] only allowed the filmmakers to make one more film after ''[[Saw VI]]'' under-performed at the box office.
