She also spent 8 years as the anchor at ''[[CBC North]]'', in [[Yellowknife]].\n\n==Connecting with her First Nations heritage==\n\nGoldenEagle described how she first got to know other First Nations people, as a journalist.<ref name=leaderpost2018-06-07/>  She singled out First Nations artist [[Allen Sapp]] as a mentor.  When they were introduced he started speaking to her in the [[Cree language]], assuming she too could speak it.

However, after being involved in a scandal with another actor, her career had been on the wane. Since then, she would always take refuge under the influence of a bottle of alcohol, which caused her to make destructive decisions in love and career. \n\nOne day, while having another drinking binge in a bar, she was noticed and befriended by Brisom band frontman Francis ([[JC Santos]]) who then helped her get through that night, and several other nights to follow.\n\nJane was drunk practically the whole movie, maybe 95% from Scene 1. She was catty, unprofessional, reckless, annoying -- very unlikable. The scene of Jane with a bat in the parking lot was suffused with imminent danger. The scene of Jane with a broken shard of wine glass exquisitely dripped with hopeless desperation (cinematographer Pao Orendain at his best).

However, after being involved in a scandal with another actor, her career had been on the wane. Since then, she would always take refuge under the influence of a bottle of alcohol, which caused her to make destructive decisions in love and career. \n\nOne day, while having another drinking binge in a bar, she was noticed and befriended by Brisom band frontman Francis ([[JC Santos]]) who then helped her get through that night, and several other nights to follow.\n\nJane was drunk practically the whole movie, maybe 95% from Scene 1. She was catty, unprofessional, reckless, annoying -- very unlikable. The scene of Jane with a bat in the parking lot was suffused with imminent danger. The scene of Jane with a broken shard of wine glass exquisitely dripped with hopeless desperation (cinematographer Pao Orendain at his best). That painfully explicit song \"F**king Circumstance\" by Pappel was the perfect song to accompany Jane's downward spiral. Amid all that emotional muck, Bela Padilla still managed to shine through with her raw, dedicated performance, bringing out Jane's vulnerability and humanity to fore.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Bela Padilla]]                                      \n*[[JC Santos]]                                       \n*[[Matteo Guidicelli]]                              \n*[[Kean Cipriano]]\n*[[Rio Locsin]]\n*Jasmine Hollingworth\n*[[Danita Paner]]\n\n==Production==\nAccording to Bela Padillia, she calls Irene on the phone and told her that she wanted to make a movie again with her.

The franchise also includes film and print adaptations.\n\nThe main games in the series follow the events of the King of Iron Fist Tournament, hosted by the Mishima [[Zaibatsu]], where players control a plethora of characters to win the tournament and gain control of the company; the conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series' plot, while players explore other characters' motivations in aiming to control the Zaibatsu.\n\nGameplay focuses on hand-to-hand combat with an opponent, with the gameplay system including blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting. The series later introduced combos and special moves, with characters also able to stage break arenas. ''Tekken'' is noted as being one of the first fighting games at the time to use 3D animation.\n\nJapanese video game developer [[Namco]] began the series in 1994, with the release of the [[Tekken (video game)|self-titled]] first entry. As of 2017, it has nine additional entries, eight spin-off games, and has been adapted into three feature films and other media. ''[[Tekken 2]]'', as well as the third game ''[[Tekken 3]]'', are considered landmark titles; they received critical acclaim for their gameplay and more immersive experience. Subsequent titles have followed this concept, and received generally positive critical responses.\n\nThe series has been universally acclaimed and commercially successful, having shipped more than 49 million units, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, and the second best-selling fighting game franchise in history.<ref name=\"sales\">{{Cite tweet |number=1230696020280897537 |user=Harada_TEKKEN |title=TEKKEN7 had achieved Over 5 million sales (Achieved in December 2019)!

In contrast to previous titles, ''Tekken Tag Tournament'' features tag battles and includes almost all of the ''Tekken'' characters in the series up until that point in time, for a total of 34 characters. The game ran on the same arcade board as ''Tekken 3'', and thus saw major graphical upgrades when ported to the PlayStation 2.

In the canonical ending, Kazuya loses to Heihachi and his son Jin, who defeats Heihachi afterwards. Jin unwillingly transforms into his Devil form, but after glimpsing a vision of his mother, Jun (whom he had not seen in six years), he refrains from executing Heihachi.\n\n====''Tekken 5''====\n{{main|Tekken 5}}\n''[[Tekken 5]]'' was released in arcades in 2004 and 2005 for the [[PlayStation 2]], with a short period of time of transition from arcade to PlayStation, of two months in North America and four months in Japan.<ref name=\"4spot\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/tekken4/similar.html?mode=versions |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102162227/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/tekken4/similar.html?mode=versions |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |title=Tekken 4 for PlayStation 2: Release Summary |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"5spot\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/tekken5/similar.html?mode=versions |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102162228/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/tekken5/similar.html?mode=versions |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |title=Tekken 5 for PlayStation 2: Release Summary |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}</ref> There are 32 characters to choose from, including for the first time, Devil Jin and [[Osaka]]'s [[Asuka Kazama]].

From then on, starting with ''Tekken 2'', characters automatically block while not moving forward or performing actions, a feature called \"neutral guard.\" Standing or retreating characters will block high and middle attacks with no input from the player, while crouching characters will duck high attacks and block low ones. Normal middle attacks will hit crouching players, but some special mid-attacks can be blocked by both stand and crouching neutral guards. Meanwhile, pressing backwards will give the player an \"active guard\" that can withstand certain combo attacks that would normally penetrate the neutral guard. Some characters are equipped with parries and reversals that act like traditional \"press button to block\" systems.\n\n''Tekken 3'' introduced several gameplay possibilities that were retained in later games, including the ability to sidestep into the foreground or background.<ref name=\"ignfeature\">{{cite web | title=The Evolution of Tekken| url=http://games.ign.com/articles/102/1026583p1.html|date=September 18, 2009|publisher=IGN|author=Clements, Ryan| accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> ''Tekken 3'' and later games also reduced recovery time after being knocked down and gave characters rolls to recover instantly after hitting the ground, allowing the player to get back into the fight more quickly at the risk of being hit while rolling. ''Tekken 4'' gave characters even greater mobility by adding true [[3D computer graphics|3D]] movement inside geometrically complex arenas with uneven ground, obstacles, and walls. The 3D gameplay allows damaging side and back throws as a reward for outmaneuvering the opponent, as well as evasive attacks that develop directly from a sidestep.\n\n''Tekken 5'' saw a combination of walled and infinite arenas, while discarding uneven ground. ''Tekken 6'' retains much of the design from ''Tekken 5'' but also includes a \"Rage\" mode, which activates when a character is near the end of his vitality bar and earns a damage multiplier. \"Bound\" hits were also added, in which a player connected with an airborne opponent will place him in an inescapable grounded state, allowing combo extensions. ''Tekken 6'' also has destructible floors and walls that allow the fighters to blast through to new fighting areas when broken. ''Tekken Tag Tournament 2'' retains these elements while also adding a new kind of stage break (\"balcony breaks\", which is a combination of floor and wall breaks where characters will go through a breakable wall and fall to a lower level in the same sequence). ''Tag 2'' specific features include Tag Assaults (cooperative combos triggered by hitting a Bound and a tag at the same time) and Tag Crashes (an emergency tag occurring when downed and the partner is currently in Rage).\n\n''Tekken 7'' introduces some movement changes to the ''Tekken'' formula. The back walk animation is now similar to ''Tekken Revolution'', featuring a more fluid movement away from the opponent as opposed to a slower shuffle. Regular back rolling from a grounded state has been removed and instead replaced with a new rising animation and performing a \"ankle kick\" (kicking the standing opponent while laying face up on the ground) is now accompanied by a new back roll to help create separation. Balcony breaks from ''Tag Tournament 2'' are present and function similarly to how they did in solo play. New features include \"Power Crushes\" (an attack that cannot be interrupted by regular attacks once the animation has begun) and \"Rage Arts\" (attacks that can only be used when your character has hit a Raged state near the end of their vitality meter, sacrificing the Rage mode to perform the attack). Bound has been mostly removed save for specific situations (certain moves can cause a Bound if not comboed into and all low parries will cause a Bound effect, similar to ''Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion''; floor breaks now result in an effect similar to a Tag Assault in ''Tag 2'' rather than a standard Bound) and instead characters now have more frequent access to an \"Aerial Tailspin\" effect (an attack that throws an opponent backwards onto their head as opposed to straight downwards, although it is still inescapable once triggered which means the combo can continue).\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Mishimafamily.png|thumb|right|The conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series' plot.<ref name=\"mishima\"/> As seen from left to right: Jinpachi Mishima, Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama.]]\n{{main|List of Tekken characters}}\nPlayers can choose from a diverse cast that hails from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and fighting styles.

For example, Heihachi and Kazuya Mishima, by virtues of familial connection and studying under the same Advanced Mishima Style Fighting Karate discipline, have very similar moves and a signature \"crouch dash\" stance for pretty much their entire appearances in the series. [[Jin Kazama]], when he debuted, also had the same Mishima fighting style, though he mixed this with Kazama Style Traditional Martial Arts as practiced by his mother, [[Jun Kazama]]. For storyline reasons, starting on ''Tekken 4'', he forwent this in favor of Traditional Karate, a completely different discipline that technically made him an entirely different character, while his old movelist was given to his demonic form, Devil Jin. Meanwhile, there are some characters who were formerly clones of each other before they diverged and gained unique moves, such as Lee Chaolan (a clone of Marshall Law), Anna Williams (a clone of her sister, Nina), and Armor King (a clone of King).<ref>{{cite book | title=Trigger happy: videogames and the entertainment revolution |author=Poole, Steven| page=151|publisher=Arcade Publishing|isbn=1-55970-598-1| year=2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Tekken 4 \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 History| url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/25904/tekken-4-page-2-history/|date=August 29, 2002|publisher=GamePro|author=Drifter, Tokyo| accessdate=August 21, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905045545/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/25904/tekken-4-page-2-history/| url-status=live|archivedate=September 5, 2012}}</ref> Still further, there are also characters who are replacements or \"successors\" of older characters; this happened principally in ''Tekken 3'' due to the significant time skip, though some older characters later returned alongside their successors anyway.

The franchise also includes film and print adaptations.\n\nThe main games in the series follow the events of the King of Iron Fist Tournament, hosted by the Mishima [[Zaibatsu]], where players control a plethora of characters to win the tournament and gain control of the company; the conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series' plot, while players explore other characters' motivations in aiming to control the Zaibatsu.\n\nGameplay focuses on hand-to-hand combat with an opponent, with the gameplay system including blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting. The series later introduced combos and special moves, with characters also able to stage break arenas. ''Tekken'' is noted as being one of the first fighting games at the time to use 3D animation.\n\nJapanese video game developer [[Namco]] began the series in 1994, with the release of the [[Tekken (video game)|self-titled]] first entry. As of 2017, it has nine additional entries, eight spin-off games, and has been adapted into three feature films and other media. ''[[Tekken 2]]'', as well as the third game ''[[Tekken 3]]'', are considered landmark titles; they received critical acclaim for their gameplay and more immersive experience. Subsequent titles have followed this concept, and received generally positive critical responses.\n\nThe series has been universally acclaimed and commercially successful, having shipped more than 49 million units, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, and the second best-selling fighting game franchise in history.<ref name=\"sales\">{{Cite tweet |number=1230696020280897537 |user=Harada_TEKKEN |title=TEKKEN7 had achieved Over 5 million sales (Achieved in December 2019)!

Jin unwillingly transforms into his Devil form, but after glimpsing a vision of his mother, Jun (whom he had not seen in six years), he refrains from executing Heihachi.\n\n====''Tekken 5''====\n{{main|Tekken 5}}\n''[[Tekken 5]]'' was released in arcades in 2004 and 2005 for the [[PlayStation 2]], with a short period of time of transition from arcade to PlayStation, of two months in North America and four months in Japan.<ref name=\"4spot\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/tekken4/similar.html?mode=versions |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102162227/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/tekken4/similar.html?mode=versions |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |title=Tekken 4 for PlayStation 2: Release Summary |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"5spot\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/tekken5/similar.html?mode=versions |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102162228/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/tekken5/similar.html?mode=versions |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |title=Tekken 5 for PlayStation 2: Release Summary |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}</ref> There are 32 characters to choose from, including for the first time, Devil Jin and [[Osaka]]'s [[Asuka Kazama]].

From then on, starting with ''Tekken 2'', characters automatically block while not moving forward or performing actions, a feature called \"neutral guard.\" Standing or retreating characters will block high and middle attacks with no input from the player, while crouching characters will duck high attacks and block low ones. Normal middle attacks will hit crouching players, but some special mid-attacks can be blocked by both stand and crouching neutral guards. Meanwhile, pressing backwards will give the player an \"active guard\" that can withstand certain combo attacks that would normally penetrate the neutral guard. Some characters are equipped with parries and reversals that act like traditional \"press button to block\" systems.\n\n''Tekken 3'' introduced several gameplay possibilities that were retained in later games, including the ability to sidestep into the foreground or background.<ref name=\"ignfeature\">{{cite web | title=The Evolution of Tekken| url=http://games.ign.com/articles/102/1026583p1.html|date=September 18, 2009|publisher=IGN|author=Clements, Ryan| accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> ''Tekken 3'' and later games also reduced recovery time after being knocked down and gave characters rolls to recover instantly after hitting the ground, allowing the player to get back into the fight more quickly at the risk of being hit while rolling. ''Tekken 4'' gave characters even greater mobility by adding true [[3D computer graphics|3D]] movement inside geometrically complex arenas with uneven ground, obstacles, and walls. The 3D gameplay allows damaging side and back throws as a reward for outmaneuvering the opponent, as well as evasive attacks that develop directly from a sidestep.\n\n''Tekken 5'' saw a combination of walled and infinite arenas, while discarding uneven ground. ''Tekken 6'' retains much of the design from ''Tekken 5'' but also includes a \"Rage\" mode, which activates when a character is near the end of his vitality bar and earns a damage multiplier. \"Bound\" hits were also added, in which a player connected with an airborne opponent will place him in an inescapable grounded state, allowing combo extensions. ''Tekken 6'' also has destructible floors and walls that allow the fighters to blast through to new fighting areas when broken. ''Tekken Tag Tournament 2'' retains these elements while also adding a new kind of stage break (\"balcony breaks\", which is a combination of floor and wall breaks where characters will go through a breakable wall and fall to a lower level in the same sequence). ''Tag 2'' specific features include Tag Assaults (cooperative combos triggered by hitting a Bound and a tag at the same time) and Tag Crashes (an emergency tag occurring when downed and the partner is currently in Rage).\n\n''Tekken 7'' introduces some movement changes to the ''Tekken'' formula. The back walk animation is now similar to ''Tekken Revolution'', featuring a more fluid movement away from the opponent as opposed to a slower shuffle. Regular back rolling from a grounded state has been removed and instead replaced with a new rising animation and performing a \"ankle kick\" (kicking the standing opponent while laying face up on the ground) is now accompanied by a new back roll to help create separation. Balcony breaks from ''Tag Tournament 2'' are present and function similarly to how they did in solo play. New features include \"Power Crushes\" (an attack that cannot be interrupted by regular attacks once the animation has begun) and \"Rage Arts\" (attacks that can only be used when your character has hit a Raged state near the end of their vitality meter, sacrificing the Rage mode to perform the attack). Bound has been mostly removed save for specific situations (certain moves can cause a Bound if not comboed into and all low parries will cause a Bound effect, similar to ''Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion''; floor breaks now result in an effect similar to a Tag Assault in ''Tag 2'' rather than a standard Bound) and instead characters now have more frequent access to an \"Aerial Tailspin\" effect (an attack that throws an opponent backwards onto their head as opposed to straight downwards, although it is still inescapable once triggered which means the combo can continue).\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Mishimafamily.png|thumb|right|The conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series' plot.<ref name=\"mishima\"/> As seen from left to right: Jinpachi Mishima, Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama.]]\n{{main|List of Tekken characters}}\nPlayers can choose from a diverse cast that hails from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and fighting styles.

For example, Heihachi and Kazuya Mishima, by virtues of familial connection and studying under the same Advanced Mishima Style Fighting Karate discipline, have very similar moves and a signature \"crouch dash\" stance for pretty much their entire appearances in the series. [[Jin Kazama]], when he debuted, also had the same Mishima fighting style, though he mixed this with Kazama Style Traditional Martial Arts as practiced by his mother, [[Jun Kazama]]. For storyline reasons, starting on ''Tekken 4'', he forwent this in favor of Traditional Karate, a completely different discipline that technically made him an entirely different character, while his old movelist was given to his demonic form, Devil Jin. Meanwhile, there are some characters who were formerly clones of each other before they diverged and gained unique moves, such as Lee Chaolan (a clone of Marshall Law), Anna Williams (a clone of her sister, Nina), and Armor King (a clone of King).<ref>{{cite book | title=Trigger happy: videogames and the entertainment revolution |author=Poole, Steven| page=151|publisher=Arcade Publishing|isbn=1-55970-598-1| year=2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Tekken 4 \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 History| url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/25904/tekken-4-page-2-history/|date=August 29, 2002|publisher=GamePro|author=Drifter, Tokyo| accessdate=August 21, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905045545/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/25904/tekken-4-page-2-history/| url-status=live|archivedate=September 5, 2012}}</ref> Still further, there are also characters who are replacements or \"successors\" of older characters; this happened principally in ''Tekken 3'' due to the significant time skip, though some older characters later returned alongside their successors anyway.
