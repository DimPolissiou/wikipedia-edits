By default, Player 1 and Player 2 can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled. Along with the ship's primary weapons, the player also has access to three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player's ship and scrolls \"up\" the screen, one that makes a powerful circular, nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets. The game has six stages.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Development ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Viewpoint'' also saw release on a variety of home platforms, including the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] game consoles, as well as the [[Sharp X68000]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms. A port for the [[Sega Saturn]] was due in 1996;<ref>{{cite news|last= |first= |title=It Depends on Your Viewpoint|work=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=7|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=May 1996|page=8}}</ref> however, it was cancelled. At one point, an 8-bit version for the [[Game Boy Color]] was planned,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/07/23/game-boy-colors-viewpoint|title=Game Boy Color's Viewpoint|last=Staff|first=I. G. N.|date=1999-07-22|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref> but it was cancelled.\n\nThe Genesis version features a sound and graphical style similar the Neo-Geo arcade game, but has considerably fewer enemies, a lower color palette and suffers from slowdown. The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same. The X68000 version, trimmed down like the Genesis version, is similar to that port in terms of sound and visual style. The FM Towns platform received the truest-to-arcade port, although it suffers the occasional slowdown.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = Arcade: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065514/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Neo Geo: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065516/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Genesis: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Michael |first=Christopher |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116034121/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> PS1: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Sackenheim |first=Shawn |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211012111/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |archivedate=December 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| CVG = Arcade: 95%<ref name=\"CVG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/225/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| EGM = Genesis: 35 / 50<ref name=\"egm65\"/> <br /> PS1: 30.5 / 40<ref name=\"egm78\"/>\n| Fam = Neo Geo: 30 / 40<ref name=\"Fam\"/>\n| GameFan = Neo Geo: 198.5 / 200<ref name=\"GameFan\"/> <br /> PS1: 233 / 300<ref>''GameFan'', volume 4, issue 1 (January 1996), page 16</ref>\n| GMaster = Neo Geo: 93%<ref>''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'', issue 9 (September 1993), pages 62-63 (published 19 August 1993)</ref> <br /> PS1: 89%<ref name=\"GMasterPS1\">''[[GamesMaster]]'', episode 90 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZdroNphXA&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 10]), November 23, 1995</ref>\n| Play = PS1: 74%<ref>''Play'', issue 2 (December 1995), pages 60-61 (published 16 November 1995)</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Maximum''\n| rev1Score = PS1: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max2\"/>\n| NGen = Genesis: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen3\"/><br />PS1: {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"NGen13\"/>\n| rev3 = ''{{ill|Player One (magazine)|lt=Player One|fr|Player One|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev3Score = Neo Geo: 97%<ref name=\"player1\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[Sinclair User]]''\n| rev4Score = Arcade: 96%<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/157/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''{{ill|Video Games (magazine)|lt=Video Games|de|Video Games|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev5Score = Neo Geo: 84%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-12-2634.html |title=Viewpoint (Neo Geo) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> Mega Drive: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-4-746.html |title=Viewpoint (Mega Drive) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> PS1: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-10-1998.html |title=Viewpoint (PlayStation) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = Best Graphics in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award2Pub = ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''\n| award2 = Best Music in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award3Pub = [[GameFan|''GameFan'' Megawards]]\n| award3 = Best Shooter (Genesis)<ref>''GameFan'', volume 3, issue 1 (January 1995), pages 68-75</ref>\n}}\n\nThe Neo Geo version received a positive critical reception.

By default, Player 1 and Player 2 can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled. Along with the ship's primary weapons, the player also has access to three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player's ship and scrolls \"up\" the screen, one that makes a powerful circular, nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets. The game has six stages.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Development ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Viewpoint'' also saw release on a variety of home platforms, including the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] game consoles, as well as the [[Sharp X68000]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms. A port for the [[Sega Saturn]] was due in 1996;<ref>{{cite news|last= |first= |title=It Depends on Your Viewpoint|work=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=7|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=May 1996|page=8}}</ref> however, it was cancelled. At one point, an 8-bit version for the [[Game Boy Color]] was planned,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/07/23/game-boy-colors-viewpoint|title=Game Boy Color's Viewpoint|last=Staff|first=I.

The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same. The X68000 version, trimmed down like the Genesis version, is similar to that port in terms of sound and visual style. The FM Towns platform received the truest-to-arcade port, although it suffers the occasional slowdown.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = Arcade: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065514/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Neo Geo: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065516/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Genesis: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Michael |first=Christopher |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116034121/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> PS1: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Sackenheim |first=Shawn |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211012111/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |archivedate=December 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| CVG = Arcade: 95%<ref name=\"CVG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/225/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| EGM = Genesis: 35 / 50<ref name=\"egm65\"/> <br /> PS1: 30.5 / 40<ref name=\"egm78\"/>\n| Fam = Neo Geo: 30 / 40<ref name=\"Fam\"/>\n| GameFan = Neo Geo: 198.5 / 200<ref name=\"GameFan\"/> <br /> PS1: 233 / 300<ref>''GameFan'', volume 4, issue 1 (January 1996), page 16</ref>\n| GMaster = Neo Geo: 93%<ref>''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'', issue 9 (September 1993), pages 62-63 (published 19 August 1993)</ref> <br /> PS1: 89%<ref name=\"GMasterPS1\">''[[GamesMaster]]'', episode 90 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZdroNphXA&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 10]), November 23, 1995</ref>\n| Play = PS1: 74%<ref>''Play'', issue 2 (December 1995), pages 60-61 (published 16 November 1995)</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Maximum''\n| rev1Score = PS1: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max2\"/>\n| NGen = Genesis: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen3\"/><br />PS1: {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"NGen13\"/>\n| rev3 = ''{{ill|Player One (magazine)|lt=Player One|fr|Player One|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev3Score = Neo Geo: 97%<ref name=\"player1\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[Sinclair User]]''\n| rev4Score = Arcade: 96%<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/157/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''{{ill|Video Games (magazine)|lt=Video Games|de|Video Games|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev5Score = Neo Geo: 84%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-12-2634.html |title=Viewpoint (Neo Geo) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> Mega Drive: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-4-746.html |title=Viewpoint (Mega Drive) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> PS1: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-10-1998.html |title=Viewpoint (PlayStation) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = Best Graphics in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award2Pub = ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''\n| award2 = Best Music in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award3Pub = [[GameFan|''GameFan'' Megawards]]\n| award3 = Best Shooter (Genesis)<ref>''GameFan'', volume 3, issue 1 (January 1995), pages 68-75</ref>\n}}\n\nThe Neo Geo version received a positive critical reception.

Only one document survives mentioning the mediaeval town of Lel\u00e9r\u0151l, believed to have been named by Deac Laz\u0103r around 1521. The village was put on a formal footing in 1872 after the etimology seems to be a romanian village as such name is not present in Hungarian language.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, built in 1902, lies in the village square. It was donated by Bishop [[S\u00e1ndor Dessewffy]] (b. 1931). The villagers drilled a well to supply water, and the main square is named the Heroes' Well. Today, it is just an artifact; the water has all been used up.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nMaroslele has all the features of a modern Western European community. It is connected to the water, gas, electricity and telephone networks and has broadband internet. The Hungarian government's plans focus mainly on education and entrepreneurship, innovation, culture, sports and recreation, and target the current regeneration of the town.\n\nThe local library holds around ten thousand books and has space for exhibitions and conferences, as well as providing resources for historical research. It also provides computers for internet access. <!-- er, isn't this what a library does? but keep for now. Must be interesting enough to keep on HU:WP, and the way the UK is going, it may be of interest, because 350 of ours are about to close -->\n\n==Geography==\nMaroslele lies between the [[K\u00f6r\u00f6s River]] and the [[Maros River]] ({{lang-ro|Mure\u0219}}). The estuary of the Maros lies very close to village. Before the river was controlled, the area was very swampy and reedy. The floodplain of the [[K\u00f6r\u00f6s-Maros National Park]] conservation area is nearby.\n\nThe [[subsoil]] of the village is of [[clay]], which can make for hard living: it is prone to flood in rainy seasons, and can become very muddy.\n\n==Transport==\nThe village is accessible from [[Mak\u00f3]] from the west, about {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Szeged]]. By ferry it is about {{convert|17|km|0|abbr=on}} and from [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] it is about {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 2011, the [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|Hungarian motorway M43]] (under completion) made a connexion to the village.\n\nPublic transport is provided by [[Tisza Vol\u00e1n]]. <!-- This probably deserves an article, add it to the list TODO -->\n\n==History==\nThe first known record of the village is in 1274 as \"Lele\". The origin of \"Maroslele\" is not clear; the first part obviously comes from the [[Maros River]] but the second part of the name (\"Lele\") possibly comes from the Hungarian word for soul ({{lang|hu|lelek}}).\n\nIn 1596, the [[Ottoman Empire]] razed the village. After the Ottoman reign, the town of [[Mak\u00f3]] used the land for grazing until the end of the 18th century.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, peasant farmers moved to the village and started to grow tobacco.  Not much later the village became part of the Diocese of Csan\u00e1d County. In 1873 Maroslele becomes an official settlement.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century the residents started to buy out the lands from the bishop. The bishop helped to build a church and a school and the residents changed the name of the village to {{lang|hu|P\u00fcsp\u00f6klele}} (\"Bishopsoul\") as an honour. They raised a stone cross in front of the church in remembrance of him.\n\nDuring the World Wars many people lost their lives in the village. The Russians took occupation at the end of the Second World War, and they changed its name to Maroslele, in 1950.\n\nThe Local History Collection has a collection of ironworking machines that were used in the village. The Historical Compendium of The Village Blacksmith lists them all.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Library Maroslele.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Maroslele library]]\n[[File:Village Hall Maroslele.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Maroslele Village Hall]]\n* Plaque of J\u00f3zsef Annus\n* Cross in the memory of [[S\u00e1ndor Dessewffy]]\n* War memorial\n* Crucifix, at the edge of the village\n* Local history collection\n* Well of the heroes\n* Roman Catholic church\n* Vetyeh\u00e1t Forest\n\n==Economy==\nThe area is mostly agricultural, and crops such as paprika, grain, and arable crops are grown.

It covers an area of {{convert|46.56|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} between the southeastern part of the [[Tisza River]] and [[Maros River]] and in 2009 had a population of 2,084.<ref name=\"ksh cite\">{{cite web\n|url={{ksh url}}10515\n|title=Maroslele\n|date=1 January 2011\n|accessdate=14 January 2012\n|publisher=[[Hungarian Central Statistical Office]]\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe village was first mentioned in records dating from 1214. Only one document survives mentioning the mediaeval town of Lel\u00e9r\u0151l, believed to have been named by Deac Laz\u0103r around 1521. The village was put on a formal footing in 1872 after the etimology seems to be a romanian village as such name is not present in Hungarian language.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, built in 1902, lies in the village square. It was donated by Bishop [[S\u00e1ndor Dessewffy]] (b. 1931). The villagers drilled a well to supply water, and the main square is named the Heroes' Well. Today, it is just an artifact; the water has all been used up.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nMaroslele has all the features of a modern Western European community. It is connected to the water, gas, electricity and telephone networks and has broadband internet. The Hungarian government's plans focus mainly on education and entrepreneurship, innovation, culture, sports and recreation, and target the current regeneration of the town.\n\nThe local library holds around ten thousand books and has space for exhibitions and conferences, as well as providing resources for historical research. It also provides computers for internet access. <!-- er, isn't this what a library does? but keep for now. Must be interesting enough to keep on HU:WP, and the way the UK is going, it may be of interest, because 350 of ours are about to close -->\n\n==Geography==\nMaroslele lies between the [[K\u00f6r\u00f6s River]] and the [[Maros River]] ({{lang-ro|Mure\u0219}}). The estuary of the Maros lies very close to village. Before the river was controlled, the area was very swampy and reedy. The floodplain of the [[K\u00f6r\u00f6s-Maros National Park]] conservation area is nearby.\n\nThe [[subsoil]] of the village is of [[clay]], which can make for hard living: it is prone to flood in rainy seasons, and can become very muddy.\n\n==Transport==\nThe village is accessible from [[Mak\u00f3]] from the west, about {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Szeged]]. By ferry it is about {{convert|17|km|0|abbr=on}} and from [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]] it is about {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 2011, the [[M43 motorway (Hungary)|Hungarian motorway M43]] (under completion) made a connexion to the village.\n\nPublic transport is provided by [[Tisza Vol\u00e1n]]. <!-- This probably deserves an article, add it to the list TODO -->\n\n==History==\nThe first known record of the village is in 1274 as \"Lele\". The origin of \"Maroslele\" is not clear; the first part obviously comes from the [[Maros River]] but the second part of the name (\"Lele\") possibly comes from the Hungarian word for soul ({{lang|hu|lelek}}).\n\nIn 1596, the [[Ottoman Empire]] razed the village. After the Ottoman reign, the town of [[Mak\u00f3]] used the land for grazing until the end of the 18th century.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, peasant farmers moved to the village and started to grow tobacco.  Not much later the village became part of the Diocese of Csan\u00e1d County. In 1873 Maroslele becomes an official settlement.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century the residents started to buy out the lands from the bishop. The bishop helped to build a church and a school and the residents changed the name of the village to {{lang|hu|P\u00fcsp\u00f6klele}} (\"Bishopsoul\") as an honour. They raised a stone cross in front of the church in remembrance of him.\n\nDuring the World Wars many people lost their lives in the village. The Russians took occupation at the end of the Second World War, and they changed its name to Maroslele, in 1950.\n\nThe Local History Collection has a collection of ironworking machines that were used in the village. The Historical Compendium of The Village Blacksmith lists them all.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Library Maroslele.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Maroslele library]]\n[[File:Village Hall Maroslele.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Maroslele Village Hall]]\n* Plaque of J\u00f3zsef Annus\n* Cross in the memory of [[S\u00e1ndor Dessewffy]]\n* War memorial\n* Crucifix, at the edge of the village\n* Local history collection\n* Well of the heroes\n* Roman Catholic church\n* Vetyeh\u00e1t Forest\n\n==Economy==\nThe area is mostly agricultural, and crops such as paprika, grain, and arable crops are grown.

Though he was able to successfully market his skills from a young age, it's likely that the relatively sparse demand for painted portraits, a luxury good, was the main factor necessitating an itinerant career that saw the artist move regularly, family perhaps in tow, between western Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the [[Hudson River Valley]]. The artist moved on as he exhausted the demand of the local community for painted \"likenesses\". This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic, rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits, which are almost always set within interiors. A letter from the American artist [[John Vanderlyn]] to his nephew, John Vanderlyn, Jr., from Kingston, New York, dated September 9, 1825, stated, \"Were I to begin life again, I should not hesitate to follow this plan, that is, to paint portraits cheap and slight, for the mass of folks can't judge of the merits of a well finished picture, I am more and more persuaded of this. Indeed, moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does, must be an agreeable way of passing ones time. I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburgh's the other day painted a year or two ago, which seemed to satisfy them.\"<ref>Black and Holdridge 1969, p. 14.</ref> Such comments from a well established academic painter such as Vanderlyn positions Phillips not as a wandering peddler of art, but instead as an artist with social and economic importance. This is also visible in his  clientele, which consisted of judges, doctors and business owners.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Black|first=Mary|title=Ammi Phillips: Portrait Painter 1788 - 1865|publisher=Clarkson N. Potter, Inc.|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nWe may contrast this somewhat supercilious opinion of Phillips' artistic worth with the conclusion of the twentieth-century art critic [[Hilton Kramer]], who wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1970, \"In the ''Plain and Fancy'' exhibition, for example, there are five portraits by the amazing Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865), and at least two of them\u2014the portraits of Mrs. Isaac Cox and of Deacon Benjamin Benedict (both about 1836)\u2014are of superb quality. To the modern eye, the portrait of Mrs. Cox particularly speaks with a clarity, precision, and sympathy that places it considerably nearer to our own standards of artistic probity than anything to be found in the common run of 'serious' painting at the time. If this is 'innocent' painting, it is innocent only of those flatulent academic pretensions which remained the curse of so much of our art in the 19th century.\"\n\nAmmi Phillips lived into the era of the daguerreotype, and his last portraits show this influence He died on July 15, 1865, age 72, in Curtisville, Massachusetts, just outside Stockbridge, where his death certificate is filed in the Town Hall. He was buried in Amenia, New York, where he had lived earlier in his life.\n\n==''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog''==\n[[File:Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ammi Phillips, ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', 1830-1835]]The artist's most famous work is ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', which is in the collection of the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in New York.

The anonymous painter of these strongly colored works, which dated from the 1830s, became known as the \"Kent Limner\", after the locality where they had come to light.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nStylistically distinct from those of the \"Kent Limner\", a second group of early-19th-century paintings emerged after 1940 in the area near the Connecticut\u2013[[New York (state)|New York]] border. Attributed at the time to an unknown \"Border Limner\", these works, dating from the period 1812\u20131819, were characterized by soft [[pastel]] hues and limited drawing skills, as seen in the portraits of ''Mrs. Russell Dorr and Baby'', now in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection, Williamsburg, Virginia, and of ''Harriet Leavens'', now in the [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"Mills\">Mills, Sally. \"Phillips, Ammi.\" ''Grove Art Online.

Retrieved June 2, 2014.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1958 that Ammi Phillips' identity as the painter of both groups of portraits was established by Barbara and Larry Holdridge, and endorsed by Mary Black, writing on May 21, 1959, to three fellow folk-art historians, \"You are the ones who should be the first to know that I have joined the opposition [i.e., the Holdridges] and now believe that the Border Limner, Ammi Phillips, A.

Later he glossed over problems with anatomy by using flat dark-colored backgrounds and dark dresses and suits\".<ref name=\"Black1976\"/> Phillips' work influenced the style of his younger contemporary, [[Erastus Salisbury Field]], who worked as an itinerant portrait painter in the region just east of Phillips.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nThe Museum of American Folk Art showed its first major exhibition devoted to the work of a single folk portraitist to \"Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter 1788\u20131865,\" on exhibit from October 16 to December 2, 1968.

In 1855 he was recorded as \"artist\", and was reported to be living in New Mariborough, Massachusetts. In 1860 he was in Curtisville, Pennsylvania, and in 1865, he was living in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Allaway|first=David R.|title=My People: The Work of Ammi Phillips|publisher=|year=March 2020|isbn=978-0-9987122-1-5|location=https://issuu.com/n2xb/docs/ammi_phillips_-_analysis__indexed_|pages=105}}</ref>\n\nPhillips died on July 11th, 1865, at his home in Curtisville.

[[Reuben Moulthrop|Rueben Moulthrop]], Nathaniel Wales, Uriah Brown, and [[Samuel Broadbent]] are all artists traced by documents to the area, and stylistic elements of their work can be seen in Phillip's own early paintings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Black|first=Mary|title=Ammi Phillips: Portrait Painter 1788 - 1865|publisher=Clarkson N.

Though he was able to successfully market his skills from a young age, it's likely that the relatively sparse demand for painted portraits, a luxury good, was the main factor necessitating an itinerant career that saw the artist move regularly, family perhaps in tow, between western Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the [[Hudson River Valley]]. The artist moved on as he exhausted the demand of the local community for painted \"likenesses\". This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic, rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits, which are almost always set within interiors. A letter from the American artist [[John Vanderlyn]] to his nephew, John Vanderlyn, Jr., from Kingston, New York, dated September 9, 1825, stated, \"Were I to begin life again, I should not hesitate to follow this plan, that is, to paint portraits cheap and slight, for the mass of folks can't judge of the merits of a well finished picture, I am more and more persuaded of this. Indeed, moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does, must be an agreeable way of passing ones time. I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburgh's the other day painted a year or two ago, which seemed to satisfy them.\"<ref>Black and Holdridge 1969, p. 14.</ref> Such comments from a well established academic painter such as Vanderlyn positions Phillips not as a wandering peddler of art, but instead as an artist with social and economic importance. This is also visible in his  clientele, which consisted of judges, doctors and business owners.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Black|first=Mary|title=Ammi Phillips: Portrait Painter 1788 - 1865|publisher=Clarkson N. Potter, Inc.|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nWe may contrast this somewhat supercilious opinion of Phillips' artistic worth with the conclusion of the twentieth-century art critic [[Hilton Kramer]], who wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1970, \"In the ''Plain and Fancy'' exhibition, for example, there are five portraits by the amazing Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865), and at least two of them\u2014the portraits of Mrs. Isaac Cox and of Deacon Benjamin Benedict (both about 1836)\u2014are of superb quality. To the modern eye, the portrait of Mrs. Cox particularly speaks with a clarity, precision, and sympathy that places it considerably nearer to our own standards of artistic probity than anything to be found in the common run of 'serious' painting at the time. If this is 'innocent' painting, it is innocent only of those flatulent academic pretensions which remained the curse of so much of our art in the 19th century.\"\n\nAmmi Phillips lived into the era of the daguerreotype, and his last portraits show this influence He died on July 15, 1865, age 72, in Curtisville, Massachusetts, just outside Stockbridge, where his death certificate is filed in the Town Hall. He was buried in Amenia, New York, where he had lived earlier in his life.\n\n==''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog''==\n[[File:Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ammi Phillips, ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', 1830-1835]]The artist's most famous work is ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', which is in the collection of the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in New York.

A dog peeked out from under her chair. The details were saccharine, but they could not obscure the force and beauty of the painting.\"<ref>Cole, Teju. Open City. New York: Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2012. P. 36.</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery of the Artist and Reconstruction of his Body of Work==\n\nPhillips' modern rediscovery began in 1924, when a group of portraits of women, shown leaning forward in three-quarter view and wearing dark dresses, were displayed in an antique show in [[Kent, Connecticut]]. The anonymous painter of these strongly colored works, which dated from the 1830s, became known as the \"Kent Limner\", after the locality where they had come to light.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nStylistically distinct from those of the \"Kent Limner\", a second group of early-19th-century paintings emerged after 1940 in the area near the Connecticut\u2013[[New York (state)|New York]] border. Attributed at the time to an unknown \"Border Limner\", these works, dating from the period 1812\u20131819, were characterized by soft [[pastel]] hues and limited drawing skills, as seen in the portraits of ''Mrs. Russell Dorr and Baby'', now in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection, Williamsburg, Virginia, and of ''Harriet Leavens'', now in the [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"Mills\">Mills, Sally. \"Phillips, Ammi.\" ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Retrieved June 2, 2014.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1958 that Ammi Phillips' identity as the painter of both groups of portraits was established by Barbara and Larry Holdridge, and endorsed by Mary Black, writing on May 21, 1959, to three fellow folk-art historians, \"You are the ones who should be the first to know that I have joined the opposition [i.e., the Holdridges] and now believe that the Border Limner, Ammi Phillips, A. Phillips, and the Kent Limner are one and the same person.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Additional works were identified, showing the artist's transition from the delicate coloration of the Border period to the bold and dramatic works that followed.

Later he glossed over problems with anatomy by using flat dark-colored backgrounds and dark dresses and suits\".<ref name=\"Black1976\"/> Phillips' work influenced the style of his younger contemporary, [[Erastus Salisbury Field]], who worked as an itinerant portrait painter in the region just east of Phillips.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nThe Museum of American Folk Art showed its first major exhibition devoted to the work of a single folk portraitist to \"Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter 1788\u20131865,\" on exhibit from October 16 to December 2, 1968.
