This could lead to several implications to the combined business, ranging from litigation to inability to combine operations in California. The CPUC released an order stating that they cannot begin the merger of their California operations until after the CPUC issues a final decision on the pending application, scheduled for the April 16 Voting Meeting. Mike Sievert, new T-Mobile's CEO, stated that he has the view that \u201cthe Commission lacks jurisdiction over this transaction\u201d and that T-Mobile believes that the FCC has exclusive authority to approve wireless deals. The company also has several objections to the PUC's conditions of closure, and may countersue if litigation happens or approval is under current conditions. Either way, T-Mobile has stated they are officially combined, whether or not the PUC litigates, and have warned investors of possible costs from litigation. However, they don't expect it to have significant harm on the value of the transaction or timeline of changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2020/04/california-puc-t-mobile-sprint-cant-merge-final-decision-deal/|title=California PUC says T-Mobile and Sprint can't merge until it makes a final decision on the deal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/t-mobile-sprint-took-a-risk-by-finishing-merger-without-calif-approval/|title=T-Mobile, Sprint took a risk by finishing merger without Calif. approval|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|date=2020-04-02|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Support ===\nOn September 21, 2018, [[TracFone Wireless|Tracfone Wireless]] voiced it's support for the merger.

This could lead to several implications to the combined business, ranging from litigation to inability to combine operations in California. The CPUC released an order stating that they cannot begin the merger of their California operations until after the CPUC issues a final decision on the pending application, scheduled for the April 16 Voting Meeting. Mike Sievert, new T-Mobile's CEO, stated that he has the view that \u201cthe Commission lacks jurisdiction over this transaction\u201d and that T-Mobile believes that the FCC has exclusive authority to approve wireless deals. The company also has several objections to the PUC's conditions of closure, and may countersue if litigation happens or approval is under current conditions. Either way, T-Mobile has stated they are officially combined, whether or not the PUC litigates, and have warned investors of possible costs from litigation. However, they don't expect it to have significant harm on the value of the transaction or timeline of changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2020/04/california-puc-t-mobile-sprint-cant-merge-final-decision-deal/|title=California PUC says T-Mobile and Sprint can't merge until it makes a final decision on the deal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/t-mobile-sprint-took-a-risk-by-finishing-merger-without-calif-approval/|title=T-Mobile, Sprint took a risk by finishing merger without Calif. approval|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|date=2020-04-02|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Support ===\nOn September 21, 2018, [[TracFone Wireless|Tracfone Wireless]] voiced it's support for the merger.

Some of these missions include conducting Long-Range Reconnaissance Patrols (LRRP), [[Raid (military)|raids]] against high-value targets, locating enemy command and control centres, targeting and destruction of enemy air defences and radar systems, and [[Prisoner of war|POW]] rescue operations. The unit can be infiltrated by parachute, helicopter, small boat, or by foot.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe CTOE, heir of the historical traditions of ''Regimento de Infantaria 9'' (9th Infantry Regiment), was created on 16 April 1960 to form units specialised in counter-guerrilla operations, psychological operations, and mountaineering. These special, [[light-infantry]] units were called ''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' (Special Hunters; the regular army light-infantry units were just called Hunters) and were the first units in the Portuguese Army to wear a [[beret]] (brown) and [[Disruptive Pattern Material|camouflage]]. They were elite units, with highly motivated, hand-picked personnel, whose instructors had taken courses on counter-insurgency and counter-guerrilla operations in [[France]], [[Algeria]], the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Spain]]. When the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] began in 1961, there were already four [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of Special Hunters in [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]]. Early in the fighting, the ''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' received updated 7,62&nbsp;mm NATO small arms such as the Espingarda m/961 ([[Heckler & Koch G3]]) and the FN/German G1 [[FN FAL|FAL]] rifle (known as the m/962); the FAL was a favored weapon of the ''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' due to its lighter weight and better practical accuracy compared to the m/961 G3. The 4th Company Ca\u00e7adores Especiais in particular was a very active one (their website contains lots of photos and detailed mission chronology, [http://www.4cce.org/]). Still, by the end of 1961, the Special Hunters had been disbanded: some of their training was incorporated into the instruction of the regular army Hunter companies, and the brown beret and camouflage spread to the whole Army. The CTOE remained, now tasked with giving their courses to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[NCOs]], and to form [[Portuguese Army Commandos|commando troops]].\n\n[[File:Ig-conv-sta-cruz.jpg|thumb|Infantry Regiment 9, headquartes of the Special Operations Troops Center - Old Santa Cruz Convent, Lamego, Portugal]]\n\nAfter the creation of the special operations unit in 1981, the CTOE ceased to be just an instruction facility but also served as the HQ for the new Portuguese special operations unit. The unit members wear a grass green beret and are the heir of the Special Hunters: the beret badge includes a trumpet \u2014 a symbol of the Special Hunters; and the unit is known as Rangers because the first instructors of the Special Hunters completed the [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]] Course and adapted the characteristics of that training to the Special Operations Course. The unit has operated in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[East-Timor]], [[Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]].\n\n== Rangers Commandments ==\n*1st - The '''RANGER''' is self-disciplined and of willing obedience;\n*2nd - The '''RANGER''' resists hunger, thirst, tiredness and discomfort;\n*3rd - The '''RANGER''' is always ready because his reason demands it and his preparation allows it;\n*4th - The '''RANGER''' consciously ponders all his decisions and never turns his back towards danger;\n*5th - The '''RANGER''' has confidence in leaders, respects them and makes himself loved by his subordinates;\n*6th - The '''RANGER''' is generous in victory and patient in adversity;\n*7th - The '''RANGER''' regulates its procedure according to the dictates of honor and duty;\n*8th - The '''RANGER''' is proud of the dignity of his mission devoted to it with enthusiasm and dedication;\n*9th - The '''RANGER''' is loyal and has in patriotism the noblest of his virtues;\n*10th - The '''RANGER''' constantly overcomes himself for firm will and indomitable value.\n\n== CTOE Courses ==\nThe CTOE has several courses:\n\n* ''COE - Curso de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais'' (Special Operations Course): [[Direct action (military)|direct action]] (reconnaissance, raids, hostage and POW rescues) and indirect action ([[insurgency]] and [[guerrilla]], [[counter-insurgency]] and counter-guerrilla, military aid) - 21 weeks.\n* [[Sniper]] Course (requires previous COE): 14 weeks.\n* Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol Course (requires previous COE): [[reconnaissance]] and direct action special operations (8 weeks).\n* Irregular Operations Course (only for officers and NCOs of the permanent cadre): organisation, instruction, and orientation of irregular forces with of the objective of defending the national territory ([[Portugal]]) when invaded and start the [[resistance movement|resistance]] (4 weeks).\n* [[Psychological Operations]] Course.\n* Mountaineering Course.\n* Terrorist Threats' Prevention and Combat Course.\n\n[[File:Rangers on parade.jpg|thumb|Rangers on parade]]\n[[File:Mountain warfare.jpg|thumb|Mountain warfare]]\n[[File:Anti-terrorism.jpg|thumb|Anti-terrorism]]\n[[File:Unconventional warfare.jpg|thumb|Unconventional warfare]]\n[[File:Incursion by boat.jpg|thumb|Incursion by boat]]\n[[File:Jungle warfare.jpg|thumb|Jungle warfare]]\n[[File:The traditional green beret.jpg|thumb|The traditional green beret]]\n[[File:Completion of Special Operations Course.jpg|thumb|Completion of Special Operations Course.

(abbreviated '''''WWTBAM''''' and informally known as simply '''''Millionaire''''') is an international television [[game show]] franchise of British origin, created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and [[Steven Knight]]. In its format, currently owned and licensed by [[Sony Pictures Television]], contestants tackle a series of multiple-choice questions to win large cash prizes in a format that twists on many game show genre conventions \u2013 only one contestant plays at a time, similar to radio quizzes; contestants are given the question before attempting an answer, and have no time limit to answer questions; and the amount offered increases as they tackle questions that become increasingly difficult. The maximum cash prize offered in most versions of the format is one million of the local currency.\n\nThe [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (British game show)|original British version]] debuted on 4 September 1998 on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network and was aired until its final episode on 11 February 2014. A revived series of seven episodes to commemorate its 20th anniversary aired from 5 to 11 May 2018. The revival received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans, as well as high viewing figures, leading ITV to renew the show for another series. Since its debut, international variants of the game show have been aired in around 160 countries worldwide.\n\n==History==\nThe format of the show was created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight, who had earlier created a number of the promotional games for Tarrant's [[Breakfast television|morning show]] on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] radio, such as the [[bong game]]. Tentatively known as ''Cash Mountain'',<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> the show took its finalised title from a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (song)|song]] written by [[Cole Porter]] for the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', starring by [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Celeste Holm]]. Since the original version launched, several individuals have claimed that they originated the format and that Celador had breached their [[copyright]]. While many pursued litigation, none were successful, and each claim was later settled out-of-court on an agreement/settlement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xavierax.com/ebook.pdf |title=Millionaire 2nd Edition.qxd |last=Leonard |first=John J. |year=2005 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801163453/http://www.xavierax.com/ebook.pdf |archive-date=1 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The show that should have made me a million|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/29/1048653901387.html|author=Daniel Dasey|publisher=The Sydney Sun-Herald|date=30 March 2003}}</ref><ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaymercury/news/tm_objectid=15908484&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=who-wants-to-sue-a-millionaire-name_page.html Birmingham Sunday Mercury], 28 August 2005</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, original producer [[Celador]] announced that it was seeking to sell the worldwide rights to ''Millionaire'', together with the rest of its British programme library, as the first phase of a sell-off of the company's format and production divisions. \nBritish television producer Paul Smith first had the idea to franchise the UK programme internationally. He developed a series of standards for international variants that ensured they mirrored the British original closely. For example, all hosts were required to appear on-screen wearing [[Armani]] suits, as Tarrant did in the UK; producers were forbidden from hiring local composers to create original music, instead using the same music cues used by the British version; and the lighting system and set design were to adhere faithfully to the way they were presented on the British version.<ref name=\"Walmsley\">{{cite web|title=Millionaire|url=http://www.andywalmsley.com/millionaire.php|publisher=Andy Walmsley, Production Designer|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> Some of Smith's rules have been slightly relaxed over the years as the franchise's history has progressed.\n\nDutch company [[2waytraffic]] ultimately acquired ''Millionaire'' and all of Celador's other programmes. Two years later, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] purchased 2waytraffic for \u00a3137.5 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/13/television.mediabusiness | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Sony to buy Millionaire firm for \u00a3137.5m | first=Chris | last=Tryhorn | date=13 March 2008}}</ref> [[Sony Pictures Television]] currently owns and licenses the show's format. [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television]], [[the Walt Disney Company]]'s in-home sales and content distribution firm controls the U.S. version independent of Sony.\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Rules===\nA group of contestants on each episode play a preliminary round called \"Fastest Finger First\". All are given a question by the host and four answers which must be placed within a particular order; in the first season of the original version (1998) and the first four seasons of the Australian version (1999\u20132002), contestants have to simply answer a multiple-choice question. If any contestants are visually impaired, the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music for this round begins. The contestant who not only answers correctly, but in the fastest time, goes on to play the main game. In the event that no one gets the question right, another question is given; if two or more contestants answer correctly but with the same time, they are given a tie-breaker amongst them to determine who will move on. This round is only used when a new contestant is being chosen to play the main round, and can be played more than once in an episode amongst those remaining within the group seeking to play the main game. In celebrity editions, the round is not used; celebrities automatically take part in the main game.\n\nOnce a contestant enters the main game, they are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Each features four possible answers, in which the contestant must give the correct answer. Doing so wins them a certain amount of money, with tackling much tougher questions increasing their prize fund. During their game, the player has a set of lifelines that they may use only once to help them with a question, as well as two \"safety nets\" \u2013 if a contestant gets a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they will leave with that amount as their prize. While the first few questions are generally easy, subsequent ones after them will prompt the host to ask if the answer they gave is their \"final answer\" \u2013 if it is, then it is locked in and cannot be changed. If a contestant feels unsure about an answer, and does not wish to play on, they can walk away with the money they have won, to which the host will ask them to confirm this as their final decision; in such cases, the host will usually ask them to state what answer they would have gone for, and reveal if it would have been correct or incorrect.\n\n====Original format====\nDuring the British original, between 1998 and 2007, the show's format required contestants to answer fifteen questions. The payout structure was as follows:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/fewer-and-harder-questions-on-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-6605687.html|title=Fewer \u2013 and Harder \u2013 Questions on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''|author=[[Show business|Showbiz]]|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=13 August 2007|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Question number\n!Question value\n|-\n!(Bold zones are the guaranteed levels)\n|-\n|1\n|\u00a3100\n|-\n|2\n|\u00a3200\n|-\n|3\n|\u00a3300\n|-\n|4\n|\u00a3500\n|-\n!'''5'''\n!'''\u00a31,000'''\n|-\n|6\n|\u00a32,000\n|-\n|7\n|\u00a34,000\n|-\n|8\n|\u00a38,000\n|-\n|9\n|\u00a316,000\n|-\n!'''10'''\n!'''\u00a332,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|\u00a364,000\n|-\n|12\n|\u00a3125,000\n|-\n|13\n|\u00a3250,000\n|-\n|14\n|\u00a3500,000\n|-\n!'''15'''\n!'''<big>\u00a31,000,000</big>'''\n|}\n{{anchor|12-question format}}\nAfter 2007, the format was changed, reducing the number of questions to twelve; the overall change in format was later incorporated into a number of international versions over a period of four years, including the Arab, Bulgarian, Dutch, French, Polish, Spanish, and Turkish versions. The payout structure, as a whole, was subsequently changed as a result, with the second safety net relocated to \u00a350,000:<ref>{{cite web|first=Neil|last=Wilkes|date=13 August 2007 |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a71325/new-prize-levels-for-millionaire.html#~oP1HgrOEjOnZxt |title=New prize levels for ''Millionaire'' |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]] |accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Question number\n!Question value\n|-\n!(Bold zones are the guaranteed levels)\n|-\n|1\n|\u00a3500\n|-\n!'''2'''\n!'''\u00a31,000'''\n|-\n|3\n|\u00a32,000\n|-\n|4\n|\u00a35,000\n|-\n|5\n|\u00a310,000\n|-\n|6\n|\u00a320,000\n|-\n!'''7'''\n!'''\u00a350,000'''\n|-\n|8\n|\u00a375,000\n|-\n|9\n|\u00a3150,000\n|-\n|10\n|\u00a3250,000\n|-\n|11\n|\u00a3500,000\n|-\n!'''12'''\n!'''<big>\u00a31,000,000</big>'''\n|}\nWhen the game show was revived for British television in 2018, the format was changed a second time, reverting to the original arrangement used before 2007, but with one notable difference, in that the second safety net was made adjustable \u2013 once a contestant reached \u00a31,000, the host would ask them, before giving the next question, if they wish to set the next cash prize amount as the second safety net, with this allowing them to set up as high as \u00a3500,000 in their game as a result.\n\n====U.S. format====\nAn American syndication of the game show was conceived after the British original proved successful, debuting in 2002. The only difference between it and the British version was that episodes were halved in length \u2013 30 minutes, as opposed to the 60-minute length of the original version. The change meant that the preliminary round of the show was eliminated, and contestants had to pass a more conventional game show qualification test. Exceptions to this arrangement, in which it was used under the name \"Fastest Finger\" included: primetime special editions of the programme; the 2004 series that was dubbed ''Super Millionaire'', in which the final prize was increased to $10,000,000;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/02/17/super-millionaire-is-looking-for-few-fast-fingers.html|title=''Super Millionaire'' Is Looking for a Few ''Fast Fingers''|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=17 February 2004|accessdate=18 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130105534/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/02/17/super-millionaire-is-looking-for-few-fast-fingers.html|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and for the 10th anniversary special of the US edition, run during August 2009 for eleven episodes. The decision to remove this round would later occur in other international versions, including the British original.\n\n=====Clock format=====\nIn 2008, the U.S. version changed its format so that contestants were required to answer questions within a set time limit. The limit varied depending on the difficulty of the question:<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080818abc04|title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Kicks Off Seventh Season by Introducing New Changes to the Game, Creating New Levels of Excitement, Emotional Drama and Heart-Pounding Tension for Both Viewers and Contestants|website=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n* 15 seconds for questions 1\u20135\n* 30 seconds for questions 6\u201310\n* 45 seconds for questions 11\u201314\n* 45 seconds, plus any remaining time from the previous 14 questions for question 15\n\nTime for each question began counting down immediately after a question was given and its answers were revealed (but before reading all the answers) but was temporarily paused when a lifeline was used. If a contestant exceeded the time limit, they were forced to walk away with any prize money they had won up to that point; however, if the Double Dip lifeline is in use, then the contestant's winnings drops to the last safe haven attained. This format change was later adopted into other international versions \u2013 the British original, for example, adopted this change for episodes on 3 August 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a231867/format-changes-ahead-for-millionaire.html#~oP2IB7a62U1Vky |title=Format changes ahead for 'Millionaire' |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=23 June 2010 |work=Digital Spy |publisher=Hearst Magazines UK |accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=====Shuffle format=====\nOn 13 September 2010, the U.S. version adopted a second and more significant change in its format. In this change, the game featured two rounds. The first round consisted of ten questions, in which the cash prize associated to each value, along with the category and difficulty for each question is randomised per game. As such, the difficulty of the question in this round, is ''not'' tied to the value associated to it, and a contestant does not know what amount they won unless they provide a correct answer, or choose to walk away. As part of this format, the amount of money a contestant won in this round was banked, but if they walk away before completing the round, they left with half the amount that had been banked; if they gave an incorrect answer during this round, they left with just $1,000.<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\">{{cite web|url= https://www.facebook.com/notes/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire/the-new-season-of-millionaire-is-a-real-game-changer-click-here-to-learn-all-of-/412488051663|title=The New Season of \"Millionaire\" is a Real Game-Changer|publisher= Disney-ABC Domestic Television|date=16 August 2010|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> If they answered all ten questions correctly, they then moved onto the second round, which stuck to the standard format of the game show \u2013 the remaining questions are set to general knowledge and feature cash prizes of high, non-cumulative values. The contestant can, at this point, walk away with the total amount banked from the first round; otherwise, an incorrect answer meant they left with $25,000. The format was later modified for the fourteenth season of the US version, but retained the same arrangement for the last four questions.\n\nIn 2015, the so-called \"shuffle format\" was scrapped and the show returned to a version that closely resembled the original format.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://tv.avclub.com/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-to-feature-new-host-new-1798283830\n| title      = Who Wants To Be A Millionaire to feature new host, new/old format\n| work       = [[The A.V.

During the main game, contestants were given the option of choosing this feature, in which if they chose to use it, they gained the used of a fourth lifeline that allowed them to discuss a question with a member of the audience, in exchange for having no second safety net \u2013 if they got any question between the sixth and final cash prize amount wrong, they would leave with the guaranteed amount given for correctly answering five questions. This modified format was subsequently adopted for use in a variety of international versions abroad, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and Venezuela.\n\n=====Hot Seat format=====\n{{see also|Millionaire Hot Seat}}\nIn November 2008, the Norwegian version modified the show format under the title of \"Hot Seat\". In this variation of the game, six contestants took part, with each taking it in turns to answer questions and build up their prize fund. Utilising the time limit format introduced in the US version, this variation on the format granted a contestant the right to pass the question on to another player, who cannot pass it on themselves, while eliminating both the option of walking away from a question, and the use of lifelines. If a contestant cannot pass on or correctly answer a question, they are eliminated, and the highest cash value they made is removed. The game ends when all contestants are eliminated or the question for the highest cash value is answered \u2013 if a contestant who answers the final question gives a correct answer, they win that prize; otherwise, the last contestant to be eliminated receives a small prize if they reach the fifth question safety net. This format was later introduced to various markets over the course of a four year-period from 2009 to 2012, including Italy, Hungary, Spain, Vietnam,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vtv.vn/Article/Get/Ai-la-trieu-phu-phien-ban-moi-se-ra-mat-vao-ngay-79--8b63ee3e16.html |title=Ai l\u00e0 tri\u1ec7u ph\u00fa phi\u00ean b\u1ea3n m\u1edbi s\u1ebd ra m\u1eaft v\u00e0o ng\u00e0y 7/9 |work=VTV.vn |date=12 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815043700/http://vtv.vn/Article/Get/Ai-la-trieu-phu-phien-ban-moi-se-ra-mat-vao-ngay-79--8b63ee3e16.html |archivedate=15 August 2010 |language=vi |url-status=dead }}</ref> Indonesia, [[Millionaire Hot Seat|Australia]], and Chile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://programas.13.cl/millonarioaltatension/|title=Canal13.cl|access-date=25 January 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716125336/http://programas.13.cl/millonarioaltatension/|archive-date=16 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Australia's version was modified to use the Norwegian's Hot Seat format. In 2017, as part of new modification to the format, the game incorporated the use of the Fastest Finger First round, with the winner able to select a lifeline, out of three that the show provided. or to keep a check for a AU$1,000.\n\n===Lifelines===\nDuring a standard play of the game, a contestant is given a series of lifelines to aid them with difficult questions. In the standard format, a contestant has access to three lifelines \u2013 the contents can use each only once per game, but can use more than one on a single question. The standard lifelines used in the original format of the game show include:\n\n* '''Ask the Audience''': the audience takes voting pads attached to their seats and votes for the answer that they believe is correct. The computer tallies the results and displays them as percentages to the contestant.\n* '''50:50''': the game's computer eliminates two wrong answers from the current question, leaving behind the correct answer and one incorrect answer. From 2000, the selection of two incorrect answers were random.\n* '''Phone a Friend''': the contestant is connected with a friend over a phone line and is given 30 seconds to read the question and answers and solicit assistance. The time begins as soon as the contestant starts reading the question.\n\nIn the US, \"Ask the Audience\" and \"Phone a Friend\" had corporate sponsorship at different periods. [[AT&T Corporation|The original AT&T]] sponsored \"Phone-a-Friend\" during the original ABC primetime show and the syndicated version's first season; [[AT&T|the current AT&T]] sponsored the 2009 primetime episodes. From 2004 to 2006, [[AOL]] sponsored \"Ask the Audience\" and allowed users of [[AOL Instant Messenger|Instant Messenger]] to participate in the lifeline by adding the [[Screen name (computing)|screen name]] ''MillionaireIM'' to their [[contact list]]. When a contestant used the lifeline during the show, users would receive an [[instant message]] with the question and the four possible answers and would vote for the correct answer. The computer would tally these results alongside the results from the studio audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_August_23/ai_n6165047/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708211841/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_August_23/ai_n6165047/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=America Online and Buena Vista Television Break New Ground by Expanding 'Ask the Audience' Lifeline beyond the 'Millionaire' Studio via Instant Messaging |date=23 August 2004 |publisher=Business Wire |accessdate=18 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nContestants pre-select multiple friends for \"Phone a Friend,\" and as soon as the contestant begins to play, producers alert the friends and ask them to keep their phone lines free and await three rings before answering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/apr/25/news/cl-55078 |title=Sweating Bullets on the Hot Seat as a Know-It-All Phone-a-Friend |publisher=latimes.com |date=25 April 2001 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> On 11 January 2010, the US version eliminated the use of \"Phone a Friend\" in response to an increasing trend of contestants' friends using [[web search engine]]s and other Internet resources to assist them during the calls. Producers came to feel that the lifeline was giving contestants who had friends with Internet access an unfair advantage, and they also believed it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline, by which friends provided assistance based on what they already knew.<ref>{{cite episode|season=8|number=66|series=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ''(U.S. version)''|network =Syndicated|date=11 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring tapings of the current British version, security personnel from the production office stay with contestants' friends at their homes to ensure integrity. During The People Play specials in 2012 and 2013, friends traveled to the studio and stayed backstage. When a contestant used the lifeline, the friend they called appeared on a monitor in the studio, and both the friend and contestant were able to see and communicate with each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdA5l9xgTQ|title=The day I was phone-a-friend on Who Wants to be a Millionaire|last=The Telegraph|date=20 December 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixrqWIgCVP8|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The computer replaced the current question with another of the same difficulty. The contestant could not reinstate any lifelines used on the original question.<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\"/> A variation of this lifeline for the US version, called \"Cut the Question\", was brought into use in 2014 for a week-long run of special episodes that featured child contestants, in which it could only be used within the first ten questions.\n* '''Double Dip''' \u2013 One of two lifelines created for the ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off of the US version. When used, this lifeline allowed contestants to make two guesses at a question, but forbade them from using any other lifelines they had left or from walking away with their current winnings. If the contestant first used 50:50 and then used Double Dip on the same question, it would guarantee them the correct answer. When the standard US format incorporated a time limit on questions, the show retired 50:50 and replaced it with Double Dip.<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\"/> This lifeline was also used in the Russian version (without a clock format) but did not replace 50:50.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXXBqZjnTdA&t=1199s|title=\u041a\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c?

When chosen, a sequestered panel of three experts (chosen by the producers) appears via face-to-face audio and video feed to provide assistance. Like \"Phone a Friend,\" this lifeline incorporated a 30-second time limit for its use. This lifeline was also used in the Russian version between 2006 and 2008 but did not feature experts.\n* '''Ask the Expert''' \u2013 Inspired by \"Three Wise Men\", this lifeline provided the contestant with one person, an expert selected for them, to help them with the question. Unlike its predecessor, this lifeline had no time limit on its use, but was only available after the fifth question;<ref name=Expert>{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/millionaire_asktheexpert.htm|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Ask the Expert Lifeline|publisher=about.com|last=Grosvenor|first=Carrie|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> after \"Phone a Friend\" was removed in 2010, it was made readily available at any time in the game. In the US version, the lifeline was sponsored by [[Skype]] for its live audio and video feeds.<ref name=Expert/> In the Hong Kong edition, it replaced the \"Phone a Friend\" lifeline for one-off special in 2001 and for two celebrity specials in 2018, though with the celebrity contestants able to ask a panel of experts for help, present in the audience, all of whom had the question and possible answers visible to them.\n* '''Ask One of the Audience''' \u2013 Used in the German version of the show, this lifeline was designed for use as part of its \"Risk Mode\" format. When used, the contestant selects someone from the audience, whereupon the host rereads the question and the possible answers and asks them to choose one. If the contestant goes for the answer they chose and it proves correct, the audience member is given a small cash prize in return. This lifeline was implemented as part of the Costa Rican version, but made available after passing the first safety net.\n* '''Ask Three of the Audiences''' \u2013 Currently used in the Vietnamese version of the show, this lifeline was designed for use as part of its Original format. When used, the contestant selects three from the audiences, whereupon the host rereads the question and the possible answers and asks them to choose one. If the contestant goes for the answer they chose and it proves to be correct, the audience members are given a small cash prize in return (600000 \u20ab divided to members that answered correctly in the 3 audiences). This lifeline was implemented as part of the Vietnamese version, but made available after passing the first safety net. In the Philippine version, the lifeline is called ''People Speak'', which can be used at any point in the game.\n* '''Jump the Question''' \u2013 Used in the US version of the show, as part of the \"Shuffle Format\", from the start of the ninth season to the end of thirteenth season. When used, prior to giving a final answer, a contestant would skip the current question and move on to the next one, but would earn no money from the question they skipped; the lifeline could not be used if they have reached the final question.

The Strachans' score provides drama and tension, and unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] takes inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and their cues from the 6th/3rd to 10th/7th question, and then from the 11th/8th question onwards, take the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan |last=Smurthwaite |first=Nick |newspaper=[[The Stage]] |date=21 March 2005 |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991 |archivedate=12 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On [[Game Show Network]] (GSN)'s ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder, the music is \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\">{{Cite episode|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|series=Gameshow Hall of Fame|publisher=GSN|date=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Strachans' ''Millionaire'' soundtrack was honoured by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] with numerous awards, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the U.S. version's clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favour of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=21 August 2014|access-date=5 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821203218/http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|archive-date=21 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\n[[File:Milonario El Salvador.jpg|thumb|TV studio of ''[[\u00bfQui\u00e9n quiere ser millonario? (Salvadoran game show)|\u00bfQui\u00e9n quiere ser millonario?]]'', the [[Salvadorian]] version of the show.]]\nThe basic set design used in the ''Millionaire'' franchise was conceived by British [[production designer]] [[Andy Walmsley]], and is the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> Unlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the programme feels more like a [[Thriller film|movie thriller]] than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The main game typically has the contestant and host sit in \"Hot Seats\",<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> which are slightly-modified, {{convert|3|foot|m}}-high Pietranera Arco All chairs situated in the centre of the stage; an [[LG Electronics|LG]] computer monitor directly facing each seat displays questions and other pertinent information.\n\nThe lighting system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses further into the game. There are also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporised, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside a prison while an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the U.S. ''Millionaire'' introduced its shuffle format, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able to walk around the stage. According to Vieira, the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|date=15 September 2010|network=Syndicated}}</ref> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernised look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colours and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-live-wendy-williams-rachael-369024|title=''Anderson Live'', ''Wendy Williams'', ''Rachael Ray'' Among Syndicated Shows Getting Set Makeovers (Photos)|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=10 September 2012|accessdate=12 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Catchphrase===\n''Millionaire'' has made [[catchphrase]]s out of several lines used on the show. The most well-known of these catchphrases is the host's question \"Is that your final answer?\", asked whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified.<ref name=\"Commentary\">Commentary provided by Tarrant on the DVD ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?: Magic Moments and More''.</ref> The question is asked because the rules require that the contestants must clearly indicate their choices before they are made official, the nature of the game allowing them to ponder the options before committing to an answer. Regularly on tier-three questions, a dramatic pause occurs between the contestant's statement of their answer and the host's acknowledgement of whether or not it is correct.\n\nMany parodies of ''Millionaire'' have capitalised on the \"final answer\" catchphrase. In the United States, the phrase was popularised by Philbin during his tenure as the host of that country's version,<ref name=\"TV Series Finale\"/> to the extent that [[TV Land]] listed it in its special ''100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases'', which aired in 2006.<ref>The Star Ledger. 11 December 2006</ref>\n\nOn the Australian versions, McGuire replaces the phrase with \"Lock it in?\"; likewise, the Indian version's hosts have used varying \"lock\" catchphrases. There are also a number of other non-English versions of ''Millionaire'' where the host does not ask \"[Is that your] final answer?\" or a literal translation thereof.<ref>Certain non-English ''Millionaire'' shows' hosts, in their \"final answer\" phrases, translate these words as \"definitive answer\", \"final decision\", etc.</ref> Besides the \"final answer\" question, other catchphrases used on the show include the contestants' requests to use lifelines, such as \"I'd like to phone a friend\"; and a line that Tarrant spoke whenever a contestant was struggling with a particular question, \"Some questions are only easy if you know the answer.\"<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' has been credited with single-handedly reviving interest in, and breaking new ground for, the television game show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> It revolutionised the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the most popular game shows in television history, and is credited by some with paving the way for the phenomenon of reality programming.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Awards, accolades and honours===\nIn 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] honoured the UK version of ''Millionaire'' by ranking it number 23 on its \"BFI TV 100\" list, which compiled what British television industry professionals believed were the greatest programmes to have ever originated from that country.<ref>{{cite web|title=The BFI TV 100 at the BFI website |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/index.html |publisher=British Film Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524092249/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/index.html |archivedate=24 May 2009 }}</ref> The UK ''Millionaire'' also won the 1999 [[British Academy Television Awards|British Academy Television Award]] for Best Entertainment Programme, and four [[National Television Awards]] for Most Popular Quiz Programme from 2002 to 2005.\n\nThe original primetime version of the U.S. ''Millionaire'' won two [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show|Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show]] in 2000 and 2001.

In September 2001, Ingram took part in the game show for two days, joined by his wife Diana and college lecturer [[Tecwen Whittock]]. After his first day, he devised a plan to help him win the \u00a31 million cash prize the following day \u2013 for each question he faced, Ingram would read out the answers for a question, whereupon Whittock, who sat amongst the contestants who would play Fastest Finger First, would cough whenever the correct answer was spoken out. As Ingram drew close to the top prize, production staff backstage became suspicious over the amount of back noise Whittock was creating with his coughing. In addition, they also became concerned that Ingram showed no sign of having specialist knowledge on any subject he faced in his questions, in contrast to previous contestants. After the episode had been filmed, an investigation was ordered. Ingram was informed that he was suspected of cheating, and thus was not allowed to take his winnings; his reaction to this news further justified suspicions he had cheated. When the footage was reviewed, staff began to notice the pattern between Whittock's coughing and Ingram's behaviour when he chose an answer. After suspending the broadcast of both episodes Ingram featured in, police were called in to investigate the matter further.\n\nIn April 2003, Ingram, Diana, and Whittock were taken to court on the charge of using fraudulent means to win the top prize on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''. During the trial, the defence claimed that Whittock had simply suffered from allergies during recording of the second episode, but the prosecution refuted this by revealing footage that showed his coughing stopped, upon Ingram leaving the set and Whittock subsequently taking his turn on the main game. The trial concluded with all three being found guilty and receiving suspended sentences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2910119.stm|title=Millionaire trio escape jail|work=BBC News|date=8 April 2003|accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref> After the trial, ITV aired a documentary about the scandal, along with Ingram's entire game, complete with Whittock's coughing sounds.

The second, for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]], was based on the shuffle format<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/xbox360/645007-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-2012-edition|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? 2012 Edition|website=[[GameFAQs]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref> and was offered as a consolation prize during the next season (2011\u201312).\n\nLudia also made a [[Facebook]] game based on ''Millionaire'' available to players in North America from 2011 to 2016. This game featured an altered version of the shuffle format, condensing the number of questions to twelve\u2014eight in round one and four in round two. Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly. Contestants were allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one, and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.<ref>The rules of the Facebook game are sourced from the following page: {{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/playmillionaire/app_423340984404330|publisher=Ludia|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Scrapped animated spin-off===\nIn September 2001, [[Celador]] signed a deal with [[DIC Entertainment]] to produce a cartoon based on the show titled ''The Adventures of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? \u2013 The Animated Series''.<ref>https://www.c21media.net/celador-dic-to-make-animated-millionaire/</ref><ref>https://www.awn.com/news/dic-asks-celedor-your-final-answer</ref> The series was to follow fictional winners of the show, who would have used their prize money to take trips to various exotic locations, while the fictional host would keep in touch with them through the Millionaire Command Center.\n\nThe series was planned to be shown off at [[MIPCOM]] that year, however nothing else was confirmed for the series, and was silently scrapped without a formal announcement.\n\n===Disney Parks attraction===\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!}}\n[[File:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - Play It! Sound Stage after 2004 closure.jpg|thumb|right|The building housing the California version after its 2004 closure]]\nA theme park attraction based on the show, known as ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!]]'', appeared at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (when it was known as ''Disney-MGM Studios'') at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] and at [[Disney California Adventure Park]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a \"Fastest Finger\" question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theatre who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a ''Millionaire'' CD game, to a 3-night [[Disney Cruise Line|Disney Cruise]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Winner?

(abbreviated '''''WWTBAM''''' and informally known as simply '''''Millionaire''''') is an international television [[game show]] franchise of British origin, created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and [[Steven Knight]]. In its format, currently owned and licensed by [[Sony Pictures Television]], contestants tackle a series of multiple-choice questions to win large cash prizes in a format that twists on many game show genre conventions \u2013 only one contestant plays at a time, similar to radio quizzes; contestants are given the question before attempting an answer, and have no time limit to answer questions; and the amount offered increases as they tackle questions that become increasingly difficult. The maximum cash prize offered in most versions of the format is one million of the local currency.\n\nThe [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (British game show)|original British version]] debuted on 4 September 1998 on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network and was aired until its final episode on 11 February 2014. A revived series of seven episodes to commemorate its 20th anniversary aired from 5 to 11 May 2018. The revival received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans, as well as high viewing figures, leading ITV to renew the show for another series. Since its debut, international variants of the game show have been aired in around 160 countries worldwide.\n\n==History==\nThe format of the show was created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight, who had earlier created a number of the promotional games for Tarrant's [[Breakfast television|morning show]] on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] radio, such as the [[bong game]]. Tentatively known as ''Cash Mountain'',<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> the show took its finalised title from a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (song)|song]] written by [[Cole Porter]] for the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', starring by [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Celeste Holm]]. Since the original version launched, several individuals have claimed that they originated the format and that Celador had breached their [[copyright]]. While many pursued litigation, none were successful, and each claim was later settled out-of-court on an agreement/settlement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xavierax.com/ebook.pdf |title=Millionaire 2nd Edition.qxd |last=Leonard |first=John J. |year=2005 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801163453/http://www.xavierax.com/ebook.pdf |archive-date=1 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The show that should have made me a million|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/29/1048653901387.html|author=Daniel Dasey|publisher=The Sydney Sun-Herald|date=30 March 2003}}</ref><ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaymercury/news/tm_objectid=15908484&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=who-wants-to-sue-a-millionaire-name_page.html Birmingham Sunday Mercury], 28 August 2005</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, original producer [[Celador]] announced that it was seeking to sell the worldwide rights to ''Millionaire'', together with the rest of its British programme library, as the first phase of a sell-off of the company's format and production divisions. \nBritish television producer Paul Smith first had the idea to franchise the UK programme internationally. He developed a series of standards for international variants that ensured they mirrored the British original closely. For example, all hosts were required to appear on-screen wearing [[Armani]] suits, as Tarrant did in the UK; producers were forbidden from hiring local composers to create original music, instead using the same music cues used by the British version; and the lighting system and set design were to adhere faithfully to the way they were presented on the British version.<ref name=\"Walmsley\">{{cite web|title=Millionaire|url=http://www.andywalmsley.com/millionaire.php|publisher=Andy Walmsley, Production Designer|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> Some of Smith's rules have been slightly relaxed over the years as the franchise's history has progressed.\n\nDutch company [[2waytraffic]] ultimately acquired ''Millionaire'' and all of Celador's other programmes. Two years later, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] purchased 2waytraffic for \u00a3137.5 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/13/television.mediabusiness | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Sony to buy Millionaire firm for \u00a3137.5m | first=Chris | last=Tryhorn | date=13 March 2008}}</ref> [[Sony Pictures Television]] currently owns and licenses the show's format. [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television]], [[the Walt Disney Company]]'s in-home sales and content distribution firm controls the U.S. version independent of Sony.\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Rules===\nA group of contestants on each episode play a preliminary round called \"Fastest Finger First\". All are given a question by the host and four answers which must be placed within a particular order; in the first season of the original version (1998) and the first four seasons of the Australian version (1999\u20132002), contestants have to simply answer a multiple-choice question. If any contestants are visually impaired, the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music for this round begins. The contestant who not only answers correctly, but in the fastest time, goes on to play the main game. In the event that no one gets the question right, another question is given; if two or more contestants answer correctly but with the same time, they are given a tie-breaker amongst them to determine who will move on. This round is only used when a new contestant is being chosen to play the main round, and can be played more than once in an episode amongst those remaining within the group seeking to play the main game. In celebrity editions, the round is not used; celebrities automatically take part in the main game.\n\nOnce a contestant enters the main game, they are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Each features four possible answers, in which the contestant must give the correct answer. Doing so wins them a certain amount of money, with tackling much tougher questions increasing their prize fund. During their game, the player has a set of lifelines that they may use only once to help them with a question, as well as two \"safety nets\" \u2013 if a contestant gets a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they will leave with that amount as their prize. While the first few questions are generally easy, subsequent ones after them will prompt the host to ask if the answer they gave is their \"final answer\" \u2013 if it is, then it is locked in and cannot be changed. If a contestant feels unsure about an answer, and does not wish to play on, they can walk away with the money they have won, to which the host will ask them to confirm this as their final decision; in such cases, the host will usually ask them to state what answer they would have gone for, and reveal if it would have been correct or incorrect.\n\n====Original format====\nDuring the British original, between 1998 and 2007, the show's format required contestants to answer fifteen questions. The payout structure was as follows:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/fewer-and-harder-questions-on-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-6605687.html|title=Fewer \u2013 and Harder \u2013 Questions on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''|author=[[Show business|Showbiz]]|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=13 August 2007|accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Question number\n!Question value\n|-\n!(Bold zones are the guaranteed levels)\n|-\n|1\n|\u00a3100\n|-\n|2\n|\u00a3200\n|-\n|3\n|\u00a3300\n|-\n|4\n|\u00a3500\n|-\n!'''5'''\n!'''\u00a31,000'''\n|-\n|6\n|\u00a32,000\n|-\n|7\n|\u00a34,000\n|-\n|8\n|\u00a38,000\n|-\n|9\n|\u00a316,000\n|-\n!'''10'''\n!'''\u00a332,000'''\n|-\n|11\n|\u00a364,000\n|-\n|12\n|\u00a3125,000\n|-\n|13\n|\u00a3250,000\n|-\n|14\n|\u00a3500,000\n|-\n!'''15'''\n!'''<big>\u00a31,000,000</big>'''\n|}\n{{anchor|12-question format}}\nAfter 2007, the format was changed, reducing the number of questions to twelve; the overall change in format was later incorporated into a number of international versions over a period of four years, including the Arab, Bulgarian, Dutch, French, Polish, Spanish, and Turkish versions.

The only difference between it and the British version was that episodes were halved in length \u2013 30 minutes, as opposed to the 60-minute length of the original version. The change meant that the preliminary round of the show was eliminated, and contestants had to pass a more conventional game show qualification test. Exceptions to this arrangement, in which it was used under the name \"Fastest Finger\" included: primetime special editions of the programme; the 2004 series that was dubbed ''Super Millionaire'', in which the final prize was increased to $10,000,000;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/02/17/super-millionaire-is-looking-for-few-fast-fingers.html|title=''Super Millionaire'' Is Looking for a Few ''Fast Fingers''|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=17 February 2004|accessdate=18 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130105534/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/02/17/super-millionaire-is-looking-for-few-fast-fingers.html|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and for the 10th anniversary special of the US edition, run during August 2009 for eleven episodes. The decision to remove this round would later occur in other international versions, including the British original.\n\n=====Clock format=====\nIn 2008, the U.S. version changed its format so that contestants were required to answer questions within a set time limit. The limit varied depending on the difficulty of the question:<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080818abc04|title='Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' Kicks Off Seventh Season by Introducing New Changes to the Game, Creating New Levels of Excitement, Emotional Drama and Heart-Pounding Tension for Both Viewers and Contestants|website=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n* 15 seconds for questions 1\u20135\n* 30 seconds for questions 6\u201310\n* 45 seconds for questions 11\u201314\n* 45 seconds, plus any remaining time from the previous 14 questions for question 15\n\nTime for each question began counting down immediately after a question was given and its answers were revealed (but before reading all the answers) but was temporarily paused when a lifeline was used. If a contestant exceeded the time limit, they were forced to walk away with any prize money they had won up to that point; however, if the Double Dip lifeline is in use, then the contestant's winnings drops to the last safe haven attained. This format change was later adopted into other international versions \u2013 the British original, for example, adopted this change for episodes on 3 August 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/news/a231867/format-changes-ahead-for-millionaire.html#~oP2IB7a62U1Vky |title=Format changes ahead for 'Millionaire' |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=23 June 2010 |work=Digital Spy |publisher=Hearst Magazines UK |accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=====Shuffle format=====\nOn 13 September 2010, the U.S. version adopted a second and more significant change in its format. In this change, the game featured two rounds. The first round consisted of ten questions, in which the cash prize associated to each value, along with the category and difficulty for each question is randomised per game. As such, the difficulty of the question in this round, is ''not'' tied to the value associated to it, and a contestant does not know what amount they won unless they provide a correct answer, or choose to walk away. As part of this format, the amount of money a contestant won in this round was banked, but if they walk away before completing the round, they left with half the amount that had been banked; if they gave an incorrect answer during this round, they left with just $1,000.<ref name=\"Millionaire Facebook\u20142010 changes\">{{cite web|url= https://www.facebook.com/notes/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire/the-new-season-of-millionaire-is-a-real-game-changer-click-here-to-learn-all-of-/412488051663|title=The New Season of \"Millionaire\" is a Real Game-Changer|publisher= Disney-ABC Domestic Television|date=16 August 2010|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref> If they answered all ten questions correctly, they then moved onto the second round, which stuck to the standard format of the game show \u2013 the remaining questions are set to general knowledge and feature cash prizes of high, non-cumulative values. The contestant can, at this point, walk away with the total amount banked from the first round; otherwise, an incorrect answer meant they left with $25,000. The format was later modified for the fourteenth season of the US version, but retained the same arrangement for the last four questions.\n\nIn 2015, the so-called \"shuffle format\" was scrapped and the show returned to a version that closely resembled the original format.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://tv.avclub.com/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-to-feature-new-host-new-1798283830\n| title      = Who Wants To Be A Millionaire to feature new host, new/old format\n| work       = [[The A.V.

During the main game, contestants were given the option of choosing this feature, in which if they chose to use it, they gained the used of a fourth lifeline that allowed them to discuss a question with a member of the audience, in exchange for having no second safety net \u2013 if they got any question between the sixth and final cash prize amount wrong, they would leave with the guaranteed amount given for correctly answering five questions. This modified format was subsequently adopted for use in a variety of international versions abroad, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and Venezuela.\n\n=====Hot Seat format=====\n{{see also|Millionaire Hot Seat}}\nIn November 2008, the Norwegian version modified the show format under the title of \"Hot Seat\". In this variation of the game, six contestants took part, with each taking it in turns to answer questions and build up their prize fund. Utilising the time limit format introduced in the US version, this variation on the format granted a contestant the right to pass the question on to another player, who cannot pass it on themselves, while eliminating both the option of walking away from a question, and the use of lifelines. If a contestant cannot pass on or correctly answer a question, they are eliminated, and the highest cash value they made is removed. The game ends when all contestants are eliminated or the question for the highest cash value is answered \u2013 if a contestant who answers the final question gives a correct answer, they win that prize; otherwise, the last contestant to be eliminated receives a small prize if they reach the fifth question safety net. This format was later introduced to various markets over the course of a four year-period from 2009 to 2012, including Italy, Hungary, Spain, Vietnam,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vtv.vn/Article/Get/Ai-la-trieu-phu-phien-ban-moi-se-ra-mat-vao-ngay-79--8b63ee3e16.html |title=Ai l\u00e0 tri\u1ec7u ph\u00fa phi\u00ean b\u1ea3n m\u1edbi s\u1ebd ra m\u1eaft v\u00e0o ng\u00e0y 7/9 |work=VTV.vn |date=12 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815043700/http://vtv.vn/Article/Get/Ai-la-trieu-phu-phien-ban-moi-se-ra-mat-vao-ngay-79--8b63ee3e16.html |archivedate=15 August 2010 |language=vi |url-status=dead }}</ref> Indonesia, [[Millionaire Hot Seat|Australia]], and Chile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://programas.13.cl/millonarioaltatension/|title=Canal13.cl|access-date=25 January 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716125336/http://programas.13.cl/millonarioaltatension/|archive-date=16 July 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Australia's version was modified to use the Norwegian's Hot Seat format. In 2017, as part of new modification to the format, the game incorporated the use of the Fastest Finger First round, with the winner able to select a lifeline, out of three that the show provided. or to keep a check for a AU$1,000.\n\n===Lifelines===\nDuring a standard play of the game, a contestant is given a series of lifelines to aid them with difficult questions. In the standard format, a contestant has access to three lifelines \u2013 the contents can use each only once per game, but can use more than one on a single question. The standard lifelines used in the original format of the game show include:\n\n* '''Ask the Audience''': the audience takes voting pads attached to their seats and votes for the answer that they believe is correct. The computer tallies the results and displays them as percentages to the contestant.\n* '''50:50''': the game's computer eliminates two wrong answers from the current question, leaving behind the correct answer and one incorrect answer. From 2000, the selection of two incorrect answers were random.\n* '''Phone a Friend''': the contestant is connected with a friend over a phone line and is given 30 seconds to read the question and answers and solicit assistance. The time begins as soon as the contestant starts reading the question.\n\nIn the US, \"Ask the Audience\" and \"Phone a Friend\" had corporate sponsorship at different periods. [[AT&T Corporation|The original AT&T]] sponsored \"Phone-a-Friend\" during the original ABC primetime show and the syndicated version's first season; [[AT&T|the current AT&T]] sponsored the 2009 primetime episodes. From 2004 to 2006, [[AOL]] sponsored \"Ask the Audience\" and allowed users of [[AOL Instant Messenger|Instant Messenger]] to participate in the lifeline by adding the [[Screen name (computing)|screen name]] ''MillionaireIM'' to their [[contact list]]. When a contestant used the lifeline during the show, users would receive an [[instant message]] with the question and the four possible answers and would vote for the correct answer. The computer would tally these results alongside the results from the studio audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_August_23/ai_n6165047/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708211841/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_August_23/ai_n6165047/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=America Online and Buena Vista Television Break New Ground by Expanding 'Ask the Audience' Lifeline beyond the 'Millionaire' Studio via Instant Messaging |date=23 August 2004 |publisher=Business Wire |accessdate=18 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nContestants pre-select multiple friends for \"Phone a Friend,\" and as soon as the contestant begins to play, producers alert the friends and ask them to keep their phone lines free and await three rings before answering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/apr/25/news/cl-55078 |title=Sweating Bullets on the Hot Seat as a Know-It-All Phone-a-Friend |publisher=latimes.com |date=25 April 2001 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> On 11 January 2010, the US version eliminated the use of \"Phone a Friend\" in response to an increasing trend of contestants' friends using [[web search engine]]s and other Internet resources to assist them during the calls. Producers came to feel that the lifeline was giving contestants who had friends with Internet access an unfair advantage, and they also believed it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline, by which friends provided assistance based on what they already knew.<ref>{{cite episode|season=8|number=66|series=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ''(U.S. version)''|network =Syndicated|date=11 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring tapings of the current British version, security personnel from the production office stay with contestants' friends at their homes to ensure integrity. During The People Play specials in 2012 and 2013, friends traveled to the studio and stayed backstage. When a contestant used the lifeline, the friend they called appeared on a monitor in the studio, and both the friend and contestant were able to see and communicate with each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYdA5l9xgTQ|title=The day I was phone-a-friend on Who Wants to be a Millionaire|last=The Telegraph|date=20 December 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixrqWIgCVP8|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The computer replaced the current question with another of the same difficulty. The contestant could not reinstate any lifelines used on the original question.<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\"/> A variation of this lifeline for the US version, called \"Cut the Question\", was brought into use in 2014 for a week-long run of special episodes that featured child contestants, in which it could only be used within the first ten questions.\n* '''Double Dip''' \u2013 One of two lifelines created for the ''Super Millionaire'' spin-off of the US version. When used, this lifeline allowed contestants to make two guesses at a question, but forbade them from using any other lifelines they had left or from walking away with their current winnings. If the contestant first used 50:50 and then used Double Dip on the same question, it would guarantee them the correct answer. When the standard US format incorporated a time limit on questions, the show retired 50:50 and replaced it with Double Dip.<ref name=\"futon critic\u2014rules\"/> This lifeline was also used in the Russian version (without a clock format) but did not replace 50:50.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXXBqZjnTdA&t=1199s|title=\u041a\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c?

When chosen, a sequestered panel of three experts (chosen by the producers) appears via face-to-face audio and video feed to provide assistance. Like \"Phone a Friend,\" this lifeline incorporated a 30-second time limit for its use. This lifeline was also used in the Russian version between 2006 and 2008 but did not feature experts.\n* '''Ask the Expert''' \u2013 Inspired by \"Three Wise Men\", this lifeline provided the contestant with one person, an expert selected for them, to help them with the question. Unlike its predecessor, this lifeline had no time limit on its use, but was only available after the fifth question;<ref name=Expert>{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/od/millionaireglossary/g/millionaire_asktheexpert.htm|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Ask the Expert Lifeline|publisher=about.com|last=Grosvenor|first=Carrie|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> after \"Phone a Friend\" was removed in 2010, it was made readily available at any time in the game. In the US version, the lifeline was sponsored by [[Skype]] for its live audio and video feeds.<ref name=Expert/> In the Hong Kong edition, it replaced the \"Phone a Friend\" lifeline for one-off special in 2001 and for two celebrity specials in 2018, though with the celebrity contestants able to ask a panel of experts for help, present in the audience, all of whom had the question and possible answers visible to them.\n* '''Ask One of the Audience''' \u2013 Used in the German version of the show, this lifeline was designed for use as part of its \"Risk Mode\" format. When used, the contestant selects someone from the audience, whereupon the host rereads the question and the possible answers and asks them to choose one. If the contestant goes for the answer they chose and it proves correct, the audience member is given a small cash prize in return. This lifeline was implemented as part of the Costa Rican version, but made available after passing the first safety net.\n* '''Ask Three of the Audiences''' \u2013 Used in the Vietnamese version of the show, this lifeline was designed for use as part of its Original format. When used, the contestant selects three from the audiences, whereupon the host rereads the question and the possible answers and asks them to choose one. If the contestant goes for the answer they chose and it proves to be correct, the audience members are given a small cash prize in return (600000 \u20ab divided to members that answered correctly in the 3 audiences). This lifeline was implemented as part of the Vietnamese version, but made available after passing the first safety net. In the Philippine version, the lifeline is called ''People Speak'', which can be used at any point in the game.\n* '''Jump the Question''' \u2013 Used in the US version of the show, as part of the \"Shuffle Format\", from the start of the ninth season to the end of thirteenth season. When used, prior to giving a final answer, a contestant would skip the current question and move on to the next one, but would earn no money from the question they skipped; the lifeline could not be used if they have reached the final question. Unlike other lifelines, it could be used twice during a game, except for the thirteenth season \u2013 the introduction of \"Plus One\" led to the lifeline being modified as a result. The lifeline was removed following the 2014\u201315 season.\n* '''Crystal Ball''' \u2013 Used in the US version of the show, as part of specially designated weeks that used the \"Shuffle Format\". When used during the first round, the contestant is allowed to see the cash amount that is designated to the question they are currently on.<ref name=CrystalBall>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/24/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-celebrates-halloween-with-an-added-crystal-ball-lifeline-a-spooky-set-makeover-and-a-contestant-in-drag/154574/ |title='Who Wants to be a Millionaire' Celebrates Halloween With an Added \"Crystal Ball\" Lifeline, A Spooky Set Makeover and a Contestant in Drag |last=Kondolojy |first=Amanda |work=TV By the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029173644/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/24/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-celebrates-halloween-with-an-added-crystal-ball-lifeline-a-spooky-set-makeover-and-a-contestant-in-drag/154574/ |archivedate=29 October 2012 }}</ref>\n* '''+1''' \u2013 Used in the US version of the show from 2015 to 2019. Based on \"Ask One of the Audience\", the lifeline allows a contestant to invite on a friend from the audience to come and help them answer the question. There is no time limit, but after that question has been answered the friend has to return to the audience.\n* '''Ask the Host''' \u2013 Used in the 20th anniversary of the British original, the French and Italian revivals, as well as [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show, season 21)|the 21st season of the American version]]. When used by the contestant, the host uses their knowledge of a question's subject, gives their thoughts about the question, and tries to assist them with finding the correct answer out of the choices given. The lifeline features no time limit, and the host reassures all they have no connection to the outside world and receive the question and possible answers for it at the same time as the contestant, and thus have no knowledge of what the correct answer is.\n\n===Top prize winners===\nOut of all contestants that have played the game, few have been able to win the top prize on any international version of the show. The first was [[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]], who won the top prize on the U.S. version on 19 November 1999. Carpenter did not use a lifeline until the final question, using his Phone-a-Friend not for help but to call his father to tell him he was about to win the million.<ref>{{cite news|first=Arlene|last=Vigoda|title=Million-dollar winner untaxed by celebrity|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=22 November 1999}}</ref>\n\nOther notable top prize winners include [[Judith Keppel]], the first winner of the UK version;<ref name=\"wilson\">{{cite news |title=Wilson: Millionaire win 'planned' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1035069.stm |work=BBC News |date=22 November 2000 |accessdate=28 January 2007}}</ref> Kevin Olmstead from the U.S. version, who won a progressive jackpot of $2.18&nbsp;million;<ref name=\"Jackpot\">{{cite news|title=Double jackpot winner on US Millionaire|work=BBC News|date=11 April 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1271553.stm|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> [[Martin Flood]] from the Australian version, who was investigated by producers after suspicions that he had cheated, much like [[Charles Ingram]], but was later cleared;<ref>{{cite news|title=Second Aussie 'Millionaire' winner emerges|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/11/14/1131951103121.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 November 2005|accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> [[Mana Ashida]] from the Japanese version; and Sushil Kumar from the Indian version, who is often referred to in Western media as the \"real-life ''Slumdog Millionaire''\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Burke|first=Jason|title='Real Slumdog Millionaire' is first to win $1m on Indian gameshow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/27/real-slumdog-millionaire-indian-gameshow?newsfeed=true|accessdate=6 September 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Stanglin|first=Douglas|title=Real-life 'Slumdog Millionaire' wins $1M in India|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/11/real-life-slumdog-millionaire-wins-1m-in-india/1?csp=34news|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|date=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Indian man becomes real life Slumdog Millionaire as he wins game show|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/8866558/Indian-man-becomes-real-life-Slumdog-Millionaire-as-he-wins-game-show.html|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Magnier|first=Mark|title=Indian from modest background becomes TV game show millionaire|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/28/world/la-fg-india-slumdog-20111029|accessdate=6 September 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=28 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Beard|first=Lanford|title='Slumdog Millionaire' comes to life for Sushil Kumar|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2011/10/27/slumdog-millionaire-sushil-kumar|accessdate=7 March 2015|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly PopWatch|date=27 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Original version==\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The Strachans' score provides drama and tension, and unlike older game show musical scores, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main ''Millionaire'' [[theme song]] takes inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and their cues from the 6th/3rd to 10th/7th question, and then from the 11th/8th question onwards, take the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan |last=Smurthwaite |first=Nick |newspaper=[[The Stage]] |date=21 March 2005 |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991 |archivedate=12 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On [[Game Show Network]] (GSN)'s ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder, the music is \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\">{{Cite episode|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|series=Gameshow Hall of Fame|publisher=GSN|date=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Strachans' ''Millionaire'' soundtrack was honoured by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] with numerous awards, the earliest of them awarded in 2000.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\"/> The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the U.S. version's clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010, in favour of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company [[Ah2 Music]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ah2 Music Marks 10th Anniversary|url=http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|publisher=TrailerMusicVibe|date=21 August 2014|access-date=5 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821203218/http://www.trailermusicvibe.com/ah2-music-marks-10th-anniversary/|archive-date=21 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\n[[File:Milonario El Salvador.jpg|thumb|TV studio of ''[[\u00bfQui\u00e9n quiere ser millonario? (Salvadoran game show)|\u00bfQui\u00e9n quiere ser millonario?]]'', the [[Salvadorian]] version of the show.]]\nThe basic set design used in the ''Millionaire'' franchise was conceived by British [[production designer]] [[Andy Walmsley]], and is the most reproduced scenic design in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> Unlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, ''Millionaire''{{'}}s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the programme feels more like a [[Thriller film|movie thriller]] than a typical quiz show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The floor is made of [[Plexiglas]]<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> The main game typically has the contestant and host sit in \"Hot Seats\",<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> which are slightly-modified, {{convert|3|foot|m}}-high Pietranera Arco All chairs situated in the centre of the stage; an [[LG Electronics|LG]] computer monitor directly facing each seat displays questions and other pertinent information.\n\nThe lighting system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses further into the game. There are also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporised, creating a haze effect. [[Media scholar]] [[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Dr. Robert Thompson]], a professor at [[Syracuse University]], stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside a prison while an escape was in progress.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\nWhen the U.S. ''Millionaire'' introduced its shuffle format, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able to walk around the stage. According to Vieira, the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Season 23, Episode 8|series=Live! with Regis and Kelly|date=15 September 2010|network=Syndicated}}</ref> Also, two video screens were installed\u2013one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernised look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasting]], which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colours and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-live-wendy-williams-rachael-369024|title=''Anderson Live'', ''Wendy Williams'', ''Rachael Ray'' Among Syndicated Shows Getting Set Makeovers (Photos)|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=10 September 2012|accessdate=12 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Catchphrase===\n''Millionaire'' has made [[catchphrase]]s out of several lines used on the show. The most well-known of these catchphrases is the host's question \"Is that your final answer?\", asked whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified.<ref name=\"Commentary\">Commentary provided by Tarrant on the DVD ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?: Magic Moments and More''.</ref> The question is asked because the rules require that the contestants must clearly indicate their choices before they are made official, the nature of the game allowing them to ponder the options before committing to an answer. Regularly on tier-three questions, a dramatic pause occurs between the contestant's statement of their answer and the host's acknowledgement of whether or not it is correct.\n\nMany parodies of ''Millionaire'' have capitalised on the \"final answer\" catchphrase. In the United States, the phrase was popularised by Philbin during his tenure as the host of that country's version,<ref name=\"TV Series Finale\"/> to the extent that [[TV Land]] listed it in its special ''100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases'', which aired in 2006.<ref>The Star Ledger. 11 December 2006</ref>\n\nOn the Australian versions, McGuire replaces the phrase with \"Lock it in?\"; likewise, the Indian version's hosts have used varying \"lock\" catchphrases. There are also a number of other non-English versions of ''Millionaire'' where the host does not ask \"[Is that your] final answer?\" or a literal translation thereof.<ref>Certain non-English ''Millionaire'' shows' hosts, in their \"final answer\" phrases, translate these words as \"definitive answer\", \"final decision\", etc.</ref> Besides the \"final answer\" question, other catchphrases used on the show include the contestants' requests to use lifelines, such as \"I'd like to phone a friend\"; and a line that Tarrant spoke whenever a contestant was struggling with a particular question, \"Some questions are only easy if you know the answer.\"<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' has been credited with single-handedly reviving interest in, and breaking new ground for, the television game show.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> It revolutionised the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the most popular game shows in television history, and is credited by some with paving the way for the phenomenon of reality programming.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n===Awards, accolades and honours===\nIn 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] honoured the UK version of ''Millionaire'' by ranking it number 23 on its \"BFI TV 100\" list, which compiled what British television industry professionals believed were the greatest programmes to have ever originated from that country.<ref>{{cite web|title=The BFI TV 100 at the BFI website |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/index.html |publisher=British Film Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524092249/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/index.html |archivedate=24 May 2009 }}</ref> The UK ''Millionaire'' also won the 1999 [[British Academy Television Awards|British Academy Television Award]] for Best Entertainment Programme, and four [[National Television Awards]] for Most Popular Quiz Programme from 2002 to 2005.\n\nThe original primetime version of the U.S. ''Millionaire'' won two [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show|Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show]] in 2000 and 2001. Philbin was honoured with a Daytime Emmy in the category of [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] in 2001, while Vieira received one in 2005 and another in 2009, making her the second woman to win an Emmy Award for hosting a game show, and the first to win multiple times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Meredith_Vieira/1578769#awards |title=Meredith Vieira biography |publisher=www.hollywood.com |accessdate=11 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321145229/http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Meredith_Vieira/1578769 |archivedate=21 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the U.S. ''Millionaire'' No. 7 on its 2001 list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time,<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Guide Names the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=27 January \u2013 2 February 2001}}</ref> and later ranked it No. 6 on its 2013 \"60 Greatest Game Shows\" list.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eyes on the Prize|last=Fretts|first=Bruce|date=17 June 2013|work=TV Guide|pages=14\u201315}}</ref> GSN ranked ''Millionaire'' No. 5 on its August 2006 list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time,<ref>{{cite episode|series=The 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time|network=GSN|date=31 August 2006}}</ref> and later honoured the show in January 2007 on its first, and so far only, ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/>\n\n==Charles Ingram cheating scandal==\n[[File:Charles Ingram 1.jpg|thumb|150px|Charles Ingram became infamous for cheating on the programme with a method that staff had not anticipated]]\nAlthough the show employed many ways of preventing cheating, no one working on the British original was prepared for a unique style employed by one contestant \u2013 [[Major (United Kingdom)|British Army Major]] [[Charles Ingram]]. In September 2001, Ingram took part in the game show for two days, joined by his wife Diana and college lecturer [[Tecwen Whittock]]. After his first day, he devised a plan to help him win the \u00a31 million cash prize the following day \u2013 for each question he faced, Ingram would read out the answers for a question, whereupon Whittock, who sat amongst the contestants who would play Fastest Finger First, would cough whenever the correct answer was spoken out. As Ingram drew close to the top prize, production staff backstage became suspicious over the amount of back noise Whittock was creating with his coughing. In addition, they also became concerned that Ingram showed no sign of having specialist knowledge on any subject he faced in his questions, in contrast to previous contestants. After the episode had been filmed, an investigation was ordered. Ingram was informed that he was suspected of cheating, and thus was not allowed to take his winnings; his reaction to this news further justified suspicions he had cheated. When the footage was reviewed, staff began to notice the pattern between Whittock's coughing and Ingram's behaviour when he chose an answer. After suspending the broadcast of both episodes Ingram featured in, police were called in to investigate the matter further.\n\nIn April 2003, Ingram, Diana, and Whittock were taken to court on the charge of using fraudulent means to win the top prize on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''. During the trial, the defence claimed that Whittock had simply suffered from allergies during recording of the second episode, but the prosecution refuted this by revealing footage that showed his coughing stopped, upon Ingram leaving the set and Whittock subsequently taking his turn on the main game. The trial concluded with all three being found guilty and receiving suspended sentences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2910119.stm|title=Millionaire trio escape jail|work=BBC News|date=8 April 2003|accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref> After the trial, ITV aired a documentary about the scandal, along with Ingram's entire game, complete with Whittock's coughing sounds.

This game featured an altered version of the shuffle format, condensing the number of questions to twelve\u2014eight in round one and four in round two. Contestants competed against eight other ''Millionaire'' fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly. Contestants were allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one, and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.<ref>The rules of the Facebook game are sourced from the following page: {{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/playmillionaire/app_423340984404330|publisher=Ludia|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Scrapped animated spin-off===\nIn September 2001, [[Celador]] signed a deal with [[DIC Entertainment]] to produce a cartoon based on the show titled ''The Adventures of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? \u2013 The Animated Series''.<ref>https://www.c21media.net/celador-dic-to-make-animated-millionaire/</ref><ref>https://www.awn.com/news/dic-asks-celedor-your-final-answer</ref> The series was to follow fictional winners of the show, who would have used their prize money to take trips to various exotic locations, while the fictional host would keep in touch with them through the Millionaire Command Center.\n\nThe series was planned to be shown off at [[MIPCOM]] that year, however nothing else was confirmed for the series, and was silently scrapped without a formal announcement.\n\n===Disney Parks attraction===\n{{Main|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!}}\n[[File:Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - Play It! Sound Stage after 2004 closure.jpg|thumb|right|The building housing the California version after its 2004 closure]]\nA theme park attraction based on the show, known as ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!]]'', appeared at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (when it was known as ''Disney-MGM Studios'') at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] and at [[Disney California Adventure Park]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. Both the Florida and California ''Play It!'' attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004,<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Joshua C.|title=Discovering the Magic Kingdom: An Unofficial Disneyland Vacation Guide|publisher=Author House|year=2010|page=207|isbn=9781452063133}}</ref> and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by ''[[Toy Story Midway Mania!]]''\n\nThe format in the ''Play It!'' attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a \"Fastest Finger\" question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became ''Phone a Complete Stranger'' which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theatre who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a ''Millionaire'' CD game, to a 3-night [[Disney Cruise Line|Disney Cruise]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Wants to Be a Winner?

The word \"office\" may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see [[officer (disambiguation)|officer]], [[office-holder (disambiguation)|office-holder]], [[official]]); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty. When used as an [[adjective]], the term \"office\" may refer to [[business]]-related tasks. In [[legal|law]], a [[company]] or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of (for example) a [[storage silo]] rather than an establishment with [[desk]]-and-[[office chair|chair]]. An office is also an [[architectural]] and [[design]] phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a [[Bench (furniture)|bench]] in the corner of a [[small business]] of extremely small size (see [[small office/home office]]), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company. In modern terms an office is usually the location where [[white-collar worker]]s carry out their functions. As per [[James Stephenson]], \"Office is  that part of [[business enterprise]] which is devoted to the direction and co-ordination of its various activities.\"\n\nOffices in [[classical antiquity]] were often part of a palace complex or of a large temple. The [[High Middle Ages]] (1000\u20131300) saw the rise of the medieval [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom. With the growth of large, complex organizations in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed.{{by whom|date=September 2018}} As the [[Industrial Revolution]] intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of [[bank]]ing, [[rail transport|rail]], [[insurance]], [[retail]], [[petroleum]], and [[telegraph]]y grew dramatically, requiring many clerks, and as a result more office space was assigned to house their activities. The [[time and motion study|time-and-motion study]], pioneered in manufacturing by [[F. W.

At their new efficiency desks, office workers could be watched, monitored and subjected to time-and-motion studies.\n}}\n</ref>\nHowever, by the middle of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required discretion in the control of [[privacy]], and gradually the [[cubicle]] system evolved.<ref name=Long/>\n\nThe main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their jobs. [[Work space]]s in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work. There are nine generic types of work space,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} each supporting different activities. In addition to individual cubicles, one can find [[meeting room]]s, [[lobby (room)|lounges]], and spaces for support activities, such as photocopying and filing. Some offices also have a kitchen area where workers can make their lunches. There are many{{quantify|date=September 2018}} different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial [[fashion]]s and the culture of specific companies can be even more important.  \nWhile offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult, such as requirements for light, networking, and security. The major purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment - primarily for administrative and managerial workers. These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, [[personal computer|PCs]] and other equipment they may need within these areas.\n\n==History==\nThe structure and shape of the office is impacted by both management thought as well as construction materials and may or may not have walls or barriers. The word stems from the Latin [[Officium (Ancient Rome)|officium]], and its equivalents in various, mainly romance, languages.  An officium was not necessarily a place, but rather an often mobile 'bureau' in the sense of a human staff or even the abstract notion of a formal position, such as a magistrature. The relatively elaborate Roman bureaucracy would not be equaled for centuries in the West after the fall of [[Rome]], even partially reverting to illiteracy, while the East preserved a more sophisticated administrative culture, both under Byzantium and under Islam.\n\nOffices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or a large temple. There was usually a room where [[Scroll (parchment)|scroll]]s were kept and [[scribe]]s did their work. Ancient texts mentioning the work of scribes allude to the existence of such \"offices\". These rooms are sometimes called \"libraries\" by some archaeologists and the general press because one often associates scrolls with literature. In fact they were true offices since the scrolls were meant for record keeping and other management functions such as treaties and edicts, and not for writing or keeping poetry or other works of fiction.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe [[High Middle Ages]] (1000\u20131300) saw the rise of the medieval [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom. The rooms of the chancery often had walls full of pigeonholes, constructed to hold rolled up pieces of parchment for safekeeping or ready reference, a precursor to the bookshelf. The introduction of printing during the [[Renaissance]] did not change these early government offices much.\n\n[[File:Office 1719.jpg|thumb|An early [[Europe]]an office]]\n\nMedieval illustrations, such as paintings or tapestries, often show people in their private offices handling record-keeping books or writing on scrolls of [[parchment]]. All kinds of writings seemed to be mixed in these early forms of offices. Before the invention of the [[printing press]] and its distribution there was often a very thin line between a private office and a private [[library]] since books were read or written in the same space at the same [[desk]] or [[Table (furniture)|table]], and general accounting and personal or private letters were also done there.\n\nIt was during the 13th century that the English form of the word first appeared when referring to a position involving duties (ex. the office of the ...).  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] appears to have first used the word in 1395 to mean a place where business is transacted in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.\n\nAs [[mercantilism]] became the dominant economic theory of the [[Renaissance]], merchants tended to conduct their business in the same buildings, which might include retail sales, warehousing and clerical work.  During the 15th century, population density in many cities reached the point where stand-alone buildings were used by merchants to conduct their business, and there was a developing a distinction between church, government/military, and commerce uses for buildings.<ref name=Long>{{cite book | last=Long | first=Kim | pages=14\u201316 | title=User Effective Buildings | location=Denver | publisher=Aardex Corporation | year=2004 | isbn=978-0975552407}}</ref>\n\n===Emergence of the modern office===\nWith the growth of large, complex organizations such as the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[East India Company]] in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed. The Old Admiralty ([[Ripley Building]]) was built in 1726 as a three-storey U-shaped brick building and was the first purpose built office building in Great Britain. As well as offices, the building housed a board room and [[apartment]]s for the Lords of the Admiralty. In the 1770s, many scattered offices for the [[Royal Navy]] were gathered into [[Somerset House]], the first block purpose-built for office work.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8S4yyAkysYgC|title=The Making of the Modern Admiralty:British Naval Policy-Making, 1805-1927|author=Hamilton, C.I|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=15|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617003219/https://books.google.com/books?id=8S4yyAkysYgC|archivedate=2016-06-17|isbn=9781139496544}}</ref>\n\n[[File:East India House by Thomas Malton the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|The sprawling complex of the extended [[East India House]] c.1800.

The Company developed a very complex bureaucracy for the task, which required thousands of office employees to process the necessary paperwork. The Company recognized the benefits of centralized administration, and required that all workers sign in and out at the central office, daily.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23372401|title=How the office was invented|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2012-12-17|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722013846/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23372401|archivedate=2013-07-22}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Industrial Revolution]] intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of [[bank]]ing, [[rail transport|rail]], [[insurance]], [[retail]], [[petroleum]], and [[telegraph]]y dramatically grew in size and complexity.  To transact business, an increasing large number of clerks were needed to handle order-processing, accounting, and document filing, with increasingly specialized office space required to house these activities. Most of the desks of the era were top heavy with paper storage bins extending above the desk-work area, giving the appearance of a cubicle and offering the workers some degree of privacy.\n\nThe relatively high price of land in the central core of cities lead to the first multi-story buildings, which were limited to about 10 stories until the use of [[Cast-iron architecture|iron and steel]] allowed for higher structures. The first purpose-built office block was the Brunswick Building, built in [[Liverpool]] in 1841.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolwiki.org/Liverpool_Firsts|title=Liverpool Firsts|accessdate=2012-12-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131220134929/http://www.liverpoolwiki.org/Liverpool_Firsts|archivedate=2013-12-20}}</ref> The invention of the safety [[Screw-drive elevator|elevator]] in 1852 by [[Elisha Otis]] saw the rapid escalation upward of buildings.<ref name=Long/> By the end of the 19th century, larger office buildings frequently contained large glass [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]]s to allow light into the complex and improve air circulation.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Office speaking tubes 1903.jpg|left|thumb|An office in 1903, equipped with [[speaking tube]]s]]\n\nBy 1906, [[Sears]], Roebuck and Co had opened their mail order and headquarters operation in a {{convert|3000000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building in Chicago, at the time the largest building in the world.

F.W.

In 1964, the [[Herman Miller (office equipment)]] company engaged [[Robert Propst (inventor)|Robert Propst]], a prolific industrial designer, who came up with the concept of the [[Action Office]] which later evolved into the [[cubicle]] office furniture system.<ref name=Long/>\n\n=== Japan 20th century office ===\n\nJapanese businesses have set themselves apart from their American counterparts by implementing different techniques in the way they handle business.  The Japanese office layout improves work productivity, harmony in the office, and holds every employee accountable for the work they produce.  The type of office layout used in Japan is called an '''[[open plan]]''', and relies on ergonomics to help make employees as productive as possible.  The Japanese open office layout allows them to use an organizational structure known as the horizontal structure.  In the typical Japanese office there are no walls dividing desks, no cubicles, and no individual offices. Also they are able to implement policies using the ringi-sho consensus.\n\nIn order to get group members to work effectively in the open office floor plan the use of island style desks are used. The most dominant feature of the Japanese island style office layout is that each group forms an island.  Kageyu Noro, Goroh Fujimaki & Shinsuke Kishi, researches of ergonomics in the work place, stated,\u201d Japanese offices have traditionally adhered to island layouts because these reflect the Japanese style of teamwork and top-down style of management.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Noro | first1 = Kageyu | last2 = Fujimaki | first2 = Goroh | last3 = Kishi | first3 = Shinsuke | title = Evidence-based ergonomics: a comparison of Japanese and American office layouts | journal = International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 527&ndash;538 | doi = 10.1080/10803548.2003.11076588 | pmid = 14675524 | date = 2003 | ref = harv }}</ref> The group leader will then sit at the prominent position and ensure productivity.\n[[File:Good Smile Company offices ladies.jpg|thumb|Island style seating]]\nThe group leader will assign a task to the group, and each member of the group then receives their individual task to complete.  Island style seating also gives the group the benefit of being able to speak to one another at any time, and ask for help if needed.  Being in such close proximity to one another in the office gives another advantage to the supervisor in that he can call an uchi-awase.  Uchi-awase is an informal meeting in order to get an important message across, and also allows all members of the team to be creative in the office. \u201cThe open office layout allows for this because there are hardly any independent rooms or enclosures.  If the supervisor stands at his desk he can glance at his associates and easily call them over.\u201d, according to Durlabhji, Subhash, Norton E. Marks, and Scott Roach, authors of Japanese Business: Cultural Perspective.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Durlabhji | first1 = Subhash | last2 = Marks | first2 = Norton E. | last3 = Roach | first3 = Scott | title = Japanese business: cultural perspectives | pages = [https://archive.org/details/japanesebusiness0000unse/page/237 237&ndash;238] | publisher = State University of New York Press | location = Albany | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780791412527 | url = https://archive.org/details/japanesebusiness0000unse/page/237 }}</ref> Once all individual tasks are complete the group then combines each person's work and the project is the put together as a whole and returned to the supervisor. The work is viewed as a team effort and that each member of the group receives equal credit for being part of a team completing the goal assigned.  The group itself holds each member accountable for ensuring that the work is getting done, and that no one individual is doing more work than another. Another motivating factor is that the group's boss is also seated at the same desk, and the effect that this has on the individuals is that they must work hard just like the boss. The role of having an open layout with island type seating allows the office to be structured so the employees are put together as teams.\n\nThe type of organizational structure found within the Japanese office is known as a horizontal structure.  According to Andrew, Ghillyer, author of Management Now,\u201d Horizontal structure is an organization structure consisting of two groups: the first composed of senior management responsible for strategic decisions and policies and the second composed of empowered employees working together in different process teams; also known as a team structure.\u201d<ref>{{cite book | last = Ghillyer | first = Andrew | title = Management Now: Skills for 21st Century Management | page = 154 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York, NY | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780071315265}}</ref> The benefit of using this type of structure is that hierarchy is flattened to reduce supervision, teams are able to self-manage, team performance, not just the individual is rewarded, and training is highly emphasized amongst all employees. With the heightened sense of empowerment and responsibility workers are motivated to complete objectives in a timely manner. Having the office structured horizontally allows for the easy communication of introducing new policies and ideas amongst the groups.\n\n\u201cRingisho\u201d is the concept of submitting proposals and making decisions off those ideas. By unifying everyone together in the Japanese office it helps to make better-informed decisions on policies of the company that all managers and employees have input on. The idea behind this is to get a hold of various thinking individuals to see if there is a good way in writing their policies that come to benefit the company better.  Richard Lewis, author of ''When Cultures Collide'', states \u201cSuggestions, ideas and inventions make their way up the company hierarchy by a process of collecting signatures among workers and middle managers. Many people are involved. Top executives take the final step in ratifying items that have won sufficient approval.\u201d<ref>{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Richard D. | title = When cultures collide: leading across cultures | page = [https://archive.org/details/whenculturescoll00lewi_0/page/511 511] | publisher = Nicholas Brealey | location = Bostion | year = 2015 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781904838029 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/whenculturescoll00lewi_0/page/511 }}</ref> With this system in place changes to policies are only passed if there is an overall consensus to pass it.  Allowing each group to have a say on which policies should be implemented improves overall job satisfaction and harmony throughout the office.\n\nThe way Japanese offices are structured allow them to be more efficient when conducting business. The efficiency at which they operate has been noticed by such companies General Motors, Ford, Motorola, and Chrysler Company.  They continue to look for other ways to be more efficient and productive with the office layout and employee productivity.\n\n==Office spaces==\nThe main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their job\u2014preferably at minimum cost and to maximum satisfaction. With different people performing different tasks and activities, however, it is not always easy to select the right office spaces. To aid decision-making in workplace and office design, one can distinguish three different types of office spaces: work spaces, meeting spaces and support spaces. For new, or developing businesses, remote satellite offices and project rooms, [[serviced offices]] can provide a simple solution and provide all of the former types of space.\n\n===Work spaces===\nWork spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work.

Open plan offices put multiple workers together in the same space, and some studies have shown that they can improve short term productivity, i.e. within a single [[software]] [[project]].  At the same time, the loss of privacy and security can increase the incidence of theft and loss of company secrets.  A type of compromise between open plan and individual rooms is provided by the [[cubicle]] [[desk]], possibly made most famous by the ''[[Dilbert]]'' cartoon series, which solves visual privacy to some extent, but often fails on acoustic separation and security.  Most cubicles also require the occupant to sit with their back towards anyone who might be approaching; workers in walled offices almost always try to position their normal work seats and desks so that they can see someone entering, and in some instances, install tiny mirrors on things such as computer monitors.\n\n==Office buildings==<!-- This section is linked from the redirect page \"Office building\", linked from many articles -->\n\n[[File:Salinas Office.jpg|thumb|A small office building in [[Salinas, California]], [[United States]]]]\n[[File:View to One World Trade Center.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.8|The [[One World Trade Center]] in [[Manhattan]] is a high-rise office building, the tallest of its kind in the U.S.]]\n\nWhile offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult.  These requirements can be both legal (''e.g. light levels must be sufficient'') or technical (''e.g. requirements for computer networking'').  Alongside, other requirements such as security and flexibility of layout, has led to the creation of special [[building]]s which are dedicated only or primarily for use as offices. An '''office building''', also known as an '''office block''' or '''business center''' is a form of [[commercial building]] which contains spaces mainly designed to be used for offices.\n\nThe primary purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment primarily for administrative and managerial workers. These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipment they may need within these areas.\n\nAn office building will be divided into sections for different companies or may be dedicated to one company.  In either case, each company will typically have a reception area, one or several meeting rooms, singular or open-plan offices, as well as toilets.\n\nMany office buildings also have kitchen facilities and a staff room, where workers can have lunch or take a short break. Many office spaces are now also [[serviced office]] spaces, which means that those occupying a space or building can share facilities.\n\n==Office and retail rental rates==\n\nRental rates for office and retail space are typically quoted in terms of money per floor-area\u2013time, usually money per floor-area per year or month. For example, the rate for a particular property may be $29 per square-foot per year ($29/s.f/yr) - $290 per square-meter\u2013year ($290/m<sup>2</sup>/a), and rates in the area could range $20\u2013$50/s.f./yr ($200\u2013$500/m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7a).\n\nIn many countries, rent is typically paid monthly even if usually discussed in terms of years.\n\nExamples:\n* A particular 2,000 s.f. space is priced at $15/s.f./yr = (2,000 s.f.) \u00d7 ($15/s.f./a) / (12 mo/yr) = $2500/month\n* A 200 m<sup>2</sup> space priced at $150/m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7a = (200 m<sup>2</sup>) \u00d7 ($150/m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7a) / (12 mo/a) = $2500/month\n\nIn a ''gross lease'', the rate quoted is an all-inclusive rate. One pays a set amount of rent per time and the landlord is responsible for all other expenses such as costs of utilities, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs.\n\nThe ''triple net'' lease is one in which the tenant is liable for a share of various expenses such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, climate control, repairs, janitorial services and landscaping.\n\nOffice rents in the United States are still recovering from the high vacancy rates that occurred in the wake of the 2008 depression.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/realestate/pdf/This-Recovery%20-Explained.pdf |title=This Recovery Explained |publisher=The Steven L.

BOMA describes Class B office buildings as those that compete \"for a wide range of users with rents in the average range for the area\". BOMA states that Class B buildings have \"adequate systems\" and finishes that \"are fair to good for the area\", but that the buildings do not compete with Class A buildings for the same prices.

The word \"office\" may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see [[officer (disambiguation)|officer]], [[office-holder (disambiguation)|office-holder]], [[official]]); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty. When used as an [[adjective]], the term \"office\" may refer to [[business]]-related tasks. In [[legal|law]], a [[company]] or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of (for example) a [[storage silo]] rather than an establishment with [[desk]]-and-[[office chair|chair]]. An office is also an [[architectural]] and [[design]] phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a [[Bench (furniture)|bench]] in the corner of a [[small business]] of extremely small size (see [[small office/home office]]), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company. In modern terms an office is usually the location where [[white-collar worker]]s carry out their functions. As per [[James Stephenson]], \"Office is  that part of [[business enterprise]] which is devoted to the direction and co-ordination of its various activities.\"\n\nOffices in [[classical antiquity]] were often part of a palace complex or of a large temple. The [[High Middle Ages]] (1000\u20131300) saw the rise of the medieval [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom. With the growth of large, complex organizations in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed.{{by whom|date=September 2018}} As the [[Industrial Revolution]] intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of [[bank]]ing, [[rail transport|rail]], [[insurance]], [[retail]], [[petroleum]], and [[telegraph]]y grew dramatically, requiring many clerks, and as a result more office space was assigned to house their activities.

[[Work space]]s in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work. There are nine generic types of work space,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} each supporting different activities. In addition to individual cubicles, one can find [[meeting room]]s, [[lobby (room)|lounges]], and spaces for support activities, such as photocopying and filing. Some offices also have a kitchen area where workers can make their lunches. There are many{{quantify|date=September 2018}} different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial [[fashion]]s and the culture of specific companies can be even more important.  \nWhile offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult, such as requirements for light, networking, and security. The major purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment - primarily for administrative and managerial workers. These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, [[personal computer|PCs]] and other equipment they may need within these areas.\n\n==History==\nThe structure and shape of the office is impacted by both management thought as well as construction materials and may or may not have walls or barriers. The word stems from the Latin [[Officium (Ancient Rome)|officium]], and its equivalents in various, mainly romance, languages.  An officium was not necessarily a place, but rather an often mobile 'bureau' in the sense of a human staff or even the abstract notion of a formal position, such as a magistrature. The relatively elaborate Roman bureaucracy would not be equaled for centuries in the West after the fall of [[Rome]], even partially reverting to illiteracy, while the East preserved a more sophisticated administrative culture, both under Byzantium and under Islam.\n\nOffices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or a large temple. There was usually a room where [[Scroll (parchment)|scroll]]s were kept and [[scribe]]s did their work. Ancient texts mentioning the work of scribes allude to the existence of such \"offices\". These rooms are sometimes called \"libraries\" by some archaeologists and the general press because one often associates scrolls with literature. In fact they were true offices since the scrolls were meant for record keeping and other management functions such as treaties and edicts, and not for writing or keeping poetry or other works of fiction.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe [[High Middle Ages]] (1000\u20131300) saw the rise of the medieval [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom. The rooms of the chancery often had walls full of pigeonholes, constructed to hold rolled up pieces of parchment for safekeeping or ready reference, a precursor to the bookshelf. The introduction of printing during the [[Renaissance]] did not change these early government offices much.\n\n[[File:Office 1719.jpg|thumb|An early [[Europe]]an office]]\n\nMedieval illustrations, such as paintings or tapestries, often show people in their private offices handling record-keeping books or writing on scrolls of [[parchment]]. All kinds of writings seemed to be mixed in these early forms of offices. Before the invention of the [[printing press]] and its distribution there was often a very thin line between a private office and a private [[library]] since books were read or written in the same space at the same [[desk]] or [[Table (furniture)|table]], and general accounting and personal or private letters were also done there.\n\nIt was during the 13th century that the English form of the word first appeared when referring to a position involving duties (ex. the office of the ...).  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] appears to have first used the word in 1395 to mean a place where business is transacted in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.\n\nAs [[mercantilism]] became the dominant economic theory of the [[Renaissance]], merchants tended to conduct their business in the same buildings, which might include retail sales, warehousing and clerical work.  During the 15th century, population density in many cities reached the point where stand-alone buildings were used by merchants to conduct their business, and there was a developing a distinction between church, government/military, and commerce uses for buildings.<ref name=Long>{{cite book | last=Long | first=Kim | pages=14\u201316 | title=User Effective Buildings | location=Denver | publisher=Aardex Corporation | year=2004 | isbn=978-0975552407}}</ref>\n\n===Emergence of the modern office===\nWith the growth of large, complex organizations such as the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[East India Company]] in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed. The Old Admiralty ([[Ripley Building]]) was built in 1726 as a three-storey U-shaped brick building and was the first purpose built office building in Great Britain. As well as offices, the building housed a board room and [[apartment]]s for the Lords of the Admiralty. In the 1770s, many scattered offices for the [[Royal Navy]] were gathered into [[Somerset House]], the first block purpose-built for office work.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8S4yyAkysYgC|title=The Making of the Modern Admiralty:British Naval Policy-Making, 1805-1927|author=Hamilton, C.I|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=15|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617003219/https://books.google.com/books?id=8S4yyAkysYgC|archivedate=2016-06-17|isbn=9781139496544}}</ref>\n\n[[File:East India House by Thomas Malton the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|The sprawling complex of the extended [[East India House]] c.1800.

To transact business, an increasing large number of clerks were needed to handle order-processing, accounting, and document filing, with increasingly specialized office space required to house these activities. Most of the desks of the era were top heavy with paper storage bins extending above the desk-work area, giving the appearance of a cubicle and offering the workers some degree of privacy.\n\nThe relatively high price of land in the central core of cities lead to the first multi-story buildings, which were limited to about 10 stories until the use of [[Cast-iron architecture|iron and steel]] allowed for higher structures. The first purpose-built office block was the Brunswick Building, built in [[Liverpool]] in 1841.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolwiki.org/Liverpool_Firsts|title=Liverpool Firsts|accessdate=2012-12-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131220134929/http://www.liverpoolwiki.org/Liverpool_Firsts|archivedate=2013-12-20}}</ref> The invention of the safety [[Screw-drive elevator|elevator]] in 1852 by [[Elisha Otis]] saw the rapid escalation upward of buildings.<ref name=Long/> By the end of the 19th century, larger office buildings frequently contained large glass [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]]s to allow light into the complex and improve air circulation.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Office speaking tubes 1903.jpg|left|thumb|An office in 1903, equipped with [[speaking tube]]s]]\n\nBy 1906, [[Sears]], Roebuck and Co had opened their mail order and headquarters operation in a {{convert|3000000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building in Chicago, at the time the largest building in the world.

In 1964, the [[Herman Miller (office equipment)]] company engaged [[Robert Propst (inventor)|Robert Propst]], a prolific industrial designer, who came up with the concept of the [[Action Office]] which later evolved into the [[cubicle]] office furniture system.<ref name=Long/>\n\n=== Japan 20th century office ===\n\nJapanese businesses have set themselves apart from their American counterparts by implementing different techniques in the way they handle business.  The Japanese office layout improves work productivity, harmony in the office, and holds every employee accountable for the work they produce.  The type of office layout used in Japan is called an '''[[open plan]]''', and relies on ergonomics to help make employees as productive as possible.  The Japanese open office layout allows them to use an organizational structure known as the horizontal structure.  In the typical Japanese office there are no walls dividing desks, no cubicles, and no individual offices. Also they are able to implement policies using the ringi-sho consensus.\n\nIn order to get group members to work effectively in the open office floor plan the use of island style desks are used. The most dominant feature of the Japanese island style office layout is that each group forms an island.  Kageyu Noro, Goroh Fujimaki & Shinsuke Kishi, researches of ergonomics in the work place, stated,\u201d Japanese offices have traditionally adhered to island layouts because these reflect the Japanese style of teamwork and top-down style of management.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Noro | first1 = Kageyu | last2 = Fujimaki | first2 = Goroh | last3 = Kishi | first3 = Shinsuke | title = Evidence-based ergonomics: a comparison of Japanese and American office layouts | journal = International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 527&ndash;538 | doi = 10.1080/10803548.2003.11076588 | pmid = 14675524 | date = 2003 | ref = harv }}</ref> The group leader will then sit at the prominent position and ensure productivity.\n[[File:Good Smile Company offices ladies.jpg|thumb|Island style seating]]\nThe group leader will assign a task to the group, and each member of the group then receives their individual task to complete.  Island style seating also gives the group the benefit of being able to speak to one another at any time, and ask for help if needed.  Being in such close proximity to one another in the office gives another advantage to the supervisor in that he can call an uchi-awase.  Uchi-awase is an informal meeting in order to get an important message across, and also allows all members of the team to be creative in the office. \u201cThe open office layout allows for this because there are hardly any independent rooms or enclosures.  If the supervisor stands at his desk he can glance at his associates and easily call them over.\u201d, according to Durlabhji, Subhash, Norton E. Marks, and Scott Roach, authors of Japanese Business: Cultural Perspective.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Durlabhji | first1 = Subhash | last2 = Marks | first2 = Norton E. | last3 = Roach | first3 = Scott | title = Japanese business: cultural perspectives | pages = [https://archive.org/details/japanesebusiness0000unse/page/237 237&ndash;238] | publisher = State University of New York Press | location = Albany | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780791412527 | url = https://archive.org/details/japanesebusiness0000unse/page/237 }}</ref> Once all individual tasks are complete the group then combines each person's work and the project is the put together as a whole and returned to the supervisor. The work is viewed as a team effort and that each member of the group receives equal credit for being part of a team completing the goal assigned.  The group itself holds each member accountable for ensuring that the work is getting done, and that no one individual is doing more work than another. Another motivating factor is that the group's boss is also seated at the same desk, and the effect that this has on the individuals is that they must work hard just like the boss. The role of having an open layout with island type seating allows the office to be structured so the employees are put together as teams.\n\nThe type of organizational structure found within the Japanese office is known as a horizontal structure.  According to Andrew, Ghillyer, author of Management Now,\u201d Horizontal structure is an organization structure consisting of two groups: the first composed of senior management responsible for strategic decisions and policies and the second composed of empowered employees working together in different process teams; also known as a team structure.\u201d<ref>{{cite book | last = Ghillyer | first = Andrew | title = Management Now: Skills for 21st Century Management | page = 154 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York, NY | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780071315265}}</ref> The benefit of using this type of structure is that hierarchy is flattened to reduce supervision, teams are able to self-manage, team performance, not just the individual is rewarded, and training is highly emphasized amongst all employees. With the heightened sense of empowerment and responsibility workers are motivated to complete objectives in a timely manner. Having the office structured horizontally allows for the easy communication of introducing new policies and ideas amongst the groups.\n\n\u201cRingisho\u201d is the concept of submitting proposals and making decisions off those ideas. By unifying everyone together in the Japanese office it helps to make better-informed decisions on policies of the company that all managers and employees have input on. The idea behind this is to get a hold of various thinking individuals to see if there is a good way in writing their policies that come to benefit the company better.  Richard Lewis, author of ''When Cultures Collide'', states \u201cSuggestions, ideas and inventions make their way up the company hierarchy by a process of collecting signatures among workers and middle managers. Many people are involved. Top executives take the final step in ratifying items that have won sufficient approval.\u201d<ref>{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Richard D. | title = When cultures collide: leading across cultures | page = [https://archive.org/details/whenculturescoll00lewi_0/page/511 511] | publisher = Nicholas Brealey | location = Bostion | year = 2015 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781904838029 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/whenculturescoll00lewi_0/page/511 }}</ref> With this system in place changes to policies are only passed if there is an overall consensus to pass it.  Allowing each group to have a say on which policies should be implemented improves overall job satisfaction and harmony throughout the office.\n\nThe way Japanese offices are structured allow them to be more efficient when conducting business. The efficiency at which they operate has been noticed by such companies General Motors, Ford, Motorola, and Chrysler Company.  They continue to look for other ways to be more efficient and productive with the office layout and employee productivity.\n\n==Office spaces==\nThe main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their job\u2014preferably at minimum cost and to maximum satisfaction. With different people performing different tasks and activities, however, it is not always easy to select the right office spaces. To aid decision-making in workplace and office design, one can distinguish three different types of office spaces: work spaces, meeting spaces and support spaces. For new, or developing businesses, remote satellite offices and project rooms, [[serviced offices]] can provide a simple solution and provide all of the former types of space.\n\n===Work spaces===\nWork spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work. There are nine generic types of work space, each supporting different activities.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:open office.png|'''open office'''\nFile:team space.png|'''team space'''\nFile:cubicle.png|'''cubicle'''\n</gallery>\n\n'''Open office''': An open work space for more than ten people, suitable for activities which demand frequent communication or routine activities which need relatively little concentration\n\n'''Team space''': A semi-enclosed work space for two to eight people; suitable for teamwork which demands frequent internal communication and a medium level of concentration\n\n'''Cubicle''': A semi-enclosed work space for one person, suitable for activities which demand medium concentration and medium interaction\n\n<gallery>\nFile:private office.png|'''private office'''\nFile:shared office.png|'''shared office'''\nFile:team room.png|'''team room'''\n</gallery>\n\n'''Private office''': An enclosed work space for one person, suitable for activities which are confidential, demand a lot of concentration or include many small meetings\n\n'''Shared office''': An enclosed work space for two or three people, suitable for semi-concentrated work and collaborative work in small groups\n\n'''Team room''': An enclosed work space for four to ten people; suitable for teamwork which may be confidential and demands frequent internal communication\n\n<gallery>\nFile:study booth.png|'''study booth'''\nFile:work lounge.png|'''work lounge'''\nFile:touch down.png|'''touch down'''\n</gallery>\n\n'''Study booth''': An enclosed work space for one person; suitable for short-term activities which demand concentration or confidentiality\n\n'''Work lounge''': A lounge-like work space for two to six people; suitable for short-term activities which demand collaboration and/or allow impromptu interaction\n\n'''Touch down''': An open work space for one person; suitable for short-term activities which require little concentration and low interaction\n\n===Meeting spaces===\nMeeting spaces in an office typically use interactive processes, be it quick conversations or intensive brainstorms. There are six generic types of meeting space, each supporting different activities.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:small meeting room.png|'''small meeting room'''\nFile:large meeting room.png|'''large meeting room'''\nFile:small meeting space.png|'''Small meeting space'''\n</gallery>\n\n'''Small meeting room''': An enclosed meeting space for two to four persons, suitable for both formal and informal interaction\n\n'''Large meeting room''': An enclosed meeting space for five to twelve people, suitable for formal interaction\n\n'''Small meeting space''': An open or semi-open meeting space for two to four persons; suitable for short, informal interaction\n\n<gallery>\nFile:large meeting space.png|'''large meeting space'''\nFile:brainstorm room.png|'''brainstorm room'''\nFile:meeting point.png|'''meeting point'''\n</gallery>\n\n'''Large meeting space''': An open or semi-open meeting space for five to twelve people; suitable for short, informal interaction\n\n'''Brainstorm room''': An enclosed meeting space for five to twelve people; suitable for brainstorming sessions and workshops\n\n'''Meeting point''': An open meeting point for two to four persons; suitable for ad hoc, informal meetings\n\n===Support spaces===\nSupport spaces in an office are typically used for secondary activities such as filing documents or taking a break. There are twelve generic types of support space, each supporting different activities.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:filing space.png|'''filing space'''\nFile:storage sapce.png|'''storage space'''\nFile:print and copy area.png|'''print and copy area'''\n</gallery>\n\n'''Filing space''': An open or enclosed support space for the storage of frequently used files and documents\n\n'''Storage space''': An open or enclosed support space for the storage of commonly used office supplies\n\n'''Print and copy area''': An open or enclosed support space with facilities for printing, scanning and copying\n\n<gallery>\nFile:mail area.png|'''mail area'''\nFile:pantry area.png|'''pantry area'''\nFile:break area.png|'''break area'''\n</gallery>\n\n'''Mail area''': An open or semi-open support space where employees can pick up or deliver their personal mail\n\n'''Pantry area''': An open or enclosed support space where people can get coffee and tea as well as soft drinks and snacks\n\n'''Break area''': A semi-open or enclosed support space where employees can take a break from their work\n\n<gallery>\nFile:locker area.png|'''locker area'''\nFile:smoking room.png|'''smoking room'''\nFile:office library.png|'''library'''\n</gallery>\n\n'''Locker area''': An open or semi-open support space where employees can store their personal belongings\n\n'''Smoking room''': An enclosed support space where employees can smoke a cigarette\n\n'''Library''': A semi-open or enclosed support space for reading of books, journals and magazines\n\n<gallery>\nFile:games room.png|'''games room'''\nFile:waiting area.png|'''waiting area'''\nFile:circulation space.png|'''circulation space'''\n</gallery>\n\n'''Games room''': An enclosed support space where employees can play games (e.g. computer games, pool, darts)\n\n[[Lactation room]]: as of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a requirement for companies in the United States.\n\n'''Waiting area''': An open or semi-open support space where visitors can be received and can wait for their appointment\n\n'''Circulation space''': Support space which is required for circulation on office floors, linking all major functions\n\n==Office structure==\n[[File:TradeMe offices.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Open plan [[TradeMe]] offices, above [[NZX]], Wellington, New Zealand]]\n\nThere are many different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial [[fashion]]s, and the culture of specific companies can be even more important.  Choices include, how many people will work within the same room.  At one extreme, each individual worker will have their own room; at the other extreme a large '''[[open plan]]''' office can be made up of one main room with tens or hundreds of people working in the same space.  Open plan offices put multiple workers together in the same space, and some studies have shown that they can improve short term productivity, i.e. within a single [[software]] [[project]].  At the same time, the loss of privacy and security can increase the incidence of theft and loss of company secrets.  A type of compromise between open plan and individual rooms is provided by the [[cubicle]] [[desk]], possibly made most famous by the ''[[Dilbert]]'' cartoon series, which solves visual privacy to some extent, but often fails on acoustic separation and security.  Most cubicles also require the occupant to sit with their back towards anyone who might be approaching; workers in walled offices almost always try to position their normal work seats and desks so that they can see someone entering, and in some instances, install tiny mirrors on things such as computer monitors.\n\n==Office buildings==<!-- This section is linked from the redirect page \"Office building\", linked from many articles -->\n\n[[File:Salinas Office.jpg|thumb|A small office building in [[Salinas, California]], [[United States]]]]\n[[File:View to One World Trade Center.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.8|The [[One World Trade Center]] in [[Manhattan]] is a high-rise office building, the tallest of its kind in the U.S.]]\n\nWhile offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult.  These requirements can be both legal (''e.g. light levels must be sufficient'') or technical (''e.g. requirements for computer networking'').  Alongside, other requirements such as security and flexibility of layout, has led to the creation of special [[building]]s which are dedicated only or primarily for use as offices. An '''office building''', also known as an '''office block''' or business center is a form of [[commercial building]] which contains spaces mainly designed to be used for offices.\n\nThe primary purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment primarily for administrative and managerial workers. These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipment they may need within these areas.\n\nAn office building will be divided into sections for different companies or may be dedicated to one company.  In either case, each company will typically have a reception area, one or several meeting rooms, singular or open-plan offices, as well as toilets.\n\nMany office buildings also have kitchen facilities and a staff room, where workers can have lunch or take a short break. Many office spaces are now also [[serviced office]] spaces, which means that those occupying a space or building can share facilities.\n\n==Office and retail rental rates==\n\nRental rates for office and retail space are typically quoted in terms of money per floor-area\u2013time, usually money per floor-area per year or month. For example, the rate for a particular property may be $29 per square-foot per year ($29/s.f/yr) - $290 per square-meter\u2013year ($290/m<sup>2</sup>/a), and rates in the area could range $20\u2013$50/s.f./yr ($200\u2013$500/m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7a).\n\nIn many countries, rent is typically paid monthly even if usually discussed in terms of years.\n\nExamples:\n* A particular 2,000 s.f. space is priced at $15/s.f./yr = (2,000 s.f.) \u00d7 ($15/s.f./a) / (12 mo/yr) = $2500/month\n* A 200 m<sup>2</sup> space priced at $150/m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7a = (200 m<sup>2</sup>) \u00d7 ($150/m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7a) / (12 mo/a) = $2500/month\n\nIn a ''gross lease'', the rate quoted is an all-inclusive rate. One pays a set amount of rent per time and the landlord is responsible for all other expenses such as costs of utilities, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs.\n\nThe ''triple net'' lease is one in which the tenant is liable for a share of various expenses such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, climate control, repairs, janitorial services and landscaping.\n\nOffice rents in the United States are still recovering from the high vacancy rates that occurred in the wake of the 2008 depression.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/realestate/pdf/This-Recovery%20-Explained.pdf |title=This Recovery Explained |publisher=The Steven L.

BOMA states that Class A facilities have \"high quality standard finishes, state of the art systems, exceptional accessibility and a definite market presence\". BOMA describes Class B office buildings as those that compete \"for a wide range of users with rents in the average range for the area\". BOMA states that Class B buildings have \"adequate systems\" and finishes that \"are fair to good for the area\", but that the buildings do not compete with Class A buildings for the same prices. According to BOMA Class C buildings are aimed towards \"tenants requiring functional space at rents below the average for the area\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boma.org/research/Pages/building-class-definitions.aspx|accessdate=18 July 2013|title=Building Class Definitions|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827220305/http://www.boma.org/research/Pages/building-class-definitions.aspx|archivedate=27 August 2013}}</ref>  The lack of specifics allows considerable room for \"fudging\" the boundaries of the categories. Oftentimes, the above categories are further modified by adding the plus or minus sign to create subclasses, such as Class A+ or Class B-.<ref>{{cite web|title=CLASS A+ OFFICE SPACE|url=http://www.cbre.us/o/indianapolis/AssetLibrary/RiverNorth_Flyer.pdf|website=cbre.us|accessdate=21 September 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009000131/http://www.cbre.us/o/indianapolis/AssetLibrary/RiverNorth_Flyer.pdf|archivedate=9 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn order to differentiate between modern A class buildings and aging A class buildings, the notion of triple A class, and double A class is used.  A triple A class building that is 20 years old may be referred to as double A building or simply an A Class building, typically dependent on the number of new A class buildings that have been built since it was constructed.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n; Physical\n*[[Business park]]\n*[[Corner office]]\n*[[Executive suite]]\n*[[Factory]]\n*[[Office space planning]]\n*[[Office supplies]]\n*[[Over-illumination]]\n*[[Steel building]]s\n*[[Warehouse]]\n{{col-break}}\n{{Portal|Business|Architecture}}\n; Soft issues\n*[[Business attire]]\n*[[Office management]]\n*[[Workplace politics|Office politics]]\n*[[Sick building syndrome]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last = Adams | first = Scott | title = What do you call a sociopath in a cubicle?

The winner is crowned champion in the same manner as in other [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American sports leagues]] (i.e. via a [[Playoffs|playoff]] following a [[Season (sports)#Regular season|regular season]]).  This differs from other top soccer leagues around the world which consider the club with the most points at the end of the season to be the sole champion. MLS honors that achievement with the [[Supporters' Shield]]. A U.S.-based team that wins the MLS Cup is awarded one of that country's berths in the following year's [[CONCACAF Champions League]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2017/04/06/concacaf-champions-league-ccl-qualifying-format-changes|title=CONCACAF resolves qualifying problem for future CCL|last=Staff|first=SI com|website=SI.com|language=en|access-date=December 10, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/09/22/how-concacaf-champions-league-qualifiers-are-determined-mls|title=2019 CONCACAF Champions League qualifying process clarified|last=MLS Soccer Staff|date=October 21, 2018|access-date=December 10, 2018}}</ref> (The sole Canadian entrant in the Champions League is determined by a [[Canadian Championship|separate process]] also involving non-MLS teams; when Canadian team [[Toronto FC]] won the 2017 MLS Cup, an additional U.S. team was selected based on regular-season performance.)<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe league hosted its inaugural championship, [[MLS Cup 1996]] on October 20, 1996. Today the MLS Cup is typically held in the middle of November, featuring the winners of the Eastern Conference Championship and Western Conference Championship. [[LA Galaxy]] are the most successful team, winning a record fifth Cup in [[MLS Cup 2014|2014]].\n\nDuring its history, the MLS Cup has been represented by the [[Alan I. Rothenberg]] Trophy from 1996 through 1998, a redesigned Alan I. Rothenberg Trophy from 1999 through 2007, and the [[Philip F.

United's early successes ===\nThe MLS Cup's roots trace back to the foundation of Major League Soccer, when the league decided to have a championship format similar to its contemporary North American sports leagues by having the season culminate in a postseason tournament to determine the league champion.\n\nFor the first few MLS Cup finals, the championship was dominated by [[D.C. United]], who appeared in the first four MLS Cup finals, winning three of them. The inaugural MLS Cup in [[MLS Cup 1996|1996]] was the first championship match, featuring United and [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]]. The inaugural match had the Galaxy take an early 1\u20130 lead, and double in early in the second half. However, their lead was relinquished towards the end of the match when [[Tony Sanneh]] pulled one back in the 72nd minute. Nine minutes later, [[Shawn Medved]] tied the match at two, resulting in [[overtime]] between the two sides. Four minutes into overtime, [[Eddie Pope]] gave United the [[golden goal]] victory.\n\nIn [[MLS Cup 1997|1997]], the second league cup final was contested at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]], where United won back-to-back titles, a feat that would not be accomplished for another decade (when [[Houston Dynamo]] won the 2006 and 2007 finals). The game ended 2\u20131 in United's favor over [[Colorado Rapids]], who would not win a championship until [[MLS Cup 2010|2010]]. [[Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)|Jaime Moreno]] was declared [[Man of the Match]] for his goal in the 37th minute of play. This season was also the first time in league history any MLS team won the regular season ([[MLS Supporters' Shield|Supporters' Shield]]) and postseason title in the same season.\n\nD.C. United's run ended the third year, when they made a third run to the MLS Cup finals, only to lose to the expansion-side [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] by 2-0. However the following year, United repeated their [[Double (association football)|\"double\"]] of winning both the Supporters Shield and MLS Cup the same season. This time, it was a 2\u20130 win over the Galaxy in the [[MLS Cup 1999|1999 MLS Cup final]].\n\n=== Rise of the California Cl\u00e1sico ===\n\nFor the first time since 1997, the [[MLS Cup 2000|2000 MLS Cup]] final saw a new club reach the finals along with the Fire. This time the [[Kansas City Wizards]] won their first MLS Cup with a 1\u20130 victory over the Fire.\n\n[[File:LandonDonovan1.jpg|175px|thumb|right|[[Landon Donovan]] of San Jose defending against Chicago's [[Carlos Bocanegra]] in the [[MLS Cup 2003|2003 MLS Cup]].]]\n\nFrom 2001 through 2004, the MLS Cup finals saw a rising of the [[California Cl\u00e1sico]] when stateside rivals, L.A. Galaxy and [[San Jose Earthquakes]] clashed together in the 2001 final. The match also saw the rise of U.S. national [[Landon Donovan]] who won a Newcomer of the Year award and tallied the equalizer in the Earthquakes 2\u20131 championship victory over the Galaxy.\n\nWith the largest crowd in MLS Cup history at hand, the New England Revolution took on the Galaxy in the 2002 finals. For the match, over 61,000 fans were in attendance at [[Gillette Stadium]] to witness the final. In the second period of sudden-death overtime, the Galaxy nabbed their first MLS Cup title, and sparked the start of a string of MLS Cup losses for the Revolution.\n\nThe 2003 final saw the league leaders for that season go head-to-head. Two clubs that had MLS Cup experience, the Fire and Earthquakes, played for the final that year. The two clubs had successful regular season campaigns with the Fire winning their first Supporters' Shield, and the Earthquakes being the Western Conference regular season and post-season champions as well as having the second best overall regular season record. In a hotly contested match, the Earthquakes won with their second MLS Cup title with a 4\u20132 score making it the highest scoring MLS Cup final in league history (six goals).\n\nAfter a four-year absence, United made their fifth trip to the MLS Cup final, playing against the Wizards for [[MLS Cup 2004]]. The match had four goals scored in the first 25 minutes, with United rallying for a 3\u20131 lead. Midway through the second half, United had relinquished a penalty kick. [[Josh Wolff]] scored for Kansas City, bringing the game within a goal. D.C. United was able to retain the lead, by winning their fourth MLS Cup title, by a score of 3\u20132.\n\n=== Format changes ===\n\nUntil 2005, the MLS Cup championship games had been dominated by clubs that had either won or had come close to winning the Supporters Shield. In the [[MLS Cup 2005|2005 MLS Cup]] championship, the match was won by the [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]], who won the league title by having a 9th-place overall record.<ref name=\"mls cup 2005 seattle times recap\"/> Consequently, the Wizards had a better record, but did not qualify for the playoffs because they finished 5th in the Eastern Conference, in spite of an 8th-place overall record.<ref name=\"mls cup 2005 seattle times recap\">{{cite news|last=Romero |first=Jos\u00e9 Miguel |title=MLS Cup History {{!}} Galaxy blanks Revs 1\u20130 to win 2005 title |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sounders/2010259600_webmlscup20.html |accessdate=May 4, 2011 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=November 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125001235/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sounders/2010259600_webmlscup20.html |archivedate=November 25, 2009 }}</ref> The result prompted MLS to create new wild-cards that were used starting in 2006, where only a certain number of clubs per conference could qualify, and the next best overall teams regardless of conference would also qualify.

It was redesigned after the 2008 season after the change to the MLS Cup trophy. It is now an oval-shaped black badge with the [[Philip F. Anschutz Trophy]] in the middle. The MLS scudetto is worn by the winning team the season following the victory. It is only during the subsequent season (two years after winning the championship), that the team adds a [[Star (football badge)|star]] \u2013 a common soccer signifier of titles won \u2013 above the team logo. The team can display the star on other items beside their jersey in the year after winning the Cup, but only if the scudetto is not shown. The [[Columbus Crew SC|Columbus Crew]] was the first team to wear the redesigned scudetto. [[Real Salt Lake]] would wear the scudetto in 2010 after winning their first MLS cup in 2009. A year after the [[Colorado Rapids]] would also wear the scudetto after their cup run in 2010 for the 2011 season. Finally the Los Angeles Galaxy would wear the scudetto after winning the MLS Cup in 2011, ironically it would be the last team to wear the redesigned scudetto. After the 2012 season, MLS decided not to use the scudetto for upcoming season and instead the defending MLS Cup champions would have a gold star above one or more silver stars indication the team's MLS Cup wins, followed by an additional silver star added to the lined stars the following season. The Los Angeles Galaxy were the first to receive the gold star above the team's three silver stars for the 2013 season.\n\n=== \"Buffalo Bills\" of MLS ===\n\nWhile the Galaxy earned their second MLS Cup trophy and the Houston Dynamo earned consecutive cups, the New England Revolution went on a run of making three consecutive MLS Cup finals, losing all of them. Two of their three losses were in extra time, while the other was lost on penalty kicks. The infamy gave the club the title of being the [[Buffalo Bills]] (an [[National Football League|NFL]] American football team) of MLS.<ref>{{cite news|last=Londono|first=Taurus|title=For New England Revs fan flashbacks of Buffalo Bills, chance for redemption|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ycn-8060040|accessdate=May 12, 2011|newspaper=Yahoo! news|date=March 16, 2011}}</ref> This was in reference to the Buffalo Bills [[Super Bowl]] games in the early 1990s, in which they lost in four consecutive appearances. In the 2005 final, they lost to the Los Angeles Galaxy, a rematch of 2002, in the final. Held at Pizza Hut Park (now [[Toyota Stadium (Texas)|Toyota Stadium]]) in [[Frisco, Texas]], the Galaxy defeated the Revolution by a score of 1\u20130 thanks to a 105th-minute overtime goal from Galaxy midfielder and [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemalan]] international, [[Guillermo Ram\u00edrez]]. Ram\u00edrez's goal sealed the Galaxy's second MLS Cup title, and left the Revs searching once again.\n\nIn 2006, the championship was once again played in Frisco at Pizza Hut Park. This time the Revolution took on the [[Houston Dynamo]]. Both were coming off a successful season, in which they fell short of winning the Supporters' Shield. A sellout crowd of 22,427 attended the match, which is to date the largest crowd in the stadium's history.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Revolution forward [[Taylor Twellman]] scored an overtime goal in the 113th minute to give the Revolution the 1\u20130 lead. However, Dynamo captain and forward [[Brian Ching]] immediately tied the score following the Revolution's goal. The match went to penalties, in which the Dynamo won 4\u20133. This left the Revolution for a second-consecutive year searching for league glory. It was also the first time in league history that a club made the MLS Cup final and lost consecutively.<ref name=\"mls cup 2007\"/>\n\nIn the 2007 final, the Revolution and Dynamo played each other once again for the 2007 cup. Played in Washington, D.C. at RFK Stadium, a crowd just shy of 40,000 witnessed the championship.<ref name=\"mls cup 2007\"/> The announced crowd of 39,859 made it the largest MLS Cup crowd since 2002.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The Revolution had a successful season, earning their first [[U.S. Open Cup]] title. The Revolution wanted their first MLS Cup crown, and wanted to win their first \"Double\" in club history. Houston, finishing just shy once again to [[D.C. United]] of winning the [[MLS Supporters' Shield]] were determined to finish their second season with some hardware, and to defend their MLS Cup title.<ref name=\"mls cup 2007\"/> The match went in the Revolution's favor early on, as the Revolution's captain, Twellman, netted in the 20th minute to give New England a 1\u20130 lead. However, midway through the second half, the Dynamo retaliated. Dynamo striker [[Joseph Ngwenya]] leveled things at one apiece in the 61st minute, and MLS Cup Man of the Match, [[Dwayne De Rosario]] gave the Dynamo a 2\u20131 lead in the 74th.<ref name=\"mls cup 2007\"/> The goal also proved to be the winning goal, as the Dynamo earned the first back-to-back MLS Cup titles since [[D.C.

Galaxy in [[MLS Cup 2009]] to win their first championship.]]\n\nEarly in the [[2008 Major League Soccer season|2008 Major League Soccer]] season, the league announced that the championship would be returning to [[Home Depot Center]]. Throughout the regular season, the league was dominated by the Columbus Crew, who finished the season with 57 points, and secured the Supporters' Shield title with three matches remaining before the [[2008 MLS Cup Playoffs]]. Traditionally, the Shield winners only rarely made it to the league championship, in spite of usually being the heavy favorites going into the playoffs. However, for the first time in eight years, a regular season champion made it to the MLS Cup final. The [[Sigi Schmid]]-led club made their first run to the championship, along with their opponents the [[New York Red Bulls]]. For the Crew, being the Shield winners, their run to the final was a bit expected. The Red Bulls making the final was seen as a large surprise, possibly even a fluke. The Red Bulls did not qualify for the playoffs until the last day of the season, where they were the weakest team, in terms of regular season record, to qualify for the playoffs. The match ended up being dominated by the Crew as Columbus defeated New York with ease, 3\u20131. The point gap between the two clubs was the largest in history, and the scoreline between the two clubs made it tied for the largest margin of victory in MLS Cup history. New York's run to the finals was further emphasized as a fluke when the club had the worst record in 2009.\n\nThe following championship saw two intra-conference clubs meet in the final for the second consecutive year, this time in [[Seattle]]'s Qwest Field (now [[CenturyLink Field]]). The Western Conference regular season and postseason champions, [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]] took on [[Real Salt Lake]], who finished fifth in the West. Although the Sounders FC management had originally planned on capping the seats available in Qwest Field to 35,700, surging demand led to the release of an additional 10,000 seats, expanding the total capacity to roughly 45,700.  The announced crowd was 46,011. The crowd size was the first championship crowd since 2002 to draw over 45,000 spectators. Televised on [[ESPN]], it was the first time that the MLS championship match was televised on the cable network; the first thirteen were carried on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. In the 41st minute, Galaxy striker [[Mike Magee (soccer)|Mike Magee]] scored, only for Salt Lake's [[Robbie Findley]] to make the tying goal in the 61st. The stalemate was not broken in regulation nor overtime, requiring penalty kicks to decide the match. Thanks to a strike from Salt Lake's [[Robbie Russell (soccer)|Robbie Russell]], Salt Lake won their first major trophy. By winning the championship, they gained entry into the [[2010\u201311 CONCACAF Champions League]]. There, they made it to the final, only to lose to [[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]] of Mexico.\n\nAt the 2010 season's end, six teams from the Western Conference qualified for the playoffs, whereas only two clubs from the East qualified, making it the largest disparity between the two conferences in league history. The league's seeding at the time awarded conference winners earned the top seeds, the two weakest Western Conference teams, [[San Jose Earthquakes]] and [[Colorado Rapids]] were seeded against the Eastern Conference champion, [[New York Red Bulls]] and runner-up [[Columbus Crew SC|Columbus Crew]], respectively. Some cited this as an unfair advantage for the Rapids and Earthquakes, as both teams made the semi-finals. In the end, the Rapids played FC Dallas for [[MLS Cup 2010]], winning 2\u20131 in overtime.\n\n=== Galaxy dynasty ===\n\n[[File:Robbie_Keane.jpg|thumb|right|[[LA Galaxy]] captain, [[Robbie Keane]] was the [[MLS Cup 2014|2014 MLS Cup MVP]].]]\n\nBetween the 2011 and 2014 MLS Cups, the [[LA Galaxy]] appeared in three MLS Cup finals, winning every single final, having the most success in MLS Cup in a short period of time since United's late 1990s dynasty. The only final that the Galaxy did not win, came in 2013, where they lost in the 2013 Western Conference finals to eventual runner-up, [[Real Salt Lake]]. During that time, the Galaxy became the first MLS franchise to win five MLS Cups, when they won [[MLS Cup 2014]]. These teams contained several high-profile players including Landon Donovan, [[Robbie Keane]], [[Gyasi Zardes]], [[David Beckham]] and [[Omar Gonzalez]].\n\nSome claim that the Galaxy's dynasty began in 2009, when they reached the playoffs for the first time since 2005, and marched to the finals, only to lose on penalties to [[Real Salt Lake]]. In 2010, and again, in 2011, the Galaxy won consecutive [[Supporters' Shield]], and completed the league double winning both the Shield and MLS Cup in 2011. This was the first time this had been accomplished since the Columbus Crew achieved it in 2008. In the [[MLS Cup 2011|2011 MLS Cup final]], the Galaxy defeated the [[Houston Dynamo]], 1&ndash;0 off a 72nd minute Donovan goal. The goal was scored off a Galaxy counter where Beckham fed a through ball to Donovan who slotted it past Hall. The 2012 final featured both the Galaxy and Dynamo again, making it the first since 2007 that an MLS Cup final was a rematch of the previous final. Again, the Galaxy won the final, this time [[MLS Cup 2012#Match details|coming from behind]] to defeat the Dynamo by a 3&ndash;1 scoreline. The match was Beckham's final MLS match.\n\nDuring the 2013 season, the Galaxy's chance to three-peat was thwarted by Real Salt Lake. Salt Lake defeated the Galaxy, 2&ndash;1 on aggregate, to advance to the MLS Cup final, where they eventually lost to [[Sporting Kansas City]].\n\n[[2014 MLS Season|The following season]], the Galaxy reached the MLS Cup final again, playing the [[New England Revolution]], making it a rematch of [[MLS Cup 2002]] and [[MLS Cup 2005]]. In extra-time a Robbie Keane goal propelled the Galaxy to their fifth MLS match, a victory in the 2014 MLS Cup.\n\n=== Expansion teams from Cascadia, Canada, and Atlanta ===\n[[File:Osvaldo Alonso lifting the MLS Cup at Sounders Rally.jpg|thumb|right|Osvaldo Alonso of Seattle Sounders FC lifting the MLS Cup trophy in December 2016]]\nThe [[Portland Timbers]] won the [[2015 MLS Cup]], defeating the Columbus Crew 2\u20131.

The temperature at the start of the match was {{convert|21|F|C}} ({{convert|10|F|C}}, when adjusted for wind chill), with strong winds coming off Lake Ontario.  The field was watered shortly before the match, and resultant field was described as icy by players.  The [[Seattle Sounders FC]] defeated [[Toronto FC]] 5\u20134 in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] after a scoreless match of 90 minutes regular time and 30 minutes overtime. The Sounders did not register a single shot on goal, becoming the first MLS club to do so in a match, regular season or otherwise. The Sounders, despite a very poor start and mid-season managerial change, became the second team from the [[Pacific Northwest]] to win the cup, after Portland in 2015.\n\nIn the [[2017 MLS Cup]], Toronto FC and Seattle faced off in a rematch of the previous edition, also at BMO Field. Toronto FC won the match 2\u20130, and became the first Canadian team to win the MLS Cup, and the first MLS team to complete a domestic [[treble (association football)|treble]], after winning the [[Canadian Championship]] and [[Supporters' Shield]] earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite news |date=December 9, 2017 |title=Toronto beats Seattle to win MLS Cup |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42282402 |work=[[BBC Sports]] |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:AUFC MLS Cup ceremony.jpg|thumb|Pyrotechnics display during [[Atlanta United FC|Atlanta United's]] trophy ceremony following the [[MLS Cup 2018|2018 MLS Cup]] final]]\n\n[[Atlanta United FC]], in their second season as an expansion team, won the [[MLS Cup 2018|2018 edition]] of the MLS Cup by defeating the [[Portland Timbers]] 2\u20130.

Anschutz Trophy]], named for the contributions and investment to American soccer and MLS by [[Philip Anschutz]]. Typically, the award presentation is held on a podium in the center of the field, where the league commissioner will award the team with the cup.\n\nBefore the actual award presentation, the finalists are awarded with silver medals with the league's logo imprinted on them. The champions are then presented with gold medals, before the trophy is handed to the winning team's captain.\n\nIn cup history, the MLS Cup champions have been awarded with three different trophies. For the first three MLS Cup finals, the winning team was awarded with the [[Alan I. Rothenberg]] Trophy, named for Rothenberg's contributions to American soccer. The Rothenberg Trophy was a dark gold trophy that had two handles around a soccer ball, with the league's logo imprinted on the plaque. In 1999, the Rothenberg Trophy was redesigned with a soccer ball placed on a beacon. In 2008, the trophy was redesigned again to its present state and renamed the Philip F. Anschutz Trophy.\n\n== Venues ==\n[[File:LA Galaxy vs Houston Dynamo- Western Conference Finals panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[StubHub Center]] has hosted six MLS Cup finals.]]\n\nIn MLS Cup history, seven matches have been played in the Greater Los Angeles area.

The Galaxy became the second team (and first since D.C.

United's early successes ===\nThe MLS Cup's roots trace back to the foundation of Major League Soccer, when the league decided to have a championship format similar to its contemporary North American sports leagues by having the season culminate in a postseason tournament to determine the league champion.\n\nFor the first few MLS Cup finals, the championship was dominated by [[D.C. United]], who appeared in the first four MLS Cup finals, winning three of them. The inaugural MLS Cup in [[MLS Cup 1996|1996]] was the first championship match, featuring United and [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]]. The inaugural match had the Galaxy take an early 1\u20130 lead, and double in early in the second half. However, their lead was relinquished towards the end of the match when [[Tony Sanneh]] pulled one back in the 72nd minute. Nine minutes later, [[Shawn Medved]] tied the match at two, resulting in [[overtime]] between the two sides. Four minutes into overtime, [[Eddie Pope]] gave United the [[golden goal]] victory.\n\nIn [[MLS Cup 1997|1997]], the second league cup final was contested at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]], where United won back-to-back titles, a feat that would not be accomplished for another decade (when [[Houston Dynamo]] won the 2006 and 2007 finals). The game ended 2\u20131 in United's favor over [[Colorado Rapids]], who would not win a championship until [[MLS Cup 2010|2010]]. [[Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)|Jaime Moreno]] was declared [[Man of the Match]] for his goal in the 37th minute of play. This season was also the first time in league history any MLS team won the regular season ([[MLS Supporters' Shield|Supporters' Shield]]) and postseason title in the same season.\n\nD.C. United's run ended the third year, when they made a third run to the MLS Cup finals, only to lose to the expansion-side [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] by 2-0. However the following year, United repeated their [[Double (association football)|\"double\"]] of winning both the Supporters Shield and MLS Cup the same season. This time, it was a 2\u20130 win over the Galaxy in the [[MLS Cup 1999|1999 MLS Cup final]].\n\n=== Rise of the California Cl\u00e1sico ===\n\nFor the first time since 1997, the [[MLS Cup 2000|2000 MLS Cup]] final saw a new club reach the finals along with the Fire. This time the [[Kansas City Wizards]] won their first MLS Cup with a 1\u20130 victory over the Fire.\n\n[[File:LandonDonovan1.jpg|175px|thumb|right|[[Landon Donovan]] of San Jose defending against Chicago's [[Carlos Bocanegra]] in the [[MLS Cup 2003|2003 MLS Cup]].]]\n\nFrom 2001 through 2004, the MLS Cup finals saw a rising of the [[California Cl\u00e1sico]] when stateside rivals, L.A. Galaxy and [[San Jose Earthquakes]] clashed together in the 2001 final. The match also saw the rise of U.S. national [[Landon Donovan]] who won a Newcomer of the Year award and tallied the equalizer in the Earthquakes 2\u20131 championship victory over the Galaxy.\n\nWith the largest crowd in MLS Cup history at hand, the New England Revolution took on the Galaxy in the 2002 finals. For the match, over 61,000 fans were in attendance at [[Gillette Stadium]] to witness the final. In the second period of sudden-death overtime, the Galaxy nabbed their first MLS Cup title, and sparked the start of a string of MLS Cup losses for the Revolution.\n\nThe 2003 final saw the league leaders for that season go head-to-head. Two clubs that had MLS Cup experience, the Fire and Earthquakes, played for the final that year. The two clubs had successful regular season campaigns with the Fire winning their first Supporters' Shield, and the Earthquakes being the Western Conference regular season and post-season champions as well as having the second best overall regular season record. In a hotly contested match, the Earthquakes won with their second MLS Cup title with a 4\u20132 score making it the highest scoring MLS Cup final in league history (six goals).\n\nAfter a four-year absence, United made their fifth trip to the MLS Cup final, playing against the Wizards for [[MLS Cup 2004]]. The match had four goals scored in the first 25 minutes, with United rallying for a 3\u20131 lead. Midway through the second half, United had relinquished a penalty kick. [[Josh Wolff]] scored for Kansas City, bringing the game within a goal. D.C. United was able to retain the lead, by winning their fourth MLS Cup title, by a score of 3\u20132.\n\n=== Format changes ===\n\nUntil 2005, the MLS Cup championship games had been dominated by clubs that had either won or had come close to winning the Supporters Shield.

Rothenberg MLS Cup trophy. First worn by [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]] in 2006, following their [[MLS Cup 2005|2005 MLS Cup]] title,<ref>[http://www.mlsnet.com/MLS/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20060120&content_id=50854&vkey=news_mls&fext=.jsp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220200116/http://www.mlsnet.com/MLS/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20060120&content_id=50854&vkey=news_mls&fext=.jsp|date=February 20, 2006}}</ref> the Houston Dynamo wore the same triangular scudettos in 2007 and 2008 during their dual-cup run. It was redesigned after the 2008 season after the change to the MLS Cup trophy. It is now an oval-shaped black badge with the [[Philip F. Anschutz Trophy]] in the middle. The MLS scudetto is worn by the winning team the season following the victory. It is only during the subsequent season (two years after winning the championship), that the team adds a [[Star (football badge)|star]] \u2013 a common soccer signifier of titles won \u2013 above the team logo. The team can display the star on other items beside their jersey in the year after winning the Cup, but only if the scudetto is not shown. The [[Columbus Crew SC|Columbus Crew]] was the first team to wear the redesigned scudetto. [[Real Salt Lake]] would wear the scudetto in 2010 after winning their first MLS cup in 2009. A year after the [[Colorado Rapids]] would also wear the scudetto after their cup run in 2010 for the 2011 season. Finally the Los Angeles Galaxy would wear the scudetto after winning the MLS Cup in 2011, ironically it would be the last team to wear the redesigned scudetto. After the 2012 season, MLS decided not to use the scudetto for upcoming season and instead the defending MLS Cup champions would have a gold star above one or more silver stars indication the team's MLS Cup wins, followed by an additional silver star added to the lined stars the following season. The Los Angeles Galaxy were the first to receive the gold star above the team's three silver stars for the 2013 season.\n\n=== \"Buffalo Bills\" of MLS ===\n\nWhile the Galaxy earned their second MLS Cup trophy and the Houston Dynamo earned consecutive cups, the New England Revolution went on a run of making three consecutive MLS Cup finals, losing all of them. Two of their three losses were in extra time, while the other was lost on penalty kicks. The infamy gave the club the title of being the [[Buffalo Bills]] (an [[National Football League|NFL]] American football team) of MLS.<ref>{{cite news|last=Londono|first=Taurus|title=For New England Revs fan flashbacks of Buffalo Bills, chance for redemption|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ycn-8060040|accessdate=May 12, 2011|newspaper=Yahoo! news|date=March 16, 2011}}</ref> This was in reference to the Buffalo Bills [[Super Bowl]] games in the early 1990s, in which they lost in four consecutive appearances. In the 2005 final, they lost to the Los Angeles Galaxy, a rematch of 2002, in the final. Held at Pizza Hut Park (now [[Toyota Stadium (Texas)|Toyota Stadium]]) in [[Frisco, Texas]], the Galaxy defeated the Revolution by a score of 1\u20130 thanks to a 105th-minute overtime goal from Galaxy midfielder and [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemalan]] international, [[Guillermo Ram\u00edrez]]. Ram\u00edrez's goal sealed the Galaxy's second MLS Cup title, and left the Revs searching once again.\n\nIn 2006, the championship was once again played in Frisco at Pizza Hut Park. This time the Revolution took on the [[Houston Dynamo]]. Both were coming off a successful season, in which they fell short of winning the Supporters' Shield. A sellout crowd of 22,427 attended the match, which is to date the largest crowd in the stadium's history.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Revolution forward [[Taylor Twellman]] scored an overtime goal in the 113th minute to give the Revolution the 1\u20130 lead. However, Dynamo captain and forward [[Brian Ching]] immediately tied the score following the Revolution's goal. The match went to penalties, in which the Dynamo won 4\u20133. This left the Revolution for a second-consecutive year searching for league glory. It was also the first time in league history that a club made the MLS Cup final and lost consecutively.<ref name=\"mls cup 2007\"/>\n\nIn the 2007 final, the Revolution and Dynamo played each other once again for the 2007 cup. Played in Washington, D.C. at RFK Stadium, a crowd just shy of 40,000 witnessed the championship.<ref name=\"mls cup 2007\"/> The announced crowd of 39,859 made it the largest MLS Cup crowd since 2002.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The Revolution had a successful season, earning their first [[U.S. Open Cup]] title. The Revolution wanted their first MLS Cup crown, and wanted to win their first \"Double\" in club history. Houston, finishing just shy once again to [[D.C. United]] of winning the [[MLS Supporters' Shield]] were determined to finish their second season with some hardware, and to defend their MLS Cup title.<ref name=\"mls cup 2007\"/> The match went in the Revolution's favor early on, as the Revolution's captain, Twellman, netted in the 20th minute to give New England a 1\u20130 lead. However, midway through the second half, the Dynamo retaliated. Dynamo striker [[Joseph Ngwenya]] leveled things at one apiece in the 61st minute, and MLS Cup Man of the Match, [[Dwayne De Rosario]] gave the Dynamo a 2\u20131 lead in the 74th.<ref name=\"mls cup 2007\"/> The goal also proved to be the winning goal, as the Dynamo earned the first back-to-back MLS Cup titles since [[D.C.

Galaxy in [[MLS Cup 2009]] to win their first championship.]]\n\nEarly in the [[2008 Major League Soccer season|2008 Major League Soccer]] season, the league announced that the championship would be returning to [[Home Depot Center]]. Throughout the regular season, the league was dominated by the Columbus Crew, who finished the season with 57 points, and secured the Supporters' Shield title with three matches remaining before the [[2008 MLS Cup Playoffs]]. Traditionally, the Shield winners only rarely made it to the league championship, in spite of usually being the heavy favorites going into the playoffs. However, for the first time in eight years, a regular season champion made it to the MLS Cup final. The [[Sigi Schmid]]-led club made their first run to the championship, along with their opponents the [[New York Red Bulls]]. For the Crew, being the Shield winners, their run to the final was a bit expected. The Red Bulls making the final was seen as a large surprise, possibly even a fluke. The Red Bulls did not qualify for the playoffs until the last day of the season, where they were the weakest team, in terms of regular season record, to qualify for the playoffs. The match ended up being dominated by the Crew as Columbus defeated New York with ease, 3\u20131. The point gap between the two clubs was the largest in history, and the scoreline between the two clubs made it tied for the largest margin of victory in MLS Cup history. New York's run to the finals was further emphasized as a fluke when the club had the worst record in 2009.\n\nThe following championship saw two intra-conference clubs meet in the final for the second consecutive year, this time in [[Seattle]]'s Qwest Field (now [[CenturyLink Field]]). The Western Conference regular season and postseason champions, [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]] took on [[Real Salt Lake]], who finished fifth in the West. Although the Sounders FC management had originally planned on capping the seats available in Qwest Field to 35,700, surging demand led to the release of an additional 10,000 seats, expanding the total capacity to roughly 45,700.  The announced crowd was 46,011. The crowd size was the first championship crowd since 2002 to draw over 45,000 spectators. Televised on [[ESPN]], it was the first time that the MLS championship match was televised on the cable network; the first thirteen were carried on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. In the 41st minute, Galaxy striker [[Mike Magee (soccer)|Mike Magee]] scored, only for Salt Lake's [[Robbie Findley]] to make the tying goal in the 61st. The stalemate was not broken in regulation nor overtime, requiring penalty kicks to decide the match. Thanks to a strike from Salt Lake's [[Robbie Russell (soccer)|Robbie Russell]], Salt Lake won their first major trophy. By winning the championship, they gained entry into the [[2010\u201311 CONCACAF Champions League]]. There, they made it to the final, only to lose to [[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]] of Mexico.\n\nAt the 2010 season's end, six teams from the Western Conference qualified for the playoffs, whereas only two clubs from the East qualified, making it the largest disparity between the two conferences in league history. The league's seeding at the time awarded conference winners earned the top seeds, the two weakest Western Conference teams, [[San Jose Earthquakes]] and [[Colorado Rapids]] were seeded against the Eastern Conference champion, [[New York Red Bulls]] and runner-up [[Columbus Crew SC|Columbus Crew]], respectively. Some cited this as an unfair advantage for the Rapids and Earthquakes, as both teams made the semi-finals. In the end, the Rapids played FC Dallas for [[MLS Cup 2010]], winning 2\u20131 in overtime.\n\n=== Galaxy dynasty ===\n\n[[File:Robbie_Keane.jpg|thumb|right|[[LA Galaxy]] captain, [[Robbie Keane]] was the [[MLS Cup 2014|2014 MLS Cup MVP]].]]\n\nBetween the 2011 and 2014 MLS Cups, the [[LA Galaxy]] appeared in three MLS Cup finals, winning every single final, having the most success in MLS Cup in a short period of time since United's late 1990s dynasty. The only final that the Galaxy did not win, came in 2013, where they lost in the 2013 Western Conference finals to eventual runner-up, [[Real Salt Lake]]. During that time, the Galaxy became the first MLS franchise to win five MLS Cups, when they won [[MLS Cup 2014]]. These teams contained several high-profile players including Landon Donovan, [[Robbie Keane]], [[Gyasi Zardes]], [[David Beckham]] and [[Omar Gonzalez]].\n\nSome claim that the Galaxy's dynasty began in 2009, when they reached the playoffs for the first time since 2005, and marched to the finals, only to lose on penalties to [[Real Salt Lake]]. In 2010, and again, in 2011, the Galaxy won consecutive [[Supporters' Shield]], and completed the league double winning both the Shield and MLS Cup in 2011. This was the first time this had been accomplished since the Columbus Crew achieved it in 2008. In the [[MLS Cup 2011|2011 MLS Cup final]], the Galaxy defeated the [[Houston Dynamo]], 1&ndash;0 off a 72nd minute Donovan goal. The goal was scored off a Galaxy counter where Beckham fed a through ball to Donovan who slotted it past Hall. The 2012 final featured both the Galaxy and Dynamo again, making it the first since 2007 that an MLS Cup final was a rematch of the previous final. Again, the Galaxy won the final, this time [[MLS Cup 2012#Match details|coming from behind]] to defeat the Dynamo by a 3&ndash;1 scoreline. The match was Beckham's final MLS match.\n\nDuring the 2013 season, the Galaxy's chance to three-peat was thwarted by Real Salt Lake. Salt Lake defeated the Galaxy, 2&ndash;1 on aggregate, to advance to the MLS Cup final, where they eventually lost to [[Sporting Kansas City]].\n\n[[2014 MLS Season|The following season]], the Galaxy reached the MLS Cup final again, playing the [[New England Revolution]], making it a rematch of [[MLS Cup 2002]] and [[MLS Cup 2005]]. In extra-time a Robbie Keane goal propelled the Galaxy to their fifth MLS match, a victory in the 2014 MLS Cup.\n\n=== Expansion teams from Cascadia, Canada, and Atlanta ===\n[[File:Osvaldo Alonso lifting the MLS Cup at Sounders Rally.jpg|thumb|right|Osvaldo Alonso of Seattle Sounders FC lifting the MLS Cup trophy in December 2016]]\nThe [[Portland Timbers]] won the [[2015 MLS Cup]], defeating the Columbus Crew 2\u20131.

The temperature at the start of the match was {{convert|21|F|C}} ({{convert|10|F|C}}, when adjusted for wind chill), with strong winds coming off Lake Ontario.  The field was watered shortly before the match, and resultant field was described as icy by players.  The [[Seattle Sounders FC]] defeated [[Toronto FC]] 5\u20134 in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] after a scoreless match of 90 minutes regular time and 30 minutes overtime. The Sounders did not register a single shot on goal, becoming the first MLS club to do so in a match, regular season or otherwise. The Sounders, despite a very poor start and mid-season managerial change, became the second team from the [[Pacific Northwest]] to win the cup, after Portland in 2015.\n\nIn the [[2017 MLS Cup]], Toronto FC and Seattle faced off in a rematch of the previous edition, also at BMO Field. Toronto FC won the match 2\u20130, and became the first Canadian team to win the MLS Cup, and the first MLS team to complete a domestic [[treble (association football)|treble]], after winning the [[Canadian Championship]] and [[Supporters' Shield]] earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite news |date=December 9, 2017 |title=Toronto beats Seattle to win MLS Cup |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42282402 |work=[[BBC Sports]] |accessdate=December 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:AUFC MLS Cup ceremony.jpg|thumb|Pyrotechnics display during [[Atlanta United FC|Atlanta United's]] trophy ceremony following the [[MLS Cup 2018|2018 MLS Cup]] final]]\n\n[[Atlanta United FC]], in their second season as an expansion team, won the [[MLS Cup 2018|2018 edition]] of the MLS Cup by defeating the [[Portland Timbers]] 2\u20130.

Anschutz Trophy]], named for the contributions and investment to American soccer and MLS by [[Philip Anschutz]]. Typically, the award presentation is held on a podium in the center of the field, where the league commissioner will award the team with the cup.\n\nBefore the actual award presentation, the finalists are awarded with silver medals with the league's logo imprinted on them. The champions are then presented with gold medals, before the trophy is handed to the winning team's captain.\n\nIn cup history, the MLS Cup champions have been awarded with three different trophies. For the first three MLS Cup finals, the winning team was awarded with the [[Alan I. Rothenberg]] Trophy, named for Rothenberg's contributions to American soccer. The Rothenberg Trophy was a dark gold trophy that had two handles around a soccer ball, with the league's logo imprinted on the plaque. In 1999, the Rothenberg Trophy was redesigned with a soccer ball placed on a beacon. In 2008, the trophy was redesigned again to its present state and renamed the Philip F. Anschutz Trophy.\n\n== Venues ==\n[[File:LA Galaxy vs Houston Dynamo- Western Conference Finals panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[StubHub Center]] has hosted six MLS Cup finals.]]\n\nIn MLS Cup history, seven matches have been played in the Greater Los Angeles area.
