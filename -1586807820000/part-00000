Six [[U.S. Army]] soldiers who [[Great Locomotive Chase|hijacked]] a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[locomotive]] named [[The General (locomotive)|''The General'']] in 1862 were the first [[Medal of Honor recipients]];<ref name=\"MWxvii\">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xvii}}</ref> [[James J.

Many Medals of Honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with \"saving the flag\" (and country), not just for patriotic reasons, but because the [[U.S. flag]] was a primary means of battlefield communication at the time. Because no other military decoration was authorized during the Civil War, some seemingly less exceptional and notable actions were recognized by a Medal of Honor during that conflict.\n* 20th century: Early in the twentieth century, the Department of the Navy awarded many Medals of Honor for peacetime bravery. For instance, in 1901, [[John Henry Helms]] aboard {{USS|Chicago|CA-14|6}} was awarded the medal for saving the ship's cook from drowning. Seven sailors aboard {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|6}} were awarded the medal after the ship's boiler exploded on January 25, 1904.

Six [[U.S. Army]] soldiers who [[Great Locomotive Chase|hijacked]] a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[locomotive]] named [[The General (locomotive)|''The General'']] in 1862 were the first [[Medal of Honor recipients]];<ref name=\"MWxvii\">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xvii}}</ref> [[James J. Andrews]] led the raid. He was caught and hanged as a U.S. spy, but as a civilian, he was not eligible to receive the medal. Many Medals of Honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with \"saving the flag\" (and country), not just for patriotic reasons, but because the [[U.S. flag]] was a primary means of battlefield communication at the time. Because no other military decoration was authorized during the Civil War, some seemingly less exceptional and notable actions were recognized by a Medal of Honor during that conflict.\n* 20th century: Early in the twentieth century, the Department of the Navy awarded many Medals of Honor for peacetime bravery. For instance, in 1901, [[John Henry Helms]] aboard {{USS|Chicago|CA-14|6}} was awarded the medal for saving the ship's cook from drowning. Seven sailors aboard {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|6}} were awarded the medal after the ship's boiler exploded on January 25, 1904.

In an Act of Congress of July 9, 1918, the War Department version of the medal required that the recipient \"distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty\", and also required that the act of valor be performed \"in action involving actual conflict with an enemy\".<ref name=\"Act of July 9, 1918, 40 Stat. 870\">Act of July 9, 1918, 40 Stat. 870.</ref> This followed shortly after the results of the Army Medal of Honor Review Board, which struck 911 medals from the Medal of Honor list in February 1917 for lack of basic prerequisites.<ref name=\"Mears, The Medal of Honor, 53\"/> These included the members of the 27th Maine erroneously awarded the medal for reenlisting to guard the capital during the Civil War, 29 members of Abraham Lincoln's funeral detail, and six civilians, including [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] (restored along with four other scouts in 1989)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/09/us/buffalo-bill-s-medal-restored.html|title=Buffalo Bill's Medal Restored|date=9 July 1989|website=The New York Times|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> and [[Mary Edwards Walker]] (though the latter's was restored posthumously in 1977).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmohs.org/medal-history.php |title=History of the Medal of Honor |publisher=CMOHS.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref>\n* World War II: As a result of lawsuits, the Department of the Navy requested the Congress expressly authorize non-combat medals in the text of the authorizing statute, since the Navy Department had been awarding non-combat medals with questionable legal backing that had caused it much embarrassment.<ref>Mears, The Medal of Honor, 94</ref> The last non-combat Navy Medal of Honor was awarded in 1945, although the Department of the Navy attempted to award a non-combat Medal of Honor as late as the Korean War.<ref>Mears, The Medal of Honor, 97\u201398</ref> Official accounts vary, but generally, the Medal of Honor for combat was known as the \"Tiffany Cross\", after [[Tiffany & Co.|the company that designed the medal]].

Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the sailors to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days he emailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board ship. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', were controversial and he resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.\n\n==Timeline==\nIn spring 2020, the [[United States Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|2}} was on deployment in the Pacific.\n\n===March===\nOn 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam. On the last night some sailors stayed at a hotel where two people had tested positive for [[COVID-19]], a coronavirus disease identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness. Upon learning this, the crew were ordered back to the ship and the sailors who had stayed at the hotel were isolated. Over the next weeks the ship's medical team monitored the crew for any signs of infection.<ref name = losses/>\n\nOn 24 March, it was reported that three sailors aboard had tested positive for the virus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/24/coronavirus-3-sailors-test-positive-military-readiness-affected/2910165001/ |title=Three sailors from USS Theodore Roosevelt have coronavirus, raising concerns about pandemic's strain on military |work=USA Today |last=Vanden Brook |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Vanden Brook|date=24 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nWithin a few days, that number climbed to \"dozens.\" ''Theodore Roosevelt'' was ordered to [[Guam]] and docked on 27 March 2020.<ref name= disinfectUssTRcvn71 />\n\nOn 30 March, the ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Brett Crozier]], sent an [[Classified information in the United States#Unclassified|unclassified email]] to multiple Navy officials asking for help with the coronavirus epidemic on his ship.

Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to Guam. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the sailors to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors balked. After several days he emailed multiple Navy officers begging for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board ship. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order, and his later speech to the crew aboard the ''Roosevelt'', were controversial and he resigned a few days later.
