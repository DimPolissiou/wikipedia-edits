She grew up especially close to her younger brother, Bartley Crum Jr. Their father was active in politics as a confidant to [[Wendell Willkie]] during the [[1940 U.S. presidential election]], and served on the 1945 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] that advised President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] to support the creation of a [[Jewish state]]. The elder Crum gained renown for being one of the six lawyers who defended the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] during the [[Red Scare]] at the start of the [[Cold War]] in 1947. His career suffered during the fallout from the Blacklist, and the family moved from California to New York in late 1948.<ref name=Anything/>\n\nIn California, Bosworth was educated at [[Miss Burke's School]] and the [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York City)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]]. At age 13, intending to become an actress, she adopted her mother's maiden name as her surname. When the family relocated to New York, Bosworth first attended the [[Chapin School]]; later, she went to the [[Ecole Internationale de Gen\u00e8ve|Ecole International]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Bosworth studied at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], graduating in 1955 with a major in dance and writing.\n\n==Career==\n===Acting===\nWhile still a student at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth began modeling for the [[John Robert Powers Agency]]. She was hired by [[Diane Arbus|Diane]] and [[Allan Arbus]] to pose for a magazine ad for the [[Greyhound bus]] company. Allan drove everyone, including his and Diane's assistant Tad Yamashiro (who later became an exhibited photographer himself), from [[Manhattan]] to the Ardsley Acres section of [[Ardsley, New York]] for the photo shoot.\n\nShortly after her college graduation, Bosworth became a member of the [[Actors Studio]] in Manhattan, where she studied under master teacher [[Lee Strasberg]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Garfield|first=David|year=1980|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|page=277|isbn=978-0025426504}}.</ref> [[Arthur Penn]] cast her as the lead in her first professional play, a pre-Broadway tryout of [[James Leo Herlihy]]\u2019s ''Blue Denim'', about the consequences of teenage pregnancy and abortion. Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Small War on Murray Hill]]'' (directed by [[Garson Kanin]]), and [[Jean Kerr]]'s ''[[Mary Mary|Mary, Mary]]'' (where she understudied from 1961-1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played [[Elaine Stritch]]'s sister in the drama ''The Sin of Pat Muldoon'' and a motormouthed teen based on the young [[Nora Ephron]] in [[Phoebe Ephron]]'s comedy ''Howie''. During this period Bosworth also toured in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', playing Laura to [[Helen Hayes]]'s Amanda, and ''Remains to be Seen'' opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[Young Doctor Malone|Young Dr. Malone]]'', and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. Bosworth can also be seen in the film ''[[Four Boys and a Gun]]'' as [[James Franciscus]]'s wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of [[Bert Stern]]\u2019s 1960 cult documentary ''[[Jazz on a Summer's Day]]'', about the 1958 [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nAs an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of [[Audrey Hepburn|Audrey Hepburn's]] character Sister Luke, in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959).  Directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards. In 1958, upon learning she was cast in ''The Nun's Story'', she also learned she was pregnant. She subsequently received an abortion at an underground abortionist in Manhattan''.'' Shortly after, she boarded a plane to [[Rome]] to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun. The nun discovered she wasn't feeling well due to the abortion and rushed her to the hospital for care. The film was delayed for her recovery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/28/511863277/renowned-biographer-patricia-bosworth-writes-a-chapter-from-her-own-life|title=Renowned Biographer Patricia Bosworth Writes A Chapter From Her Own Life|author=NPR Staff|work=[[NPR]]|publisher=National Public Radio, Inc.|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|language=en|date=January 28, 2017|access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Journalist===\nIn the mid-1960s, Bosworth left acting to become a journalist. She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] and the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Later in the decade, she became editor of ''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside [[Mario Puzo]], who was then beginning drafts of his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of ''[[McCall's]]''; she served as managing editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' from 1972 to 1974. ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' founder [[Bob Guccione]] hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'' from 1974 to 1976.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The X-Rated Emperor|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/02/guccione200502|issn=0733-8899|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|location=United States|date=November 10, 2009|| publication-date=February 2005|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for ''The New York Times'', wrote freelance art pieces for the ''Times'', ''[[Time Life]]'', and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nBosworth was an editor at ''[[Mirabella]]'' from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen's Club of New York.\n\n===Author===\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor's introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth's biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0394504049}}</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=Anything/> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to [[pneumonia]] and complications from  [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html|title=Patricia Bosworth, Actress-Turned-Author, Dies at 86|first=Elsa|last=Dixler|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.

Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth's biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0394504049}}</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=Anything/> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would continue to inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to [[pneumonia]] and complications from  [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html|title=Patricia Bosworth, Actress-Turned-Author, Dies at 86|first=Elsa|last=Dixler|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.

It stars [[Sanjeev Kumar (actor)|Sanjeev Kumar]] and [[Jaya Bhaduri]].\n\nThe movie depicts a deaf and mute couple and their conflicts, pain and struggle to carve out a niche for themselves in a desensitized society. The film was remade in Tamil in 1977 as ''[[Uyarndhavargal]]'' starring [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[Sujatha (actress)|Sujatha]]. It was inspired by the 1961 Japanese film ''Happiness of Us Alone''.<ref>https://scroll.in/reel/860661/gulzars-koshish-was-inspired-by-a-japanese-film-but-it-is-no-unthinking-remake</ref><ref>http://www.thehindu.com/lf/2004/09/11/stories/2004091100820200.htm</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie is a lesson on how to live life, examining the lives of Hari (Sanjeev Kumar) and Aarthi (Jaya Bhaduri), who are deaf and mute. They meet, fall in love, marry and have a child. They raise him well and he marries a girl similar to his parents. All they have to help them is their hope, confidence and some kindness in the society, along with Uncle Narayan, who is blind. Tragedy strikes their lives as well when they lose their first child thanks to Kanu's greed. But they never give up hope on life and not in one instance during the entire movie do they think about ending it.

Burnaby's adventurous spirit, pioneering achievements, and swashbuckling courage earned an affection in the minds of Victorian [[Imperialism|imperial idealists]]. As well as travelling across Europe and Central Asia, he mastered ballooning, spoke a number of foreign languages fluently, stood for parliament twice, published several books, and was admired and feted by the women of London high society.  His popularity was legendary, appearing in a number of stories and tales of empire.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Frederick Gustavus Burnaby, Vanity Fair, 1876-12-02.jpg|thumb|upright|''Vanity Fair'' caricature, 2 December 1876]]\n\nFrederick Burnaby was born in Bedford,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} the son of the Rev. Gustavus Andrew Burnaby of [[Somerby, Leicestershire|Somerby]] Hall, Leicestershire, and canon of [[Middleham]] in Yorkshire (d. 15 July 1872), by Harriet, sister of Henry Villebois of [[Marham|Marham House]], Norfolk (d. 1883).  His sister Mary married [[John Manners-Sutton (1822\u20131898)|John Manners-Sutton]]. He was a first cousin of [[Edwyn Burnaby (British politician)|Edwyn Burnaby]] and of [[Louisa Cavendish-Bentinck]]. Fred was educated at [[Bedford School]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Oswestry School]], where he was a contemporary with [[William Archibald Spooner]], and in [[Germany]]. Legend has it he could carry two boys under both arms up the stairs of school house. Burnaby was a huge man for his times: 6&nbsp;ft 4in tall and 20 stone when fully grown.  His outsize personality and strength became the literary legend of imperial might.  Lionized by the press for his outlandish expeditious adventures across Central Asia, Burnaby at 6&nbsp;ft 4 ins tall with broad shoulders was a giant amongst men, symbolic of a Victorian celebrity, feted in London society.<ref>White-Spunner, p.400-408</ref>\n\nHe entered the [[Royal Horse Guards]] in 1859.  Finding no chance for active service, his spirit of adventure sought outlets in balloon ascents and in travels through Spain and Russia with his firm friend, George Radford.  In the summer of 1874 he accompanied the [[Third Carlist War|Carlist]] forces in Spain as correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'', but before the end of the war he was transferred to Africa to report on [[Charles George Gordon|Gordon's]] expedition to the [[Sudan]].  This took Burnaby as far as [[Khartoum]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n== Military adventures ==\nReturning to England in March 1875, he formulated his plans for a journey on horseback to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] through Russian Asia, which had just been closed to travellers.  War had broken out between the Russian army and the [[Turkmens|Turcoman]] tribesmen of the desert.  He planned to visit St Petersburg to meet [[Dmitry Milyutin|Count Milyutin]], Minister of War to the Tsar.  Travelling at his own expense carrying an 85&nbsp;lb pack, he departed [[London Victoria station]] on 30 November 1875.  The Russians announced they would protect the soldier along the route, but to all intents and purposes this proved impossible.  The accomplishment of this task, in the winter of 1875\u20131876, with the aim of reciprocity for India and the Tsarist State, was described in his book ''A Ride to Khiva'', and brought him immediate fame.  The city of [[Merv]] was inaccessible, but presented a potential military flashpoint.  The Russians knew that British Intelligence gathered information along the frontier.  Similar expeditions had taken place under Captain [[George Thomas Napier|George Napier]] (1874) and Colonel [[Charles MacGregor]] (1875).  By Christmas, Burnaby had arrived at [[Orenburg]].  In receipt of orders prohibiting progress into Persia from Russian-held territory, he was warned not to advance.  A fluent Russian speaker, he was not coerced; arriving at a Russian garrison, the officers entertaining the former [[Khanate of Kokand|Khan of Kokand]].\n\nHiring a servant and horses his party trudged through the snow to [[Kazala]], intending a crossing into Afghanistan from Merv. Extreme winter blizzards brought frostbite, treated with \"naphtha\", a Cossack emetic.  Close to death, Burnaby took three weeks to recover.  Having received conflicted accounts of the dubious privilege of Russian hospitality it was a welcome release, he later told his book, to be cheered with vodka.  It was another 400 miles south to Khiva, when he was requested to divert to [[Petro Alexandrovsk]], a Russian fortress garrison.  Lurid tales of wild tribesmen awaiting his desert travails ready to \"gouge out his eyes\" were intended to discourage.  He ignored the escort, believing the tribes more friendly than the Russians.  Intending to go via [[Bokhara]] and [[Merv]], he deviated, cutting two days off the journey.  Leaving [[Kazala]] on 12 January 1876 with a servant, guide, three camels and a ''[[kibitka]]'',{{efn|a Turcoman tent.}} Burnaby bribed the servant with 100 Roubles a day to avoid the fortress where he would be bound to be delayed.  A local mullah wrote an introduction note to the Khan, and clad in furs they traversed the freezing desert.  On the banks of River, 60 miles from the capital, he was met by the Khan's nobleman, who guided the escort into the city.  Burnaby's book outlined in some detail the events of the following days, the successful outcome of the meetings, and the decision he took to evade the Russian army.  The Khanate was already at war, his possessions seized; the Russians intended a march from Tashkent to seize [[Kashgar]], Merv and Herat.  Protestations of neutrality were a sham.  Burnaby gained respect from the population, who bowed in homage at a soldier ''en passant''.  But on return to his quarters he received a note of orders from Horse Guards to return via Russia.  Frustrated Burnaby learnt of the overwhelming numerical superiority the Tsarists presented.  To his great surprise he was received as a brother officer at Petro Alexandrovsk.  Colonel Ivanov was smug and proud declared the fate of Merv \"must be decided by the sword.\" Released by the Khan's Treasurer he travelled for nine days with Cossacks across the snowy plains of Kazala.  Hard-bitten and hungry he sat on a small pony for 900 miles.  ''En route'' he heard of what later was described in parliament as the [[Bulgarian Horrors]], and a forthcoming campaign against [[Yakub Beg]] in Kashgaria.\n\n[[File:Frederick Gustavus Burnaby by James Jacques Tissot.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Burnaby in his uniform as a captain in the [[Royal Horse Guards]] by [[James Tissot]] (1870)]]\n\nOn arrival back in England, March 1876, he was received by Commander-in-Chief, [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]], whose praise marvelled at Burnaby's feats of derring-do and impressive physique.  Burnaby's fame grew celebrated in London society, in newspaper and magazines.  His guest appearances flattered to deceive, when he learnt that he had travelled with the ringleaders of the [[Cossack Revolt]].  The rising of the Eastern Question in parliament was sparked in a village in Hercegovina and spread to Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria.  Outraged by the [[pogrom]]s the Prime Minister ordered immediate diplomatic efforts, while Gladstone demanded an aggressive clear out of the Sultanate from Europe.  It was in the crucible of this crisis that Burnaby planned a second expedition.  At Constantinople he had planned to meet Count Ignatiev, the Russian ambassador, whom he missed on his journey across Turkey on horseback, through [[Asia Minor]], from [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]] to [[Erzerum]], with the object of observing the Russian frontier, an account of which he afterwards published.  He was warned the Russian garrison had issued an arrest warrant; turning back at the frontier he took ship on the Black Sea via the Bosphorus and the Mediterranean.  In April 1877 Russia declared war on Turkey.<ref>Fred Burnaby, On Horseback Through Asia Minor, (London 1877)</ref> The inexorable conclusion was drawn in Calcutta and London that Russia would not avoid, but wanted war; planning more attacks still.  Eager for Russian rule, Colonel [[N L Grodekov]] had built a road from Tashkent to Herat via Samarkand, anticipating a war of conquest.<ref>Hopkirk, The Great Game, p.379, 388</ref> Burnaby's warnings that the bellicose Russians posed a serious threat to India were confirmed later by Lord Curzon, and an expedition much later under the arabist Colonel [[Francis Younghusband]], witnessed by the genesis of a Cossack invasion.<ref>Hopkirk, The Great Game, p.455, 524</ref>\n\n''See main article: [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877]]''\n\nBurnaby (who soon afterwards became [[lieutenant-colonel]]) acted as travelling agent to the Stafford House [[Red Cross]] Committee, but had to return to England before the campaign was over.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1879 he married [[Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed]], who had inherited her father's lands at [[Greystones]], Ireland.  The previously-named Hawkins-Whitshed estate at Greystones is known as The Burnaby to this day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countywicklowheritage.org/page_id__27.aspx?path=0p3p|title=Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed of Killincarrick|last=Raughter|first=Rosemary |date= 6 October 2016|website=Our Wicklow Heritage |publisher=Wicklow Heritage Forum|access-date= 11 July 2017|quote=}}</ref> At this point began his active interest in politics, and in [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880]] he unsuccessfully contested [[Birmingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham]] in the [[Tory]]-Democrat interest, which was followed by a second attempt in 1885.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn 23 March 1882 he crossed the English Channel in a [[gas balloon]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Colonel Burnaby |work=The Cornishman |issue=194 (184) |date=30 March 1882 |page=7}}</ref> Having been disappointed in his hope of seeing active service in the [[Egyptian Campaign of 1882]], he participated in the [[Suakin]] campaign of 1884 without official leave, and was wounded at [[Battles of El Teb|El Teb]] when acting as an intelligence officer for his friend General [[Valentine Aker Pasha Baker|Valentine Baker]].\n\n=== Death ===\nThis did not deter him from a similar course when a fresh expedition started up the [[Nile]]. He was given a post by [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]], involved first in the skirmish at El Teb, until he met his death in the hand-to-hand fighting of the [[Battle of Abu Klea]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} As a gap in the lines opened up the Colonel rushed out to rescue a colleague and was wounded outside the square. Corporal Mackintosh went to his rescue driving his bayonet into the assailant. Lieutenant-Colonel [[Lord Binning]] rushed out to give him some water, twice. On the last occasion he came across a private crying, holding the dying man's head. He had been struck again by a Mahdist spear through the neck and throat. The young soldier was tearful because Burnaby was revered as one of the great Victorian heroes. A courageous man of charm and supreme self-sacrifice, who was admired and respected in equal measure. Lord Binning recalled \"that in our little force his death caused a feeling akin to consternation.  In my own detachment many of the men sat down and cried\".<ref>Letter of 27 April 1885, to c/o Major Lord Arthur Somerset, who commanded The Blues, HCM, AB 2659</ref>  Private Steele who went to help him won the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCM]].<ref>White-Spunner, p.405</ref>\n\n== Cultural references ==\n[[Henry Newbolt]]'s poem \"[[Vita\u00ef Lampada]]\" is often quoted as referring to Burnaby's death at Abu Klea; \"The [[Gatling gun|Gatling]]'s jammed and the Colonel's dead...\", (although it was a [[Gardner gun|Gardner machine gun]] which jammed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishbattles.com/egypt-1882/abu-klea.htm |title=The Battle of Abu Klea of the Sudan Campaign 1885 |publisher=Britishbattles.com |date= |accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> It was, perhaps, because of an impromptu order by Burnaby (who, as a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]], had no official capacity in the battle) that the Dervishes managed to get inside the square. Yet the song \"Colonel Burnaby\" was written in his honour and his portrait hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, London.<ref>''The life of Colonel Fred Burnaby'' by Charles P. Corning</ref> There are two contradictory accounts:\n\n# The report in ''[[The Times]]'', says that Burnaby fell while re-forming a broken British square, this being one of only two recorded cases of a British square breaking in the 19th century.<ref>White-Spunner, p.400-408</ref>\n# [[Battle of Abu Klea|Another account]] says that the square did not break, but men were ordered to pull aside temporarily to let the Gardner gun and then the Heavy Camel Corps get out and attack the enemy. Some Dervishes got inside before the gap closed, but the back ranks of the square faced-about and made an end of the intruders.\n\nBurnaby's ''Ride to Khiva'' appears in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1898 short story, \"[[Youth (Conrad short story)|Youth]],\" when the young Marlow recounts how he \"read for the first time ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' and Burnaby's ''Ride to Khiva'',\" preferring \"the soldier to the philosopher at the time.\"<ref>Conrad, Joseph.

Burnaby's adventurous spirit, pioneering achievements, and swashbuckling courage earned an affection in the minds of Victorian imperial idealists.  As well as travelling across Europe and Central Asia, he mastered ballooning, spoke a number of foreign languages fluently, stood for parliament twice, published several books, and was admired and feted by the women of London high society.  His popularity was legendary, appearing in a number of stories and tales of empire.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Frederick Gustavus Burnaby, Vanity Fair, 1876-12-02.jpg|thumb|upright|''Vanity Fair'' caricature, 2 December 1876]]\n\nFrederick Burnaby was born in Bedford,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} the son of the Rev. Gustavus Andrew Burnaby of [[Somerby, Leicestershire|Somerby]] Hall, Leicestershire, and canon of [[Middleham]] in Yorkshire (d. 15 July 1872), by Harriet, sister of Henry Villebois of [[Marham|Marham House]], Norfolk (d. 1883).  His sister Mary married [[John Manners-Sutton (1822\u20131898)|John Manners-Sutton]]. He was a first cousin of [[Edwyn Burnaby (British politician)|Edwyn Burnaby]] and of [[Louisa Cavendish-Bentinck]]. Fred was educated at [[Bedford School]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Oswestry School]], where he was a contemporary with [[William Archibald Spooner]], and in [[Germany]]. Legend has it he could carry two boys under both arms up the stairs of school house. Burnaby was a huge man for his times: 6&nbsp;ft 4in tall and 20 stone when fully grown.  His outsize personality and strength became the literary legend of imperial might.  Lionized by the press for his outlandish expeditious adventures across Central Asia, Burnaby at 6&nbsp;ft 4 ins tall with broad shoulders was a giant amongst men, symbolic of a Victorian celebrity, feted in London society.<ref>White-Spunner, p.400-408</ref>\n\nHe entered the [[Royal Horse Guards]] in 1859.  Finding no chance for active service, his spirit of adventure sought outlets in balloon ascents and in travels through Spain and Russia with his firm friend, George Radford.  In the summer of 1874 he accompanied the [[Third Carlist War|Carlist]] forces in Spain as correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'', but before the end of the war he was transferred to Africa to report on [[Charles George Gordon|Gordon's]] expedition to the [[Sudan]].  This took Burnaby as far as [[Khartoum]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n== Military adventures ==\nReturning to England in March 1875, he formulated his plans for a journey on horseback to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] through Russian Asia, which had just been closed to travellers.  War had broken out between the Russian army and the [[Turkmens|Turcoman]] tribesmen of the desert.  He planned to visit St Petersburg to meet [[Dmitry Milyutin|Count Milyutin]], Minister of War to the Tsar.  Travelling at his own expense carrying an 85&nbsp;lb pack, he departed [[London Victoria station]] on 30 November 1875.  The Russians announced they would protect the soldier along the route, but to all intents and purposes this proved impossible.  The accomplishment of this task, in the winter of 1875\u20131876, with the aim of reciprocity for India and the Tsarist State, was described in his book ''A Ride to Khiva'', and brought him immediate fame.  The city of [[Merv]] was inaccessible, but presented a potential military flashpoint.  The Russians knew that British Intelligence gathered information along the frontier.  Similar expeditions had taken place under Captain [[George Thomas Napier|George Napier]] (1874) and Colonel [[Charles MacGregor]] (1875).  By Christmas, Burnaby had arrived at [[Orenburg]].  In receipt of orders prohibiting progress into Persia from Russian-held territory, he was warned not to advance.  A fluent Russian speaker, he was not coerced; arriving at a Russian garrison, the officers entertaining the former [[Khanate of Kokand|Khan of Kokand]].\n\nHiring a servant and horses his party trudged through the snow to [[Kazala]], intending a crossing into Afghanistan from Merv. Extreme winter blizzards brought frostbite, treated with \"naphtha\", a Cossack emetic.  Close to death, Burnaby took three weeks to recover.  Having received conflicted accounts of the dubious privilege of Russian hospitality it was a welcome release, he later told his book, to be cheered with vodka.  It was another 400 miles south to Khiva, when he was requested to divert to [[Petro Alexandrovsk]], a Russian fortress garrison.  Lurid tales of wild tribesmen awaiting his desert travails ready to \"gouge out his eyes\" were intended to discourage.  He ignored the escort, believing the tribes more friendly than the Russians.  Intending to go via [[Bokhara]] and [[Merv]], he deviated, cutting two days off the journey.  Leaving [[Kazala]] on 12 January 1876 with a servant, guide, three camels and a ''[[kibitka]]'',{{efn|a Turcoman tent.}} Burnaby bribed the servant with 100 Roubles a day to avoid the fortress where he would be bound to be delayed.  A local mullah wrote an introduction note to the Khan, and clad in furs they traversed the freezing desert.  On the banks of River, 60 miles from the capital, he was met by the Khan's nobleman, who guided the escort into the city.  Burnaby's book outlined in some detail the events of the following days, the successful outcome of the meetings, and the decision he took to evade the Russian army.  The Khanate was already at war, his possessions seized; the Russians intended a march from Tashkent to seize [[Kashgar]], Merv and Herat.  Protestations of neutrality were a sham.  Burnaby gained respect from the population, who bowed in homage at a soldier ''en passant''.  But on return to his quarters he received a note of orders from Horse Guards to return via Russia.  Frustrated Burnaby learnt of the overwhelming numerical superiority the Tsarists presented.  To his great surprise he was received as a brother officer at Petro Alexandrovsk.  Colonel Ivanov was smug and proud declared the fate of Merv \"must be decided by the sword.\" Released by the Khan's Treasurer he travelled for nine days with Cossacks across the snowy plains of Kazala.  Hard-bitten and hungry he sat on a small pony for 900 miles.  ''En route'' he heard of what later was described in parliament as the [[Bulgarian Horrors]], and a forthcoming campaign against [[Yakub Beg]] in Kashgaria.\n\n[[File:Frederick Gustavus Burnaby by James Jacques Tissot.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Burnaby in his uniform as a captain in the [[Royal Horse Guards]] by [[James Tissot]] (1870)]]\n\nOn arrival back in England, March 1876, he was received by Commander-in-Chief, [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]], whose praise marvelled at Burnaby's feats of derring-do and impressive physique.  Burnaby's fame grew celebrated in London society, in newspaper and magazines.  His guest appearances flattered to deceive, when he learnt that he had travelled with the ringleaders of the [[Cossack Revolt]].  The rising of the Eastern Question in parliament was sparked in a village in Hercegovina and spread to Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria.  Outraged by the [[pogrom]]s the Prime Minister ordered immediate diplomatic efforts, while Gladstone demanded an aggressive clear out of the Sultanate from Europe.  It was in the crucible of this crisis that Burnaby planned a second expedition.  At Constantinople he had planned to meet Count Ignatiev, the Russian ambassador, whom he missed on his journey across Turkey on horseback, through [[Asia Minor]], from [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]] to [[Erzerum]], with the object of observing the Russian frontier, an account of which he afterwards published.  He was warned the Russian garrison had issued an arrest warrant; turning back at the frontier he took ship on the Black Sea via the Bosphorus and the Mediterranean.  In April 1877 Russia declared war on Turkey.<ref>Fred Burnaby, On Horseback Through Asia Minor, (London 1877)</ref> The inexorable conclusion was drawn in Calcutta and London that Russia would not avoid, but wanted war; planning more attacks still.  Eager for Russian rule, Colonel [[N L Grodekov]] had built a road from Tashkent to Herat via Samarkand, anticipating a war of conquest.<ref>Hopkirk, The Great Game, p.379, 388</ref> Burnaby's warnings that the bellicose Russians posed a serious threat to India were confirmed later by Lord Curzon, and an expedition much later under the arabist Colonel [[Francis Younghusband]], witnessed by the genesis of a Cossack invasion.<ref>Hopkirk, The Great Game, p.455, 524</ref>\n\n''See main article: [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877]]''\n\nBurnaby (who soon afterwards became [[lieutenant-colonel]]) acted as travelling agent to the Stafford House [[Red Cross]] Committee, but had to return to England before the campaign was over.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 1879 he married [[Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed]], who had inherited her father's lands at [[Greystones]], Ireland.  The previously-named Hawkins-Whitshed estate at Greystones is known as The Burnaby to this day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countywicklowheritage.org/page_id__27.aspx?path=0p3p|title=Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed of Killincarrick|last=Raughter|first=Rosemary |date= 6 October 2016|website=Our Wicklow Heritage |publisher=Wicklow Heritage Forum|access-date= 11 July 2017|quote=}}</ref> At this point began his active interest in politics, and in [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880]] he unsuccessfully contested [[Birmingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham]] in the [[Tory]]-Democrat interest, which was followed by a second attempt in 1885.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn 23 March 1882 he crossed the English Channel in a [[gas balloon]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Colonel Burnaby |work=The Cornishman |issue=194 (184) |date=30 March 1882 |page=7}}</ref> Having been disappointed in his hope of seeing active service in the [[Egyptian Campaign of 1882]], he participated in the [[Suakin]] campaign of 1884 without official leave, and was wounded at [[Battles of El Teb|El Teb]] when acting as an intelligence officer for his friend General [[Valentine Aker Pasha Baker|Valentine Baker]].\n\n=== Death ===\nThis did not deter him from a similar course when a fresh expedition started up the [[Nile]]. He was given a post by [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]], involved first in the skirmish at El Teb, until he met his death in the hand-to-hand fighting of the [[Battle of Abu Klea]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} As a gap in the lines opened up the Colonel rushed out to rescue a colleague and was wounded outside the square. Corporal Mackintosh went to his rescue driving his bayonet into the assailant. Lieutenant-Colonel [[Lord Binning]] rushed out to give him some water, twice. On the last occasion he came across a private crying, holding the dying man's head. He had been struck again by a Mahdist spear through the neck and throat. The young soldier was tearful because Burnaby was revered as one of the great Victorian heroes. A courageous man of charm and supreme self-sacrifice, who was admired and respected in equal measure. Lord Binning recalled \"that in our little force his death caused a feeling akin to consternation.  In my own detachment many of the men sat down and cried\".<ref>Letter of 27 April 1885, to c/o Major Lord Arthur Somerset, who commanded The Blues, HCM, AB 2659</ref>  Private Steele who went to help him won the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCM]].<ref>White-Spunner, p.405</ref>\n\n== Cultural references ==\n[[Henry Newbolt]]'s poem \"[[Vita\u00ef Lampada]]\" is often quoted as referring to Burnaby's death at Abu Klea; \"The [[Gatling gun|Gatling]]'s jammed and the Colonel's dead...\", (although it was a [[Gardner gun|Gardner machine gun]] which jammed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishbattles.com/egypt-1882/abu-klea.htm |title=The Battle of Abu Klea of the Sudan Campaign 1885 |publisher=Britishbattles.com |date= |accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> It was, perhaps, because of an impromptu order by Burnaby (who, as a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]], had no official capacity in the battle) that the Dervishes managed to get inside the square. Yet the song \"Colonel Burnaby\" was written in his honour and his portrait hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, London.<ref>''The life of Colonel Fred Burnaby'' by Charles P. Corning</ref> There are two contradictory accounts:\n\n# The report in ''[[The Times]]'', says that Burnaby fell while re-forming a broken British square, this being one of only two recorded cases of a British square breaking in the 19th century.<ref>White-Spunner, p.400-408</ref>\n# [[Battle of Abu Klea|Another account]] says that the square did not break, but men were ordered to pull aside temporarily to let the Gardner gun and then the Heavy Camel Corps get out and attack the enemy. Some Dervishes got inside before the gap closed, but the back ranks of the square faced-about and made an end of the intruders.\n\nBurnaby's ''Ride to Khiva'' appears in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1898 short story, \"[[Youth (Conrad short story)|Youth]],\" when the young Marlow recounts how he \"read for the first time ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' and Burnaby's ''Ride to Khiva'',\" preferring \"the soldier to the philosopher at the time.\"<ref>Conrad, Joseph. ''Great Short Works of Joseph Conrad''. New York: Harper & Row, 1967.

{"title_page": "List of British rugby league champions", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}\nThe '''British men's rugby league champions''' are the winners of the highest league in British rugby league, which since [[Super League I|1996]] is the [[Super League]]. Although the league is based in Britain, teams from Europe and North Anerica can win the league due to teams from France and Canada competing in the [[British rugby league system]].\n\nFollowing the schism in 1895 that saw 22 Northern rugby clubs split from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]], the 22 clubs were organised into [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|one league]]. At the end of the [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396 season]], [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were the first club to be crowned champions, finishing one point ahead of [[Halifax RFC|Halifax]].<ref>{{cite news\n | last =Baker\n | first =Andrew\n | title =100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era\n | newspaper = [[The Independent]]\n | date =1995-08-20\n | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/100-years-of-rugby-league-from-the-great-divide-to-the-super-era-1597130.html\n | accessdate =2009-09-25 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Unions]] first season, more clubs defected from the [[Rugby Football Union]] to join the new league. After concerns around travel and costs were expressed, the decision was made that the competition should be split into two separate county championships: Lancashire and Yorkshire Leagues. County leagues were in place for the next five seasons until 1901\u201302 were the top seven sides from each league resigned to merge to form a new league. The only other times that there was no [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|major championship]] was when there were outbrakes of war.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 90s, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] became the only full time professional club and dominated in every competition. A new Super League began to be mooted during the [[Super League war]] in Australia as a way for [[Rupert Murdoch]] to gain a upper hand in broadcasting supremacy with the [[Australian Rugby League]]. British clubs were approached to form a Super League with a cash insentive. Part of the deal was switching the sport to summer and the merger of some clubs, the latter not taking place due to huge protest from fans. All four Super League champions; [[St Helens RFC|St Helens]], [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] have all previously won the old [[Rugby Football League Championship First Devision|First Division]].\n\nOnly three clubs to have been crowned champions are not in existence today. During the reclassification of the Championship in 1901, the league was split into two divisions. [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were placed in the [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]], finishing 10th out of 18 teams. At the end of the season a series of meetings was held about establishing a [[Football League]] club in the city. During a annual meeting the committee voted to switch to association football, becoming [[Bradford City]]. A similar situation occurred at [[Bradford FC]] in 1907 when a narrow majority of members voted to withdraw from the Northern Union in favour of association football, forming [[Bradford Park Avenue]]. [[Broughton Rangers]] struggled post war and folded in 1955 after a failed name change to Belle Vue Rangers in 1946.\n\n[[Hunslet FC]] were the fourth former champions to fold after financial issues[http://www.wakefieldexpress.co.uk/news/local-news/rugby-league-star-was-most-expensive-player-1-6493832], player strikes and a stadium fire that led to the club selling the land to developers before being eventually wound up. Unlike the other three clubs who no longer exist, a pheonix club, [[Hunslet RLFC|New Hunslet]] were formed in 1973 and still exist now.<ref name=hawkhist>{{cite web|url=http://www.hunslethawks.co.uk/info/history |title=History |publisher=Hunslet RFLC |accessdate=27 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==List==\n===RFL Championship First Division (1895\u20131996)===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%\"|Year\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Champions<br />(number of titles)\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Runners-up\n! style=\"width:27%\"|Leading tryscorer<br>(club)\n! style=\"width:1%\"|Trys\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396]]\n| {{leagueicon|Brisbane|16}} '''[[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Jack Hurst]] ({{leagueicon|oldham|16}} [[Oldham RLFC|Oldham]])\n|28\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| colspan=5 style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1896]]\u2013[[1900\u201301 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901]] [[Rugby league county leagues|County Leagues]]\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1901\u201302 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901\u201302]]\n|  {{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} '''[[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Robert Wilson (rugby league)|Rob Wilson]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|38\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1902\u201303 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1902\u201303]]\n| {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} '''[[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} Evans ({{leagueicon|Leeds|16}} [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]])\n|27\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1903\u201304 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1903\u201304]]\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} '''[[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|SCO}} [[Andrew Hogg (rugby league)|Andrew Hogg]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|34\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1904\u201305 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1904\u201305]]\n| {{leagueicon|Oldham|16}} '''[[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} [[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]\n| [[James Dechan]] ([[Bradford FC]])\n|31\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1905\u201306 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1905\u201306]]\n| {{leagueicon|Leigh|16}} '''[[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|hunslet|16}} [[Hunslet F.C.

Although the league is based in Britain, teams from Europe and North Anerica can win the league due to teams from France and Canada competing in the [[British rugby league system]].\n\nFollowing the schism in 1895 that saw 22 Northern rugby clubs split from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]], the 22 clubs were organised into [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|one league]]. At the end of the [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396 season]], [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were the first club to be crowned champions, finishing one point ahead of [[Halifax RFC|Halifax]].<ref>{{cite news\n | last =Baker\n | first =Andrew \n | title =100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era \n | newspaper = [[The Independent]]\n | date =1995-08-20 \n | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/100-years-of-rugby-league-from-the-great-divide-to-the-super-era-1597130.html\n | accessdate =2009-09-25 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Unions]] first season, more clubs defected from the [[Rugby Football Union]] to join the new league. After concerns around travel and costs were expressed, the decision was made that the competition should be split into two separate county championships: Lancashire and Yorkshire Leagues. County leagues were in place for the next five seasons until 1901\u201302 were the top seven sides from each league resigned to merge to form a new league. The only other times that there was no [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|major championship]] was when there were outbrakes of war.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 90s, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] became the only full time professional club and dominated in every competition. A new Super League began to be mooted during the [[Super League war]] in Australia as a way for [[Rupert Murdoch]] to gain a upper hand in broadcasting supremacy with the [[Australian Rugby League]]. British clubs were approached to form a Super League with a cash insentive. Part of the deal was switching the sport to summer and the merger of some clubs, the latter not taking place due to huge protest from fans. All four Super League champions; [[St Helens RFC|St Helens]], [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] have all previously won the old [[Rugby Football League Championship First Devision|First Division]].\n\nOnly three clubs to have been crowned champions are not in existence today. During the reclassification of the Championship in 1901, the league was split into two divisions. [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were placed in the [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]], finishing 10th out of 18 teams. At the end of the season a series of meetings was held about establishing a [[Football League]] club in the city. During a annual meeting the committee voted to switch to association football, becoming [[Bradford City]]. A similar situation occurred at [[Bradford FC]] in 1907 when a narrow majority of members voted to withdraw from the Northern Union in favour of association football, forming [[Bradford Park Avenue]]. [[Broughton Rangers]] struggled post war and folded in 1955 after a failed name change to Belle Vue Rangers in 1946. \n\n[[Hunslet FC]] were the fourth former champions to fold after financial issues[http://www.wakefieldexpress.co.uk/news/local-news/rugby-league-star-was-most-expensive-player-1-6493832], player strikes and a stadium fire that led to the club selling the land to developers before being eventually wound up. Unlike the other three clubs who no longer exist, a pheonix club, [[Hunslet RLFC|New Hunslet]] were formed in 1973 and still exist now.<ref name=hawkhist>{{cite web|url=http://www.hunslethawks.co.uk/info/history |title=History |publisher=Hunslet RFLC |accessdate=27 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==List==\n===RFL Championship First Division (1895\u20131996)===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%\"|Year\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Champions<br />(number of titles)\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Runners-up\n! style=\"width:27%\"|Leading tryscorer<br>(club)\n! style=\"width:1%\"|Trys\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396]]\n| {{leagueicon|Brisbane|16}} '''[[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Jack Hurst]] ({{leagueicon|oldham|16}} [[Oldham RLFC|Oldham]])\n|28\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| colspan=5 style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1896]]\u2013[[1900\u201301 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901]] [[Rugby league county leagues|County Leagues]]\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1901\u201302 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901\u201302]]\n|  {{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} '''[[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Robert Wilson (rugby league)|Rob Wilson]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|38\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1902\u201303 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1902\u201303]]\n| {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} '''[[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} Evans ({{leagueicon|Leeds|16}} [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]])\n|27\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1903\u201304 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1903\u201304]]\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} '''[[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|SCO}} [[Andrew Hogg (rugby league)|Andrew Hogg]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|34\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1904\u201305 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1904\u201305]]\n| {{leagueicon|Oldham|16}} '''[[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} [[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]\n| [[James Dechan]] ([[Bradford FC]])\n|31\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1905\u201306 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1905\u201306]]\n| {{leagueicon|Leigh|16}} '''[[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|hunslet|16}} [[Hunslet F.C.
