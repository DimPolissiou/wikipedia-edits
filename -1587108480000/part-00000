The game was released in 2002 in [[Japan]] by [[Takara]], in [[North America]] by [[Conspiracy Entertainment]], and in 2003 in [[Europe]] and other [[PAL region|PAL regions]] by [[System 3 (company)|System 3]] under their Play It label.\n\nThe game combines elements of [[Racing video game|racing]] and [[Adventure game|adventure]] games, and is widely considered to be the best of the [[Choro Q video games|Choro Q series]] due to its large seamless world which the player can freely explore. The game takes place in a world of anthropomorphic cars that interact like humans. As part of the PS2 Classics release, ''Road Trip Adventure'' was released on the [[PlayStation Store]] for the [[PlayStation 3|PS3]] in Europe on February 15, 2012; however, it was not released on the American PSN.\n\n==Story==\n[[Image:Road Trip Adventure.jpg|thumb|left|A typical snapshot of Adventure Mode gameplay.]]\nAfter starting a new game in Adventure Mode, a cutscene begins inside the office of President Forest, who is burnt out from being president. He has decided to hand over the presidency to the winner of the World Grand Prix, a seven race series for only the most elite and talented racers. The president's secretary leaves, ready to broadcast this news to the world.\n\nNext, the player appears inside the Q\u2019s Factory in Peach Town, a small town named after the surrounding peach farms. Each town's Q's Factory is where the player changes car parts. The worker in the Q's Factory informs the player that he or she may become president, if lucky enough to win the World Grand Prix.\n\nAfter these starting scenes, gameplay is almost entirely open-ended, loosely centered around the goal of winning the World Grand Prix and becoming president. To qualify for the World Grand Prix, the player must have two teammates and a Class Super A License, earned by finishing top 6 in every race of each license tier: C, B, and A, respectively. To acquire teammates, one can simply talk to other cars; if they can be recruited, they may ask the player to add them as a teammate, provided the player has previously won a race. Each race rewards the performance of the player's teammates, as well as the player\u2019s. As a result, it is imperative for a player to equip his or her teammates with adequate parts for each race.\n\nTo measure a player's achievement, there are 100 \"stamps\" which he or she can earn, one of which is becoming president. Stamps involve activities ranging from mini-games to doing small favors for other cars, and upon earning all 100, the player is eligible for a special surprise. As an example, one of the 100 stamps requires completing the player's picture album. To take a picture, the player can visit any of the 100 Quick-Pic Shops, denoted by black marks on the mini-map; after taking a picture, the owner (always a pink [[Toyota Vitz]]) will inform the player of the next shop's location. Another important stamp entails collecting all 100 [[Choro Q]] coins hidden in the cities around the world (with the exception of Cloud Hill). One of the residents of My City trades various parts and objects for Choro Q coins, and many of these parts can give the player a distinct advantage in other tasks, including winning the World Grand Prix. Each city contains a bar, whose owner can give hints as to the whereabouts of nearby coins.\n\nAdditionally, a major recurring theme is populating \"My City,\" the city which the player founds as the first resident. To build up My City, the player must talk to many different cars throughout the world and find those interested in starting a new life or building new homes or shops. As more and more residents move to My City, those residents' houses and shops appear throughout the city, each building being themed after the architectural style of its resident's hometown. Once complete, My City contains a school, [[Fire Department|fire department]], [[police station]], Q's Factory, Body Shop, Parts Shop, Paint Shop, parks, and residential houses.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n=== Economy ===\nAt the start of the game, the player is asked to specify a name for the currency used for the rest of the game. Money is central to Road Trip Adventure, as it is necessary to purchase most parts. To win money, one can race, advertise for various shops, sell parts to a resident of My City, or even play roulette. Five shops can provide a small above-car billboard to advertise with: the coffee shop in Peach Town (10 currency per km), a noodle restaurant in Fuji City (20 currency per km), a cake shop in Sandpolis (30 currency per km), a wool shop in White Mountain (40 currency per km), and a coconut shop in Papaya Island (50 currency per km). Each shop gives you a certain amount of money per kilometer driven while equipped with its respective advertisement sign. The player can also put one sign on each teammate.\n\n=== Minigames ===\nThere are around 20 minigames in Road Trip Adventure. Completing them earns money, stamps and parts. These minigames include [[Soccer]], [[Roulette]], and [[Drag Racing|Drag Races]].\n\n=== Locations ===\nThe following is a list of cities in Adventure Mode in the order in which they are typically first encountered.

Born in [[Clifton, Bristol]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1894, and travelled to the [[Transvaal Colony]] where, as a member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]], he became Director of Education. Ware next became editor of the [[The Morning Post|''Morning Post'']], being fired in 1911 after several controversies.\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the [[British Army]] but was rejected because he was too old. With the assistance of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], he obtained command of a mobile [[ambulance]] unit provided by the [[British Red Cross Society]]. In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. Ware and his graves' registration organization were transferred to the British Army in 1915. This was to become the Imperial War Graves Commission. Ware ended the war as a major general, having been [[mentioned in despatches]] twice and continued to work with the commission. In [[World War II]], he was appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries.

When the unit was disbanded in 1915, it had dealt with 12,000 casualties.<ref name=\"Veterans Agency\" />{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=33}}\n\n=== Graves Registration Commission ===\n[[File:Lt-Gen Sir Nevil Macready.jpg|left|thumb|Nevil Macready]]\nWare was struck by the lack of an official mechanism for marking and recording the graves of those killed.<ref name = \"Veterans Agency\"/> In September 1914, following British defeats at Mons and [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]], Ware's unit began sharing information with [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]], the head of the Red Cross's Wounded and Missing department.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=38\u201342, 50}} In October, Ware visited an extension of the [[B\u00e9thune]] cemetery that had graves of British soldiers in poor conditions, which were not being maintained or recorded. He soon convinced the Red Cross to fund durable grave markers.{{Sfn|Geurst|2010|p=13}}{{Sfn|Skelton|Gliddon|2008 |p=23}}\n\nIn March 1915, with the support of [[Nevil Macready]],{{Sfn|Stamp|2010|p=72}} the British Army formally recognized a Grave Registration Commission (GRC). The commission represented a joint effort between the British Army and British Red Cross.{{Efn|Crane writes that \"in some ways the GRC remained a curious hybrid, semi-detached sort of unit - the Red Cross continued to supply men and vehicles, while Ware was given the local rank of major... and the army took on the costs of crosses, rations and fuel\" {{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=52}}|name=|group=}}{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=50\u201352}} On 22 May, he was made a temporary [[major]] in the British Army.{{Sfn|The London Gazette 21 May 1915}} On 9 September, the promotion was [[antedated]] to 22 February 1915.{{Sfn|The London Gazette 7 September 1915}} In March 1915, the GRC was exempted from a ban on [[War photography|photography]] and a department of three photographers was created to photograph graves; by mid-August, six thousand graves had been photographed and eight hundred photographs sent to families.{{Sfn|Summers|2007|pp=15-17}}{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=50\u201352, 54\u201356, 59}} \n\nWare's work continued to expand: by May 1915, 4,300 graves had been registered. He was extensively involved in early organization of the commission, dividing it into two main parts and seven sections. That spring he began serving as an intermediary between the French and British governments over grave-related matters. The organization began handling requests at a headquarters in [[Lillers]], and the sections worked on grave maintenance. By mid-August, a further 18,173 graves had been registered. Around the same time Ware became unable to continue work with the Mobile Ambulance Unit, and began to solely focus on the commission. On 6 September Macready recommended transferring the organization completely to the Army; the transfer was completed by late October.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=50\u201352, 54\u201356, 59}} By May 1916, the Commission had selected 200 sites for cemeteries.{{Sfn|Summers|2007|pp=15-17}}  \n\nIn his role in the commission, Ware served as \"the sole [[intermediary]] between the British Army in the Field and the French Military and Civil Authorities in all matters relating to graves.\"{{Sfn|War Graves|1929|p=15}} Throughout 1915 and 1916, Ware led negotiations between France and Britain, resolving various issues, particularly that of [[land expropriation]] for the cemeteries. Around June 1915, his efforts resulted in an 'expropriation bill' that began to be debated by the French government. Ware shepherded the bill through its passage, urging prominent figures such as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant-General]], the [[King of the United Kingdom|King]], and the editor of the ''Times'' to support it.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=59, 64}} The law passed the French government on 29 December 1917.{{Sfn|Documents of the NYS Assembly|1918|p=548}} It gave Britain the ability to control their war graves in \"perpetuity of [[sepulture]]\"{{Sfn|Miles|2017|p=51}}{{Sfn|Skelton|Gliddon|2008|p=23}} and provided for the establishment of a British authority to manage the cemeteries.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=65}} \n\nWhen [[William Glynne Charles Gladstone]], a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] and the grandson of former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], was [[killed in action]] near [[Laventie]] on 13 April 1915, his family attempted to have the body [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and returned to England. Despite a ban on exhumations established by [[Joseph Joffre]], his family received special permission to take the body and bury it in [[Hawarden|Hawarden, Wales]]. In response, Ware secured an order that banned all future exhumations.{{Sfn|Elborough|2017|p=55}}{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=68\u201376}} \n\nOn 10 September 1915 he was appointed a chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]] by the Government of France.{{Sfn|The Edinburgh Gazette 10 September 1915}} By October 1915, the new Graves Registration Commission had registered over 31,000 graves, and 50,000 by May 1916.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/content.asp?menuid=2&submenuid=11&id=11&menuname=Records&menu=sub|title=Records|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807043150/http://www.cwgc.org/content.asp?menuid=2&submenuid=11&id=11&menuname=Records&menu=sub|archive-date=7 August 2006|access-date=17 September 2006}}</ref> On 11 February 1916 Ware was promoted to temporary [[lieutenant colonel]].{{Sfn|The London Gazette 28 March 1916}} After passage of the bill, [[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett]], the [[First Commissioner of Works]], and Ware competed for responsibility over the graveyards.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=81}} As the war continued, Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post-war period.

For example, [[Lionel Earle]], a member of the International War Graves Committee, objected to the Army's practice of marking the graves of [[deserters]] with unmarked wooden crosses. As a result the custom was abolished. In 1916, efforts to neaten the cemeteries began. Ware invited [[Arthur William Hill]], then assistant director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], to tour the cemeteries and advise upon further planting efforts in early 1915.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=88\u201389}} Hill visited 37 cemeteries and wrote a report on how to plant them. Efforts began slowly, but by 1917 the commission had established four nurseries.{{Sfn|Skelton|Gliddon|2008 |p=24}} In the [[1917 New Year Honours]], Ware was awarded the [[Companion Order of St Michael and St George]].{{Sfn|The Edinburgh Gazette 26 January 1917}}\n\n=== Imperial War Graves Commission ===\n[[File:Canadian Corps - Canadian war graves.jpg|thumb|Canadian war graves near [[Ypres, Belgium]].

Private divisional monuments and memorials for individual countries had been proposed. The National Battlefield Memorial Committee was set up in 1919 to oversee the construction of monuments. Ware and the IWGC had the ability to licence all such memorials (Belgium had signed a similar agreement in 1919) and Ware began working with the various groups.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=190-193}}{{Sfn|Stamp|2010|pp=101-102}} Although Ware felt that the primary focus of the IWGC should be cemeteries,{{Sfn|Borg|1991|pp=72-73}} by August 1921 the commission had gained responsibility for battlefield monuments as the National Battlefield Memorial Committee dissolved.

The commission also struggled to navigate various regulations and commissions when building monuments in the United Kingdom; when the IWGC was building the [[Mercantile Marine Memorial]] the [[Royal Fine Arts Commission]] (RFAC) rejected Lutyens initial proposal at Temple Gardens on the bank of the [[River Thames]], suggesting [[Tower Hill]] instead.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=196-198}} Upset, Lutyens and Ware unsuccessfully urged the RFAC to reconsider.<ref name=\"NHLE WWI\">{{NHLE|num=1260087|desc=The Mercantile Marine First World War Memorial|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nDiscussions on how to commemorate the [[Ypres Salient]], the first monument that the IWGC worked on, had begun as early as 1919, when Winston Churchill stated that \"I should like us to acquire the whole of the ruins of Ypres\u2019 as a memorial. . . A more sacred place for the British race does not exist in the world\". The Belgian government agreed to give Britain the ruins of the [[Menin Gate]] to build a memorial for Commonwealth soldiers whose graves were unknown. Blomfield was appointed to design the monument; he proposed a massive [[triumphal arch]] and central hall.

In 1926, it was concluded that \"the French authorities were disquieted by the number and scale of the Memorials which the Commission proposed to erect in France and that some modification of the proposals was necessary\". Ware began working to prevent formal opposition to the monuments. As a result, proposals were dropped to six monuments; four in France and two in Belgium.{{Sfn|Stamp|2010|pp=105-109}} In July 1926, Ware proposed an Anglo-French cemetery at [[Thiepval]].

Born in [[Clifton, Bristol]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1894, and travelled to the [[Transvaal Colony]] where, as a member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]], he became Director of Education. Ware next became editor of the [[The Morning Post|''Morning Post'']], being fired in 1911 after several controversies.\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the [[British Army]] but was rejected because he was too old. With the assistance of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], he obtained command of a mobile [[ambulance]] unit provided by the [[British Red Cross Society]]. In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. Ware and his graves' registration organization were transferred to the British Army in 1915. This was to become the Imperial War Graves Commission. Ware ended the war as a major general, having been [[mentioned in despatches]] twice and continued to work with the commission. In [[World War II]], he was appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries. He fully retired in 1948, and died the following year.\n==Early life==\nWare was born in [[Clifton, Bristol]] on 17 June 1869,<ref name=\"Veterans Agency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|title=Major General Sir Fabian Ware|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Veterans Agency|Ministry of Defence Veterans Agency]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112162637/http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|archive-date=12 November 2014|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref> to Charles Ware, a chartered accountant, and his wife, Amy Carew, {{Nee}} Goulstone.<ref name= \"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB|title=Ware, Sir Fabian Arthur Goulstone|id=3674|ref=harv|date=2008|first=A.

He was extensively involved in early organization of the commission, dividing it into two main parts and seven sections. That spring he began serving as an intermediary between the French and British governments over grave-related matters. The organization began handling requests at a headquarters in [[Lillers]], and the sections worked on grave maintenance. By mid-August, a further 18,173 graves had been registered. Around the same time Ware became unable to continue work with the Mobile Ambulance Unit, and began to solely focus on the commission. On 6 September Macready recommended transferring the organization completely to the Army; the transfer was completed by late October.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=50\u201352, 54\u201356, 59}} By May 1916, the Commission had selected 200 sites for cemeteries.{{Sfn|Summers|2007|pp=15-17}}  \n\nIn his role in the commission, Ware served as \"the sole [[intermediary]] between the British Army in the Field and the French Military and Civil Authorities in all matters relating to graves.\"{{Sfn|War Graves|1929|p=15}} Throughout 1915 and 1916, Ware led negotiations between France and Britain, resolving various issues, particularly that of [[land expropriation]] for the cemeteries. Around June 1915, his efforts resulted in an 'expropriation bill' that began to be debated by the French government. Ware shepherded the bill through its passage, urging prominent figures such as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant-General]], the [[King of the United Kingdom|King]], and the editor of the ''Times'' to support it.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=59, 64}} The law passed the French government on 29 December 1917.{{Sfn|Documents of the NYS Assembly|1918|p=548}} It gave Britain the ability to control their war graves in \"perpetuity of [[sepulture]]\"{{Sfn|Miles|2017|p=51}}{{Sfn|Skelton|Gliddon|2008|p=23}} and provided for the establishment of a British authority to manage the cemeteries.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=65}} \n\nWhen [[William Glynne Charles Gladstone]], a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] and the grandson of former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], was [[killed in action]] near [[Laventie]] on 13 April 1915, his family attempted to have the body [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and returned to England.

For example, [[Lionel Earle]], a member of the International War Graves Committee, objected to the Army's practice of marking the graves of [[deserters]] with unmarked wooden crosses. As a result the custom was abolished. In 1916, efforts to neaten the cemeteries began. Ware invited [[Arthur William Hill]], then assistant director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], to tour the cemeteries and advise upon further planting efforts in early 1915.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=88\u201389}} Hill visited 37 cemeteries and wrote a report on how to plant them.

Private divisional monuments and memorials for individual countries had been proposed. The National Battlefield Memorial Committee was set up in 1919 to oversee the construction of monuments. Ware and the IWGC had the ability to licence all such memorials (Belgium had signed a similar agreement in 1919) and Ware began working with the various groups.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=190-193}}{{Sfn|Stamp|2010|pp=101-102}} Although Ware felt that the primary focus of the IWGC should be cemeteries,{{Sfn|Borg|1991|pp=72-73}} by August 1921 the commission had gained responsibility for battlefield monuments as the National Battlefield Memorial Committee dissolved.

The commission also struggled to navigate various regulations and commissions when building monuments in the United Kingdom; when the IWGC was building the [[Mercantile Marine Memorial]] the [[Royal Fine Arts Commission]] (RFAC) rejected Lutyens initial proposal at Temple Gardens on the bank of the [[River Thames]], suggesting [[Tower Hill]] instead.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=196-198}} Upset, Lutyens and Ware unsuccessfully urged the RFAC to reconsider.<ref name=\"NHLE WWI\">{{NHLE|num=1260087|desc=The Mercantile Marine First World War Memorial|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nDiscussions on how to commemorate the [[Ypres Salient]], the first monument that the IWGC worked on, had begun as early as 1919, when Winston Churchill stated that \"I should like us to acquire the whole of the ruins of Ypres\u2019 as a memorial. . . A more sacred place for the British race does not exist in the world\". The Belgian government agreed to give Britain the ruins of the [[Menin Gate]] to build a memorial for Commonwealth soldiers whose graves were unknown. Blomfield was appointed to design the monument; he proposed a massive [[triumphal arch]] and central hall.

In 1926, it was concluded that \"the French authorities were disquieted by the number and scale of the Memorials which the Commission proposed to erect in France and that some modification of the proposals was necessary\". Ware began working to prevent formal opposition to the monuments. As a result, proposals were dropped to six monuments; four in France and two in Belgium.{{Sfn|Stamp|2010|pp=105-109}} In July 1926, Ware proposed an Anglo-French cemetery at [[Thiepval]]. In an effort to gain further French support for the [[Thiepval Memorial]], he proposed placing the inscription {{Lang|fr|Aux arm\u00e9es Fran\u00e7aise et Britannique l\u2019Empire Britannique reconnaissant}} (to the French and British armies, from the grateful British Empire) on part of the monument. In November, Ware and Lutyens met with [[Emmanuel Pontremoli]] and [[No\u00ebl \u00c9douard, vicomte de Curi\u00e8res de Castelnau]] to begin discussing Thiepval.
