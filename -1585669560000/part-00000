This is especially true of the regions of northwestern Italy and southeastern France. As Italian wealth and influence grew during the Middle Ages, many [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]], Genoese, Neapolitan, Piedmontese and Venetian traders, bankers and artisans settled, usually through family branches, throughout France. Regions of significant [[Italian diaspora]] sprang up as far north as [[Paris]] and [[Flanders]]. However it was not much as a percentage of the French global population.\n\nThis Italian migration developed more through the Renaissance, as previous generations became assimilated. Italian artists, writers and architects were called upon by the French monarchy and aristocrats, leading to a significant interchange of culture, but it was not a massive immigration of popular classes.\n\nSince the 16th century, Florence and its citizens have long enjoyed a very close relationship with France.<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/renaissance_quarterly/v060/60.4eisenbichler.html Project MUSE \u2013 Renaissance Quarterly \u2013 Savonarola in Francia: Circolazione di un'eredit\u00e0 politico-religiosa nell'Europa del Cinquecento (review)].

Under the gallicised version of her name, Catherine de M\u00e9dici, she became [[Queen consort of France]] when Henry ascended to the throne in 1547. Later on, after Henry died, she became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]] and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, [[Henry III of France|Henry III]].\n\nOther notable examples of Italians that played a major role in the history of France include [[Cardinal Mazarin]], born in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] was a cardinal, diplomat and politician, who served as the chief minister of France from 1642 until his death in 1661. Mazarin succeeded his mentor, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], and extended France's political ambitions not only within Italy but towards England as well.\n\n[[Henri de Tonti|Enrico Tonti]], born near Gaeta, Italy (1649/50 - 1704) was an Italian-born soldier, explorer, and fur trader in the service of France. He was the son of Lorenzo de Tonti, a financier and former governor of Gaeta. Enrico was second in command of the La Salle expedition on his descent of the Mississippi River. Tonti's letters and journals are valuable source materials on these explorations.\n\nEnrico's brother, Pierre [[Alphonse de Tonti]], or Alphonse de Tonty, Baron de Paludy (ca. 1659 \u2013 10 November 1727)[1] was an officer who served under the French explorer Cadillac and helped establish the first European settlement at Detroit, Michigan, Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit on the Detroit River in 1701. Several months later, both Cadillac and Tonty brought their wives to the fort, making them the first European women to travel into the interior of North America. He was the son of Lorenzo de Tonti who was a financier and former governor of Gaeta. Lorenzo de Tonti was the inventor of the form of life insurance known as the tontine. [[Henri de Tonti]], involved in LaSalle's exploration of the Mississippi River and the establishment of the first settlement in Arkansas, was his older brother.\n\n===Modern period===\n[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], French emperor and general, was ethnically [[Italians|Italian]] of Corsican origin, whose family was of [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/402943/Napoleon-I |title=Napoleon I (emperor of France) \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>\n\nItalian popular immigration to France only began in the late 18th century, really developed from the end of the 19th century until the World War I and became quite massive after this war. France needed workforce to compensate for the war losses and its very low birthrate. Initially, Italian immigration to modern France (late 18th to the early 20th century) came predominantly from northern Italy ([[Piedmont]], [[Veneto]]), then from central Italy ([[Marche]], [[Umbria]]), mostly to the bordering southeastern region of [[Provence]].<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> It wasn't until after World War II that large numbers of immigrants from [[southern Italy]] immigrated to France, usually settling in industrialised areas of France, such as [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], [[Paris]] and [[Lyon]].<ref name=\"Cohen\"/>\n\n==Autochthonous populations==\n{{See also|Italians|Corsicans}}\nIn both the [[County of Nice]], parts of [[Savoy]], \"Italian\" can refer to autochthonous speakers of [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]] ([[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] and [[Piedmontese|Piedmontese language]]s), natives in the region since before annexation to France, and also to descendants of Italians that migrated to the areas when they were part of Italian states.

This is especially true of the regions of northwestern Italy and southeastern France. As Italian wealth and influence grew during the Middle Ages, many [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]], Genoese, Neapolitan, Piedmontese and Venetian traders, bankers and artisans settled, usually through family branches, throughout France. Regions of significant [[Italian diaspora]] sprang up as far north as [[Paris]] and [[Flanders]]. However it was not much as a percentage of the French global population.\n\nThis Italian migration developed more through the Renaissance, as previous generations became assimilated. Italian artists, writers and architects were called upon by the French monarchy and aristocrats, leading to a significant interchange of culture, but it was not a massive immigration of popular classes.\n\nSince the 16th century, Florence and its citizens have long enjoyed a very close relationship with France.<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/renaissance_quarterly/v060/60.4eisenbichler.html Project MUSE \u2013 Renaissance Quarterly \u2013 Savonarola in Francia: Circolazione di un'eredit\u00e0 politico-religiosa nell'Europa del Cinquecento (review)].

Under the gallicised version of her name, Catherine de M\u00e9dici, she became [[Queen consort of France]] when Henry ascended to the throne in 1547. Later on, after Henry died, she became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]] and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, [[Henry III of France|Henry III]].\n\nOther notable examples of Italians that played a major role in the history of France include [[Cardinal Mazarin]], born in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] was a cardinal, diplomat and politician, who served as the chief minister of France from 1642 until his death in 1661. Mazarin succeeded his mentor, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], and extended France's political ambitions not only within Italy but towards England as well.\n\n[[Henri de Tonti|Enrico Tonti]], born near Gaeta, Italy (1649/50 - 1704) was an Italian-born soldier, explorer, and fur trader in the service of France. He was the son of Lorenzo de Tonti, a financier and former governor of Gaeta. Enrico was second in command of the La Salle expedition on his descent of the Mississippi River. Tonti's letters and journals are valuable source materials on these explorations.\n\nEnrico's brother, Pierre [[Alphonse de Tonti]], or Alphonse de Tonty, Baron de Paludy (ca. 1659 \u2013 10 November 1727)[1] was an officer who served under the French explorer Cadillac and helped establish the first European settlement at Detroit, Michigan, Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit on the Detroit River in 1701. Several months later, both Cadillac and Tonty brought their wives to the fort, making them the first European women to travel into the interior of North America. He was the son of Lorenzo de Tonti who was a financier and former governor of Gaeta. Lorenzo de Tonti was the inventor of the form of life insurance known as the tontine. [[Henri de Tonti]], involved in LaSalle's exploration of the Mississippi River and the establishment of the first settlement in Arkansas, was his older brother.\n\n===Modern period===\n[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], French emperor and general, was ethnically [[Italians|Italian]] of Corsican origin, whose family was of [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/402943/Napoleon-I |title=Napoleon I (emperor of France) \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>\n\nItalian popular immigration to France only began in the late 18th century, really developed from the end of the 19th century until the World War I and became quite massive after this war. France needed workforce to compensate for the war losses and its very low birthrate. Initially, Italian immigration to modern France (late 18th to the early 20th century) came predominantly from northern Italy ([[Piedmont]], [[Veneto]]), then from central Italy ([[Marche]], [[Umbria]]), mostly to the bordering southeastern region of [[Provence]].<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> It wasn't until after World War II that large numbers of immigrants from [[southern Italy]] immigrated to France, usually settling in industrialised areas of France, such as [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], [[Paris]] and [[Lyon]].<ref name=\"Cohen\"/>\n\n==Autochthonous populations==\n{{See also|Italians|Corsicans}}\nIn both the [[County of Nice]], parts of [[Savoy]], \"Italian\" can refer to autochthonous speakers of [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]] ([[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] and [[Piedmontese|Piedmontese language]]s), natives in the region since before annexation to France, and also to descendants of Italians that migrated to the areas when they were part of Italian states.

The Koyukon lived in several camps throughout the year, moving as the seasons changed, following the wild game and fish. The various bands established joint settlements after 1851. The old site of Alatna was a traditional trading center for Athabascans and Eskimos.\n\nThe first mission on the Koyukuk River, St. John's-in-the-Wilderness Episcopal Mission, was established in 1906. A post office was opened in 1925. In 1938, the name of the community was changed to Allakaket (the old name for the mission), and the name Alatna was assumed by the small Eskimo community across the river. The first public school was established in 1957. A flood caused by ice jamming inundated 85% of the community in the Spring of 1964. In 1975, the community incorporated as a City, including both settlements of Allakaket and Alatna. A clinic and airport were built in 1978. A new school and community roads were built in 1979. In September 1994, flood waters destroyed and swept away nearly all of the community's buildings, homes, and food caches for the winter. Residents rebuilt near the old City site, but some new homes and facilities are now located outside of the incorporated City boundaries. New Allakaket and Alatna are located outside of the City limits.\n\nA federally recognized tribe is located in the community\u2014the Allakaket Village. The population of the community consists of 95.9% Alaska Native or part Native. Allakaket is mainly an Athabascan community; Kobuk Eskimos live across the river in Alatna. Two separate village councils exist. Traditional potlatches, dances and foot races attract visitors from area villages. Subsistence activities provide the majority of food sources. Sale, importation, and possession of alcohol are banned in the village.\n\n==Geography==\nAllakaket is located at {{Coord|66|33|48|N|152|38|50|W|type:city}} (66.562610, -152.64756)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> (Sec. 14, T020N, R024W, Fairbanks Meridian.) Allakaket is located in the Fairbanks Recording District.\n\nAllakaket is on the south bank of the [[Koyukuk River]], southwest of its junction with the [[Alatna River]], approximately {{convert|190|mi|km}} northwest of [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] and {{convert|57|mi|km}} upriver from [[Hughes, Alaska|Hughes]]. The village of Alatna is located directly across the river.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|3.6|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} of it (17.05%) is water.\n\n===Climate===\nAllakaket has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfc'') characterized by frigid, snowy winters and mild summers. The average high temperature during July is {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1|disp=or}}. Temperatures in January fall to or below {{convert|0|F|C|1|disp=or}} on all but four mornings, and during December and February on all but six per month, whilst extended periods below {{convert|&minus;40|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or}} are common: the coldest month on record of January 1971 averaged {{convert|&minus;44.9|F|C|1}}. Being further from the Alaska Range than Fairbanks, Allakaket is less influenced by warming [[chinook winds]], so that temperatures have topped freezing in January only six times on record, and in December only ten times of record.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|94|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1}} and the lowest was {{convert|-75|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1}}. Average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is {{convert|12.41|in|mm|1|disp=or}} and annual snowfall is {{convert|61.3|in|m|2|disp=or}}.

The primary year-round employers are the school, City, Tribe and village corporation store. Construction and [[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] emergency firefighting provide summer jobs. A few earn income from trapping or selling traditional Native handicrafts. Subsistence is the focus of the local economy. Salmon, whitefish, moose, bear, small game and berries provide most food sources. Caribou are taken when available.\n\nAllakaket has no road link, but winter trails connect it with Hughes, Bettles and Tanana. River transportation is important in summer, but there is no commercial barge access due to shallow water. The state-owned [[Allakaket Airport]] has a {{convert|4000|by|100|ft|abbr=on}} gravel runway and is accessible year-round. A $6 million airport improvement began construction in 1997.

Area, Alaska|Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area]] of the [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]] of the U.S. state of [[Alaska]].

The Koyukon lived in several camps throughout the year, moving as the seasons changed, following the wild game and fish. The various bands established joint settlements after 1851. The old site of Alatna was a traditional trading center for Athabascans and Eskimos.\n\nThe first mission on the Koyukuk River, St. John's-in-the-Wilderness Episcopal Mission, was established in 1906. A post office was opened in 1925. In 1938, the name of the community was changed to Allakaket (the old name for the mission), and the name Alatna was assumed by the small Eskimo community across the river. The first public school was established in 1957. A flood caused by ice jamming inundated 85% of the community in the Spring of 1964. In 1975, the community incorporated as a City, including both settlements of Allakaket and Alatna. A clinic and airport were built in 1978. A new school and community roads were built in 1979. In September 1994, flood waters destroyed and swept away nearly all of the community's buildings, homes, and food caches for the winter. Residents rebuilt near the old City site, but some new homes and facilities are now located outside of the incorporated City boundaries. New Allakaket and Alatna are located outside of the City limits.\n\nA federally recognized tribe is located in the community\u2014the Allakaket Village. The population of the community consists of 95.9% Alaska Native or part Native. Allakaket is mainly an Athabascan community; Kobuk Eskimos live across the river in Alatna. Two separate village councils exist. Traditional potlatches, dances and foot races attract visitors from area villages. Subsistence activities provide the majority of food sources. Sale, importation, and possession of alcohol are banned in the village.\n\n==Geography==\nAllakaket is located at {{Coord|66|33|48|N|152|38|50|W|type:city}} (66.562610, -152.64756)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> (Sec. 14, T020N, R024W, Fairbanks Meridian.) Allakaket is located in the Fairbanks Recording District.\n\nAllakaket is on the south bank of the [[Koyukuk River]], southwest of its junction with the [[Alatna River]], approximately {{convert|190|mi|km}} northwest of [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] and {{convert|57|mi|km}} upriver from [[Hughes, Alaska|Hughes]]. The village of Alatna is located directly across the river.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|3.6|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} of it (17.05%) is water.\n\n===Climate===\nAllakaket has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfc'') characterized by frigid, snowy winters and mild summers.

Caribou are taken when available.\n\nAllakaket has no road link, but winter trails connect it with Hughes, Bettles and Tanana. River transportation is important in summer, but there is no commercial barge access due to shallow water.
