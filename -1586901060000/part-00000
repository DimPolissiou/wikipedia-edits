The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

He was credited with innovating the [[multitrack recording]] method. Dowd worked on a veritable \"who's who\" of recordings that encompassed blues, jazz, pop, rock and soul records.\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early years ===\nBorn in [[Manhattan]], Dowd grew up playing piano, tuba, violin, and string bass. His mother was an opera singer and his father was a [[concertmaster]].\n\nDowd graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in June 1942 at the age of 16.<ref name=\"SoS\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct04/articles/rocketscience.htm |title=The Engineers Who Changed Recording |date=October 2004 |journal=Sound on Sound |last=Daley |first=Dan |accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref> He continued his musical education at [[City College of New York]]. Dowd also played in a band at New York's [[Columbia University]], where he became a [[conducting|conductor]]. He was also employed at the [[physics]] laboratory of Columbia University.\n\n=== Military work ===\nAt age 18, Dowd was [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the military with the rank of [[sergeant]]. He continued his work in physics at Columbia University. He worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], which developed the [[atomic bomb]]. The purpose of the work was unclear until 1945.<ref name=\"languageofmusic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thelanguageofmusic.com/bio_40.HTM |title=Biography |publisher=Tom Dowd and the Language of Music |accessdate=2007-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928212802/http://www.thelanguageofmusic.com/bio_40.HTM |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}</ref> Dowd planned to obtain a degree in [[nuclear physics]] when he completed his work on the Manhattan Project. However, because his work was top secret, the university did not recognize it, and Dowd decided not to continue, since the university's curriculum would not have been able to further his physics education. His research for the military was more advanced than academic courses at that time.<ref name=\"languageofmusic\"/>\n\n=== Music ===\nDowd took a job at a [[European classical music|classical music]] recording studio until he obtained employment at [[Atlantic Records]]. His first hit was [[Eileen Barton]]'s \"[[If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake]]\". He soon became a top [[audio engineering|recording engineer]] there and recorded popular artists such as [[Ray Charles]], [[the Drifters]], [[the Coasters]], [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the Spinners]],  [[Ruth Brown]] and [[Bobby Darin]], including Darin's famous rendition of [[Kurt Weill]]/[[Bertolt Brecht]]'s \"Mack the Knife\". He captured jazz masterpieces by [[John Coltrane]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charlie Parker]]. It was Dowd's idea to cut Ray Charles' recording of \"[[What'd I Say]]\" into two parts and release them as the A-side and B-side of the same single record.\n\nDowd worked as an engineer and producer from the 1940s until the beginning of the 21st century. While working for Atlantic Records, he lived in Westwood, NJ with his wife Jackie and his sons, Steven and Todd. He recorded albums by many artists including [[Bee Gees]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]], [[Derek and the Dominos]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Wishbone Ash]], [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[the Allman Brothers Band]], [[Joe Bonamassa]], [[the J.

He was credited with innovating the [[multitrack recording]] method. Dowd worked on a veritable \"who's who\" of recordings that encompassed blues, jazz, pop, rock and soul records.\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early years ===\nBorn in [[Manhattan]], Dowd grew up playing piano, tuba, violin, and string bass. His mother was an opera singer and his father was a [[concertmaster]].\n\nDowd graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in June 1942 at the age of 16.<ref name=\"SoS\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct04/articles/rocketscience.htm |title=The Engineers Who Changed Recording |date=October 2004 |journal=Sound on Sound |last=Daley |first=Dan |accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref> He continued his musical education at [[City College of New York]]. Dowd also played in a band at New York's [[Columbia University]], where he became a [[conducting|conductor]]. He was also employed at the [[physics]] laboratory of Columbia University.\n\n=== Military work ===\nAt age 18, Dowd was [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the military with the rank of [[sergeant]]. He continued his work in physics at Columbia University. He worked on the [[Manhattan Project]], which developed the [[atomic bomb]]. The purpose of the work was unclear until 1945.<ref name=\"languageofmusic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thelanguageofmusic.com/bio_40.HTM |title=Biography |publisher=Tom Dowd and the Language of Music |accessdate=2007-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928212802/http://www.thelanguageofmusic.com/bio_40.HTM |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}</ref> Dowd planned to obtain a degree in [[nuclear physics]] when he completed his work on the Manhattan Project. However, because his work was top secret, the university did not recognize it, and Dowd decided not to continue, since the university's curriculum would not have been able to further his physics education. His research for the military was more advanced than academic courses at that time.<ref name=\"languageofmusic\"/>\n\n=== Music ===\nDowd took a job at a [[European classical music|classical music]] recording studio until he obtained employment at [[Atlantic Records]]. His first hit was [[Eileen Barton]]'s \"[[If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake]]\". He soon became a top [[audio engineering|recording engineer]] there and recorded popular artists such as [[Ray Charles]], [[the Drifters]], [[the Coasters]], [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the Spinners]],  [[Ruth Brown]] and [[Bobby Darin]], including Darin's famous rendition of [[Kurt Weill]]/[[Bertolt Brecht]]'s \"Mack the Knife\". He captured jazz masterpieces by [[John Coltrane]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charlie Parker]]. It was Dowd's idea to cut Ray Charles' recording of \"[[What'd I Say]]\" into two parts and release them as the A-side and B-side of the same single record.\n\nDowd worked as an engineer and producer from the 1940s until the beginning of the 21st century. While working for Atlantic Records, he lived in Westwood, NJ with his wife Jackie and his sons, Steven and Todd. He recorded albums by many artists including [[Bee Gees]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]], [[Derek and the Dominos]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Wishbone Ash]], [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[the Allman Brothers Band]], [[Joe Bonamassa]], [[the J.

These uses are limited to specific site scenarios and acceptance should be on a case-by-case basis for construction projects.\n\n==Carbon to nitrogen ratio==\n\nTopsoil is the primary resource for plants to grow and crops to thrive and the main two parameters for this are Carbon and Nitrogen. The Carbon provides energy and Nitrogen is a tissue builder and plants require them in a range of ratios to enable suitable growth. An optimum figure for Topsoil in the UK is a ratio of less than 20:1. This ensures that the soil has a suitable energy reserve as well as tissue building material to enable the plants to thrive. A sawdust typically has a carbonaceous base and this a high C:N ratio (in the order of c. 400:1) while an Alfalfa Hay has a low carbonaceous content and can typically have a C:N ratio in the order of 12:1.<ref>Understanding the Carbon Nitrogen Ratio by Crow Miller ACRES http://sccd.org/carbon-nitrogen_ratio.pdf</ref>\n\n==Commercial application==\nA variety of soil mixtures are sold [[commerce|commercially]] as topsoil, usually for use in improving [[garden]]s and [[lawn]]s, e.g. [[container garden]]s, [[potting soil]] and [[peat]]. Another important yet not commonly known use for topsoil is for proper surface grading near residential buildings such as homes. \"The ground around the home should slope down six inches for the first ten feet away from the home. This can often be done by adding topsoil (not sand or gravel).\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Erosion==\nA major environmental concern known as topsoil [[erosion]] occurs when the topsoil layer is blown or washed away. Without topsoil, little plant life is possible. The estimated annual costs of public and environmental health losses related to soil erosion exceed $45&nbsp;billion.<ref>http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~gdrg/readings/2007/02/20/Pimental_EnvironmentalEnergeticAndEconomicComparisonsOfOrganicAndConventionalFarmingSystems.pdf</ref> Conventional agriculture encourages the depletion of topsoil because the soil must be plowed and replanted each year. Sustainable techniques attempt to slow erosion through the use of [[cover crops]] in order to build organic matter in the soil. The United States alone loses almost 3 tons of topsoil per acre per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/nri |title=Summary Report, 2007 Natural Resources Inventory |publisher= Natural Resources Conservation Services, U.

Topsoil is mainly sold by the cubic yard in the United States.  To calculate the amount of topsoil you will need, \"simply take your length (in feet) multiplied by your width (in feet) multiplied by your depth (in feet so if you wanted 5 inches that would be 5/12) then divide the total by 27.  This will give you your cubic yards needed for the project.

Other uses specified in the standard that allows for a variety of uses in different and specific scenarios includes:\n\nAcidic, Calcareous, Low Fertility, Low Fertility Acidic and Low Fertility Calcareous. These uses are limited to specific site scenarios and acceptance should be on a case-by-case basis for construction projects.\n\n==Carbon to nitrogen ratio==\n\nTopsoil is the primary resource for plants to grow and crops to thrive and the main two parameters for this are Carbon and Nitrogen. The Carbon provides energy and Nitrogen is a tissue builder and plants require them in a range of ratios to enable suitable growth. An optimum figure for Topsoil in the UK is a ratio of less than 20:1. This ensures that the soil has a suitable energy reserve as well as tissue building material to enable the plants to thrive. A sawdust typically has a carbonaceous base and this a high C:N ratio (in the order of c. 400:1) while an Alfalfa Hay has a low carbonaceous content and can typically have a C:N ratio in the order of 12:1.<ref>Understanding the Carbon Nitrogen Ratio by Crow Miller ACRES http://sccd.org/carbon-nitrogen_ratio.pdf</ref>\n\n==Commercial application==\nA variety of soil mixtures are sold [[commerce|commercially]] as topsoil, usually for use in improving [[garden]]s and [[lawn]]s, e.g. [[container garden]]s, [[potting soil]] and [[peat]]. Another important yet not commonly known use for topsoil is for proper surface grading near residential buildings such as homes. \"The ground around the home should slope down six inches for the first ten feet away from the home. This can often be done by adding topsoil (not sand or gravel).\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Erosion==\nA major environmental concern known as topsoil [[erosion]] occurs when the topsoil layer is blown or washed away. Without topsoil, little plant life is possible. The estimated annual costs of public and environmental health losses related to soil erosion exceed $45&nbsp;billion.<ref>http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~gdrg/readings/2007/02/20/Pimental_EnvironmentalEnergeticAndEconomicComparisonsOfOrganicAndConventionalFarmingSystems.pdf</ref> Conventional agriculture encourages the depletion of topsoil because the soil must be plowed and replanted each year. Sustainable techniques attempt to slow erosion through the use of [[cover crops]] in order to build organic matter in the soil. The United States alone loses almost 3 tons of topsoil per acre per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/nri |title=Summary Report, 2007 Natural Resources Inventory |publisher= Natural Resources Conservation Services, U.

Topsoil is mainly sold by the cubic yard in the United States.  To calculate the amount of topsoil you will need, \"simply take your length (in feet) multiplied by your width (in feet) multiplied by your depth (in feet so if you wanted 5 inches that would be 5/12) then divide the total by 27.  This will give you your cubic yards needed for the project.  Ex: 10L x 10W x (5/12) = 41.66/27 = 1.54 cubic yards of topsoil needed.\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://topsoildirtcheap.com/|title=Topsoil Delivery Topsoil Dirt Cheap ~ Topsoil Delivery|website=Topsoil Delivery|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Ecology}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Agricultural wastewater]]\n* [[Desertfication]]\n* [[Dust bowl]]\n* [[Erosion control]]\n* [[No-till farming]]\n* [[Sustainable agriculture]]\n* [[Waterway degradation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n===Further reading===\n{{refbegin}}\n* [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/348200_dirt22.html The lowdown on topsoil: It's disappearing]\n* {{cite journal|journal=[[National Geographic Magazine]]|title=Our Good Earth|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/mann-text|author=Mann, C|year=2008|volume=214|issue=3|pages=80\u2013107|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121122149/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/mann-text|archivedate=2013-01-21}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Soil science}}\n* [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/ USDA Electronic Field Office Technical Guide] - Detailed soil conservation guides tailored to individual states/counties\n\n[[Category:Soil]]\n[[Category:Horticulture and gardening]]\n[[Category:Soil improvers]]\n[[Category:Lawn care]]\n[[Category:Types of soil]]\n", "name_user": "Kuyabribri", "label": "safe", "comment": "formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsoil"}

In [[Atlanta]], a man was shot by a woman's husband for crying \"Oh, you kid!\" towards her; the gunman was released without charge.<ref name=slate/>\n\nRosen commented that \"the reaction of the social reformers and guardians of public morality to the song... show us the same kinds of moral panics that greeted... later forms of popular music.\"<ref name=npr/>\n\nThe craze died down by 1910, though the phrase continued in popular usage, being particularly favored by [[Groucho Marx]] in comedy routines and as a [[tagline]].

It borders [[Lake Hopatcong]], a partially man-made lake that is now a source of much recreation and desirable real estate, and is the biggest lake in New Jersey. The community, {{convert|40|miles}} west of New York City, began as a summer getaway for the wealthy in NYC who primarily sought access to the lake. An amusement park, called \"Bertrand's Island\", sprang up and was accessible via the lake, trolley or by car through [[Mount Arlington, New Jersey|Mount Arlington]]. The construction of [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate 80]], a highway that stretches from [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], all the way across the country to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], triggered rapid growth in New York City's suburbs and led to Hopatcong becoming a permanent residential community.\n\nThe area had been called \"Brookland\" in the 19th century and the lake that was expanded to become [[Lake Hopatcong]] had been known as \"Great Pond\" or \"Brookland Pond\". During the 1830s, the name of the community had been modified to \"Brooklyn\", [[Brooklyn|to match the spelling of the city]] on [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Long Island]].<ref>Balston, Mottel.

It borders [[Lake Hopatcong]], a partially man-made lake that is now a source of much recreation and desirable real estate, and is the biggest lake in New Jersey. The community, {{convert|40|miles}} west of New York City, began as a summer getaway for the wealthy in NYC who primarily sought access to the lake. An amusement park, called \"Bertrand's Island\", sprang up and was accessible via the lake, trolley or by car through [[Mount Arlington, New Jersey|Mount Arlington]]. The construction of [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate 80]], a highway that stretches from [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], all the way across the country to [[San Francisco]], [[California]], triggered rapid growth in New York City's suburbs and led to Hopatcong becoming a permanent residential community.\n\nThe area had been called \"Brookland\" in the 19th century and the lake that was expanded to become [[Lake Hopatcong]] had been known as \"Great Pond\" or \"Brookland Pond\". During the 1830s, the name of the community had been modified to \"Brooklyn\", [[Brooklyn|to match the spelling of the city]] on [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Long Island]].<ref>Balston, Mottel.
