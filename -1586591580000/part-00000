The series follows Jonas Kahnwald, a teenager struggling to cope with his father's suicide; police officer Ulrich Nielsen, whose brother disappeared 33 years earlier; and police chief Charlotte Doppler.\n\nThe story begins in 2019, but spreads to include story-lines in 1986 and 1953 via [[time travel]], as certain characters of the show's core families grow aware of the existence of a [[wormhole]] in the cave system beneath the local nuclear power plant, which is under the management of the influential Tiedemann family. During the first season, secrets begin to be revealed concerning the Kahnwald, Nielsen, Doppler, and Tiedemann families, and their lives start to crumble as the ties become evident between the missing children and the histories of the town and its citizens.\n\nThe second season continues the intertwining families' attempts to reunite with their missing loved ones, several months after the first-season finale, in 2020, 1987 and 1954, respectively. Additional story-lines set in 2053 and 1921 add new aspects to the mysteries, and the secret ''Sic Mundus'' fellowship, a major force in an underlying battle for the ultimate fate of the people of Winden, is explored, as the season counts down towards the apocalypse \u2013 a supposed destruction of Winden and death of many of its citizens.\n\n==Cast and characters==\nThe first season primarily takes place in 2019 but expands to include stories set in 1986, 1953, and \u2013 in the final scene of the season \u2013 2052, with several characters being portrayed at various ages by multiple actors.\n\nThe second season takes place several months after the first, depicting the initial stories in 2020, 1987, and 1954, respectively, while continuing the future-set story-line into 2053, and adding a fifth story-line, set in 1921.\n\n=== Main characters ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#ADD8E6;\"\n! style=\"width:18%;\" scope=\"col\"| Character\n! style=\"width:17%;\" scope=\"col\"| Year\n! style=\"width:45%;\" scope=\"col\"| Description\n! style=\"width:15%;\" scope=\"col\"| Actor\n! style=\"width:5%;\" scope=\"col\"| Season\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"|{{sortname|Jonas|Kahnwald|nolink=1}}\n| 2019/2020\n| A high school student struggling with his father's suicide \n| {{sortname|Louis|Hofmann}}\n| 1\u20132\n|-\n| ?\u21922019/2020\n| A time traveller, also known as \"The Stranger\" \n| {{sortname|Andreas|Pietschmann}}\n| 1\u20132\n|-\n| ?\u21921921\n| The leader of ''Sic Mundus'', also known as \"Adam\"\n| {{sortname|Dietrich|Hollinderb\u00e4umer}}\n| 2\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{sortname|Mikkel|Nielsen/Michael Kahnwald|nolink=1}}\n| 2019\u21921986/1987\n| Ulrich and Katharina's youngest child\n| {{sortname|Daan Lennard|Liebrenz|nolink=1}} ([[:de:Daan Lennard Liebrenz|de]])\n| 1\u20132\n|-\n| 2019\n| Jonas' father, an artist whose suicide opens the series \n| {{sortname|Sebastian|Rudolph|nolink=1}} ([[:de:Sebastian Rudolph|de]])\n| 1\u20132\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{sortname|Hannah|Kahnwald|nolink=1}}\n| 1986/1987\n| Hannah Kr\u00fcger, a shy young girl\n| {{sortname|Ella|Lee|nolink=1}} ([[:de:Ella Lee|de]])\n| 1\u20132\n|-\n| 2019/2020\u21921954\n| Jonas' mother and Michael's wife, a massage therapist \n| {{sortname|Maja|Sch\u00f6ne}} \n| 1\u20132\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"|{{sortname|Ines|Kahnwald|nolink=1}}\n| 1953\n| A young girl\n| {{sortname|Lena|Urzendowsky|nolink=1}} ([[:de:Lena Urzendowsky|de]])\n| 1\n|-\n| 1986/1987\n| Mikkel's adoptive mother, a nurse\n| {{sortname|Anne|Ratte-Polle|nolink=1}} ([[:de:Anne Ratte-Polle|de]])\n| 1\u20132\n|-\n| 2019\n| Jonas' estranged grandmother\n| {{sortname|Angela|Winkler}}\n| 1\n|-\n| {{sortname|Sebastian|Kr\u00fcger|nolink=1}}\n| 1986\n| Hannah's blue-collar father \n| {{sortname|Denis|Schmidt|nolink=1}}\n| 1\n|-\n| {{sortname|Daniel|Kahnwald|nolink=1}}\n| 1953/1954\n| Ines' father, the Winden chief of police \n| {{sortname|Florian|Panzner}}\n| 1\u20132\n|-\n| {{sortname|Martha|Nielsen|nolink=1}}\n| 2019/2020\n| Ulrich and Katharina's middle child, Bartosz's girlfriend and Jonas' love interest\n| {{sortname|Lisa|Vicari}} \n| 1\u20132\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{sortname|Magnus|Nielsen|nolink=1}}\n| 2019/2020\n| Ulrich and Katharina's oldest child\n| {{sortname|Moritz|Jahn|link=Moritz Jahn (actor)}}\n| 1\u20132\n|-\n| ?\u21921921\n| A member of ''Sic Mundus''\n| {{sortname|Wolfram|Koch|nolink=1}} ([[:de:Wolfram Koch|de]])\n| 2\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"|{{sortname|Ulrich|Nielsen|nolink=1}}\n| 1986\n| A high school student struggling after his brother's disappearance\n| {{sortname|Ludger|B\u00f6kelmann|nolink=1}}\n| 1\n|-\n| 2019\u21921953/1954\n| Katharina's husband;

Erik Obendorf, the high school's main supplier of marijuana, has been missing for two weeks, and police officer Ulrich Nielsen \u2013 the father of Martha and her brothers, teenager Magnus and pre-teen Mikkel \u2013 has been assigned the investigation, which struggles to uncover any clues. Meanwhile, Ulrich is cheating on his wife, high school principal Katharina, with Jonas' mother Hannah. While searching for Erik's stash of drugs in a cave not far from the town's soon-to-be-closed-down nuclear power plant, Jonas, Bartosz, the three Nielsen children, and Franziska Doppler are frightened by strange sounds and their flickering flashlights, and Mikkel disappears as they flee the cave.

Police chief Charlotte Doppler is informed that the dead boy, dressed in a 1980s outfit, died only 16 hours earlier, and that his ears were destroyed by extreme pressure. Later, as lights start flickering and birds fall dead from the sky, Charlotte grows even more concerned. Meanwhile, an unkempt stranger checks into the hotel owned by Bartosz's mother Regina. Ulrich's mother Jana lies to Ulrich, claiming that her husband Tronte was with her the night of Mikkel's disappearance, while knowing he had left their house.

At the nuclear plant, newly elected director Claudia Tiedemann, Egon's daughter and Regina's mother, clashes with her predecessor Bernd Doppler, who informs her of secret barrels hidden in the nearby caves. Bernd's son, guard Helge, gives Claudia a book: ''Eine Reise durch die Zeit'' (''A Journey Through Time'') by H. G. Tannhaus. Meanwhile, as the town's electricity is flickering, a teenage Charlotte starts investigating the deaths of multiple birds, while shy young Hannah has an unrequited crush on Ulrich, and Regina is being bullied and engages in self-harm. A flock of sheep is found dead from cardiac arrest with their eardrums ruptured, and, in an undisclosed location, a man surrounded by clocks tinkers with a brass machine.

The birds also show similar symptoms to birds found after the [[Chernobyl disaster]], and Charlotte suspects connections to the Winden events of 1986. Meanwhile, her marriage to psychologist Peter is crumbling since he was discovered to be having an affair with a transgender prostitute, and she finds evidence that Peter was out driving the night of Mikkel's disappearance, despite him claiming otherwise. Their oldest daughter, Franziska, confides in Magnus Nielsen that she plans to leave Winden due to her parents' wrecked marriage, and they end up having sex. Franziska's younger sister, the deaf Elisabeth, goes missing after school, but eventually returns home, explaining that she met a mysterious man, Noah, who gave her a watch once belonging to Charlotte. Meanwhile, Peter's father Helge, who is suffering from dementia, is found roaming the forest, claiming that he \"must stop Noah\".

Hannah wants to resume her affair with Ulrich, but he angrily refuses. At the hotel, the Stranger tells Regina to deliver a package to Jonas while he is away for a few days, and at Michael's grave, the Stranger approaches Jonas, telling him that his father once saved his life. Bartosz meets Erik Obendorf's drug supplier, who is shown to be the same priest who visited Mikkel 33 years earlier. Later, Jonas receives the Stranger's package, containing a light, a [[Geiger counter]], and Michael's suicide letter. In the letter Jonas' father explains that on 4 November 2019, he travelled back to 1986, where he stayed and grew up, raised by Ines, eventually marrying Hannah and fathering Jonas.

After learning that Regina was the last one to see Mads in 1986, Ulrich confronts her, and while she admits to detesting him for bullying her during their childhood, she also makes him see that Hannah was the one framing him for rape. Visiting the morgue, Ulrich finally realises that the dead boy is Mads, not aged since 33 years ago. Meanwhile, Jonas fails to tell his mother about the suicide letter but enters the caves armed with his father's notes and the equipment from the package sent by the Stranger. Within the caves, he finds a door with a Latin phrase, ''Sic mundus creatus est'' (\"Thus the world was created\"), and after crawling through to the other side, he notices flyers put up for the missing Mads Nielsen.

Ulrich is suspended from work and Katharina confronts him about his affair. Charlotte discovers that the cave system goes beneath an old cabin owned by Helge, and later she receives a voice message from Ulrich, stating that Helge is the kidnapper, but that the question is not ''how'' he is doing it, but ''when''. Late at night, Helge leaves the nursing home, followed by Ulrich, who brings a book from Helge's room: ''Eine Reise durch die Zeit'' by H.G. Tannhaus. In 1986, Helge, who was working at the plant the night Mads disappeared, is questioned by Egon about his whereabouts. The Stranger warns Jonas that taking Mikkel back home will result in Jonas never being born. Katharina unsuccessfully attempts to convince Egon that Ulrich never raped her, and Helge and Noah prepare to move Yasin's dead body from a bunker behind Helge's cabin.\n |LineColor       = #27505A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = As You Sow, so You Shall Reap\n |AltTitle        = {{lang|de|Was man s\u00e4t, das wird man ernten}}\n |DirectedBy      = Baran bo Odar\n |WrittenBy       = Martin Behnke & Jantje Friese\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|12|1|df=yes}}\n |ShortSummary    =  In 1953, birds begin to die, and the unidentified bodies of Erik and Yasin are discovered.

Tannhaus, who declines knowledge of the book found in Helge's 2019 home. Through the young Ines and Jana, Ulrich learns of the two bodies, and when introduced to the 9-year-old Helge, he realises killing him will save the lives of the boys. He bludgeons Helge, and leaves him for dead in the bunker. Later, Tannhaus finds Ulrich's [[smartphone]]. In 1986, the Stranger meets with an elderly Tannhaus, who shares his theory of time travel through wormholes. The Stranger confirms his theories and states that such a wormhole, allowing people to travel 33 years into the past or into the future, exists in Winden. He asks Tannhaus to fix a broken brass device of his, so he can destroy the wormhole.

When Bernd admits that the hidden barrels contain byproducts of a small meltdown, Claudia hires Aleksander to secretly weld shut the door to them. In an argument with Helge (revealing that the abducted boys died from Noah's attempt to create a [[time travel|time machine]]) Noah states his mission to free humanity, likening himself to [[Noah|the Biblical Noah]]. In 2019, Hannah uses her knowledge of Aleksander's past to blackmail him into destroying Ulrich's life, while Regina discovers the Stranger's research. Bartosz is approached by Claudia, his supposedly dead grandmother. Later, Bartosz meets with Noah and agrees to join him. In 1953, Helge has been reported missing, and Noah \u2013 appearing the same age as in 1986 and 2019 \u2013  offers pastoral support to Helge's mother, Greta.

Also having returned to 1986, the elderly Helge is later killed while attempting to stop his younger self by driving a car into him. Jonas wakes in the bunker, accompanied by the Stranger, who reveals himself to be the adult Jonas and leaves to destroy the wormhole by using the brass machine, which Tannhaus has completed from the broken version brought by the adult Jonas and Ulrich's smartphone. In 2019, Charlotte finds a 1953 article on Helge's kidnapping, including a photo of Ulrich. Noah tells Bartosz that Claudia is their main adversary, and that the adult Jonas, unwittingly, is about to ''create'' the wormhole. In 1953, 9-year-old Helge regains consciousness as the wormhole appears, connecting him to Jonas in 1986.

The younger Noah is guided by his older self, a member of a group of time travellers called Sic Mundus, led by the disfigured and mysterious Adam, who tells the older Noah to retrieve the missing pages of Claudia's diary in preparation for an \"apocalypse\" that will occur on 27 June 2020.  On 21 June 2020, six days before the apocalypse, things in Winden have grown tense. An investigator, Clausen, arrives to assist Charlotte and the police force with their investigations in the disappearances, which now include Helge, Jonas and Ulrich.

He interviews Helge and goes to the local psychiatric facility to visit an old Ulrich, who spent 34 years in captivity after being mistakenly accused of murder. Ulrich rebuffs Egon for his naivety. In 2020, five days before the apocalypse, Clausen and Charlotte interview Regina, who is suffering from breast cancer. She discusses the Stranger who was at her hotel during the disappearances, and left his belongings, which included pages from Tannhaus' book.

After reading his suicide note, Michael suggests that perhaps the real reason Jonas is there is to inform Michael of what he must do and what he must write. The elderly Claudia arrives at the house and convinces Jonas and Michael that Michael must die in 2019 as an adult and Mikkel must travel to the past as a child so that Jonas can be conceived, as his role in the cycle is greater than he believes.

W\u00f6ller tells Charlotte that he helped Aleksander bury the radioactive waste in the power plant and she believes that Clausen entering the area will provoke the apocalypse. Noah reveals to Adam that he found the final pages and tries to kill Adam, but Adam shows a picture of Elisabeth who will become Noah's wife and therefore Charlotte's mother. Magnus, Franziska, and Agnes then pacify Noah and Agnes shoots him. Young Jonas and Claudia turn on the time machine in the caves, thus connecting the past and future. Young Noah visits elder Jonas in his 2020 house and gives him a letter from Martha. Young Jonas and Martha reunite, but are interrupted by Adam who shoots Martha. In the power plant, Clausen forces the opening of the radioactive waste drums which contain rocks soiled with dark matter.

anyone else notices it. On 4 November, after months of treatment at a psychiatric facility, Michael's teenage son Jonas returns to school and reunites with his best friend Bartosz Tiedemann, who is now dating Jonas' love interest, Martha. Erik Obendorf, the high school's main supplier of marijuana, has been missing for two weeks, and police officer Ulrich Nielsen \u2013 the father of Martha and her brothers, teenager Magnus and pre-teen Mikkel \u2013 has been assigned the investigation, which struggles to uncover any clues. Meanwhile, Ulrich is cheating on his wife, high school principal Katharina, with Jonas' mother Hannah. While searching for Erik's stash of drugs in a cave not far from the town's soon-to-be-closed-down nuclear power plant, Jonas, Bartosz, the three Nielsen children, and Franziska Doppler are frightened by strange sounds and their flickering flashlights, and Mikkel disappears as they flee the cave. The next day, the body of a young boy is discovered, but it is not Mikkel.

While searching the caves, he finds a locked door leading to the nearby nuclear power plant, and although Ulrich's request to enter the power plant is refused by its director Aleksander Tiedemann, Bartosz's father, he is still able to clear the father of Erik Obendorf, a power plant driver, from his list of suspects. Police chief Charlotte Doppler is informed that the dead boy, dressed in a 1980s outfit, died only 16 hours earlier, and that his ears were destroyed by extreme pressure. Later, as lights start flickering and birds fall dead from the sky, Charlotte grows even more concerned. Meanwhile, an unkempt stranger checks into the hotel owned by Bartosz's mother Regina. Ulrich's mother Jana lies to Ulrich, claiming that her husband Tronte was with her the night of Mikkel's disappearance, while knowing he had left their house.

At the nuclear plant, newly elected director Claudia Tiedemann, Egon's daughter and Regina's mother, clashes with her predecessor Bernd Doppler, who informs her of secret barrels hidden in the nearby caves. Bernd's son, guard Helge, gives Claudia a book: ''Eine Reise durch die Zeit'' (''A Journey Through Time'') by H. G. Tannhaus. Meanwhile, as the town's electricity is flickering, a teenage Charlotte starts investigating the deaths of multiple birds, while shy young Hannah has an unrequited crush on Ulrich, and Regina is being bullied and engages in self-harm. A flock of sheep is found dead from cardiac arrest with their eardrums ruptured, and, in an undisclosed location, a man surrounded by clocks tinkers with a brass machine. Mikkel sneaks away from the hospital and returns to the caves; after injuring himself, he calls for help.

The birds also show similar symptoms to birds found after the [[Chernobyl disaster]], and Charlotte suspects connections to the Winden events of 1986. Meanwhile, her marriage to psychologist Peter is crumbling since he was discovered to be having an affair with a transgender prostitute, and she finds evidence that Peter was out driving the night of Mikkel's disappearance, despite him claiming otherwise. Their oldest daughter, Franziska, confides in Magnus Nielsen that she plans to leave Winden due to her parents' wrecked marriage, and they end up having sex. Franziska's younger sister, the deaf Elisabeth, goes missing after school, but eventually returns home, explaining that she met a mysterious man, Noah, who gave her a watch once belonging to Charlotte.

Hannah wants to resume her affair with Ulrich, but he angrily refuses. At the hotel, the Stranger tells Regina to deliver a package to Jonas while he is away for a few days, and at Michael's grave, the Stranger approaches Jonas, telling him that his father once saved his life. Bartosz meets Erik Obendorf's drug supplier, who is shown to be the same priest who visited Mikkel 33 years earlier. Later, Jonas receives the Stranger's package, containing a light, a [[Geiger counter]], and Michael's suicide letter. In the letter Jonas' father explains that on 4 November 2019, he travelled back to 1986, where he stayed and grew up, raised by Ines, eventually marrying Hannah and fathering Jonas.

Visiting the morgue, Ulrich finally realises that the dead boy is Mads, not aged since 33 years ago. Meanwhile, Jonas fails to tell his mother about the suicide letter but enters the caves armed with his father's notes and the equipment from the package sent by the Stranger. Within the caves, he finds a door with a Latin phrase, ''Sic mundus creatus est'' (\"Thus the world was created\"), and after crawling through to the other side, he notices flyers put up for the missing Mads Nielsen.

Late at night, Helge leaves the nursing home, followed by Ulrich, who brings a book from Helge's room: ''Eine Reise durch die Zeit'' by H.G. Tannhaus. In 1986, Helge, who was working at the plant the night Mads disappeared, is questioned by Egon about his whereabouts.

Tannhaus, who declines knowledge of the book found in Helge's 2019 home. Through the young Ines and Jana, Ulrich learns of the two bodies, and when introduced to the 9-year-old Helge, he realises killing him will save the lives of the boys. He bludgeons Helge, and leaves him for dead in the bunker. Later, Tannhaus finds Ulrich's [[smartphone]].

The Stranger confirms his theories and states that such a wormhole, allowing people to travel 33 years into the past or into the future, exists in Winden.

The newfound evidence makes Charlotte, who was raised by Tannhaus, question her origins. The adult Jonas informs Hannah about time travel and takes her to 1987, where they find Mikkel in Ines' house. In 2053, Jonas learns via recordings by Claudia about the \"God Particle\", the sphere in the reactor that can be used as a portal for time travel. He steals fuel for the portal but is caught by the adult Elisabeth, who initially hangs him in public, but spares him and jails him instead. Silja, Elisabeth's interpreter, doubts Elisabeth's stance and frees Jonas. They go to the Dead Zone, where they successfully access the God Particle. Jonas heads inside, leaving Silja alone.\n |LineColor       = #B5A269\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Ghosts\n |AltTitle        = {{lang|de|Gespenster}}\n |DirectedBy      = Baran bo Odar\n |WrittenBy       = Jantje Friese & Marc O.

Doris cheats on her husband, Egon, with Agnes. The elderly Claudia later meets with Agnes, a former member of Sic Mundus. Agnes meets with Noah, her brother, and tells him the location of the missing pages in hopes of rejoining Sic Mundus. Claudia visits her father's younger self and apologises to him, to his confusion. Claudia encounters Noah in the forest, who kills her. Noah retrieves the missing pages and is dismayed by his findings. Egon unsuccessfully interviews Helge and visits an unresponsive Ulrich in jail. In 1987, Egon visits the older Ulrich at the asylum. Ulrich tells Egon his identity, which reminds Egon of claims Mikkel made when he first appeared in 1986. After interviewing Ines, Egon shows older Ulrich a photo of Mikkel. Ulrich attacks Egon and is restrained.

The younger Noah takes Jonas to the church, where he meets the older Noah, who escorts him to meet Adam, who reveals himself to be an elderly Jonas. In 2020, adult Jonas and Hannah meet Charlotte and Peter at the bunker and they discuss the existence of time travel, which they also reveal to a sceptical Katharina. The 1987 version of Claudia time travels to 2020 and heads to the public library, where she discovers Egon's death; she then travels back to 1987. A suspicious Clausen interviews Aleksander, who reveals his original surname \u2013 K\u00f6hler \u2013 before he married Regina. Martha, Magnus, Franziska and Elisabeth visit the cave, where they find Bartosz carrying the time machine. The kids take the time machine and leave Bartosz tied up in the cave. In 2053, Silja walks outside the Dead Zone, where she is confronted by the adult Elisabeth at gunpoint.

Adam tells Jonas about a \"loophole\" that will change the past, and shows him a God Particle that will take him to any time he wants. Jonas decides to go to the day before Michael kills himself to convince him not to do it. In 1987, Claudia invites Egon to move in with her in hopes of preventing his impending death. The imprisoned Ulrich escapes the psychiatric ward to visit Mikkel at the Kahnwald house. After a conversation, Mikkel realizes that the old man is actually his father. Ulrich tries to take Mikkel to the cave, but is apprehended by the police. Ines recovers Mikkel and Ulrich returns to the ward. In 2020, Katharina attempts to explain to Magnus and Martha what she discovered, but is rebuffed by her children for her distant behaviour. Katharina then approaches Hannah for help understanding time travel. Adult Jonas leaves Martha a necklace at the Nielsen's house and goes to the Doppler's house to help Charlotte, who explains that Tannhaus is not her real grandfather and that she never learned her parents' identities. Magnus, Martha, Franziska and Elisabeth return to the caves, where Bartosz explains the time machine before taking them to 1987.

After witnessing his 2019 self leaving the lake, 2020 Jonas shares an intimate moment with Martha. 2019 Jonas and Hannah arrive at the Nielsen family home on Ulrich and Katharina's anniversary, where Jonas has sex with Martha and Ulrich starts his affair with Hannah. 2020 Jonas reconciles with his father as he tries to convince him to not kill himself, except Michael claims he's not considering suicide and reveals that Jonas was the one who led young Mikkel into the portal in the first place. After reading his suicide note, Michael suggests that perhaps the real reason Jonas is there is to inform Michael of what he must do and what he must write. The elderly Claudia arrives at the house and convinces Jonas and Michael that Michael must die in 2019 as an adult and Mikkel must travel to the past as a child so that Jonas can be conceived, as his role in the cycle is greater than he believes. In 1921, two members of Sic Mundus \u2014 elder versions of Magnus and Franziska \u2014 share concerns with Adam.\n |LineColor       = #B5A269\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 17\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = The White Devil\n |AltTitle        = {{lang|de|Der wei\u00dfe Teufel}}\n |DirectedBy      = Baran bo Odar\n |WrittenBy       = Jantje Friese & Marc O.

They believe that perhaps she could have been the one who held Helge captive, but Helge says \"he\" told her about Claudia, the White Devil. Hannah travels to 1954, identifying herself as Katharina Nielsen and asking to see the imprisoned Ulrich at the asylum. She asks Ulrich to choose between her or Katharina; he insists he would leave Katharina for her if she helps him get out, but she does not believe him and coldly walks away. She tells Egon the man is not her husband. 1987: Claudia tries to prevent the death of her father. Egon wonders why Ulrich tried to get to the caves again, but Claudia insists there is nothing there. He realizes she knows about time travel and is selfishly using the caves for her own gain. They struggle for the telephone and he falls and hits his head. The dying Egon tells her she is the White Devil. After she returns to her own home, 2020 Jonas arrives, using a key the older Claudia had given him. He tells her they still may be able to change the events. 2020: Martha meets adult Jonas and is shocked to learn from Katharina that he is her nephew. Clausen confronts Aleksander about his background and informs him that in 1986 his own brother disappeared, and that his name was Aleksander K\u00f6hler.

Young Jonas and Claudia wander through the caves with the machine and Jonas explains to Claudia that her elder self taught him how to save the world, whereas Adam wants to destroy it. W\u00f6ller tells Charlotte that he helped Aleksander bury the radioactive waste in the power plant and she believes that Clausen entering the area will provoke the apocalypse. Noah reveals to Adam that he found the final pages and tries to kill Adam, but Adam shows a picture of Elisabeth who will become Noah's wife and therefore Charlotte's mother. Magnus, Franziska, and Agnes then pacify Noah and Agnes shoots him. Young Jonas and Claudia turn on the time machine in the caves, thus connecting the past and future. Young Noah visits elder Jonas in his 2020 house and gives him a letter from Martha. Young Jonas and Martha reunite, but are interrupted by Adam who shoots Martha. In the power plant, Clausen forces the opening of the radioactive waste drums which contain rocks soiled with dark matter. In 2053, Elisabeth turns on the machine, simultaneously as Magnus and Franziska do so in 1921. The dark matter in 2020 is then activated and begins to take on shape. As Katharina enters the cave and opens the Sic Mundus gate, the dark matter creates a portal connecting Elisabeth in 2053 to Charlotte in 2020. As the apocalypse ensues, Young Jonas is met by another version of Martha who turns on an alternate time machine and says that she is not from another time, but from another world. \n |LineColor       = #B5A269\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Netflix]] approved the series in February 2016 for a first season consisting of ten one-hour episodes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-confirms-first-german-series-869069 |title=Netflix Confirms First German Series 'Dark' From Baran bo Odar |first=Scott |last=Roxborough |date=24 February 2016 |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=24 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"MC\"/> Principal photography started on 18 October 2016 in and around Berlin<ref>Webb, Claire.

They are large mosques with several minarets. Fatih and S\u00fcleymaniye are typical examples. However, this definition does not exactly cover the concept. Beginning by the 17th century, most sultans preferred to stay in the capital rather than campaigning. Ahmet I (reigned 1603\u20131617), who was a non-campaigning sultan, commissioned the Blue Mosques, one of the greatest mosques which had 6 minarets.  This mosque is also considered a sel\u00e2tin mosque.\n\nMost of the mosques were commissioned by the sultans. But some mosques were commissioned by the other members of the dynasty; usually the mothers of sultans. \n\n== Notes

They are large mosques with several minarets. Fatih and S\u00fcleymaniye are typical examples. However, this definition does not exactly cover the concept. Beginning by the 17th century, most sultans preferred to stay in the capital rather than campaigning. Ahmet I (reigned 1603\u20131617), who was a non-campaigning sultan, commissioned the Blue Mosques, one of the greatest mosques which had 6 minarets.  This mosque is also considered a sel\u00e2tin mosque.\n\nMost of the mosques were commissioned by the sultans. But some mosques were commissioned by the other members of the dynasty; usually the mothers of sultans. \n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist|colwidth=40em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{ cite book | last=Necipo\u011flu | first=G\u00fclru | author-link=G\u00fclru Necipo\u011flu | year=2005 | title=The Age of Sinan: Architectural Culture in the Ottoman Empire | publisher=Reaktion Books | place=London | isbn=978-1-86189-253-9 | ref=harv }}\n\n{{Ottoman Empire topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mosques Commissioned By The Ottoman Dynasty}}\n[[Category:Ottoman mosques]]\n[[Category:Mosques in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Ottoman dynasty]]\n[[Category:Ottoman Empire-related lists]]\n[[Category:Turkey religion-related lists]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Bayezid II Mosque\u2192Bayezid II Mosque, Istanbul", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosques_commissioned_by_the_Ottoman_dynasty"}

According to the education policy of 1972, the government decided to upgrade the college to the level of University of Engineering & Technology after shifting it to Nawabshah. Consequently, the first year classes were started at Nawabshah in February, 1974.\n\nIn July 1976, this institution was declared as an additional campus of the University of Sindh through amendment in the Sindh University Act, 1972 and was headed by a Pro-Vice Chancellor. The additional campus was eventually upgraded to the level of University on 15th March, 1977 through an ordinance. Later-on, the Provincial Assembly of Sindh also passed an Act in this regard and named the institution as Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Nawabshah.\n\nIn 1980, the Government decided to shift Mehran University of Engineering and Technology to Jamshoro and the campus at Nawabshah was declared as a constituent college of Mehran University; renamed as Mehran University College of Engineering and Technology (MUCET), Nawabshah\". On 7th August 1996, MUCET was upgraded to the level of a university through an ordinance and later through an act of Sindh Assembly and was renamed as Quaid-e-Awam University of Engineering, Science and Technology (QUEST), Nawabshah. At present, QUEST is accredited with the Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and is the member of Association of Commonwealth Universities.\n\n==Academic departments==\n* Department of Mechanical Engineering\n* Department of Electrical Engineering\n* Department of Energy & Environment Engineering\n* Department of Electronic Engineering\n* Department of Civil Engineering\n* Department of Computer Systems Engineering\n* Department of Information Technology\n* Department of Computer Science\n* Department of Mathematics And Statistics\n* Department of Basic Sciences And Related Studies\n* Department of Chemical Engineering\n* Department of Telecommunication Engineering\n*Department of English (Language and Literature)\n\n==Academics==\n\n===Undergraduate program===\nThe system of education is the term system.

established in 1963 as a constituent college of the University of Sindh to provide adequate opportunity of engineering education to the people belonging to the interior of Sindh Province. According to the education policy of 1972, the government decided to upgrade the college to the level of University of Engineering & Technology after shifting it to Nawabshah. Consequently, the first year classes were started at Nawabshah in February, 1974.\n\nIn July 1976, this institution was declared as an additional campus of the University of Sindh through amendment in the Sindh University Act, 1972 and was headed by a Pro-Vice Chancellor. The additional campus was eventually upgraded to the level of University on 15th March, 1977 through an ordinance. Later-on, the Provincial Assembly of Sindh also passed an Act in this regard and named the institution as Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Nawabshah.\n\nIn 1980, the Government decided to shift Mehran University of Engineering and Technology to Jamshoro and the campus at Nawabshah was declared as a constituent college of Mehran University; renamed as Mehran University College of Engineering and Technology (MUCET), Nawabshah\". On 7th August 1996, MUCET was upgraded to the level of a university through an ordinance and later through an act of Sindh Assembly and was renamed as Quaid-e-Awam University of Engineering, Science and Technology (QUEST), Nawabshah. At present, QUEST is accredited with the Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and is the member of Association of Commonwealth Universities.\n\n==Academic departments==\n* Department of Mechanical Engineering\n* Department of Electrical Engineering\n* Department of Energy & Environment Engineering\n* Department of Electronic Engineering\n* Department of Civil Engineering\n* Department of Computer Systems Engineering\n* Department of Information Technology\n* Department of Computer Science\n* Department of Mathematics And Statistics\n* Department of Basic Sciences And Related Studies\n* Department of Chemical Engineering\n* Department of Telecommunication Engineering\n*Department of English (Language and Literature)\n\n==Academics==\n\n===Undergraduate program===\nThe system of education is the term system.

The [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]] - [[Saharanpur]] line passes through the city thus forming the backbone of the long-distance and best possible travel from the city. Indian Railways provides connections to [[New Delhi]],  Western Uttar Pradesh, [[Jammu & Kashmir]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], South India, and other parts of the country. [[Dehradun Shatabdi Express]] and [[Dehradun Jan Shatabdi Express]] trains pass through and halt at the [[Muzaffarnagar railway station|Muzaffarnagar station]]. The Meerut - Shaharanpur section of this railway route is now being developed as a part of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor. The corridor extends from [[Ludhiana]] in Punjab to Dankuni in West Bengal.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:National Highway 58 (India).png|thumb|alt= NH-58 passing through Muzaffarnagar|NH-58 passing through M.Nagar]]\nThe National Highway - 58 (NH-58) passes through Muzaffarnagar city. This highway provides connections towards Delhi on the southern direction and upper reaches of the Himalayas in the [[Uttarakhand]] state in the northern direction.

As a result, many roadside resorts and eateries have sprung up on the highway near the city. Especially, the town of [[Khatauli]] is famed for its canal side forest park named \"Cheetal\". Once visited for the sight of [[deer]] and [[rabbits]] and other wild animals, the Cheetal is now encroached by privately owned dhabas and resorts thus sidelining the animals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Notable People of Muzaffarnagar==\n{{famous|date=January 2017}}\n*[[Raj Roop Singh Verma]],Resident of village Lacchera, Who started The first newspaper \"DEHAT\" of Muzaffarnagar.
