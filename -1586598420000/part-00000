This effect has also been observed in other parrot species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Budden|first=A.E.|last2=Beissinger|first2=S.R.|date=14 January 2009|title=Resource allocation varies with parental sex and brood size in the asynchronously hatching green-rumped parrotlet (Forpus passerinus)|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=63|issue=5|pages=637\u2013647|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0698-x|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt4q20p58t/qt4q20p58t.pdf?t=l7nx9b}}</ref>\n\nResearch has shown that by planning asynchronous hatching, parent parrotlets don't have to spend as much time expending the high levels of energy associated with brooding, but the amount of energy expended does not change.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Siegel|first=R.B.|last2=Weathers|first2=W.W.|last3=Beissinger|first3=S.R.|date=May 1999|title=Hatching asynchrony reduces the duration, not the magnitude, of peak load in breeding green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus)|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=45|issue=6|pages=444\u2013450|doi=10.1007/s002650050583}}</ref> \n\nIt has been observed that over the course of mating and raising a brood of chicks, a female green-rumped parrotlet's mass varies greatly. Female individuals gained up to 25% more mass before laying and maintained this mass through incubation until hatching began. The amount of mass lost over the brooding and fledging periods was dependent on the size of the brood.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]].

Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

[[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

[[Frank A. Vanderlip|Frank]] and [[Narcissa Cox Vanderlip]] established the school in 1913 at their estate, [[Beechwood (Vanderlip mansion)|Beechwood]]. The school, a [[nonsectarian]] nonprofit college preparatory [[day school]], taught students at [[pre-kindergarten]] to [[twelfth grade]] levels and had small class sizes, with total enrollment rarely exceeding 150 students.<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|pages=46\u20137}} Since 1980, the buildings and property have been owned by The Clear View School,<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|158}} which runs a day treatment program for 83 students.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> The current school still uses the Scarborough School's theater, which was opened in 1917. The school campus is a contributing property to the [[Scarborough Historic District]].\n\nThe Scarborough Day School was accredited by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]] and the [[Board of Regents]] of the [[University of the State of New York]]. The school also was a member of the [[Cum Laude Society]] and the [[National Association of Independent Schools]].<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|page=47}} Its seal copies that of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]]; Scarborough-on-Hudson's namesake.<ref name=\"1952history\"/>{{rp|51}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Edward Harden Mansion, Sleepy Hollow, NY.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=A two-story brick house|The [[Edward Harden Mansion]]]]\n[[File:Marie Fayant Hall in Briarcliff Manor.tif|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=A rectangular two-story brick building|Marie Fayant Hall]]\n[[File:ScarboroughSchool1917-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=A white Neoclassical school building|Vanderlip Hall, 1917]]\nThe Scarborough School was founded in 1913 by [[Frank A. Vanderlip]] and [[Narcissa Cox Vanderlip]] for their six children and the children of friends and neighbors.<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|73}} Having met educator [[Maria Montessori]] during their European travels, the Vanderlips pioneered the [[Montessori method]] at the [[Edward Harden Mansion]] in nearby [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] by creating the first Montessori school in the United States, in 1913.<ref name=\"Montessori\"/> Frank Vanderlip's sister Ruth was married to Harden; the families maintained close ties. After a year existing in two rooms of the Harden residence, the school moved to the River Gate House at the north end of River Road and the Beechwood estate.<ref name=\"WestNRHP\"/>\n\nThe school moved to its final location in 1917, at Vanderlip Hall, a building Vanderlip constructed in 1916 bordering Albany Post Road (current [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]]). The building was designed for classes of ten, to accommodate 120 children total. It was situated on Beechwood's {{convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on}} parkland designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] for the Vanderlips. Throughout the school's history, students were open to wander the woodlands and gardens, utilize the lawns and tennis courts, and swim in the Olympic-sized pool. There were always farm animals nearby for the children to see and play with and a circus carousel to ride on. The school had a gymnasium class, amateur theater group, folk singing, a swimming pool, and an economic forum. Frank Vanderlip had spent about $500,000 on the school (${{Inflation|US|500000|1917|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}). Regular art exhibits were held at the Scarborough School, including a sculpture exhibition in the Italian garden at Beechwood, which included works by [[Jose de Creeft]], Jason Seley (a longtime professor of sculpture at [[Cornell]]), and [[Richard Stankiewicz]].<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|151}}\n\nEarly on in the school's history, the Vanderlips decided to change the school's system from the Montessori method to a more formal approach with more discipline, although students still had more freedom than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: students were not graded and were instructed to work at their own speed. As enrollment grew, another building was built for younger children, which burnt down in 1959. In addition, a lunchroom, shop, and studio were built early in the school's history. Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school; he would act out [[Swiss Family Robinson]] on an imaginary island with students to demonstrate the development of capitalism. Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom, and it is recorded that she served good simple food. She named some of her foods artistically (rice pudding with raisins was called ''B\u00eate Noire a la Bolshevik'').<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|93}}\n\nMembers of the Vanderlip family, particularly Virginia Vanderlip Schoales, continued to administer the school for sixty years. A 1959 development plan made way for a new primary school in 1961, new science facilities in 1962, expansion of the library in 1963, and the creation of an organization for alumni, of whom there were more than a thousand living in 1977.<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|page=47}} The school was unable to obtain sufficient funding and closed in 1978. In 1980, the buildings and property were taken over by The Clear View School, which opened in September 1981 after major renovations.<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|158}} The school runs a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21,<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> and is sponsored by the Association for Mentally Ill Children of Westchester; its program involves education, treatment, and crisis intervention and parent involvement.<ref name=\"NYTimes2\"/>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Seal of Scarborough.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Seal of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]]; the school's seal replicates it]]\nThe main Scarborough School building, Vanderlip Hall, was designed by [[William W. Bosworth]], known for landscaping [[Kykuit]] and restoring [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. The school building was constructed in a severe, all-white [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style, and was completed early in 1917.<ref name=\"WestNRHP\"/> In addition to a grand [[portico]]ed entry, there were two wings that housed classes, a library, cafeteria and gymnasium, basement science labs, and an art room measuring {{convert|1000|sqft|m2}}, ringed on three sides with French windows.<ref name=\"WestNRHP\"/> In the 1960s, an additional [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] structure was built across a stream that would ultimately house the school's lower grades.\n\n[[Scarborough Historic District#Rosemont|Rosemont]], an estate and the birthplace of [[John Worden]], was later used by Vanderlip as a dormitory for Scarborough School boarding students. Rosemont stood opposite the Beechwood estate, at the corner of Route 9 and Scarborough Road. Another campus building was Marie Fayant Hall, which was originally Barnesby House, home to Dr. Percy Norman Barnesby. Vanderlip built the house for him and his wife; the house was later given to the Scarborough School and served as a girls' dormitory in the 1940s and as a headmaster's residence about thirty years later.<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|94}}\n\n===Theater===\n[[File:ScarboroughSchool5.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A theater with a yellow curtain|The Julie Harris Theater]]\nBeechwood Theater, a replica of the [[Helen Hayes Theatre|Little Theater]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], was included in Wells Bosworth's design of the primary school building because Vanderlip particularly wanted his own theater. Beechwood Theater, with 256 gold velvet seats, was designed by [[Winthrop Ames]] around 1917.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Details were closely examined upon construction; the lighting equipment, the scene lofts and fly gallery, and the dressing rooms were well-designed and state-of-the-art. The stage floor was designed especially for dancing, and the acoustics and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible.<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|96}}\n\nThe theater was used for assemblies, plays, concerts, and lectures. It was also home to the Beechwood Players, an adult performing arts group which had its origins in 1919.<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|page=47}} The Players put on several plays a year, summer and winter, six plays a year and three-night runs. They had started with three one-act plays but had graduated to full-length dramas. From its first years, Broadway actors used the theater when not otherwise engaged. Among them were [[Sylvia Sidney]], [[Laurette Taylor]], [[Lynn Fontanne]], [[James Dean]], [[Judson Laire]], and [[Parker Fennelly]]. Lecturers and performers in the Beechwood Theater included [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Robert Frost]], [[John Masefield]], [[Vachel Lindsay]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t]], and a [[King of Siam]].<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|96}} Other notable appearances at the theater included [[Charles Coburn]] and [[Isadora Duncan]]. Audiences have included [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], [[Henry Ford]] and the last [[King of Poland]].<ref name=\"Theater\"/>\n\nThe theater was opened and dedicated on January 2, 1917. The first concert took place on July 30, 1916, and was by [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]]. During his performance, the [[Black Tom explosion]] took place at a munitions works in New Jersey, more than {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Scarborough. Frank Vanderlip Jr., ten years old at the time, later recalled that he saw the detonation shake the jammed theater building, and that Paderewski had played on as if nothing had happened. The automatic fire doors at the top of the theater had sprung open, and two men were sent aloft to sit on them until the end of the performance to prevent a cold draft from entering the room.<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|96}}\n\nFollowing the Scarborough School's closing, the Beechwood Theater had stood empty for many years, and was restored in 1983 by the Greater Ossining Area Community Theater. On March 17, 1984, The Clear View School presented a solo performance of ''Currier Bell, Esquire'' (a dramatization of [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s life) performed by [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]].<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|160}} The performance was a $100-a-ticket benefit for the school.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Also on that day, the theater was rededicated as the Julie Harris Theater.

[[Frank A. Vanderlip|Frank]] and [[Narcissa Cox Vanderlip]] established the school in 1913 at their estate, [[Beechwood (Vanderlip mansion)|Beechwood]]. The school, a [[nonsectarian]] nonprofit college preparatory [[day school]], taught students at [[pre-kindergarten]] to [[twelfth grade]] levels and had small class sizes, with total enrollment rarely exceeding 150 students.<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|pages=46\u20137}} Since 1980, the buildings and property have been owned by The Clear View School,<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|158}} which runs a day treatment program for 83 students.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> The current school still uses the Scarborough School's theater, which was opened in 1917. The school campus is a contributing property to the [[Scarborough Historic District]].\n\nThe Scarborough Day School was accredited by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]] and the [[Board of Regents]] of the [[University of the State of New York]]. The school also was a member of the [[Cum Laude Society]] and the [[National Association of Independent Schools]].<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|page=47}} Its seal copies that of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]]; Scarborough-on-Hudson's namesake.<ref name=\"1952history\"/>{{rp|51}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Edward Harden Mansion, Sleepy Hollow, NY.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=A two-story brick house|The [[Edward Harden Mansion]]]]\n[[File:Marie Fayant Hall in Briarcliff Manor.tif|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=A rectangular two-story brick building|Marie Fayant Hall]]\n[[File:ScarboroughSchool1917-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=A white Neoclassical school building|Vanderlip Hall, 1917]]\nThe Scarborough School was founded in 1913 by [[Frank A. Vanderlip]] and [[Narcissa Cox Vanderlip]] for their six children and the children of friends and neighbors.<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|73}} Having met educator [[Maria Montessori]] during their European travels, the Vanderlips pioneered the [[Montessori method]] at the [[Edward Harden Mansion]] in nearby [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] by creating the first Montessori school in the United States, in 1913.<ref name=\"Montessori\"/> Frank Vanderlip's sister Ruth was married to Harden; the families maintained close ties. After a year existing in two rooms of the Harden residence, the school moved to the River Gate House at the north end of River Road and the Beechwood estate.<ref name=\"WestNRHP\"/>\n\nThe school moved to its final location in 1917, at Vanderlip Hall, a building Vanderlip constructed in 1916 bordering Albany Post Road (current [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]]). The building was designed for classes of ten, to accommodate 120 children total. It was situated on Beechwood's {{convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on}} parkland designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] for the Vanderlips. Throughout the school's history, students were open to wander the woodlands and gardens, utilize the lawns and tennis courts, and swim in the Olympic-sized pool. There were always farm animals nearby for the children to see and play with and a circus carousel to ride on. The school had a gymnasium class, amateur theater group, folk singing, a swimming pool, and an economic forum. Frank Vanderlip had spent about $500,000 on the school (${{Inflation|US|500000|1917|r=-2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}). Regular art exhibits were held at the Scarborough School, including a sculpture exhibition in the Italian garden at Beechwood, which included works by [[Jose de Creeft]], Jason Seley (a longtime professor of sculpture at [[Cornell]]), and [[Richard Stankiewicz]].<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|151}}\n\nEarly on in the school's history, the Vanderlips decided to change the school's system from the Montessori method to a more formal approach with more discipline, although students still had more freedom than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: students were not graded and were instructed to work at their own speed. As enrollment grew, another building was built for younger children, which burnt down in 1959. In addition, a lunchroom, shop, and studio were built early in the school's history. Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school; he would act out [[Swiss Family Robinson]] on an imaginary island with students to demonstrate the development of capitalism. Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom, and it is recorded that she served good simple food. She named some of her foods artistically (rice pudding with raisins was called ''B\u00eate Noire a la Bolshevik'').<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|93}}\n\nMembers of the Vanderlip family, particularly Virginia Vanderlip Schoales, continued to administer the school for sixty years. A 1959 development plan made way for a new primary school in 1961, new science facilities in 1962, expansion of the library in 1963, and the creation of an organization for alumni, of whom there were more than a thousand living in 1977.<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|page=47}} The school was unable to obtain sufficient funding and closed in 1978.

Bosworth]], known for landscaping [[Kykuit]] and restoring [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. The school building was constructed in a severe, all-white [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style, and was completed early in 1917.<ref name=\"WestNRHP\"/> In addition to a grand [[portico]]ed entry, there were two wings that housed classes, a library, cafeteria and gymnasium, basement science labs, and an art room measuring {{convert|1000|sqft|m2}}, ringed on three sides with French windows.<ref name=\"WestNRHP\"/> In the 1960s, an additional [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] structure was built across a stream that would ultimately house the school's lower grades.\n\n[[Scarborough Historic District#Rosemont|Rosemont]], an estate and the birthplace of [[John Worden]], was later used by Vanderlip as a dormitory for Scarborough School boarding students. Rosemont stood opposite the Beechwood estate, at the corner of Route 9 and Scarborough Road. Another campus building was Marie Fayant Hall, which was originally Barnesby House, home to Dr. Percy Norman Barnesby. Vanderlip built the house for him and his wife; the house was later given to the Scarborough School and served as a girls' dormitory in the 1940s and as a headmaster's residence about thirty years later.<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|94}}\n\n===Theater===\n[[File:ScarboroughSchool5.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A theater with a yellow curtain|The Julie Harris Theater]]\nBeechwood Theater, a replica of the [[Helen Hayes Theatre|Little Theater]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], was included in Wells Bosworth's design of the primary school building because Vanderlip particularly wanted his own theater. Beechwood Theater, with 256 gold velvet seats, was designed by [[Winthrop Ames]] around 1917.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Details were closely examined upon construction; the lighting equipment, the scene lofts and fly gallery, and the dressing rooms were well-designed and state-of-the-art. The stage floor was designed especially for dancing, and the acoustics and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible.<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|96}}\n\nThe theater was used for assemblies, plays, concerts, and lectures. It was also home to the Beechwood Players, an adult performing arts group which had its origins in 1919.<ref name=\"1977history\"/>{{rp|page=47}} The Players put on several plays a year, summer and winter, six plays a year and three-night runs. They had started with three one-act plays but had graduated to full-length dramas. From its first years, Broadway actors used the theater when not otherwise engaged. Among them were [[Sylvia Sidney]], [[Laurette Taylor]], [[Lynn Fontanne]], [[James Dean]], [[Judson Laire]], and [[Parker Fennelly]]. Lecturers and performers in the Beechwood Theater included [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Robert Frost]], [[John Masefield]], [[Vachel Lindsay]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t]], and a [[King of Siam]].<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|96}} Other notable appearances at the theater included [[Charles Coburn]] and [[Isadora Duncan]]. Audiences have included [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], [[Henry Ford]] and the last [[King of Poland]].<ref name=\"Theater\"/>\n\nThe theater was opened and dedicated on January 2, 1917. The first concert took place on July 30, 1916, and was by [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]]. During his performance, the [[Black Tom explosion]] took place at a munitions works in New Jersey, more than {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Scarborough. Frank Vanderlip Jr., ten years old at the time, later recalled that he saw the detonation shake the jammed theater building, and that Paderewski had played on as if nothing had happened. The automatic fire doors at the top of the theater had sprung open, and two men were sent aloft to sit on them until the end of the performance to prevent a cold draft from entering the room.<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|96}}\n\nFollowing the Scarborough School's closing, the Beechwood Theater had stood empty for many years, and was restored in 1983 by the Greater Ossining Area Community Theater. On March 17, 1984, The Clear View School presented a solo performance of ''Currier Bell, Esquire'' (a dramatization of [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s life) performed by [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]].<ref name=\"Landscape\"/>{{rp|160}} The performance was a $100-a-ticket benefit for the school.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Also on that day, the theater was rededicated as the Julie Harris Theater.

It was established as a separate university on 29 July 1990, the 400th anniversary of the start of the reign of Phitsanulok-born King [[Naresuan]] the Great. A courtyard with a statue of King Naresuan is on the campus grounds and students regularly pay their respects before it. The university has about 20,000 full-time students.\n\n==History==\nOn 18 January 1964, the Ministry of Education resolved to create branches of the Bangkok's College of Education in each region of the country. On 25 January 1967, the Phitsanulok campus was established as the fourth branch of the College of Education and was meant to serve mainly the northern provinces.\n\nIn 1974 the College of Education was upgraded to university status and was named [[Srinakharinwirot University]]. Originally, only the third and fourth years of university study were offered at Phitsanulok, and students were admitted by competitive examination after completing the curriculum at one of the nation's associate degree level teacher training colleges. In 1976, the first and second years were added. Other majors besides education were gradually included, and in 1990 the Phitsanulok campus became independent of Srinakarinwirot University. It was designated \"Naresuan University\" during the celebrations of the 400th anniversary of King Naresuan the Great's ascension to the throne.\n\n[[Image:KingNU.jpg|200px|thumb|right| King Naresuan the Great statue, Naresuan University]]\n\nNaresuan University has a second campus in [[Phayao]], which opened in 1999 and was upgraded to university level and named \"[[University of Phayao]]\" in 2010. It also offers extension courses across the country at nine education centers, including [[Bangkok]].\n\n==Ranking==\nIn September 2006, Naresuan University was ranked as \"Very Good\" in a study conducted on Thai universities by the Commission on Higher Education and 5th in the uniRank 2017 Thai University Ranking.\n\n==Faculties==\nThe university has 16 [[Faculty (division)|faculties]],

It was established as a separate university on 29 July 1990, the 400th anniversary of the start of the reign of Phitsanulok-born King [[Naresuan]] the Great. A courtyard with a statue of King Naresuan is on the campus grounds and students regularly pay their respects before it. The university has about 20,000 full-time students.\n\n==History==\nOn 18 January 1964, the Ministry of Education resolved to create branches of the Bangkok's College of Education in each region of the country. On 25 January 1967, the Phitsanulok campus was established as the fourth branch of the College of Education and was meant to serve mainly the northern provinces.\n\nIn 1974 the College of Education was upgraded to university status and was named [[Srinakharinwirot University]]. Originally, only the third and fourth years of university study were offered at Phitsanulok, and students were admitted by competitive examination after completing the curriculum at one of the nation's associate degree level teacher training colleges. In 1976, the first and second years were added. Other majors besides education were gradually included, and in 1990 the Phitsanulok campus became independent of Srinakarinwirot University. It was designated \"Naresuan University\" during the celebrations of the 400th anniversary of King Naresuan the Great's ascension to the throne.\n\n[[Image:KingNU.jpg|200px|thumb|right| King Naresuan the Great statue, Naresuan University]]\n\nNaresuan University has a second campus in [[Phayao]], which opened in 1999 and was upgraded to university level and named \"[[University of Phayao]]\" in 2010. It also offers extension courses across the country at nine education centers, including [[Bangkok]].\n\n==Ranking==\nIn September 2006, Naresuan University was ranked as \"Very Good\" in a study conducted on Thai universities by the Commission on Higher Education and 5th in the uniRank 2017 Thai University Ranking.\n\n==Faculties==\nThe university has 16 [[Faculty (division)|faculties]],

It is also commonly referred to as the '''Australian Government''', the '''Commonwealth Government''', or the '''Federal Government'''.\n\nThe legislature, also known as the Parliament of Australia, or simply Parliament, is made up of democratically-elected representatives from around Australia.\n\nThese representatives meet at Parliament House in Canberra to discuss legislation and make laws for the benefit of the nation. The issues that they can make laws on are defined by sections 51 and 122 of the Constitution.\n\nThe Parliament of the Commonwealth comprises two separate chambers:\nthe House of Representatives (or 'the lower house') and the Senate (or 'the upper house'). The lower House is green and the senate is red. This 2 house system is called the bicameral system meaning 2 houses.\n\nThe House of Representatives has 151 members, each representing a different area of the country ('electorate'). Each electorate has roughly the same number of registered voters within its boundary, meaning that states with larger populations have more electorates and therefore more representatives in the House.\n\nThe Senate is composed of 76 members. Unlike the House of Representatives, membership of the Senate is divided evenly between the states. Each state has 12 senators, and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have 2 senators each. The Senate was established this way to ensure that the larger states could not use their majority in the House of Representatives to pass laws that disadvantaged the smaller states.\n\nThe Constitution is silent on the role of political parties in Parliament. It does not make any reference to a government party, an opposition party or minor parties, or to roles like Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition. These are conventions that have been adopted to assist the smooth operation of the legislature.\n\nThe executive is the administrative arm of government. The Australian Government is formed by the party or coalition of parties with the support of a majority of members in the House of Representatives.\n\nA government minister is a member of the legislature who has been chosen to also work as part of the executive, usually with responsibility for matters on a specific topic (his/her portfolio). The main roles of the Government are to make important national decisions, develop policy, introduce bills (proposed laws), implement laws and manage government departments.\n\nThe public service, working in departments and agencies, puts those laws into operation and upholds those laws once they have begun to operate. Canberra, located in the Australian Capital Territory, is Australia's national capital. The Parliament of Australia is located in Canberra, as is most of the Australian Government public service.\n\nThe judiciary is the legal arm of the government. Independent of the legislature and the executive, it is the role of the judiciary to enforce Australia's laws. It must also ensure that the other arms of government do not act beyond the powers granted to them by the Constitution or by Parliament.\n\nThe High Court of Australia is, as its name suggests, Australia's highest court. Underneath the High Court are a number of other federal courts. The [[Commonwealth]] of Australia was formed in 1901 as a result of an agreement among six self-governing [[British Empire|British colonies]], which became the six states. The terms of this contract are embodied in the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], which was drawn up at a [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Convention]] and ratified by the people of the colonies at [[referendum]]s. The Australian [[head of state]] is the [[Queen of Australia]] who is represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia]],<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| last=House of Representatives| title=The Australian System of Government| page=3| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=10 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312124621/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| archivedate=12 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |website =Parliamentary Education Office |title=History and Culture: Quick Answers |publisher =Australian Government Publishing Service |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313181036/https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |archivedate=13 March 2018 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/protocol/protocol_guidelines/15.html| last=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade| authorlink=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)| title=Protocol > Protocol guidelines > The Australian Government| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| last=Australian Public Service Commission| authorlink=Australian Public Service Commission| title=About the Commission > The Australian experience of public sector reform > The Constitutional and Government framework| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313221139/http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| archivedate=13 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenship.gov.au/learn/cit_test/_pdf/australian-citizenship-aug2012.pdf|title=Australian Citizenship \u2013 Our Common Bond|publisher=Department of Immigration and Citizenship|date=August 2012}}</ref> with executive powers delegated by [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional convention]] to the Australian [[head of government]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]].\n\nThe Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is divided into three branches: the executive branch, composed of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], presided by the Governor-General, which delegates powers to the [[Cabinet of Australia]], led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]; the [[Legislature|legislative]] branch, composed of the [[Parliament of Australia]]'s [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate (Australia)|Senate]]; and the [[Judiciary|judicial]] branch, composed of the [[High Court of Australia]] and the [[Australian court hierarchy|federal courts]]. [[Separation of powers]] is implied by the structure of the Constitution, the three branches of government being set out in separate chapters (chapters I to III).The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the [[Westminster system|United Kingdom]] ([[Fusion of powers|fused executive]], [[constitutional monarchy]]) and the [[United States Government|United States]] ([[federalism]], [[written constitution]], elected upper house), along with distinctive indigenous features, and has therefore been characterised as a \"Washminster mutation\".<ref>{{cite article|last=Thompson|first=Elaine|title=The \"Washminster\" Mutation|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|year=1980|volume=15|page=32}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n{{Images of branches of Australian Government}}\n\nSection 1 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] creates a democratic legislature, the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of Australia]] which consists of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], and two houses of parliament, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]]. [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51]] of the Constitution provides for the Commonwealth Government's legislative powers and allocates certain powers and responsibilities (known as \"heads of power\") to the Commonwealth government. All remaining responsibilities are retained by the six [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|States]] (previously separate colonies). Further, each State has its own constitution, so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments, none of which can encroach on the functions of any other. The [[High Court of Australia]] arbitrates on any disputes which arise between the Commonwealth and the States, or among the States, concerning their respective functions.\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament can propose changes to the Constitution. To become effective, the proposals must be put to a [[referendum]] of all Australians of voting age, and must receive a \"double majority\": a majority of all votes, and a majority of votes in a majority of States.\n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution also provides that the States can agree to refer any of their powers to the Commonwealth. This may be achieved by way of an amendment to the Constitution via referendum (a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the States to the Commonwealth, or vice versa, should be implemented). More commonly powers may be transferred by passing other acts of legislation which authorise the transfer and such acts require the legislative agreement of all the state governments involved. This \"transfer\" legislation may have a \"sunset clause\", a legislative provision that nullifies the transfer of power after a specified period, at which point the original division of power is restored.\n\nIn addition, Australia has several \"territories\", two of which are self-governing:  the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] (NT).  These territories' legislatures, their Assemblies, exercise powers devolved to them by the Commonwealth;  the Commonwealth Parliament remains able to override their legislation and to alter their powers.  Australian citizens in these territories are represented by members of both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.  The territory of [[Norfolk Island]] was self-governing from 1979 until 2016, although it was never  represented as such in the Commonwealth Parliament.  The other territories that are regularly inhabited{{mdash}}[[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]], [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]{{mdash}}have never been self-governing.\n\nThe federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the [[Parliament of Australia]] were the subject of protracted negotiations among the colonies during the drafting of the Constitution. The [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is elected on a basis that reflects the differing populations of the States. Thus [[New South Wales]] has 48 members while [[Tasmania]] has only five.  But the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] is elected on a basis of equality among the States: all States elect 12 Senators, regardless of population. This was intended to allow the Senators of the smaller States to form a majority and thus be able to amend or reject bills originating in the House of Representatives. The ACT and the NT each elect two Senators.\n\nThe third level of government after Commonwealth and State/Territory is [[Local government in Australia|Local government]], in the form of [[shire]]s, towns and cities. The Councils of these areas are composed of elected representatives (known as either [[councillor]] or [[alderman]], depending on the State), usually serving part-time.  Their powers are devolved to them by the State or Territory in which they are located.\n\nGovernment at the Commonwealth level and the State/Territory level is undertaken by three inter-connected arms of government:\n\n* Legislature: The [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]]\n* Executive: The Sovereign of Australia, whose executive power is exercisable by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, Ministers and their Departments\n* Judiciary: The [[High Court of Australia]] and subsidiary Federal courts.\n\n''[[Separation of powers]]'' is the principle whereby the three arms of government undertake their activities largely separately from each other:\n\n* the Legislature proposes laws in the form of Bills, and provides a legislative framework for the operations of the other two arms;  the sovereign is formally a part of the Parliament, but takes no active role in these matters, except that (representing the sovereign) Governors-General, State Governors and Territory Administrators sign enactments into law through providing Royal Assent\n* the Executive administers the laws and carries out the tasks assigned to it by legislation\n* the Judiciary hears cases arising from the administration of the law, applying both [[statute law]] and the [[common law]];  the Australian courts cannot give an [[advisory opinions|advisory opinion]] on the constitutionality of a law, but the [[High Court of Australia]] can determine whether an existing law is constitutional\n* the Judiciary is appointed by the sovereign's representatives, on the advice of the Commonwealth  or State/Territory government;  but the Legislature and the Executive should  not try to influence its decisions.\n\n==Legislature==\n{{main|Parliament of Australia}}\n[[File:Australian Senate - Parliament of Australia.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]] chamber]]\n[[File:Australian House of Representatives - Parliament of Australia.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Australian House of Representatives]] chamber]]\nThe Legislature makes the laws, and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws when appropriate. The [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of the [[Queen of Australia]], a 76-member [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a 151-member [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\n\nTwelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms, using [[proportional representation]] and the [[single transferable vote]] (known in Australia as \"quota-preferential voting\": see [[Australian electoral system]]), with half elected every three years. In addition to the state Senators, two senators are elected by voters from the [[Northern Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the Indian Ocean Territories, [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]), while another two senators are elected by the voters of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the [[Jervis Bay Territory]]). Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting, but their term of office is not fixed;  it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends on the day before the next such election.\n\nThe members of the House of Representatives are elected by majority-preferential<ref>{{cite web |url=https://researchers.anu.edu.au/publications/4497 |title=Australia: Replacing Plurality Rule with Majority-Preferential Voting |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.}}</ref> voting using the non-proportional [[Instant-runoff voting]] system<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/closer-look/short-history/the-first-parliament.html |title=The first Parliament: Developments in the Parliament of Australia |publisher=Parliamentary Education Office of the Government of Australia}}</ref> from single-member constituencies allocated among the states and territories.  In ordinary legislation, the two chambers have co-ordinate powers, but all proposals for appropriating revenue or imposing taxes must be introduced in the House of Representatives. Under the prevailing [[Westminster system]], the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is invited to form a government and is named [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].\n\nThe Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament, of which they must, in most circumstances, be members. General elections are held at least once every three years. The Prime Minister has a discretion to advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the Constitution. The most recent general election was on [[2019 Australian federal election|18 May 2019]].\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures operate within the conventions of the [[Westminster system]], with a recognised [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|Leader of the Opposition]], usually the leader of the largest party outside the government, and a [[Shadow Cabinet]] of Opposition members who \"shadow\" each member of the Ministry, asking questions on matters within the Minister's portfolio. Although the Government, by virtue of commanding a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature, can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house, the Opposition can considerably delay the passage of legislation and obstruct government business if it chooses.\n\nThe day-to-day business of the [[House of Representatives of Australia|House of Representatives]] is usually negotiated between the [[Leader of the House (Australia)|Leader of the House]], appointed by the Prime Minister, and the [[Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Australia)|Manager of Opposition Business in the House]], appointed by the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the Commonwealth parliament, currently [[Anthony Albanese]].\n\n==Executive==\n\n===Head of state===\n{{main|Monarchy of Australia | Governor-General of Australia}}\n\nThe [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] dates from 1901, when the [[British Dominions|Dominions]] of the [[British Empire]] were not sovereign states, and does not use the term \"head of state\". As Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], government and academic sources describe the Queen as head of state.<ref>The Constitution (2012) Overview by the Attorney-General's Department and Australian Government Solicitor [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005Q00193]</ref> In practice, the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people, the [[Queen of Australia]] and the [[Governor-General of Australia]], who is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen's representative, and exercises various constitutional powers in her name, they independently exercise many important powers in their own right. The governor-general represents Australia internationally, making and receiving state visits.<ref>{{cite web | title = Governor-General's Role | publisher = Office of the Governor-General | date = 20 July 2015 | url = http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role | accessdate = 1 March 2015 }}</ref>\n[[File:Government House Canberra.JPG|thumb|left|[[Government House, Canberra]]]]\nThe [[Monarch|Sovereign]] of Australia, currently [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], is also the Sovereign of fifteen other [[Commonwealth realm]]s including the United Kingdom. Like the other [[British Dominions|Dominions]], Australia gained legislative independence from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by virtue of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which was adopted in Australia in 1942 with retrospective effect from 3 September 1939. By the [[Royal Style and Titles Act 1953]], the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title [[Queen of Australia]], and in 1973 titles with any reference to her status as [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] and [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] as well were removed, making her Queen of Australia.\n\nSection 61 of the Constitution provides that 'The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor\u2011General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth'. Section 2 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provides that a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] shall represent the Queen in Australia. In practice, the Governor-General carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state, without reference to the Queen.\n\nUnder the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] the Governor-General's powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. The Governor-General retains [[reserve powers]] similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom. These are rarely exercised, but during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]] used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister.\n\nAustralia has periodically experienced movements seeking to end the monarchy. In a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]], the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution. The proposal would have removed references to the [[Queen of Australia|Queen]] from the Constitution and replaced the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] with a President nominated by the Prime Minister, but subject to the approval of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament. The proposal was defeated. The [[Australian Republican Movement]] continues to campaign for an end to the monarchy in Australia, opposed by [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]] and [[Australian Monarchist League]].\n\n{{further|Constitutional history of Australia|Australian republicanism|Australian head of state dispute}}\n\n===Executive Council===\n{{main|Federal Executive Council (Australia)}}\nThe Federal Executive Council is a formal body which exists and meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions. All Ministers are members of the Executive Council and are entitled to be styled \"[[The Honourable]]\", a title which they retain for life. The [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] usually presides at Council meetings, but in his or her absence another Minister nominated as the [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]] presides at the meeting of the Council. Since 20 December 2017, the Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council has been Senator [[Mathias Cormann]].\n\nThere are times when the government acts in a [[Caretaker government of Australia|\"caretaker\" capacity]], principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{main|Cabinet of Australia|List of Australian Ministers}}\n\nThe Cabinet of Australia is the council of senior Ministers of the Crown, responsible to the Federal Parliament. The ministers are appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, who serve at the former's pleasure. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. Outside the cabinet there is an outer ministry and also a number of junior ministers, called Parliamentary secretaries, responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister.\n\nThe Constitution of Australia does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], which is Australia's highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the Governor-General is nominal presiding officer, he almost never attends Executive Council meetings. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor-General.\n\nUntil 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 [[Robert Menzies]] created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers holding Cabinet rank, also known within parliament as the [[front bench]]. This practice has been continued by all governments except the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Government.\n\nWhen the non-Labor parties are in power, the Prime Minister makes all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at their own discretion, although in practice they consult with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and its predecessors (the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and the [[United Australia Party]]) have been in coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] or its predecessor the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate their party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the Prime Minister on the allocation of their portfolios.\n\nWhen the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] first held office under [[Chris Watson]], Watson assumed the right to choose members of his Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the [[Caucus]], and the Prime Minister would retain the right to allocate portfolios. This practice was followed until 2007. Between 1907 and 2007, Labor Prime Ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence. Prior to the [[2007 Australian general election|2007 general election]], the then Leader of the Opposition, [[Kevin Rudd]], said that he and he alone would choose the ministry should he become Prime Minister. His party won the election and he chose the ministry, as he said he would.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/29/2046939.htm |title=Rudd seizes power from factions |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 September 2007 |first=Ben |last=Worsley}}</ref>\n\nThe cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in state capitals, most frequently Sydney and Melbourne.

It is also commonly referred to as the '''Australian Government''', the '''Commonwealth Government''', or the '''Federal Government'''.\n\nThe legislature, also known as the Parliament of Australia, or simply Parliament, is made up of democratically-elected representatives from around Australia.\n\nThese representatives meet at Parliament House in Canberra to discuss legislation and make laws for the benefit of the nation. The issues that they can make laws on are defined by sections 51 and 122 of the Constitution.\n\nThe Parliament of the Commonwealth comprises two separate chambers:\nthe House of Representatives (or 'the lower house') and the Senate (or 'the upper house'). The lower House is green and the senate is red. This 2 house system is called the bicameral system meaning 2 houses.\n\nThe House of Representatives has 151 members, each representing a different area of the country ('electorate'). Each electorate has roughly the same number of registered voters within its boundary, meaning that states with larger populations have more electorates and therefore more representatives in the House.\n\nThe Senate is composed of 76 members. Unlike the House of Representatives, membership of the Senate is divided evenly between the states. Each state has 12 senators, and the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have 2 senators each. The Senate was established this way to ensure that the larger states could not use their majority in the House of Representatives to pass laws that disadvantaged the smaller states.\n\nThe Constitution is silent on the role of political parties in Parliament. It does not make any reference to a government party, an opposition party or minor parties, or to roles like Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition. These are conventions that have been adopted to assist the smooth operation of the legislature.\n\nThe executive is the administrative arm of government. The Australian Government is formed by the party or coalition of parties with the support of a majority of members in the House of Representatives.\n\nA government minister is a member of the legislature who has been chosen to also work as part of the executive, usually with responsibility for matters on a specific topic (his/her portfolio). The main roles of the Government are to make important national decisions, develop policy, introduce bills (proposed laws), implement laws and manage government departments.\n\nThe public service, working in departments and agencies, puts those laws into operation and upholds those laws once they have begun to operate. Canberra, located in the Australian Capital Territory, is Australia's national capital. The Parliament of Australia is located in Canberra, as is most of the Australian Government public service.\n\nThe judiciary is the legal arm of the government. Independent of the legislature and the executive, it is the role of the judiciary to enforce Australia's laws. It must also ensure that the other arms of government do not act beyond the powers granted to them by the Constitution or by Parliament.\n\nThe High Court of Australia is, as its name suggests, Australia's highest court. Underneath the High Court are a number of other federal courts. The [[Commonwealth]] of Australia was formed in 1901 as a result of an agreement among six self-governing [[British Empire|British colonies]], which became the six states. The terms of this contract are embodied in the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], which was drawn up at a [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Constitutional Convention]] and ratified by the people of the colonies at [[referendum]]s. The Australian [[head of state]] is the [[Queen of Australia]] who is represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia]],<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| last=House of Representatives| title=The Australian System of Government| page=3| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=10 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312124621/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/info/infosheets/is20.pdf| archivedate=12 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |website =Parliamentary Education Office |title=History and Culture: Quick Answers |publisher =Australian Government Publishing Service |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313181036/https://www.peo.gov.au/quick-answers/history-and-culture.html |archivedate=13 March 2018 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/protocol/protocol_guidelines/15.html| last=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade| authorlink=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)| title=Protocol > Protocol guidelines > The Australian Government| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| last=Australian Public Service Commission| authorlink=Australian Public Service Commission| title=About the Commission > The Australian experience of public sector reform > The Constitutional and Government framework| publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service| accessdate=14 March 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313221139/http://www.apsc.gov.au/about/exppsreform3.htm| archivedate=13 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenship.gov.au/learn/cit_test/_pdf/australian-citizenship-aug2012.pdf|title=Australian Citizenship \u2013 Our Common Bond|publisher=Department of Immigration and Citizenship|date=August 2012}}</ref> with executive powers delegated by [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional convention]] to the Australian [[head of government]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]].\n\nThe Government of the Commonwealth of Australia is divided into three branches: the executive branch, composed of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], presided by the Governor-General, which delegates powers to the [[Cabinet of Australia]], led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]; the [[Legislature|legislative]] branch, composed of the [[Parliament of Australia]]'s [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate (Australia)|Senate]]; and the [[Judiciary|judicial]] branch, composed of the [[High Court of Australia]] and the [[Australian court hierarchy|federal courts]].

Further, each State has its own constitution, so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments, none of which can encroach on the functions of any other. The [[High Court of Australia]] arbitrates on any disputes which arise between the Commonwealth and the States, or among the States, concerning their respective functions.\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament can propose changes to the Constitution. To become effective, the proposals must be put to a [[referendum]] of all Australians of voting age, and must receive a \"double majority\": a majority of all votes, and a majority of votes in a majority of States.\n\nThe Commonwealth Constitution also provides that the States can agree to refer any of their powers to the Commonwealth. This may be achieved by way of an amendment to the Constitution via referendum (a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the States to the Commonwealth, or vice versa, should be implemented). More commonly powers may be transferred by passing other acts of legislation which authorise the transfer and such acts require the legislative agreement of all the state governments involved. This \"transfer\" legislation may have a \"sunset clause\", a legislative provision that nullifies the transfer of power after a specified period, at which point the original division of power is restored.\n\nIn addition, Australia has several \"territories\", two of which are self-governing:  the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] (NT).  These territories' legislatures, their Assemblies, exercise powers devolved to them by the Commonwealth;  the Commonwealth Parliament remains able to override their legislation and to alter their powers.  Australian citizens in these territories are represented by members of both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament.  The territory of [[Norfolk Island]] was self-governing from 1979 until 2016, although it was never  represented as such in the Commonwealth Parliament.  The other territories that are regularly inhabited{{mdash}}[[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]], [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]{{mdash}}have never been self-governing.\n\nThe federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the [[Parliament of Australia]] were the subject of protracted negotiations among the colonies during the drafting of the Constitution. The [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is elected on a basis that reflects the differing populations of the States. Thus [[New South Wales]] has 48 members while [[Tasmania]] has only five.  But the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] is elected on a basis of equality among the States: all States elect 12 Senators, regardless of population. This was intended to allow the Senators of the smaller States to form a majority and thus be able to amend or reject bills originating in the House of Representatives. The ACT and the NT each elect two Senators.\n\nThe third level of government after Commonwealth and State/Territory is [[Local government in Australia|Local government]], in the form of [[shire]]s, towns and cities. The Councils of these areas are composed of elected representatives (known as either [[councillor]] or [[alderman]], depending on the State), usually serving part-time.  Their powers are devolved to them by the State or Territory in which they are located.\n\nGovernment at the Commonwealth level and the State/Territory level is undertaken by three inter-connected arms of government:\n\n* Legislature: The [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]]\n* Executive: The Sovereign of Australia, whose executive power is exercisable by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, Ministers and their Departments\n* Judiciary: The [[High Court of Australia]] and subsidiary Federal courts.\n\n''[[Separation of powers]]'' is the principle whereby the three arms of government undertake their activities largely separately from each other:\n\n* the Legislature proposes laws in the form of Bills, and provides a legislative framework for the operations of the other two arms;  the sovereign is formally a part of the Parliament, but takes no active role in these matters, except that (representing the sovereign) Governors-General, State Governors and Territory Administrators sign enactments into law through providing Royal Assent\n* the Executive administers the laws and carries out the tasks assigned to it by legislation\n* the Judiciary hears cases arising from the administration of the law, applying both [[statute law]] and the [[common law]];  the Australian courts cannot give an [[advisory opinions|advisory opinion]] on the constitutionality of a law, but the [[High Court of Australia]] can determine whether an existing law is constitutional\n* the Judiciary is appointed by the sovereign's representatives, on the advice of the Commonwealth  or State/Territory government;  but the Legislature and the Executive should  not try to influence its decisions.\n\n==Legislature==\n{{main|Parliament of Australia}}\n[[File:Australian Senate - Parliament of Australia.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]] chamber]]\n[[File:Australian House of Representatives - Parliament of Australia.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Australian House of Representatives]] chamber]]\nThe Legislature makes the laws, and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws when appropriate. The [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of the [[Queen of Australia]], a 76-member [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a 151-member [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\n\nTwelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms, using [[proportional representation]] and the [[single transferable vote]] (known in Australia as \"quota-preferential voting\": see [[Australian electoral system]]), with half elected every three years. In addition to the state Senators, two senators are elected by voters from the [[Northern Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the Indian Ocean Territories, [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]), while another two senators are elected by the voters of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the [[Jervis Bay Territory]]). Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting, but their term of office is not fixed;  it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends on the day before the next such election.\n\nThe members of the House of Representatives are elected by majority-preferential<ref>{{cite web |url=https://researchers.anu.edu.au/publications/4497 |title=Australia: Replacing Plurality Rule with Majority-Preferential Voting |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.}}</ref> voting using the non-proportional [[Instant-runoff voting]] system<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/closer-look/short-history/the-first-parliament.html |title=The first Parliament: Developments in the Parliament of Australia |publisher=Parliamentary Education Office of the Government of Australia}}</ref> from single-member constituencies allocated among the states and territories.  In ordinary legislation, the two chambers have co-ordinate powers, but all proposals for appropriating revenue or imposing taxes must be introduced in the House of Representatives. Under the prevailing [[Westminster system]], the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is invited to form a government and is named [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].\n\nThe Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament, of which they must, in most circumstances, be members. General elections are held at least once every three years. The Prime Minister has a discretion to advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the Constitution. The most recent general election was on [[2019 Australian federal election|18 May 2019]].\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures operate within the conventions of the [[Westminster system]], with a recognised [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|Leader of the Opposition]], usually the leader of the largest party outside the government, and a [[Shadow Cabinet]] of Opposition members who \"shadow\" each member of the Ministry, asking questions on matters within the Minister's portfolio. Although the Government, by virtue of commanding a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature, can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house, the Opposition can considerably delay the passage of legislation and obstruct government business if it chooses.\n\nThe day-to-day business of the [[House of Representatives of Australia|House of Representatives]] is usually negotiated between the [[Leader of the House (Australia)|Leader of the House]], appointed by the Prime Minister, and the [[Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Australia)|Manager of Opposition Business in the House]], appointed by the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the Commonwealth parliament, currently [[Anthony Albanese]].\n\n==Executive==\n\n===Head of state===\n{{main|Monarchy of Australia | Governor-General of Australia}}\n\nThe [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] dates from 1901, when the [[British Dominions|Dominions]] of the [[British Empire]] were not sovereign states, and does not use the term \"head of state\". As Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], government and academic sources describe the Queen as head of state.<ref>The Constitution (2012) Overview by the Attorney-General's Department and Australian Government Solicitor [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005Q00193]</ref> In practice, the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people, the [[Queen of Australia]] and the [[Governor-General of Australia]], who is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen's representative, and exercises various constitutional powers in her name, they independently exercise many important powers in their own right. The governor-general represents Australia internationally, making and receiving state visits.<ref>{{cite web | title = Governor-General's Role | publisher = Office of the Governor-General | date = 20 July 2015 | url = http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role | accessdate = 1 March 2015 }}</ref>\n[[File:Government House Canberra.JPG|thumb|left|[[Government House, Canberra]]]]\nThe [[Monarch|Sovereign]] of Australia, currently [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], is also the Sovereign of fifteen other [[Commonwealth realm]]s including the United Kingdom. Like the other [[British Dominions|Dominions]], Australia gained legislative independence from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by virtue of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which was adopted in Australia in 1942 with retrospective effect from 3 September 1939. By the [[Royal Style and Titles Act 1953]], the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title [[Queen of Australia]], and in 1973 titles with any reference to her status as [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] and [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] as well were removed, making her Queen of Australia.\n\nSection 61 of the Constitution provides that 'The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor\u2011General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth'. Section 2 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provides that a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] shall represent the Queen in Australia. In practice, the Governor-General carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state, without reference to the Queen.\n\nUnder the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] the Governor-General's powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. The Governor-General retains [[reserve powers]] similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom. These are rarely exercised, but during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]] used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister.\n\nAustralia has periodically experienced movements seeking to end the monarchy. In a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]], the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution. The proposal would have removed references to the [[Queen of Australia|Queen]] from the Constitution and replaced the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] with a President nominated by the Prime Minister, but subject to the approval of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament. The proposal was defeated. The [[Australian Republican Movement]] continues to campaign for an end to the monarchy in Australia, opposed by [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]] and [[Australian Monarchist League]].\n\n{{further|Constitutional history of Australia|Australian republicanism|Australian head of state dispute}}\n\n===Executive Council===\n{{main|Federal Executive Council (Australia)}}\nThe Federal Executive Council is a formal body which exists and meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions. All Ministers are members of the Executive Council and are entitled to be styled \"[[The Honourable]]\", a title which they retain for life. The [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] usually presides at Council meetings, but in his or her absence another Minister nominated as the [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]] presides at the meeting of the Council. Since 20 December 2017, the Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council has been Senator [[Mathias Cormann]].\n\nThere are times when the government acts in a [[Caretaker government of Australia|\"caretaker\" capacity]], principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{main|Cabinet of Australia|List of Australian Ministers}}\n\nThe Cabinet of Australia is the council of senior Ministers of the Crown, responsible to the Federal Parliament. The ministers are appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, who serve at the former's pleasure. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. Outside the cabinet there is an outer ministry and also a number of junior ministers, called Parliamentary secretaries, responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister.\n\nThe Constitution of Australia does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], which is Australia's highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the Governor-General is nominal presiding officer, he almost never attends Executive Council meetings. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor-General.\n\nUntil 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 [[Robert Menzies]] created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers holding Cabinet rank, also known within parliament as the [[front bench]]. This practice has been continued by all governments except the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Government.\n\nWhen the non-Labor parties are in power, the Prime Minister makes all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at their own discretion, although in practice they consult with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and its predecessors (the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and the [[United Australia Party]]) have been in coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] or its predecessor the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate their party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the Prime Minister on the allocation of their portfolios.\n\nWhen the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] first held office under [[Chris Watson]], Watson assumed the right to choose members of his Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the [[Caucus]], and the Prime Minister would retain the right to allocate portfolios. This practice was followed until 2007. Between 1907 and 2007, Labor Prime Ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence. Prior to the [[2007 Australian general election|2007 general election]], the then Leader of the Opposition, [[Kevin Rudd]], said that he and he alone would choose the ministry should he become Prime Minister. His party won the election and he chose the ministry, as he said he would.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/29/2046939.htm |title=Rudd seizes power from factions |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 September 2007 |first=Ben |last=Worsley}}</ref>\n\nThe cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in state capitals, most frequently Sydney and Melbourne.

Ultimately, 12 states and the District of Columbia had implemented measures requiring at least some private sector employers to offer maternity leave packages to its employees.<ref name=\"bw\" /> Even in the absence of this formal legislation, employees in other states often obtained maternity leave through [[collective bargaining]]. Employees frequently held enough bargaining power to influence employer policies and negotiate for the inclusion of maternity leave protection.\n\nDespite some localized employees' access to maternity leave, there was growing pressure for national maternity leave legislation in the early 1990s. Many new mothers continued to be excluded from such maternity leave provisions despite growing national demand. Women now enjoyed greater employment opportunities and changing gender norms that encouraged increased labor involvement. This increased [[female employment]] extended to mothers as well who now were now more likely to engage in the workforce even if they had a young child.

Additionally, the FMLA defines \u201cparents\u201d as biological, adoptive, step or foster parent who stood in loco parentis or \u201cin the place of a parent\u201d.

Importantly though, in order to use such leave, \u201cyou must follow your employer\u2019s normal leave rules such as submitting a leave form or providing advance notice.

In general, only employment within seven years is counted unless the break in service is (1) due to an employee's fulfillment of military obligations, or (2) governed by a collective bargaining agreement or other written agreement.\n\nThe FMLA is the only law that federally protects American employees who go on maternity or family leave their resumed job security.

For instance, the PDA upholds maternity leave by arguing that employees who give temporarily disabled folks a disability leave should give pregnant women maternity leave with the same protections and benefits. This PDA is essentially arguing that pregnant women should have rights to the same paid of unpaid leave that temporarily disabled workers are afforded by their employers. If an employer offers this protection to temporarily disabled workers then PDA says that pregnant women should also be protected using the same processes and same benefits. Additionally, in 2014 the PPACA amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act made it so that all insurance companies had to include maternity coverage in individual insurance plans. Therefore, filling the gap for unemployed women with individual insurance coverage plans to be able to afford the prenatal and postnatal pregnancy care that they need to have a healthy baby. Maternity care came to include:<ref name=\"EHealthInsurances Services\"/>\n\n*Outpatient services, such as prenatal and postnatal doctor visits, gestational diabetes screenings, lab studies, medications, etc.\n*Inpatient services, such as hospitalization, physician fees, etc.\n*Newborn baby care\n*Lactation counseling and breast-pump rental\n \nThese federal laws and amendments have increased accessibility and quality of care for prenatal and postnatal mothers and families. For example, before the Affordable Care Act, only 12% of insurance plans sold in the individual market included maternity coverage.<ref name=\"EHealthInsurances Services\"/> Also, according to a journal study on FMLA by researchers at the University of Maryland,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dagher |first=Rada K |display-authors=etal |title=Maternity Leave Duration and Postpartum Mental and Physical Health: Implications for Leave Policies |journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law |date=December 2013 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=369\u2013416 |doi=10.1215/03616878-2416247 |pmid=24305845 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259201718}}</ref> it was found that mothers who benefitted from FMLA were returned to the same job and sooner than before FMLA thus showing the impact of job stability for mothers. Nonetheless, many employees are still ineligible for the FMLA. According to the Family and Medical Leave Report in 2012, only 59% of American employees were eligible under the FMLA.<ref>{{cite web |title=Family and Medical Leave in 2012: Technical Report |url=https://www.dol.gov/asp/evaluation/fmla/fmla-2012-technical-report.pdf |website=Department of Labor |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, employees who returned after FMLA, women exclusively, were given lower wages than the ones to when they left. This comes from the same study by researchers at the University of Maryland, as aforementioned. It should be said that these lower wages may have not been permanent since the study only went to highlight women's experience with maternity leave two years after they leave.\n \nIn recent polls from 2017, Democrats and Republicans both are in high support of federal funding for paid maternity and family leave. According to a study done by the Brookings Institution,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mathur |first=Aparna \n |display-authors=etal |title=Paid Family and Medical Leave: An Issue Whose Time Has Come |url=http://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/es_20170606_paidfamilyleave.pdf |website=Brookings |publisher=AEI-Brookings Working Group on Paid Family Leave |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> a non-profit think tank in D.C., 71% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats support for a paid leave policy. Although the study did not reach a particular compromise on how the policies should work, who should pay for it, how much, and other concerns that might factor into creating a universal paid parental leave policy, they did reach a conclusion. Amongst the diverse group of researchers with different political and economic views, everyone believed that it is worthwhile to consider a federal paid leave policy. One important reason for this is because \u201cThe US is the only advanced country that provides no public support to new parents\u201d. \n \nThe U.S. does not presently have a federal paid maternity and family leave act. Some states, however, do include paid leave legislation for family members. States like California, New Jersey, and New York have pioneered paid leave legislature in their respective states. Reasons for paid leave might include higher job security for women and to reduce women's need for public assistance.

Ultimately, 12 states and the District of Columbia had implemented measures requiring at least some private sector employers to offer maternity leave packages to its employees.<ref name=\"bw\" /> Even in the absence of this formal legislation, employees in other states often obtained maternity leave through [[collective bargaining]]. Employees frequently held enough bargaining power to influence employer policies and negotiate for the inclusion of maternity leave protection.\n\nDespite some localized employees' access to maternity leave, there was growing pressure for national maternity leave legislation in the early 1990s. Many new mothers continued to be excluded from such maternity leave provisions despite growing national demand. Women now enjoyed greater employment opportunities and changing gender norms that encouraged increased labor involvement. This increased [[female employment]] extended to mothers as well who now were now more likely to engage in the workforce even if they had a young child. The labor participation rate of mothers with children under the age of 1 rose from 31% in 1976 to 54% in 1992.<ref name=\"w\">{{cite journal|last=Waldfogel|first=J.|title=The Family Gap for Young Women in the United States and Britain: Can Maternity Leave Make a Difference?|journal=Journal of Labor Economics|year=1998|volume=16|issue=3|pages=505\u2013545|doi=10.1086/209897}}</ref> The contribution of women's earnings to her family income rose from 26.6% in 1970 to 36% in 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maternity leave : policy and practice|last=Gordon, Victoria (Associate professor)|isbn=9781466573581|location=Boca Raton|oclc=838447584|date = 2013-06-10}}</ref> In spite of a high labor force participation rate, only an estimated 40% of working women had access to explicit maternity leave protection. This inadequate national coverage provoked intense protest and growing national consensus on the value of maternity leave. Ultimately, the increased salience and galvanized national support prompted the 1993 enactment of the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993|Family and Medical Leave Act]] mandating maternity leave.\n\nAlthough the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 required employers to guarantee job-protected, unpaid leave up to 12 weeks after the birth or adoption of a new child, an estimated 41 percent of employees in the United States were not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act in 2012.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jou|first=Judy|last2=Kozhimannil|first2=Katy B.|last3=Abraham|first3=Jean M.|last4=Blewett|first4=Lynn A.|last5=McGovern|first5=Patricia M.|date=February 2018 |title=Paid Maternity Leave in the United States: Associations with Maternal and Infant Health |journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=216\u2013225|doi=10.1007/s10995-017-2393-x|pmid=29098488|issn=1092-7875}}</ref> Nearly \u2154 of mothers had to work during their pregnancies between 2002-2008.<ref name=\":4\"/> By 2016, only 14% of US workers had access to paid family leave as an employee benefit.

The FMLA ensures the job security of parents/employees but does not protect employees who go on paid leave with their employers.

Additionally, the FMLA defines \u201cparents\u201d as biological, adoptive, step or foster parent who stood in loco parentis or \u201cin the place of a parent\u201d.

Importantly though, in order to use such leave, \u201cyou must follow your employer\u2019s normal leave rules such as submitting a leave form or providing advance notice. Even if you don\u2019t want to use your paid leave, your employer can require you to use it during your FMLA leave\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Employee's Guide to The Family and Medical Leave Act |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/employeeguide.pdf |website=Department of Labor |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIf you are choosing to use the FMLA to go on regular unpaid leave without any extended or paid leave, it's important to know the qualifications beforehand. The FMLA actually has several limiting stipulations and leaves out certain employee's conditions such as temp workers and trans employees, so only certain employees are eligible. In order to receive maternity leave protections under FMLA, employees must:<ref name=\"dol.gov\"/>\n\n*work for a covered employer;\n*have worked 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to the start of leave; (special hours of service rules apply to airline flight crew members)<ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division (July 2015) Fact Sheet #28J: The definition of \"parent\" as it applies to an individual who stood in loco parentis to an employee for FMLA \"eldercare\" protections. |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28c.pdf |website=Department of Labor |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n*work at a location where the employer has 50 or more employees within 75 miles; and\n*have worked for the employer for 12 months.\n\nThe 12 months of employment are not required to be consecutive in order for the employee to qualify for FMLA leave. In general, only employment within seven years is counted unless the break in service is (1) due to an employee's fulfillment of military obligations, or (2) governed by a collective bargaining agreement or other written agreement.\n\nThe FMLA is the only law that federally protects American employees who go on maternity or family leave their resumed job security. It was signed into law during President Bill Clinton's first term in 1993 and revised on February 23, 2015 to include same-sex parents and spouses.<ref name=\"U.S. Department of Labor\"/> Two other Federal laws, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 |url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm |website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> (PDA) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (PPACA, also known as the Affordable Care Act, the ACA or Obamacare)<ref name=\"EHealthInsurances Services\">{{cite web |title=Maternity Insurance Coverage under ObamaCare |url=https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/maternity-insurance-coverage-obamacare |website=EHealthInsurances Services |publisher=EHealthInsurances Services |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> amendment of the Fair Labor Standards Act,<ref>{{cite web |title=Wage and Hour Division (WHD) Handy Reference Guide to the Fair Labor Standards Act |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/hrg.htm |website=Department of Labor |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> provide some additional protection for parents on the birth of a child. For instance, the PDA upholds maternity leave by arguing that employees who give temporarily disabled folks a disability leave should give pregnant women maternity leave with the same protections and benefits. This PDA is essentially arguing that pregnant women should have rights to the same paid of unpaid leave that temporarily disabled workers are afforded by their employers. If an employer offers this protection to temporarily disabled workers then PDA says that pregnant women should also be protected using the same processes and same benefits. Additionally, in 2014 the PPACA amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act made it so that all insurance companies had to include maternity coverage in individual insurance plans. Therefore, filling the gap for unemployed women with individual insurance coverage plans to be able to afford the prenatal and postnatal pregnancy care that they need to have a healthy baby. Maternity care came to include:<ref name=\"EHealthInsurances Services\"/>\n\n*Outpatient services, such as prenatal and postnatal doctor visits, gestational diabetes screenings, lab studies, medications, etc.\n*Inpatient services, such as hospitalization, physician fees, etc.\n*Newborn baby care\n*Lactation counseling and breast-pump rental\n \nThese federal laws and amendments have increased accessibility and quality of care for prenatal and postnatal mothers and families. For example, before the Affordable Care Act, only 12% of insurance plans sold in the individual market included maternity coverage.<ref name=\"EHealthInsurances Services\"/> Also, according to a journal study on FMLA by researchers at the University of Maryland,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dagher |first=Rada K |display-authors=etal |title=Maternity Leave Duration and Postpartum Mental and Physical Health: Implications for Leave Policies |journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law |date=December 2013 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=369\u2013416 |doi=10.1215/03616878-2416247 |pmid=24305845 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259201718}}</ref> it was found that mothers who benefitted from FMLA were returned to the same job and sooner than before FMLA thus showing the impact of job stability for mothers. Nonetheless, many employees are still ineligible for the FMLA. According to the Family and Medical Leave Report in 2012, only 59% of American employees were eligible under the FMLA.<ref>{{cite web |title=Family and Medical Leave in 2012: Technical Report |url=https://www.dol.gov/asp/evaluation/fmla/fmla-2012-technical-report.pdf |website=Department of Labor |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, employees who returned after FMLA, women exclusively, were given lower wages than the ones to when they left. This comes from the same study by researchers at the University of Maryland, as aforementioned. It should be said that these lower wages may have not been permanent since the study only went to highlight women's experience with maternity leave two years after they leave.\n \nIn recent polls from 2017, Democrats and Republicans both are in high support of federal funding for paid maternity and family leave. According to a study done by the Brookings Institution,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mathur |first=Aparna \n |display-authors=etal |title=Paid Family and Medical Leave: An Issue Whose Time Has Come |url=http://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/es_20170606_paidfamilyleave.pdf |website=Brookings |publisher=AEI-Brookings Working Group on Paid Family Leave |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> a non-profit think tank in D.C., 71% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats support for a paid leave policy. Although the study did not reach a particular compromise on how the policies should work, who should pay for it, how much, and other concerns that might factor into creating a universal paid parental leave policy, they did reach a conclusion. Amongst the diverse group of researchers with different political and economic views, everyone believed that it is worthwhile to consider a federal paid leave policy. One important reason for this is because \u201cThe US is the only advanced country that provides no public support to new parents\u201d. \n \nThe U.S. does not presently have a federal paid maternity and family leave act. Some states, however, do include paid leave legislation for family members. States like California, New Jersey, and New York have pioneered paid leave legislature in their respective states. Reasons for paid leave might include higher job security for women and to reduce women's need for public assistance. A study by the Institute for Women's Research<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gult |first1=Barbara |title=Paid Parental Leave in the United States |url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/workplace/expecting-better-a.html |website=National Partnership |publisher=National Partnership for Women & Families |accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref> has also shown that paid leave could reduce employer costs and lead to U.S. economic growth.
