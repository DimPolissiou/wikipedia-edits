Navajo is spoken primarily in the [[Southwestern United States]], especially in the [[Navajo Nation]]. It is one of the most widely spoken [[Indigenous languages of the Americas#Northern America|Native American language]]s and is the most widely spoken north of the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]], with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011. The language has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs on the Navajo Nation.\n\nThe language has a fairly large phoneme inventory; it includes several uncommon consonants that are not found in English. Its four basic vowels are distinguished for [[Nasal vowel|nasality]], [[Vowel length|length]], and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. It has both [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and [[fusional language|fusional]] elements: it relies on affixes to modify verbs, and nouns are typically created from multiple morphemes, but in both cases these morphemes are fused irregularly and beyond easy recognition. Basic [[word order]] is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], though it is highly flexible to pragmatic factors.

However, this feature evolved independently in all subgroups; [[Athabaskan languages#Proto-Athabaskan|Proto-Athabaskan]] had no tones.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=139}}</ref> In each case, tone evolved from [[glottalic consonant]]s at the ends of morphemes; however, the progression of these consonants into tones has not been consistent, with some related morphemes being pronounced with high tones in some Athabaskan languages and low tones in others. It has been posited that Navajo and [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], which have no common ancestor more recent than Proto-Athabaskan and possess many pairs of corresponding but opposite tones, evolved from different dialects of Proto-Athabaskan that pronounced these glottalic consonants differently.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=138}}</ref> Proto-Athabaskan diverged fully into separate languages circa 500 BCE.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=333}}</ref>\n\nNavajo is most closely related to [[Western Apache language|Western Apache]], with which it shares a similar tonal scheme<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=209}}</ref> and more than 92 percent of its vocabulary. It is estimated that the [[Apache]]ean linguistic groups separated and became established as distinct societies, of which the Navajo were one, somewhere between 1300 and 1525.<ref>{{Harvnb|Levy|1998|p=25}}</ref> As a member of the Western Apachean group, Navajo's closest relative is the [[Mescalero-Chiricahua language]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=334}}</ref> Navajo is generally considered [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with all other Apachean languages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Koenig|2005|p=9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:NavajoSigns.png|thumb|right|upright=1.59|Examples of written Navajo on public signs.

In 1936, linguist [[Edward Sapir]] showed how the arrival of the Navajo people in the new arid climate among the corn agriculturalists of the Pueblo area was reflected in their language by tracing the changing meanings of words from Proto-Athabaskan to Navajo. For example, the word *''d\u00e8:'', which in Proto-Athabaskan meant \"horn\" and \"dipper made from animal horn\", in Navajo came to mean \"gourd\" or \"dipper made from gourd\". Likewise, the Proto-Athabaskan word *''\u026b-y\u00e1xs'' \"snow lies on the ground\" in Navajo became ''s\u00e0s'' \"corn lies on the ground\". Similarly, the Navajo word for \"corn\" is ''n\u00e0:-d\u0105:'', derived from two Proto-Athabaskan roots meaning \"enemy\" and \"food\", suggesting that the Navajo originally considered corn to be \"food of the enemy\" when they first arrived among the Pueblo people.<ref>Sapir, E.

When the [[United States]] annexed these territories in 1848 following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]],<ref name=\"Minahan 2013 261\"/> the English-speaking settlers allowed{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Navajo children to attend their schools. In some cases, the United States established separate schools for Navajo and other Native American children. In the late 19th century, it founded boarding schools, often operated by religious missionary groups. In efforts to [[acculturate]] the children, school authorities insisted that they learn to speak English and practice Christianity. Students routinely had their mouths washed out with lye soap as a punishment if they did speak Navajo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/the-warrior-tradition-fkaz4h/|title=The Warrior Tradition &#124; The Warrior Tradition|via=www.pbs.org|access-date=2020-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115052715/https://www.pbs.org/video/the-warrior-tradition-fkaz4h/|archive-date=2019-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref> Consequently, when these students grew up and had children of their own, they often did not teach them Navajo, in order to prevent them from being punished.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 421\"/>\n\n[[Robert W.

By the 1960s, indigenous languages of the United States had been declining in use for some time. Native American language use began to decline more quickly in this decade as paved roads were built and English-language radio was broadcast to tribal areas. Navajo was no exception, although its large speaker pool\u2014larger than that of any other Native language in the United States\u2014gave it more staying power than most.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 422\">{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=422}}</ref> Adding to the language's decline, federal acts passed in the 1950s to increase educational opportunities for Navajo children had resulted in pervasive use of English in their schools.<ref name=\"Kroskrity Field 2009 38\"/>\n\n===Revitalization and current status===\nIn 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Bilingual Education Act]], which provided funds for educating young students who are not native English speakers. The Act had mainly been intended for Spanish-speaking children\u2014particularly [[Mexican Americans]]\u2014but it applied to all recognized linguistic minorities. Many Native American tribes seized the chance to establish their own bilingual education programs. However, qualified teachers who were fluent in Native languages were scarce, and these programs were largely unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 422\"/>\n\nHowever, data collected in 1980 showed that 85 percent of Navajo first-graders were bilingual, compared to 62 percent of Navajo of all ages&nbsp;\u2013 early evidence of a resurgence of use of their traditional language among younger people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Koenig|2005|p=8}}</ref> In 1984, to counteract the language's historical decline, the [[Navajo Nation Council]] decreed that the Navajo language would be available and comprehensive for students of all grade levels in schools of the [[Navajo Nation]].<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 422\"/> This effort was aided by the fact that, largely due to the work of Young and Morgan, Navajo is one of the best-documented Native American languages. In 1980 they published a monumental expansion of their work on the language, organized by word (first initial of vowel or consonant) in the pattern of English dictionaries, as requested by Navajo students.

To say 'give me some hay', the Navajo verb ''n\u00ed\u0142jool'' (Non-Compact Matter) must be used, while for 'give me a cigarette' the verb ''n\u00edt\u012f\u012fh'' (SSO) must be used.\nNavajo also contains a separate system of [[Navajo grammar#Classifiers (transitivity prefixes)|classifiers]] that generally marks for [[Voice (grammar)|voice]]. There are four classifiers: ''\u00d8-'', ''[[wikt:\u0142-#Navajo|\u0142-]]'', ''[[wikt:d-#Navajo|d-]]'', and ''[[wikt:l-#Navajo|l-]]'', placed between the personal prefixes and the verbal stem. The ''\u0142-'' classifier indicates causation (transitivity increase), e.g. ''yib\u00e9\u00e9zh'' (''yi-\u00d8-b\u00e9\u00e9zh'') 'it's boiling'  vs. ''yi\u0142b\u00e9\u00e9zh'' (''yi-\u0142-b\u00e9\u00e9zh'') 'he's boiling it'. The ''d-'' and ''l-'' classifiers indicate passive voice (transitivity reduction), e.g. ''yiz\u00e9\u00e9s'' (''yi-\u00d8-z\u00e9\u00e9s'') 'he's singeing it' vs. ''yid\u00e9\u00e9s'' (''yi-d-z\u00e9\u00e9s'') 'it's being singed' . The ''d-'' classifier is used to detransitivize verbs with ''\u00d8-'', while ''l-'' is used for verbs with ''\u0142-''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|pp=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns are not required to form a complete Navajo sentence. Besides the extensive information that can be communicated with a verb, Navajo speakers may alternate between the third and fourth person to distinguish between two already specified actors, similarly to how speakers of languages with [[grammatical gender]] may repeatedly use pronouns.<ref name=\"Kozak 2013 161\">{{Harvnb|Kozak|2013|p=161}}</ref>\n\nMost nouns are not inflected for number,<ref name=\"Young Morgan 1992 882\"/> and plurality is usually encoded directly in the verb through the use of various prefixes or aspects, though this is by no means mandatory.

However, these verbs, known as \"neuter verbs\", are distinguished by only having the imperfective mode, as they describe continuous states of being.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=934}}</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe vast majority of Navajo vocabulary is of Athabaskan origin.<ref name=\"Wurm 1996 1134\"/> However, the vocabulary size is still fairly small; one estimate counted 6,245 noun bases and 9,000 verb bases, with most of these nouns being derived from verbs.<ref name=\"Mueller 2008 12\">{{Harvnb|Mueller-Gathercole|2008|p=12}}</ref> Prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas]], Navajo did not borrow much from other languages, including from other Athabaskan and even [[Southern Athabaskan languages|Apachean]] languages. The Athabaskan family is fairly diverse in both [[phonology]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] due to its languages' prolonged relative isolation.<ref name=\"Wurm 1996 1134\">{{Harvnb|Wurm|M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler|Tyron|1996|p=1134}}</ref> Even the [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo peoples]], with whom the Navajo interacted with for centuries and borrowed cultural customs, have lent few words to the Navajo language.

Around this point, the Navajo language began importing some, though still not many, English words, mainly by young schoolchildren exposed to English.<ref name=\"Kroskrity Field 2009 38\">{{Harvnb|Kroskrity|Field|2009|p=38}}</ref>\n\nNavajo has expanded its vocabulary to include Western technological and cultural terms through [[calque]]s and Navajo descriptive terms. For example, the phrase for English ''[[tank]]'' is ''[[wikt:chid\u00ed naa\u02bcna\u02bc\u00ed bee\u02bceld\u01eb\u01ebhtsoh bik\u00e1\u00e1\u02bc dah naaznil\u00edg\u00ed\u00ed|chidi naa na\u02bci bee \u02bceld\u01eb\u01ebh tsoh, bikaa\u02bc dah naazniligii]]'' 'vehicle that crawls around, by means of which big explosions are made, and that one sits on at an elevation'. This [[language purism]] also extends to proper nouns, such as the names of U.S. states (e.g. ''Hoozdo'' 'Arizona' and ''Yoot\u00f3'' 'New Mexico'; see also ''hahoodzo'' 'state') and languages (''naakaii'' 'Spanish').\n\nOnly one Navajo word has been fully absorbed into the English language: ''[[hogan]]'' (from Navajo ''hooghan'') \u2013 a term referring to the traditional houses.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hogan&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=August 6, 2014|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=hogan|date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811164422/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hogan&allowed_in_frame=0|archivedate=August 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Others with limited English recognition include ''[[chindi]]'' (an evil spirit of the deceased),<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=165}}</ref> and ''[[Kayenta, Arizona|Kayenta]]'' (a place name, from ''[[wikt:T\u00e9\u00e9\u02bcnd\u00e9\u00e9h|t\u00e9\u00e9\u02bcnd\u00e9\u00e9h]]'' 'game pit where wild animals fall into deep water').<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=177}}</ref> The [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[genus]] name ''[[Side-blotched lizard|Uta]]'' may be of Navajo origin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=211}}</ref> It has been speculated that English-speaking settlers were reluctant to take on more Navajo loanwords compared to [[List of English words from indigenous languages of the Americas|many other Native American languages]], including the [[Hopi language]], because the Navajo were among the most violent resisters to colonialism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=110}}</ref>\n\n==Orthography==\nEarly attempts at a Navajo orthography were made in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Navajo is spoken primarily in the [[Southwestern United States]], especially on the [[Navajo Nation]]. It is one of the most widely spoken [[Indigenous languages of the Americas#Northern America|Native American language]]s and is the most widely spoken north of the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]], with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011. The language has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs on the Navajo Nation.\n\nThe language has a fairly large phoneme inventory; it includes several uncommon consonants that are not found in English. Its four basic vowels are distinguished for [[Nasal vowel|nasality]], [[Vowel length|length]], and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. It has both [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and [[fusional language|fusional]] elements: it relies on affixes to modify verbs, and nouns are typically created from multiple morphemes, but in both cases these morphemes are fused irregularly and beyond easy recognition. Basic [[word order]] is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], though it is highly flexible to pragmatic factors.

However, this feature evolved independently in all subgroups; [[Athabaskan languages#Proto-Athabaskan|Proto-Athabaskan]] had no tones.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=139}}</ref> In each case, tone evolved from [[glottalic consonant]]s at the ends of morphemes; however, the progression of these consonants into tones has not been consistent, with some related morphemes being pronounced with high tones in some Athabaskan languages and low tones in others. It has been posited that Navajo and [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], which have no common ancestor more recent than Proto-Athabaskan and possess many pairs of corresponding but opposite tones, evolved from different dialects of Proto-Athabaskan that pronounced these glottalic consonants differently.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=138}}</ref> Proto-Athabaskan diverged fully into separate languages circa 500 BCE.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=333}}</ref>\n\nNavajo is most closely related to [[Western Apache language|Western Apache]], with which it shares a similar tonal scheme<ref>{{Harvnb|Hargus|Rice|2005|p=209}}</ref> and more than 92 percent of its vocabulary. It is estimated that the [[Apache]]ean linguistic groups separated and became established as distinct societies, of which the Navajo were one, somewhere between 1300 and 1525.<ref>{{Harvnb|Levy|1998|p=25}}</ref> As a member of the Western Apachean group, Navajo's closest relative is the [[Mescalero-Chiricahua language]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=334}}</ref> Navajo is generally considered [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with all other Apachean languages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Koenig|2005|p=9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:NavajoSigns.png|thumb|right|upright=1.59|Examples of written Navajo on public signs.

In 1936, linguist [[Edward Sapir]] showed how the arrival of the Navajo people in the new arid climate among the corn agriculturalists of the Pueblo area was reflected in their language by tracing the changing meanings of words from Proto-Athabaskan to Navajo. For example, the word *''d\u00e8:'', which in Proto-Athabaskan meant \"horn\" and \"dipper made from animal horn\", in Navajo came to mean \"gourd\" or \"dipper made from gourd\". Likewise, the Proto-Athabaskan word *''\u026b-y\u00e1xs'' \"snow lies on the ground\" in Navajo became ''s\u00e0s'' \"corn lies on the ground\". Similarly, the Navajo word for \"corn\" is ''n\u00e0:-d\u0105:'', derived from two Proto-Athabaskan roots meaning \"enemy\" and \"food\", suggesting that the Navajo originally considered corn to be \"food of the enemy\" when they first arrived among the Pueblo people.<ref>Sapir, E.

When the [[United States]] annexed these territories in 1848 following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]],<ref name=\"Minahan 2013 261\"/> the English-speaking settlers allowed{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Navajo children to attend their schools. In some cases, the United States established separate schools for Navajo and other Native American children. In the late 19th century, it founded boarding schools, often operated by religious missionary groups. In efforts to [[acculturate]] the children, school authorities insisted that they learn to speak English and practice Christianity. Students routinely had their mouths washed out with lye soap as a punishment if they did speak Navajo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/the-warrior-tradition-fkaz4h/|title=The Warrior Tradition &#124; The Warrior Tradition|via=www.pbs.org|access-date=2020-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115052715/https://www.pbs.org/video/the-warrior-tradition-fkaz4h/|archive-date=2019-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref> Consequently, when these students grew up and had children of their own, they often did not teach them Navajo, in order to prevent them from being punished.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 421\"/>\n\n[[Robert W.

By the 1960s, indigenous languages of the United States had been declining in use for some time. Native American language use began to decline more quickly in this decade as paved roads were built and English-language radio was broadcast to tribal areas. Navajo was no exception, although its large speaker pool\u2014larger than that of any other Native language in the United States\u2014gave it more staying power than most.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 422\">{{Harvnb|Johansen|Ritzker|2007|p=422}}</ref> Adding to the language's decline, federal acts passed in the 1950s to increase educational opportunities for Navajo children had resulted in pervasive use of English in their schools.<ref name=\"Kroskrity Field 2009 38\"/>\n\n===Revitalization and current status===\nIn 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Bilingual Education Act]], which provided funds for educating young students who are not native English speakers. The Act had mainly been intended for Spanish-speaking children\u2014particularly [[Mexican Americans]]\u2014but it applied to all recognized linguistic minorities. Many Native American tribes seized the chance to establish their own bilingual education programs. However, qualified teachers who were fluent in Native languages were scarce, and these programs were largely unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 422\"/>\n\nHowever, data collected in 1980 showed that 85 percent of Navajo first-graders were bilingual, compared to 62 percent of Navajo of all ages&nbsp;\u2013 early evidence of a resurgence of use of their traditional language among younger people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Koenig|2005|p=8}}</ref> In 1984, to counteract the language's historical decline, the [[Navajo Nation Council]] decreed that the Navajo language would be available and comprehensive for students of all grade levels in schools of the [[Navajo Nation]].<ref name=\"Johansen Ritzker 422\"/> This effort was aided by the fact that, largely due to the work of Young and Morgan, Navajo is one of the best-documented Native American languages. In 1980 they published a monumental expansion of their work on the language, organized by word (first initial of vowel or consonant) in the pattern of English dictionaries, as requested by Navajo students.

To say 'give me some hay', the Navajo verb ''n\u00ed\u0142jool'' (Non-Compact Matter) must be used, while for 'give me a cigarette' the verb ''n\u00edt\u012f\u012fh'' (SSO) must be used.\nNavajo also contains a separate system of [[Navajo grammar#Classifiers (transitivity prefixes)|classifiers]] that generally marks for [[Voice (grammar)|voice]]. There are four classifiers: ''\u00d8-'', ''[[wikt:\u0142-#Navajo|\u0142-]]'', ''[[wikt:d-#Navajo|d-]]'', and ''[[wikt:l-#Navajo|l-]]'', placed between the personal prefixes and the verbal stem. The ''\u0142-'' classifier indicates causation (transitivity increase), e.g. ''yib\u00e9\u00e9zh'' (''yi-\u00d8-b\u00e9\u00e9zh'') 'it's boiling'  vs. ''yi\u0142b\u00e9\u00e9zh'' (''yi-\u0142-b\u00e9\u00e9zh'') 'he's boiling it'. The ''d-'' and ''l-'' classifiers indicate passive voice (transitivity reduction), e.g. ''yiz\u00e9\u00e9s'' (''yi-\u00d8-z\u00e9\u00e9s'') 'he's singeing it' vs. ''yid\u00e9\u00e9s'' (''yi-d-z\u00e9\u00e9s'') 'it's being singed' . The ''d-'' classifier is used to detransitivize verbs with ''\u00d8-'', while ''l-'' is used for verbs with ''\u0142-''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Faltz|1998|pp=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns are not required to form a complete Navajo sentence. Besides the extensive information that can be communicated with a verb, Navajo speakers may alternate between the third and fourth person to distinguish between two already specified actors, similarly to how speakers of languages with [[grammatical gender]] may repeatedly use pronouns.<ref name=\"Kozak 2013 161\">{{Harvnb|Kozak|2013|p=161}}</ref>\n\nMost nouns are not inflected for number,<ref name=\"Young Morgan 1992 882\"/> and plurality is usually encoded directly in the verb through the use of various prefixes or aspects, though this is by no means mandatory.

However, these verbs, known as \"neuter verbs\", are distinguished by only having the imperfective mode, as they describe continuous states of being.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|Morgan|1992|p=934}}</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe vast majority of Navajo vocabulary is of Athabaskan origin.<ref name=\"Wurm 1996 1134\"/> However, the vocabulary size is still fairly small; one estimate counted 6,245 noun bases and 9,000 verb bases, with most of these nouns being derived from verbs.<ref name=\"Mueller 2008 12\">{{Harvnb|Mueller-Gathercole|2008|p=12}}</ref> Prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas]], Navajo did not borrow much from other languages, including from other Athabaskan and even [[Southern Athabaskan languages|Apachean]] languages. The Athabaskan family is fairly diverse in both [[phonology]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] due to its languages' prolonged relative isolation.<ref name=\"Wurm 1996 1134\">{{Harvnb|Wurm|M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler|Tyron|1996|p=1134}}</ref> Even the [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo peoples]], with whom the Navajo interacted with for centuries and borrowed cultural customs, have lent few words to the Navajo language.

Around this point, the Navajo language began importing some, though still not many, English words, mainly by young schoolchildren exposed to English.<ref name=\"Kroskrity Field 2009 38\">{{Harvnb|Kroskrity|Field|2009|p=38}}</ref>\n\nNavajo has expanded its vocabulary to include Western technological and cultural terms through [[calque]]s and Navajo descriptive terms. For example, the phrase for English ''[[tank]]'' is ''[[wikt:chid\u00ed naa\u02bcna\u02bc\u00ed bee\u02bceld\u01eb\u01ebhtsoh bik\u00e1\u00e1\u02bc dah naaznil\u00edg\u00ed\u00ed|chidi naa na\u02bci bee \u02bceld\u01eb\u01ebh tsoh, bikaa\u02bc dah naazniligii]]'' 'vehicle that crawls around, by means of which big explosions are made, and that one sits on at an elevation'. This [[language purism]] also extends to proper nouns, such as the names of U.S. states (e.g. ''Hoozdo'' 'Arizona' and ''Yoot\u00f3'' 'New Mexico'; see also ''hahoodzo'' 'state') and languages (''naakaii'' 'Spanish').\n\nOnly one Navajo word has been fully absorbed into the English language: ''[[hogan]]'' (from Navajo ''hooghan'') \u2013 a term referring to the traditional houses.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hogan&allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=August 6, 2014|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=hogan|date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811164422/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hogan&allowed_in_frame=0|archivedate=August 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Others with limited English recognition include ''[[chindi]]'' (an evil spirit of the deceased),<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=165}}</ref> and ''[[Kayenta, Arizona|Kayenta]]'' (a place name, from ''[[wikt:T\u00e9\u00e9\u02bcnd\u00e9\u00e9h|t\u00e9\u00e9\u02bcnd\u00e9\u00e9h]]'' 'game pit where wild animals fall into deep water').<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=177}}</ref> The [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[genus]] name ''[[Side-blotched lizard|Uta]]'' may be of Navajo origin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=211}}</ref> It has been speculated that English-speaking settlers were reluctant to take on more Navajo loanwords compared to [[List of English words from indigenous languages of the Americas|many other Native American languages]], including the [[Hopi language]], because the Navajo were among the most violent resisters to colonialism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2000|p=110}}</ref>\n\n==Orthography==\nEarly attempts at a Navajo orthography were made in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Examples of this include brisk walking, swimming, dancing, riding a bike, and even jumping rope. Another important aspect to self care includes [[Healthy diet|eating]] fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats and other proteins. Processed foods should be limited. Limiting saturated fats, trans fats, sugars, and sodium will also contribute to a healthy diet.\n\nIllness behaviors include taking medication as prescribed and getting [[vaccine|vaccinations]].

[[Social determinants of health]] play a huge role in how people take care of themselves. Access to care is one major determinant an individual's ability to carry out self-care maintenance behaviors.This includes having access to transportation to visit a health care facility, availability of open hours of offices/clinics, and whether or not the care is affordable.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Havranek|first=E.P.|last2=Mujahid|first2=M.S.|last3=Barr|first3=D.A.|date=2015|title=Social determinants of risk and outcomes for cardiovascular disease: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association|url=|journal=Circulation|volume=132|issue=9|pages=873\u2013898|doi=10.1161/CIR.0000000000000228|pmid=26240271}}</ref> These external factors can determine a person's ability to perform self-care maintenance because a person may not be able to perform a behavior based on its availability. Access to facilities that promote self-care within an individual's living environment is another factor that influences self-care maintenance. An individual's environment determines whether they are able to go to the gym to exercise or go to a grocery store to buy healthy food.<ref name=\":5\" /> Living in a [[food desert]] or having limited resources that allow for physical activity would decrease the likelihood of participating in self-care maintenance behaviors.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nInternal factors, such as motivation, emotions, and cognitive abilities also influence self-care maintenance behaviors. Motivation is often the driving force behind performing self-care maintenance behaviors.<ref name=\":8\" /> A person who is motivated to stay healthy and manage and/or prevent a [[Chronic condition|chronic illness]] is more likely to be interested in performing maintenance behaviors as aforementioned. Emotions are also indicative of whether a person is going to perform such behaviors. A person with depression is more likely to have a poor dietary intake low in fruits and vegetables, reduced physical activity, and poor medication adherence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=J.S.|last2=Safren|first2=S.A.|last3=Cagliero|first3=E.|date=2007|title=Depression, self-care, and medication adherence in type 2 diabetes|url=|journal=American Diabetes Association|volume=30 |issue=9|pages=2222\u20132227|doi=10.2337/dc07-0158|pmid=17536067|pmc=4440862}}</ref> An individual with impaired cognitive or functional abilities also has a diminished capacity to perform self-care maintenance behaviors.<ref name=\":8\" /> Some of these behaviors, such as medication adherence, require the ability to maintain a schedule, but someone with memory impairment may have difficulty completing tasks that rely on memory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Additionally, an individual's motivation influences their ability to perform self-care behaviors. Individuals need to be able to plan, set goals, and make appropriate decisions regarding their health needs.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nIn addition, self-care is influenced by an individual's attitude and perceived competence <ref name=\"pone19\" />.

Stoplight and skill teaching allow patients and providers to work together to develop decision-making strategies.\n\n1. '''Stoplight''' is an action plan for the daily treatment of a patient's chronic illness created by the healthcare team and the patient.<ref>Pollack, A. N. (2017). Community health paramedicine. Jones & Bartlett Learning. Retrieved from:\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=jm4aDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT960&lpg=PT960&dq=stoplight+action+plan&source=bl&ots=2cdEMMl5ZB&sig=RupYBfmdp2H0x2JNqEWA16HnGos&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJtv-Jk-3SAhVG5CYKHflSCpM4ChDoAQguMAQ#v=onepage&q=stoplight%20action%20plan&f=false</ref> It makes decision making easier by categorizing signs and symptoms and determining the appropriate actions for each set. It separates signs and symptoms into three zones:\n\n* ''Green'' is the safe zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms are what is typically expected. The patient should continue with their daily self-care tasks, such as taking daily medications and eating a healthy diet.<ref name=\"aafa, n.d.\">(aafa, n.d.)</ref>\n* ''Yellow'' is the caution zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms should be monitored as they are abnormal, but they are not yet dangerous. Some actions may need to be taken in this zone in order to go back to the green zone, for instance taking an additional medication. The patient may need to contact their healthcare team for advice.<ref name=\"aafa, n.d.\" />\n* ''Red'' is the danger zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms show that something is dangerously wrong. If in this category the patient needs to take actions to return to the green category, such as taking an emergency medication, as well as contact their healthcare team immediately. They may also need to contact emergency medical assistance.<ref name=\"aafa, n.d.\" />\n\nThe stoplight plan helps patients to make decisions about what actions to take for different signs and symptoms and when to contact their healthcare team with a problem. The patient and their provider will customize certain signs and symptoms that fit in each stoplight category.<ref>(Lung Foundation, n.d.)</ref>\n\n2. '''Skills teaching''' is a learning opportunity between a healthcare provider and a patient where a patient learns a skill in self-care unique to his or her chronic illness.<ref>Bennett, H. D., Coleman, E. A., Parry, C., Bodenheimer, T., & Chen, E. H. (2009). Health coaching for patients with chronic illness. Family practice management, 17(5), 24-29.</ref> Some of these skills may be applied to the daily management of the symptoms of a chronic illness. Other skills may be applied when there is an exacerbation of a symptom. The patient should not only learn the purpose of self-care skills. It is also important to learn when to apply skills in daily management of a chronic illness and how the skill might be modified or changed when the patient experiences an exacerbation of a symptom.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nFor example, a patient newly diagnosed with persistent asthma might learn about taking an oral medicine for daily management, control of chronic symptoms and prevention of an asthma attack. However, there may come a time when the patient might be exposed to an environmental trigger or stress that causes an asthma attack. The patient starts to experience shortness of breath, chest tightness or wheezing. When this unexpected symptom occurs, the skill of taking daily medicines and the medicine that is taken may change. Rather than taking an oral medicine daily, a different medication is needed for quick rescue and relief of symptoms. The rescue medication works quickly with an inhaler. Knowing to choose the right medication and knowing how to take the medicine with an inhaler is a skill that is learned for the self-care management of asthma.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn skills teaching, it is important for the patient and provider to discuss skills and address any lingering questions. It is important for the patient to know when and how a skill is to be implemented, and how the skill may need to be changed when the symptom is different from normal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dickson |first1=Victoria Vaughan |last2=Riegel |first2=Barbara |title=Are we teaching what patients need to know?

The third volume of his three-volume study ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' is dedicated to this notion. For Foucault, the notion of ''care of self'' (''epimeleia heautou'') of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy]] comprises an attitude towards the self, others and the world, as well as a certain form of attention. For Foucault, the pursuit of the care for one's own well-being also comprises [[Philosophy of self#Self-knowledge|self-knowledge]] ([[Know thyself|gn\u014dthi seauton]]).<ref>18.Foucault M: Technologies of the Self.

Notably, civil rights activist and poet [[Audre Lorde]] wrote that in the context of multiple oppressions as a black woman, \u201ccaring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.\u201d With the rise of the term in the medical usages, for instance, to combat anxiety, the association with black feminism has fallen away in clinical and popular usage.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/fashion/post-election-anxiety-self-care.html | title=Soak, Steam, Spritz: It's All Self-Care| newspaper=The New York Times| date=10 December 2016| last1=Meltzer| first1=Marisa}}</ref> However, in feminist and queer theory, the link to Lorde and other scholars is retained.<ref>{{Cite thesis | url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/26823 | title=Radical self-care : Performance, activism, and queer people of color| date=May 2014| type=Thesis}}</ref>\n\nThe [[self-care deficit nursing theory]] was developed by [[Dorothea Orem]] between 1959 and 2001.

Experience helps the patient develop cues and patterns that they can remember and follow, leading to reasonable goals and actions in repeat situations.<ref name=\":8\" /> A patient who has skills in self-management knows what to do during repeated symptomatic events. This could lead to them recognizing their symptoms earlier, and seeking a provider sooner.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Health care literacy:''' Health care literacy is another factor affecting self-care management. Health care literacy is the amount of basic health information people are able to understand. Health care literacy is the major variable contributing to differences in patient ratings of self-management support.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal |last1=Wallace |first1=A.S |last2=Carlson |first2=J.R |last3=Malone |first3=R.M |last4=Joyner |first4=J |last5=DeWalt |first5=D.A |title=The influence of literacy on patient-reported experiences of diabetes self-management support |journal=Nursing Research |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=356\u2013363 |doi=10.1097/nnr.0b013e3181ef3025 |pmid=20808193 |year=2010|pmc=2946184 }}</ref> Successful self-care involves understanding the meaning of changes in one's body. Individuals who can identify changes in their body are then able to come up with options and decide on a course of action.<ref name=\":8\" /> Health education at the patient's literacy level can increase the patient's ability to problem solve, set goals, and acquire skills in applying practical information. A patient's literacy can also affect their rating of healthcare quality. A poor healthcare experience may cause a patient to avoid returning to that same provider. This creates a delay in acute symptom management. Providers must consider health literacy when designing treatment plans that require self-management skills.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n'''Co-morbid conditions:''' A patient with multiple chronic illnesses may experience compounding effects of their illnesses. This can include worsening of one condition by the symptoms or treatment of another.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal |last1=Bayliss |first1=E.A |last2=Steiner |first2=J.F |last3=Fernald |first3=D.H |last4=Crane |first4=L.A |last5=Main |first5=D.S |title=Descriptions of barriers to self-care by persons with comorbid chronic diseases |journal=Annals of Family Medicine |date=2003 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=15\u201321|pmid=15043175 |doi=10.1370/afm.4 |pmc=1466563}}</ref> People tend to prioritize one of their conditions. This limits the self-care management of their other illnesses. One condition may have more noticeable symptoms than others. Or the patient may be more emotionally connected to one illness, for example, the one they have had for a long time. If providers are unaware of the effect of having multiple illnesses, the patient's overall health may fail to improve or worsen as a result of therapeutic efforts.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\n=== Improving self-care management ===\nThere are many ways for patients and healthcare providers to work together to improve patients and caregivers' self-care management. Stoplight and skill teaching allow patients and providers to work together to develop decision-making strategies.\n\n1. '''Stoplight''' is an action plan for the daily treatment of a patient's chronic illness created by the healthcare team and the patient.<ref>Pollack, A. N. (2017). Community health paramedicine. Jones & Bartlett Learning. Retrieved from:\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=jm4aDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT960&lpg=PT960&dq=stoplight+action+plan&source=bl&ots=2cdEMMl5ZB&sig=RupYBfmdp2H0x2JNqEWA16HnGos&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJtv-Jk-3SAhVG5CYKHflSCpM4ChDoAQguMAQ#v=onepage&q=stoplight%20action%20plan&f=false</ref> It makes decision making easier by categorizing signs and symptoms and determining the appropriate actions for each set. It separates signs and symptoms into three zones:\n\n* ''Green'' is the safe zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms are what is typically expected. The patient should continue with their daily self-care tasks, such as taking daily medications and eating a healthy diet.<ref name=\"aafa, n.d.\">(aafa, n.d.)</ref>\n* ''Yellow'' is the caution zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms should be monitored as they are abnormal, but they are not yet dangerous. Some actions may need to be taken in this zone in order to go back to the green zone, for instance taking an additional medication. The patient may need to contact their healthcare team for advice.<ref name=\"aafa, n.d.\" />\n* ''Red'' is the danger zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms show that something is dangerously wrong. If in this category the patient needs to take actions to return to the green category, such as taking an emergency medication, as well as contact their healthcare team immediately. They may also need to contact emergency medical assistance.<ref name=\"aafa, n.d.\" />\n\nThe stoplight plan helps patients to make decisions about what actions to take for different signs and symptoms and when to contact their healthcare team with a problem. The patient and their provider will customize certain signs and symptoms that fit in each stoplight category.<ref>(Lung Foundation, n.d.)</ref>\n\n2. '''Skills teaching''' is a learning opportunity between a healthcare provider and a patient where a patient learns a skill in self-care unique to his or her chronic illness.<ref>Bennett, H. D., Coleman, E. A., Parry, C., Bodenheimer, T., & Chen, E. H. (2009). Health coaching for patients with chronic illness. Family practice management, 17(5), 24-29.</ref> Some of these skills may be applied to the daily management of the symptoms of a chronic illness. Other skills may be applied when there is an exacerbation of a symptom. The patient should not only learn the purpose of self-care skills. It is also important to learn when to apply skills in daily management of a chronic illness and how the skill might be modified or changed when the patient experiences an exacerbation of a symptom.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nFor example, a patient newly diagnosed with persistent asthma might learn about taking an oral medicine for daily management, control of chronic symptoms and prevention of an asthma attack. However, there may come a time when the patient might be exposed to an environmental trigger or stress that causes an asthma attack. The patient starts to experience shortness of breath, chest tightness or wheezing. When this unexpected symptom occurs, the skill of taking daily medicines and the medicine that is taken may change. Rather than taking an oral medicine daily, a different medication is needed for quick rescue and relief of symptoms. The rescue medication works quickly with an inhaler. Knowing to choose the right medication and knowing how to take the medicine with an inhaler is a skill that is learned for the self-care management of asthma.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn skills teaching, it is important for the patient and provider to discuss skills and address any lingering questions. It is important for the patient to know when and how a skill is to be implemented, and how the skill may need to be changed when the symptom is different from normal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dickson |first1=Victoria Vaughan |last2=Riegel |first2=Barbara |title=Are we teaching what patients need to know?

The third volume of his three-volume study ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' is dedicated to this notion. For Foucault, the notion of ''care of self'' (''epimeleia heautou'') of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy]] comprises an attitude towards the self, others and the world, as well as a certain form of attention. For Foucault, the pursuit of the care for one's own well-being also comprises [[Philosophy of self#Self-knowledge|self-knowledge]] ([[Know thyself|gn\u014dthi seauton]]).<ref>18.Foucault M: Technologies of the Self.

Notably, civil rights activist and poet [[Audre Lorde]] wrote that in the context of multiple oppressions as a black woman, \u201ccaring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.\u201d With the rise of the term in the medical usages, for instance, to combat anxiety, the association with black feminism has fallen away in clinical and popular usage.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/fashion/post-election-anxiety-self-care.html | title=Soak, Steam, Spritz: It's All Self-Care| newspaper=The New York Times| date=10 December 2016| last1=Meltzer| first1=Marisa}}</ref> However, in feminist and queer theory, the link to Lorde and other scholars is retained.<ref>{{Cite thesis | url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/26823 | title=Radical self-care : Performance, activism, and queer people of color| date=May 2014| type=Thesis}}</ref>\n\nThe [[self-care deficit nursing theory]] was developed by [[Dorothea Orem]] between 1959 and 2001.
