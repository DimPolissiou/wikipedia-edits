{"title_page": "List of government-owned companies", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{main|State-owned enterprises}}\nThis is a world-wide '''list of government-owned companies'''. This list can be considered as non-exhaustive because of lack of space and time. For example, China alone has in the [[wikipedia]] database as of October 2019 more than 350 individual entries in its \"Government-owned companies of China\" Category page.\n\nThe paragraph that follows was paraphrased from a 1996 [[GAO]] report which investigated only the 20th-century American experience. The GAO report did not consider the potential use in the international forum of SOEs as extensions of a nation's foreign policy utensils. A [[government-owned corporation]] is a legal entity that undertakes [[commerce|commercial]] activities on behalf of an owner [[government]]. Their legal status varies from being a part of government to [[joint-stock company|stock companies]] with a state as a regular [[shareholder|stockholder]]. There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms can be used interchangeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and that they are established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also have public policy objectives, GOCs should be differentiated from other forms of government agencies or state entities established to pursue purely non-financial objectives.<ref name=gao>{{cite book|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|title=Report to the Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Post Office and Civil Service, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate - GOVERNMENT CORPORATIONS - Profiles of Existing Government Corporations |pages=1\u201316|date=December 1995|quote=GAO/GGD-96-14|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/230/222015.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Government-owned companies==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn 2009, the [[Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] formed the [[Afghan public protection force|Afghan Public Protection Force (APPF)]] as a \"state owned enterprise\" subordinate to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]].

[[Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal]], [[Correios]], [[Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecu\u00e1ria|Embrapa]], [[Brazilian Development Bank|BNDES]] and [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo|USP]] are examples of public enterprises. Mixed-economy companies are enterprises with the majority of stocks owned by the government, but that also have stocks owned by the [[private sector]] and usually have their shares traded on [[stock exchange]]s. [[Banco do Brasil]], [[Petrobras]], [[Sabesp]], and [[Eletrobras]] are examples of mixed-economy companies.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the central government of Brazil launched a privatization program inspired by the [[Washington Consensus]]. State-owned enterprises such as [[Vale (mining company)|Vale do Rio Doce]], [[Telebr\u00e1s]], [[Companhia Sider\u00fargica Nacional|CSN]], and [[Usiminas]] (most of them mixed-economy companies) were transferred to the private sector as part of this policy.\n\nBrasil State Owned Companies Fact Sheet / Download from the planejamento.gov.br website.<ref>http://www.planejamento.gov.br/secretarias/upload/Arquivos/dest/perfil_empresas_estatais/2014/2015_ano_base_2014.pdf</ref>\n\n===Brunei===\n* [[Brunei Investment Agency]]\n\n===Bulgaria===\n* [[Bulgarian Energy Holding]]\n* [[Bulgarian Posts]]\n* [[Bulgarian State Railways]]\n* [[LB Bulgaricum]]\n* [[National Railway Infrastructure Company]]\n* [[Kintex]]\n* [[Sofia Airport]]\n\n===Canada===\n{{main article|Crown corporations of Canada}}\nIn [[Canada]], state-owned corporations are referred to as ''Crown corporations'', indicating that an organization is established by law, owned by the sovereign (either [[Monarchy of Canada|in right of Canada]] or [[Monarchy in the Canadian provinces|a province]]), and overseen by parliament and cabinet.

In the late 1980s, the government began to reform the state-owned enterprise, and during the 1990s and 2000s, many mid-sized and small sized state-owned enterprises were privatized and went public. There are a number of different corporate forms which result in a mixture of public and private capital. In PRC terminology, a state-owned enterprise refers to a particular corporate form, which is increasingly being replaced by the [[public company|listed company]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} State-owned enterprises are mostly governed by both local governments' SASAC and, in the central government, [[State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council|the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council]]. However, some state-owned enterprise were governed by [[China Investment Corporation]] (and its domestic arm [[Central Huijin Investment]]), as well as under the governance of [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] for the university-run enterprises, or some financial institutes that were under the governance of the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAs of 2011, 35% of business activity and 43% of profits in the People's Republic of China resulted from companies in which the state owned a majority interest.

Hence Crown corporations did not play as significant a role in the development of the territory as in many other British territories.\n\nThe [[MTR Corporation]] (MTR) was formed as a Crown corporation, mandated to operate under \"prudent commercial principles\", in 1975. The [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]], operated under a government department, was corporatised in 1982 to imitate the success of MTR (see [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]]). MTR was privatised in 2000 although the Hong Kong Government is still the majority shareholder. KCR was operationally merged with MTR in 2007.\n\nExamples of present-day statutory bodies include the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]], responsible for running the [[Hong Kong International Airport]], or the [[Hong Kong Housing Authority|Housing Authority]], which provides housing to about half of Hong Kong residents.\n\n===Colombia===\n[[File:EDIFICIO EPM.jpg|thumb|[[Empresas P\u00fablicas de Medell\u00edn]] headquarters]]\n* [[Ecopetrol]]\n* [[Empresas P\u00fablicas de Medell\u00edn]]\n* [[ETB (company)|ETB]]\n* [https://www.lasceibas.gov.co/ Las Ceibas - Empresas P\u00fablicas de Neiva E.S.P]\n\n===Cuba===\n* [[ETECSA|Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba S.A.]]\n* [[Union de Industrias Militares]]\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n{{main article|St\u00e1tn\u00ed podnik}}\n* [[Budweiser Budvar Brewery]]\n* \u010cEPS, a.s.\n* [[\u010cEZ Group]]\n* [[\u010cesk\u00e9 dr\u00e1hy]]\n\n===Denmark===\n* [[Banedanmark]]\n* [[Danske Spil]]\n* [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]\n* [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]]\n* [[Energinet.dk]]\n* [[\u00d8rsted (company)|\u00d8rsted]]\n* [[PostNord]] (40%)\n\n'''Municipal'''\n* Aarhus Vand A/S\n* Kalundborg Forsyning A/S\n* Middelgrunden offshore electricity generation wind farm\n* Sams\u00f8 offshore electricity generation wind farm and district heating plants\n* Vandcenter Syd as\n\n===Egypt===\n* [[Egypt Post]]\n* [[EgyptAir]]\n* [[Egyptian National Railways]]\n* [[Nile TV]]\n* [[Suez Canal Authority]]\n* [[Telecom Egypt]]\n* [[EGPC]]\n* [[ERTU]]\n* [[EGAS]]\n* [[Arab Contractors]]\n* [[National Bank of Egypt]]\n* [[Banque Misr]]\n* [[Banque Du Caire]]\n\n===Finland===\n{{main|List of Finnish government enterprises}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alko]]\n* [[Altia]]\n* [[CSC \u2013 IT Center for Science]]\n* [[Destia]]\n* [[Hansel Ltd.]]\n* [[Laatumaa]]\n* [[Mets\u00e4hallitus]]\n* [[National Land Survey of Finland]]\n* [[Omaisuudenhoitoyhti\u00f6 Arsenal]]\n* [[Patria (company)|Patria]]\n* [[Senate Properties]]\n* [[Veikkaus]]\n* [[VR Group]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===France===\n{{main|Agence des participations de l'\u00c9tat}}\n\n===Gabon===\n* [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale Petroli\u00e8re Gabonaise]]\n\n===Germany===\n{{main|State-owned enterprises of Germany}}\n\n===Ghana===\n* [[Ghana National Petroleum Corporation]]\n* [[Ghana Oil Company]]\n* [[Volta River Authority]]\n\n===Greenland===\n* [[Greenland Airport Authority]]\n\n===Hungary===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Hungarian State Railways]]\n* [[Kossuth R\u00e1di\u00f3]]\n* [[Magyar Posta]]\n* [[Magyar R\u00e1di\u00f3]]\n* [[Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3]]\n* [[MVM Group]]\n* [[Paks Nuclear Power Plant]]\n* [[State Printing Company]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===India===\n{{main|List of public sector undertakings in India}}\nIn [[India]], state-owned enterprise is termed a [[Public Sector Undertakings in India|Public Sector Undertaking]] (PSU) or a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE).

A big customer might be the government or a government agency. The other type is government agencies which might also do activities competing with private owned companies. They usually are funded by tax money but can also sell services. The government has tried to avoid having agencies doing commercial activities, by separating out areas that compete with private companies into government-owned companies, for example within road construction. The reason is both to avoid unfair competition, and a wish to have [[market economy]] instead of [[plan economy]] as much as possible.

The GAO report did not consider the potential use in the international forum of SOEs as extensions of a nation's foreign policy utensils. A [[government-owned corporation]] is a legal entity that undertakes [[commerce|commercial]] activities on behalf of an owner [[government]]. Their legal status varies from being a part of government to [[joint-stock company|stock companies]] with a state as a regular [[shareholder|stockholder]]. There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms can be used interchangeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and that they are established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also have public policy objectives, GOCs should be differentiated from other forms of government agencies or state entities established to pursue purely non-financial objectives.<ref name=gao>{{cite book|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|title=Report to the Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Post Office and Civil Service, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate - GOVERNMENT CORPORATIONS - Profiles of Existing Government Corporations |pages=1\u201316|date=December 1995|quote=GAO/GGD-96-14|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/230/222015.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Government-owned companies==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn 2009, the [[Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] formed the [[Afghan public protection force|Afghan Public Protection Force (APPF)]] as a \"state owned enterprise\" subordinate to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]].

In the late 1980s, the government began to reform the state-owned enterprise, and during the 1990s and 2000s, many mid-sized and small sized state-owned enterprises were privatized and went public. There are a number of different corporate forms which result in a mixture of public and private capital. In PRC terminology, a state-owned enterprise refers to a particular corporate form, which is increasingly being replaced by the [[public company|listed company]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} State-owned enterprises are mostly governed by both local governments' SASAC and, in the central government, [[State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council|the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council]]. However, some state-owned enterprise were governed by [[China Investment Corporation]] (and its domestic arm [[Central Huijin Investment]]), as well as under the governance of [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] for the university-run enterprises, or some financial institutes that were under the governance of the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAs of 2011, 35% of business activity and 43% of profits in the People's Republic of China resulted from companies in which the state owned a majority interest.

Hence Crown corporations did not play as significant a role in the development of the territory as in many other British territories.\n\nThe [[MTR Corporation]] (MTR) was formed as a Crown corporation, mandated to operate under \"prudent commercial principles\", in 1975. The [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]], operated under a government department, was corporatised in 1982 to imitate the success of MTR (see [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]]).

A big customer might be the government or a government agency. The other type is government agencies which might also do activities competing with private owned companies. They usually are funded by tax money but can also sell services. The government has tried to avoid having agencies doing commercial activities, by separating out areas that compete with private companies into government-owned companies, for example within road construction. The reason is both to avoid unfair competition, and a wish to have [[market economy]] instead of [[plan economy]] as much as possible.

{"title_page": "Projection (mathematics)", "text_new": "{{No references|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''projection''' is a mapping of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (or other [[mathematical structure]]) into  a subset (or sub-structure), which is equal to its square for [[function composition|mapping composition]] (or, in other words, which is [[idempotence|idempotent]]). The [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] to a subspace of a projection is also called a ''projection'', even if the idempotence property is lost.\nAn everyday example of a projection is the casting of shadows onto a plane (paper sheet).  The projection of a point is its shadow on the paper sheet. The shadow of a point on the paper sheet is this point itself (idempotency). The shadow of a three-dimensional sphere is a closed disk.  Originally, the notion of projection was introduced in [[Euclidean geometry]] to denote the projection of the [[Euclidean space]] of three dimensions onto a plane in it, like the shadow example. The two main projections of this kind are: \n* {{anchor|Central projection}}The '''projection from a point onto a plane''' or '''central projection''': If ''C'' is a point, called the '''center of projection''', then the projection of a point ''P'' different from ''C'' onto a plane that does not contain ''C'' is the intersection of the line ''CP'' with the plane. The points ''P'' such that the line ''CP'' is parallel to the plane does not have any image by the projection, but one often says that they project to a point at infinity of the plane (see [[projective geometry]] for a formalization of this terminology). The projection of the point ''C'' itself is not defined.\n* The '''projection parallel to a direction D, onto a plane''' or '''[[parallel projection]]''': The image of a point ''P'' is the intersection with the plane of the line parallel to ''D'' passing through ''P''. See {{slink|Affine space|Projection}} for an accurate definition, generalized to any dimension.\n\nThe concept of '''projection''' in [[mathematics]] is a very old one, most likely has its roots in the phenomenon of the shadows cast by real-world objects on the ground. This rudimentary idea was refined and abstracted, first in a geometric context and later in other branches of mathematics. Over time different versions of the concept developed, but today, in a sufficiently abstract setting, we can unify these variations.\n\nIn [[cartography]], a [[map projection]] is a map of a part of the surface of the Earth onto a plane, which, in some cases, but not always, is the restriction of a projection in the above meaning. The [[3D projection]]s are also at the basis of the theory of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. \n\nThe need for unifying the two kinds of projections and of defining the image by a central projection of any point different of the center of projection are at the origin of [[projective geometry]]. However, a [[projective transformation]] is a [[bijection]] of a projective space, a property ''not'' shared with the ''projections'' of this article.\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Proj-map.svg|thumb|191x191px|The commutativity of this diagram is the universality of the projection \u03c0, for any map ''f'' and set X.]]\n\nIn an abstract setting we can generally say that a ''projection'' is a mapping of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] (or of a [[mathematical structure]]) which is [[idempotent]], which means that a projection is equal to its [[Function composition|composition]] with itself. A '''projection''' may also refer to a mapping which has a right inverse. Both notions are strongly related, as follows. Let ''p'' be an idempotent [[map (mathematics)|map]] from a set ''A'' into itself (thus ''p''&nbsp;\u2218 ''p''&nbsp;= ''p'') and ''B''&nbsp;= ''p''(''A'') be the image of ''p''. If we denote by ''\u03c0'' the map ''p'' viewed as a map from ''A'' onto ''B'' and by ''i'' the [[injective function|injection]] of ''B'' into ''A'' (so that ''p''&nbsp;= ''i''&nbsp;\u2218 ''\u03c0''), then we have ''\u03c0''&nbsp;\u2218 ''i''&nbsp;= Id<sub>''B''</sub> (so that ''\u03c0'' has a right inverse). Conversely, if ''\u03c0'' has a right inverse, then ''\u03c0''&nbsp;\u2218&nbsp;''i'' = Id<sub>''B''</sub> implies that ''i''&nbsp;\u2218 ''\u03c0'' is idempotent.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe original notion of projection has been extended or generalized to various mathematical situations, frequently, but not always, related to geometry, for example:\n\n* In [[set theory]]:\n** An operation typified by the ''j''&nbsp;<sup>th</sup> [[projection (set theory)|projection map]], written proj<sub>''j''&nbsp;</sub>, that takes an element '''x''' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''j''&nbsp;</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''k''</sub>) of the [[cartesian product]] ''X''<sub>1</sub> &times; \u2026 &times; ''X''<sub>''j''</sub> &times; \u2026 &times; ''X''<sub>''k''</sub> to the value proj<sub>''j''&nbsp;</sub>('''x''') = ''x''<sub>''j''&nbsp;</sub>.  This map is always [[surjective]].\n** A mapping that takes an element to its [[equivalence class]] under a given [[equivalence relation]] is known as the '''{{visible anchor|canonical projection}}'''.\n** The evaluation map sends a function ''f'' to the value ''f''(''x'') for a fixed ''x''.  The space of functions ''Y''<sup>''X''</sup> can be identified with the cartesian product <math>\\prod_{i\\in X}Y_i</math>, and the evaluation map is a projection map from the cartesian product.\n* For [[relational database]]s and [[query language]]s, the [[Projection (relational algebra)|projection]] is a  [[unary operation]] written as <math>\\Pi_{a_1, \\ldots,a_n}( R )</math> where <math>a_1,\\ldots,a_n</math> is a set of attribute names. The result of such projection is defined as the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that is obtained when all [[tuple]]s in ''R'' are restricted to the set <math>\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\}</math>.  ''R'' is a [[Relation (database)|database-relation]].\n* In [[spherical geometry]], projection of a sphere upon a plane was used by [[Ptolemy]] (~150) in his [[Planisphaerium]]. The method is called [[stereographic projection]] and uses a plane tangent to a sphere and a ''pole'' C diametrically opposite the point of tangency.  Any point ''P'' on the sphere besides ''C'' determines a line ''CP'' intersecting the plane at the projected point for ''P''. The correspondence makes the sphere a [[one-point compactification]] for the plane when a [[point at infinity]] is included to correspond to ''C'', which otherwise has no projection on the plane. A common instance is the [[complex plane]] where the compactification corresponds to the [[Riemann sphere]]. Alternatively, a [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemisphere]] is frequently projected onto a plane using the [[gnomonic projection]].\n* In [[linear algebra]], a [[linear transformation]] that remains unchanged if applied twice (''p''(''u'') = ''p''(''p''(''u''))), in other words, an [[idempotent]] operator.  For example, the mapping that takes a point (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') in three dimensions to the point (''x'', ''y'', 0) in the plane is a projection. This type of projection naturally generalizes to any number of dimensions ''n'' for the source and ''k'' \u2264 ''n'' for the target of the mapping.  See [[orthogonal projection]], [[projection (linear algebra)]].  In the case of orthogonal projections, the space admits a decomposition as a product, and the projection operator is a projection in that sense as well.\n* In [[differential topology]], any [[fiber bundle]] includes a projection map as part of its definition.  Locally at least this map looks like a projection map in the sense of the product topology and is therefore open and subjective.\n* In [[topology]], a [[retract]] is a continuous map ''r'': ''X'' \u2192 ''X'' which restricts to the identity map on its image.  This satisfies a similar idempotency condition ''r''<sup>2</sup> = ''r'' and can be considered a generalization of the projection map.  A retract which is [[homotopic]] to the identity is known as a [[deformation retract]].  This term is also used in category theory to refer to any split epimorphism.\n* The [[scalar resolute|scalar projection]] (or resolute) of one [[vector (geometric)|vector]] onto another.\n* In [[category theory]], the above notion of cartesian product of sets can be generalized to arbitrary [[category (mathematics)|categories]].  The [[product (category theory)|product]] of some objects has a '''canonical projection''' [[morphism]] to each factor.  This projection will take many forms in different categories.  The projection from the [[Cartesian product]] of [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the [[product topology]] of [[topological space]]s (which is always surjective and [[open map|open]]), or from the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of [[group (mathematics)|groups]], etc.  Although these morphisms are often [[epimorphism]]s and even surjective, they do not have to be.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Thomas Craig (mathematician)|Thomas Craig]] (1882) [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/umhistmath/ABR2552.0001.001?rgn=works;view=toc;rgn1=author;q1=Craig A Treatise on Projections] from [[University of Michigan]] Historical Math Collection.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Projection (Mathematics)}}\n[[Category:Mathematical terminology]]\n\n[[pl:Rzut (matematyka)]]\n", "text_old": "{{No references|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''projection''' is a mapping of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (or other [[mathematical structure]]) into  a subset (or sub-structure), which is equal to its square for [[function composition|mapping composition]] (or, in other words, which is [[idempotence|idempotent]]).

Koopa}}), is a [[fan-made]], [[Gender bender|gender-bent]] version of the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]] character [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], in which he is transformed to resemble the character [[Princess Peach]] using a [[power-up]]. The character was created on September 19, 2018 by a Malaysian artist named Ayyk92 as part of a comic strip which he posted online. Bowsette quickly rose in popularity internationally, with related hashtags in English and Japanese trending on [[Twitter]]. Bowsette is typically portrayed as a light-skinned blonde woman with horns, fangs, a spiked collar with matching armbands, and a black [[strapless dress]]. Several professional Japanese artists contributed their own renditions of the character. A convention themed around Bowsette was planned for October of the same year.\n\nJournalists took notice of the trend and were surprised by its longevity, attributing it to various aspects such as the character's appearance and appeal, or the possible desire by fans to shock Nintendo's social media handlers. While some noted much of the art that spawned from it was solely pornographic, others were quick to emphasize that some had a wholesome tone instead. Bowsette's rapid popularity led to other fan-made characters in a similar vein in a short timespan, each based on an existing Nintendo character. In [[Japan]], concerns were raised about the legality of fan-made characters under [[Copyright law of Japan|Japan's copyright law]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n[[File:Bowsette another one by poderosoandrajoso.png|Some fan renditions of the character have added additional details from Bowser's design, such as a spiked tail|thumb]]\nCreated by Nintendo in 1985, ''[[Super Mario]]'' is a long running series of [[platform game]]s.

{"title_page": "Complexity (information theory)", "text_new": "'''Information complexity''' is an information-theoretic quantity defined as the fluctuation of information about [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]]. It is derivable from fluctuations in the predominance of order and chaos in a dynamic system and has been used as a measure of complexity in many diverse fields. It was introduced in a 1993 paper by Bates and Shepard.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=John E.|last2=Shepard|first2=Harvey K.|date=1993-01-18|title=Measuring complexity using information fluctuation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019390232O|journal=Physics Letters A|language=en|volume=172|issue=6|pages=416\u2013425|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(93)90232-O|issn=0375-9601}}</ref>.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe information complexity of a discrete dynamic system is a function of the [[probability distribution]] of its states when it is subject to random external inputs. The purpose of driving the system with a rich information source such as a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] or a [[White noise|white noise signal]] is to probe the dynamics of the system in much the same as an [[impulse response]] is used in [[signal processing]]. \n\nIf a system has <math display=\"inline\">N</math> possible states and the ''state probabilities'' <math display=\"inline\">p_i</math>are known, then its [[Entropy (information theory)#Definition|information entropy]] is\n\n: <math>\\Eta = \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i I_i = - \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nwhere <math display=\"inline\">I_i = -\\log p_i</math> is the [[information content]] of state <math display=\"inline\">i</math>.\n\nThe ''information complexity'' of the system is defined as the [[Standard deviation#Discrete random variable|standard deviation]] or fluctuation of <math display=\"inline\">I</math> about its mean <math display=\"inline\">\\Eta</math>:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i(I_i - \\Eta)^2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_iI_i^2 - \\Eta^2}</math>\n\nor\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log^2 p_i - \\Biggl(\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log p_i \\Biggr)^2}.</math>\n\nThe ''fluctuation of state information'' <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is zero in a maximally disordered system with all <math>p_i = 1/N</math>; the system simply mimics its random inputs. <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is also zero when the system is perfectly ordered with just one fixed state (<math>p_1 = 1</math>), regardless of inputs. <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is non-zero between these two extremes with a mixture of both higher-probability states and lower-probability states populating state space.\n\n== Fluctuation of information allows for memory and computation ==\n\nAs a complex dynamic system evolves in time, how it transitions between states depends on external stimuli in an irregular way. At times it may be more sensitive to external stimuli (unstable) and at other times less sensitive (stable). If a particular state has several possible next-states, external information determines which one will be next and the system gains that information by following a particular trajectory in state space. But if several different states all lead to the same next-state, then upon entering the next-state the system loses information about which state preceded it. Thus, a complex system exhibits alternating information gain and loss as it evolves in time. The alternation or fluctuation of information is equivalent to remembering and forgetting \u2014 temporary information storage or memory \u2014 an essential feature of non-trivial computation. \n\nThe gain or loss of information associated with transitions between states can be related to state information. The ''net information gain'' of a transition from state <math>i</math> to state <math>j</math> is the information gained when leaving state <math>i</math> less the information lost when entering state <math>j</math>:\n\n: <math>\\Gamma_{ij} = -\\log p_{i \\rightarrow j} + \\log p_{i \\leftarrow j}.</math>\n\nHere <math display=\"inline\">p_{i \\rightarrow j}</math> is the ''forward conditional probability'' that if the present state is <math>i</math> then the next state is <math>j</math> and <math>p_{i \\leftarrow j}</math> is the ''reverse conditional probability'' that if the present state is <math>j</math> then the previous state was <math>i\n</math>. The conditional probabilities are related to the ''transition probability'' <math>p_{ij}</math>, the probability that a transition from state <math>i\n</math> to state <math>j</math> occurs, by:\n\n: <math>p_{ij} = p_i p_{i \\rightarrow j} = p_j p_{i \\leftarrow j}.</math>\n\nEliminating the conditional probabilities:\n\n: <math>\\Gamma_{ij} = -\\log (p_{ij}/p_i) + \\log (p_{ij}/p_j) = \\log p_i - \\log p_j = I_j - I_i.</math>\n\nTherefore the net information gained by the system as a result of the transition depends only on the increase in state information from the initial to the final state. It can be shown that this is true even for multiple consecutive transitions regardless of the path taken in state space<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n<math>\\Gamma = \\Delta I</math> is reminiscent of the relation between force and [[potential energy]]. <math>I</math> is like potential and <math>\\Gamma</math> is like force. External information \u201cpushes\u201d a system \u201cuphill\u201d to a state of higher information potential to accomplish memory storage, much like pushing a mass uphill to a state of higher gravitational potential stores energy. The amount of energy storage depends only on the final height, not the path up the hill. Likewise, the amount of information storage does not depend on the transition path between two states in state space. Once a system reaches a rare state, it may \"fall\" to a more common state, losing the previously stored information.\n\nIt may be useful to compute the [[Standard deviation#Discrete random variable|standard deviation]] of <math>\\Gamma</math> about its mean (which is zero), namely the ''fluctuation of net information gain'' <math>\\sigma_\\Gamma</math><ref name=\":0\" />, but <math>\\sigma_I</math> takes into account multi-transition ''memory loops'' in state space and therefore should be a better indicator of the computational power of a system. Moreover, <math>\\sigma_I</math> is easier to calculate because there can be many more transitions than states.  \n\n== Chaos and order ==\nA dynamic system that is sensitive to external information (unstable) exhibits [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior whereas one that is insensitive to external information (stable) exhibits orderly behavior. A complex system exhibits both behaviors, fluctuating between them in dynamic balance when subject to a rich information source. The degree of fluctuation is quantified by <math>\\sigma_I</math>; it captures the alternation in the predominance of chaos and order in a complex system as it evolves in time.\n\n== Example: rule 110 variant of the elementary cellular automaton ==\nThe [[rule 110]]  variant of the [[elementary cellular automaton]] has been [[Rule 110#The proof of universality|proven]] to be capable of [[universal computation]]. The proof is based on the existence and interactions of cohesive and self-perpetuating cell patterns known as gliders or [[Rule 110#Spaceships in Rule 110|spaceships]], [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent]] phenomena, that imply the capability of groups of automaton cells to remember that a glider is passing through them. It is therefore to be expected that there will be memory loops in state space resulting from alternations of information gain and loss, instability and stability, chaos and order.\n\nConsider a 3-cell group of adjacent automaton cells that obey rule 110: <math>end-center-end</math>. The next state of the center cell depends on the present state of the end cells as specified by the rule:   \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+Elementary cellular automaton rule 110.\n!3-cell group\n|1-1-1\n|1-1-0\n|1-0-1\n|1-0-0\n|0-1-1\n|0-1-0\n|0-0-1\n|0-0-0\n|-\n!next center cell\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|}\n\nTo calculate the information complexity of this system, attach a ''driver cell'' to each end of the 3-cell group to provide a random external stimulus like so, <math>\\text{driver} \\rightarrow \\text{end-center-end} \\leftarrow \\text{driver}</math>, such that the rule can be applied to the two end cells. Next determine what the next state is for each possible present state and for each possible combination of driver cell contents, to determine the forward conditional probabilities. \n\nThe [[state diagram]] of this system is depicted below, with circles representing the states and arrows representing transitions between states. The eight states of this system, <math>1-1-1</math> to <math>0-0-0</math> are labeled with the decimal equivalent of the 3-bit contents of the 3-cell group: 7 to 0. The transition arrows are labeled with forward conditional probabilities. Notice that there is variability in the divergence and convergence of arrows corresponding to a variability in chaos and order, sensitivity and insensitivity, gain and loss of external information from the driver cells. \n[[File:State_diagram_for_rule_110_with_transition_probabilities.jpg|alt=|border|none|frame|'''The 3-cell state diagram for the rule 110 elementary cellular automaton showing conditional transition probabilities with random stimulation.''']]\n\nThe forward conditional probabilities are determined by the ratio of possible driver cell contents that drive a particular transition. For example, for the four possible combinations of two driver cell contents, state 7 leads to states 5, 4, 1 and 0 so <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 5}</math>, <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 4}</math>, <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 1}</math>, and <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 0}</math> are each 1/4 or 25%. Likewise, state 0 leads to states 0, 1, 0 and 1 so <math>p_{0 \\rightarrow 1}</math>and <math>p_{0 \\rightarrow 0}</math>are each 1/2 or 50%. And so forth.\n\nThe state probabilities are related by\n\n: <math>p_j = \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i  p_{i \\rightarrow j} \\text{ and } \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i = 1.</math>\n\nThese linear algebraic equations can be solved manually or with the aid of a computer program for the state probabilities, with the following results:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>0</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>1</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>2</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>3</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>4</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>5</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>6</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>7</sub>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1/34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5/34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |4/17\n|}\n\nInformation entropy and complexity can then be calculated from the state probabilities:\n\n: <math>\\Eta = - \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i \\log_2 p_i = 2.86 \\text{ bits},</math>\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i \\log_2^2 p_i - \\Eta^2} = 0.56 \\text{ bits}.</math>\n\nNote that the maximum possible entropy for eight states is <math>\\log_2 8 = 3 \\text{ bits},</math> which would be the case if all eight states were equally likely with probabilities of 1/8 (randomness). Thus rule 110 has a relatively high entropy or state utilization at 2.86 bits. But this does not preclude a substantial fluctuation of state information about entropy and thus a substantial value of complexity. Whereas, maximum entropy ''would'' preclude complexity.\n\nAn alternative method can be used to obtain the state probabilities when the analytical method used above is unfeasible. Simply drive the system at its inputs (the driver cells) with a random source for many generations and observe the state probabilities empirically. When this is done via computer simulation for 10 million generations the results are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340284677_Measuring_complexity_using_information_fluctuation_a_tutorial|title=Measuring complexity using information fluctuation: a tutorial|last=Bates|first=John E.|date=2020-03-30|website=Research Gate|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Information variables for the rule 110 elementary cellular automaton\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |number of cells\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |3\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |4\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |5\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |6\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |7\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |8\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |9\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |10\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |11\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |12\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |13\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\Eta \\text{ (bits)}</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2.86\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |3.81\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |4.73\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5.66\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |6.56\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |7.47\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |8.34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |9.25\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |10.09\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |10.97\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |11.78\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\sigma_I \\text{ (bits)}</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.56\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.65\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.72\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.73\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.79\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.81\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.89\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.90\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.00\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.01\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.15\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\sigma_I / \\Eta</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.20\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.15\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.13\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.12\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.11\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.11\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.09\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n|}\n\nSince both <math>\\Eta</math> and <math>\\sigma_I</math> increase with system size, their dimensionless ratio <math>\\sigma_I/\\Eta</math>, the ''relative information complexity'', is included to better compare systems of different sizes. Notice that the empirical and analytical results agree for the 3-cell automaton.\n\nIn the paper by Bates and Shepard<ref name=\":0\" />, <math>\\sigma_I</math> is computed for all elementary cellular automaton rules and it was observed that the ones that exhibit slow-moving gliders and possibly stationary objects, as rule 110 does, are highly correlated with large values of ''<math>\\sigma_I</math>''. ''<math>\\sigma_I</math>'' can therefore be used as a filter to select candidate rules for universal computation, which is tedious to prove.\n\n== Applications ==\nAlthough the derivation of the information complexity formula is based on information fluctuations in a dynamic system, it is given only in terms of state probabilities and so can be made to apply to any probability distribution, including those derived from static images or text.\n\nOver the years the original paper<ref name=\":0\" /> has been [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=18239232465073627536&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en referred] to by researchers in many diverse fields: ecology<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parrott|first=Lael|date=2010-11-01|title=Measuring ecological complexity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X10000567|journal=Ecological Indicators|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=1069\u20131076|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.03.014|issn=1470-160X}}</ref>, ecosystem sustainability<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Chaojun|last2=Zhao|first2=Hongrui|date=2019-04-18|title=Analysis of remote sensing time-series data to foster ecosystem sustainability: use of temporal information entropy|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.1533661|journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing|volume=40|issue=8|pages=2880\u20132894|doi=10.1080/01431161.2018.1533661|issn=0143-1161}}</ref>, landscape sustainability<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zurlini|first=Giovanni|last2=Petrosillo|first2=Irene|last3=Jones|first3=K.

It is derivable from fluctuations in the predominance of order and chaos in a dynamic system and has been used as a measure of complexity in many diverse fields. It was introduced in a 1993 paper by Bates and Shepard.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=John E.|last2=Shepard|first2=Harvey K.|date=1993-01-18|title=Measuring complexity using information fluctuation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019390232O|journal=Physics Letters A|language=en|volume=172|issue=6|pages=416\u2013425|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(93)90232-O|issn=0375-9601}}</ref>.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe information complexity of a discrete dynamic system is a function of the [[probability distribution]] of its states when it is subject to random external inputs. The purpose of driving the system with a rich information source such as a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] or a [[White noise|white noise signal]] is to probe the dynamics of the system in much the same as an [[impulse response]] is used in [[signal processing]]. \n\nIf a system has <math display=\"inline\">N</math> possible states and the ''state probabilities'' <math display=\"inline\">p_i</math>are known, then its [[Entropy (information theory)#Definition|information entropy]] is\n\n: <math>\\Eta = \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i I_i = - \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nwhere <math display=\"inline\">I_i = -\\log p_i</math> is the [[information content]] of state <math display=\"inline\">i</math>.\n\nThe ''information complexity'' of the system is defined as the [[Standard deviation#Discrete random variable|standard deviation]] or fluctuation of <math display=\"inline\">I</math> about its mean <math display=\"inline\">\\Eta</math>:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i(I_i - \\Eta)^2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_iI_i^2 - \\Eta^2}</math>\n\nor\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log^2 p_i - \\Biggl(\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i \\log p_i \\Biggr)^2}.</math>\n\nThe ''fluctuation of state information'' <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is zero in a maximally disordered system with all <math>p_i = 1/N</math>; the system simply mimics its random inputs. <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is also zero when the system is perfectly ordered with just one fixed state (<math>p_1 = 1</math>), regardless of inputs. <math>\\sigma_I\n</math> is non-zero between these two extremes with a mixture of both higher-probability states and lower-probability states populating state space.\n\n== Fluctuation of information allows for memory and computation ==\n\nAs a complex dynamic system evolves in time, how it transitions between states depends on external stimuli in an irregular way. At times it may be more sensitive to external stimuli (unstable) and at other times less sensitive (stable). If a particular state has several possible next-states, external information determines which one will be next and the system gains that information by following a particular trajectory in state space. But if several different states all lead to the same next-state, then upon entering the next-state the system loses information about which state preceded it. Thus, a complex system exhibits alternating information gain and loss as it evolves in time. The alternation or fluctuation of information is equivalent to remembering and forgetting \u2014 temporary information storage or memory \u2014 an essential feature of non-trivial computation. \n\nThe gain or loss of information associated with transitions between states can be related to state information. The ''net information gain'' of a transition from state <math>i</math> to state <math>j</math> is the information gained when leaving state <math>i</math> less the information lost when entering state <math>j</math>:\n\n: <math>\\Gamma_{ij} = -\\log p_{i \\rightarrow j} + \\log p_{i \\leftarrow j}.</math>\n\nHere <math display=\"inline\">p_{i \\rightarrow j}</math> is the ''forward conditional probability'' that if the present state is <math>i</math> then the next state is <math>j</math> and <math>p_{i \\leftarrow j}</math> is the ''reverse conditional probability'' that if the present state is <math>j</math> then the previous state was <math>i\n</math>. The conditional probabilities are related to the ''transition probability'' <math>p_{ij}</math>, the probability that a transition from state <math>i\n</math> to state <math>j</math> occurs, by:\n\n: <math>p_{ij} = p_i p_{i \\rightarrow j} = p_j p_{i \\leftarrow j}.</math>\n\nEliminating the conditional probabilities:\n\n: <math>\\Gamma_{ij} = -\\log (p_{ij}/p_i) + \\log (p_{ij}/p_j) = \\log p_i - \\log p_j = I_j - I_i.</math>\n\nTherefore the net information gained by the system as a result of the transition depends only on the increase in state information from the initial to the final state. It can be shown that this is true even for multiple consecutive transitions regardless of the path taken in state space<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n<math>\\Gamma = \\Delta I</math> is reminiscent of the relation between force and [[potential energy]]. <math>I</math> is like potential and <math>\\Gamma</math> is like force. External information \u201cpushes\u201d a system \u201cuphill\u201d to a state of higher information potential to accomplish memory storage, much like pushing a mass uphill to a state of higher gravitational potential stores energy. The amount of energy storage depends only on the final height, not the path up the hill. Likewise, the amount of information storage does not depend on the transition path between two states in state space. Once a system reaches a rare state, it may \"fall\" to a more common state, losing the previously stored information.\n\nIt may be useful to compute the [[Standard deviation#Discrete random variable|standard deviation]] of <math>\\Gamma</math> about its mean (which is zero), namely the ''fluctuation of net information gain'' <math>\\sigma_\\Gamma</math><ref name=\":0\" />, but <math>\\sigma_I</math> takes into account multi-transition ''memory loops'' in state space and therefore should be a better indicator of the computational power of a system. Moreover, <math>\\sigma_I</math> is easier to calculate because there can be many more transitions than states.  \n\n== Chaos and order ==\nA dynamic system that is sensitive to external information (unstable) exhibits [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior whereas one that is insensitive to external information (stable) exhibits orderly behavior. A complex system exhibits both behaviors, fluctuating between them in dynamic balance when subject to a rich information source. The degree of fluctuation is quantified by <math>\\sigma_I</math>; it captures the alternation in the predominance of chaos and order in a complex system as it evolves in time.\n\n== Example: rule 110 variant of the elementary cellular automaton ==\nThe [[rule 110]]  variant of the [[elementary cellular automaton]] has been [[Rule 110#The proof of universality|proven]] to be capable of [[universal computation]]. The proof is based on the existence and interactions of cohesive and self-perpetuating cell patterns known as gliders or [[Rule 110#Spaceships in Rule 110|spaceships]], [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent]] phenomena, that imply the capability of groups of automaton cells to remember that a glider is passing through them. It is therefore to be expected that there will be memory loops in state space resulting from alternations of information gain and loss, instability and stability, chaos and order.\n\nConsider a 3-cell group of adjacent automaton cells that obey rule 110: <math>end-center-end</math>. The next state of the center cell depends on the present state of the end cells as specified by the rule:   \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+Elementary cellular automaton rule 110.\n!3-cell group\n|1-1-1\n|1-1-0\n|1-0-1\n|1-0-0\n|0-1-1\n|0-1-0\n|0-0-1\n|0-0-0\n|-\n!next center cell\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|}\n\nTo calculate the information complexity of this system, attach a ''driver cell'' to each end of the 3-cell group to provide a random external stimulus like so, <math>\\text{driver} \\rightarrow \\text{end-center-end} \\leftarrow \\text{driver}</math>, such that the rule can be applied to the two end cells. Next determine what the next state is for each possible present state and for each possible combination of driver cell contents, to determine the forward conditional probabilities. \n\nThe [[state diagram]] of this system is depicted below, with circles representing the states and arrows representing transitions between states. The eight states of this system, <math>1-1-1</math> to <math>0-0-0</math> are labeled with the decimal equivalent of the 3-bit contents of the 3-cell group: 7 to 0. The transition arrows are labeled with forward conditional probabilities. Notice that there is variability in the divergence and convergence of arrows corresponding to a variability in chaos and order, sensitivity and insensitivity, gain and loss of external information from the driver cells. \n[[File:State_diagram_for_rule_110_with_transition_probabilities.jpg|alt=|border|none|frame|'''The 3-cell state diagram for the rule 110 elementary cellular automaton showing conditional transition probabilities with random stimulation.''']]\n\nThe forward conditional probabilities are determined by the ratio of possible driver cell contents that drive a particular transition. For example, for the four possible combinations of two driver cell contents, state 7 leads to states 5, 4, 1 and 0 so <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 5}</math>, <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 4}</math>, <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 1}</math>, and <math>p_{7 \\rightarrow 0}</math> are each 1/4 or 25%. Likewise, state 0 leads to states 0, 1, 0 and 1 so <math>p_{0 \\rightarrow 1}</math>and <math>p_{0 \\rightarrow 0}</math>are each 1/2 or 50%. And so forth.\n\nThe state probabilities are related by\n\n: <math>p_j = \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i  p_{i \\rightarrow j} \\text{ and } \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i = 1.</math>\n\nThese linear algebraic equations can be solved manually or with the aid of a computer program for the state probabilities, with the following results:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>0</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>1</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>2</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>3</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>4</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>5</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>6</sub>\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |p<sub>7</sub>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1/34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5/34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2/17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |4/17\n|}\n\nInformation entropy and complexity can then be calculated from the state probabilities:\n\n: <math>\\Eta = - \\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i \\log_2 p_i = 2.86 \\text{ bits},</math>\n\n: <math>\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=0}^7 p_i \\log_2^2 p_i - \\Eta^2} = 0.56 \\text{ bits}.</math>\n\nNote that the maximum possible entropy for eight states is <math>\\log_2 8 = 3 \\text{ bits},</math> which would be the case if all eight states were equally likely with probabilities of 1/8 (randomness). Thus rule 110 has a relatively high entropy or state utilization at 2.86 bits. But this does not preclude a substantial fluctuation of state information about entropy and thus a substantial value of complexity. Whereas, maximum entropy ''would'' preclude complexity.\n\nAn alternative method can be used to obtain the state probabilities when the analytical method used above is unfeasible. Simply drive the system at its inputs (the driver cells) with a random source for many generations and observe the state probabilities empirically. When this is done via computer simulation for 10 million generations the results are as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340284677_Measuring_complexity_using_information_fluctuation_a_tutorial|title=Measuring complexity using information fluctuation: a tutorial|last=Bates|first=John E.|date=2020-03-30|website=Research Gate|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Information variables for the rule 110 elementary cellular automaton\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |number of cells\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |3\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |4\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |5\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |6\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |7\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |8\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |9\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |10\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |11\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |12\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |13\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\Eta \\text{ (bits)}</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |2.86\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |3.81\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |4.73\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |5.66\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |6.56\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |7.47\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |8.34\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |9.25\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |10.09\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |10.97\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |11.78\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\sigma_I \\text{ (bits)}</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.56\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.65\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.72\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.73\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.79\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.81\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.89\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.90\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.00\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.01\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |1.15\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\" |<math>\\sigma_I / \\Eta</math>\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.20\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.17\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.15\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.13\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.12\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.11\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.11\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.09\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |0.10\n|}\n\nSince both <math>\\Eta</math> and <math>\\sigma_I</math> increase with system size, their dimensionless ratio <math>\\sigma_I/\\Eta</math>, the ''relative information complexity'', is included to better compare systems of different sizes. Notice that the empirical and analytical results agree for the 3-cell automaton.\n\nIn the paper by Bates and Shepard<ref name=\":0\" />, <math>\\sigma_I</math> is computed for all elementary cellular automaton rules and it was observed that the ones which exhibit slow-moving gliders and possibly stationary objects, as rule 110 does, are highly correlated with large values of ''<math>\\sigma_I</math>''.
