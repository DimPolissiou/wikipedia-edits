The Orinoco watershed covers an area of about 990000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, making it the third largest in South America, covering most of [[Venezuela]] and eastern part of [[Colombia]].\n\nThe Orinoco is one of the most important rivers in the world due to its length and flow (2140&nbsp;km and more than 30000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s),<ref>Historial del caudal del Orinoco desde 1969, en Musinacio {{cite web |url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/part%274/SOUTH_AMERICA/Venezuela/3vn%60or~2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193548/http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/part'4/SOUTH_AMERICA/Venezuela/3vn%60or~2.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> the extent of its basin (1 million km<sup>2</sup>) and especially its historical importance and economic and the meaning it has had for Venezuela, where most of its basin is spread, with almost two-thirds of it. It is probably the largest river in the world in relation to its basin, similar in extent to that of the [[Danube]] but five times greater in volume.  Its discharge is the third largest of any river worldwide, after the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and the [[Congo River|Congo]], and much greater than that of many rivers of greater length and basin area.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Orinoco river basin synthesizes the three great forms of relief that exist in nature: ancient massifs and shields on the one hand, recently raised (that is the [[Cenozoic|Tertiary]]) ridges on the other and tectonic depressions and basins or accumulation plains, in third place. Each of these forms of relief has its own characteristics, but also its similarities with similar natural regions of other parts of the world. For any country, especially in the inter-tropical zone, it represents a great ecological and economic advantage to have represented in its territory these three forms of relief.  The only other countries in the Americas with a similar geological disposition are Canada and the United States.\n\nTo define the Orinoco basin as a natural region, it is necessary to establish the geographic characteristics that define it, such as extension, relief, [[climate]], [[hydrography]], [[vegetation]], soils, and mineral resources.\n\n== Extension ==\nThe Orinoco basin covers an area of almost 989000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of which 643480&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or slightly more than 65% remain in Venezuelan territory, while the remaining 35% is in Colombian territory in the Colombian Llanos and The eastern slope of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia, a stretch of the great mountain range of the Andes. This Colombian region is called [[Orinoqu\u00eda natural region|Orinoqu\u00eda]]. Of the part located in Venezuela, just over half extend from the Venezuelan Andes and the Cordillera de la Costa to the north-western bank of the Orinoco River (the left bank), forming most of the Venezuelan plains and the delta Orinoco. The southern part of the basin contains most of the waters that come from the [[Guayana venezolana|Venezuelan Guiana]].\n\n== Relief ==\n[[File:Roraima-Tepui Plateau.jpg|thumb|The top of Roraima, the highest Tepui of Venezuelan Guayana. The curious shapes have been produced by erosion.]]\n\nThe sources of the Orinoco River are located at Cerro [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]], at 1047 meters above sea level, discovered in 1951 by the Franco-Venezuelan expedition that went back and explored the Upper Orinoco course to the [[Parima Mountains|Sierra Parima]], headed By Venezuelan army officer Frank Risquez Iribarren. The first reference to this expedition was that of Alberto Contramaestre Torres in 1954.<ref>Alberto Contramaestre Torres. Expedici\u00f3n a las fuentes del Orinoco. Caracas, 1954.</ref> And there are other references to this expedition, for example, that of Pablo J. Anduce.<ref>Pablo J. Anduce. ''Shailili-Ko. Descubrimiento de las fuentes del Orinoco''. Caracas: Talleres Gr\u00e1ficos Ilustraciones S. A., 1960</ref> From the birth of the Orinoco at the foot of the hill Delgado Chalbaud (02\u00ba19\u201905\u201d07 Of latitude north, 63\u00ba21\u201942\u201d63 of longitude west and 1047.35 meters of altitude) until its opening in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the Orinoco describes a great arc and its basin extends like fan, reason why the north-western part Of the basin is somewhat more extensive than the south-east.\n\nAs already indicated, the two sub-regions of the basin have quite different characteristics, due to differences in their geological constitution. The maximum height of the basin is located in the [[Sierra Nevada del Cocuy]], in Colombia (more than 5000 meters above sea level), which forms part of the Eastern Andean Cordillera of Colombia.\n\nThe north-western edge of the basin would consist of the Colombian-Venezuelan Andean slopes and the southern slopes of other mountainous reliefs of northern Venezuela, while the southern edge of the basin would be marked for the most part by the watershed between the Orinoco and the Amazon, which is located on the Guayan\u00e9s massif. Between the two sides extends the Venezuelan Guayana on the right bank of the Orinoco and the Llanos, both Colombian and Venezuelan on the left bank. As we see, the Orinoco river itself marks the natural boundary between these two regions; it could be said that the Orinoco is one of the most remarkable natural borders in the world, although this fact has a simple explanation: the rivers have little slope and have been building for millions of years a level of accumulation with the sediments that they carry from the mountain ranges where they are born. And it is these sediments that push the channel of the Orinoco against the Guayanese shield itself, to the point that in most of its course, the channel is riding on the rocks of the guayan\u00e9s shield, as can be seen in Piedra del Medium in front of [[Ciudad Bol\u00edvar]] (before Angostura). The ancient name of Bolivar City, Angostura of the Orinoco is due to the fact that the rocks of the shield are very resistant to the erosion and presented in that point, a narrowing of about 800 meters of width that gave origin to a species of imprisonment during, probably, millions of years, until the river was gradually excavating the channel on granite rocks.\n\n[[File:Orinocometer.jpg|thumb|right|350 px|The Piedra del Medio, located in front of Ciudad Bolivar is a kind of '' nilometer '' or '' orino-meter '' in this case, in which the lines of different coloration indicate the successive levels reached by the water.]]\n\nThus, the Venezuelan Guiana constitutes, unlike the Llanos, a surface of erosion. From the combination of these two forces that modify the relief, a constructive one, the sedimentation and another destructive one, the erosion, arises the current situation in which the river marks approximately the limit between the two regions. As can be seen from the above, this limit presents exceptions since, in some sections, rounded hills of granite origin (and therefore, Guayan reliefs) can be seen on the left bank of the Orinoco, that is, on the border of the Llanos. In the stone of the middle, you can see the different levels reached by the waters of the river, expressed in the different coloration of the granite, which explains the value of this granite island as \"nilometer\" - according to [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alejandro de Humboldt]]. These lines of distinct coloring should not be interpreted as a reduction of river flow over geological time, but as a descent of river level with sediment transport from the bottom to the sea: we recall that the river delta (almost 40000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) was built with these sediments, while granitic rocks (such as Piedra del Medio) have been much more resistant to erosion.\n\nOn the other hand, the sandstones of the Venezuelan Guayana (of the Roraima formation) have been transformed into sand by the erosion that, although never very intense by the extra-ordinary resistance of the rocks, has been very durable (more than 1 billion of years), for which the sedimentary cover has been transformed into an inverted relief that forms the Tepuis. Moreover, were it not for the fact that the Guayanese Massif has been suffering a slow and long movement of ascent, in the present time it would have already become a penillanura in which almost all the sedimentary cover of sandstones would have disappeared. The sands coming from this erosive process have been deposited in the left bank of the river, especially in the low plains of Apure state, between the rivers [[Meta River|Meta]] and [[Apure]] itself. They were not deposited in the right border because there the relief is higher. And these sands could become over millions of years in strata of sandstones that could also become converted to rise and rejuvenate the relief on plateaus similar to those that now exist in Guyana. This would be a kind of example of the theory of the [[Ciclo geogr\u00e1fico|geographical cycle]].\n\nIn turn, these sands have come to create a unique eco-system in the world: an extensive dune field (occupies about 30,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) that has the peculiarity that it is not a desert climate but a savanna climate in a landscape of natural pastures that alternate with some gallery forests, flowing rivers and [[dune]]s of more than 100&nbsp;km in length and up to 20&nbsp;m in height.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magazine.com.ve/turismo/index.php?id=3303&idSec=8&accion=detalle |title= Ruta de Gallegos: para ver m\u00e9danos y playas de agua dulce en Apure Parte II|accessdate=1 October 2009 |author=Magazine Digital |language= Spanish}}</ref> Some of these dunes are used by the [[Llanero]] to establish in them the cheese,<ref>Fernando Calzadilla Vald\u00e9s. ''Por los llanos de Apure''.

They also serve to protect the livestock from floods. Thus, this eco-system so curious and picturesque, is the result of wind modeling in a savannah climate. It is not, as stated in the Atlas of Venezuela. A spatial image (also known as the Atlas of [[PDVSA]],<ref>[[PDVSA]]. ''Atlas de Venezuela. Una visi\u00f3n espacial''. Caracas: Instituto de Ingenier\u00eda, 1992</ref> of a paleodunas eco-system formed in an environment with a climate much drier than the present one, but of a mechanism of formation of dunes that only acts during the dry season since. When the level of the waters of the Orinoco falls due to the drought of the rivers, especially those that come from the Llanos, they remain extensive beaches of very fine sand, that the trade winds soon transfer towards the south-east forming what now constitutes the [[Santos Luzardo National Park]], a name taken from one of the main characters in [[Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara]]'s novel by [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]].\n\nThe direction of the winds during the dry season (of the summer as it is said in the Llanos) is on average very constant and with a considerable speed, from the north-east to the south-west, as can be seen in the direction of the elongated dunes in satellite images. This address may vary for a short time but in the long run it is maintained exactly in that direction. In the rainy season (or winter) the direction changes slightly and proceeds practically from the free east. But this is not the most remarkable change, but the decrease of its speed. This is due to the greater humidity that the trade winds bring and to the consequent convection: as the wet winds advance on the savanna they increase of temperature by the heat of the ground due to the solar radiation. In turn, this warming gives rise to the rise of moist air (precisely what we know as convection) and this rise gives rise, in turn, to a decrease in the speed of the winds and the increase of precipitation. So the mechanism of the winds and that of the accumulation of the sands from the Guayanese Massif are almost opposite and this opposition has been favorable for the establishment of agricultural activities in the Llanos: the dunes can become covered with vegetation and serve. The basis for the establishment of houses, herds and roads, and this process becomes more noticeable to the west, not only by the decrease of the speed of the winds as they move in that direction but also because the sands they form. These dunes come from the beaches of the Orinoco and the transport of the same diminishes when the speed of the wind descends. Fernando Calzadilla Vald\u00e9s explains all this process in the central part of the [[Apure state]], where he begins what he calls the Alto Llano, although this concept is not established with a certain level that throughout the Apure is very low until reaching the true piedmont of the Andes (established modern, this yes, in the curve of level of the 200 altitude.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Klimadiagramm-metrisch-deutsch-Ciudad Bolivar.Venezuela.png|thumb|350px|right|Climograph of Ciudad Bol\u00edvar. Rains are indicated in mm and temperatures in \u00b0C.]]\n\nAcross the Orinoco basin, climates are isothermal, i.e, climates with few temperature variations throughout the year (the difference between the average temperature of the warmer months and the less warm months is only 3\u00b0C), as corresponds to the inter-tropical zone. Five major types of climate in the lowlands (up to 800 m above sea level, according to the considerations of [[Antonio W. Goldbrunner]]), which are the [[tropical rainforest climate|jungle climate]] (Af in the K\u00f6ppen classification), [[savanna]] (Aw in the same climatic classification), the semi-desert and the desert proper. It is disputed whether there is a monsoon climate (according to the K\u00f6ppen nomenclature) in the Orinoco basin, which would become the fifth type of climate. In any case, the existence of this climate would be reduced to the Atlantic coast of the Orinoco delta, where the influence of the northern equatorial current (which here is practically a coastal drift) influences to make the rains much more important On the whole coast common to the Guianas and Venezuela, but that diminish abruptly in Venezuela when advancing inland. At higher altitudes four or five thermal, climatic, biotic or ecological floors can be distinguished according to criteria used by different authors and their interest in their field of research. Temperatures have a very limited annual amplitude (about 3\u00b0C or less), although their daily amplitude is much higher and around 10\u00b0C. Rainfall is high, especially in Venezuelan Guayana, where it reaches very high values (4000 mm or more) in some fairly extensive areas. In Los Llanos, rainfall is much lower (1500 to 2000 mm, with an elevation of this amount towards the foothills of the Andes) and gives rise to the presence of savanna vegetation, with gallery forests next to the rivers, and in the Andean piedmont, tropophile forests, which lose much of their leaves during the dry season. The climate chart of Ciudad Bol\u00edvar shows the behavior of rains (blue line) and temperature (red line). The shading in yellow indicates the season or season of drought (deficit of precipitations, according to the xerothermic index of Gaussen). However, Ciudad Bol\u00edvar's climate is not representative of the entire Orinoco basin, but is rather an anomaly, in the sense that, because of its location with respect to the prevailing winds (by the action of mountains north-eastern Venezuela and the plateaus of the south-east) and this city being somewhat distant from the sea (the influence of the rainfall of the coastal drift in the Venezuelan Atlantic coasts), the precipitations are quite smaller than they should be.\n\n==== Climate for Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n ====\n* Current climate conditions for Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n ([[Bol\u00edvar (state)|Bolivar state]]):\n** Location: latitude 4\u00ba36'N, longitude 61\u00ba06'W, altitude, 910 mm.\n** Temperature: January (21.6\u00b0C), February (22\u00b0C), March (22.5\u00b0C), April (22.3\u00b0C), May (22\u00b0C), June (21.5\u00b0C), July (21.5\u00b0C), August (21.5\u00b0C), September (22\u00b0C), October (22.1\u00b0C), November (22\u00b0C), December (21.8\u00b0C).

The two stripes can be seen by the different coloration of the two rivers.]]\n\nThe Orinoco, with its tributaries, constitutes an extensive hydrographic network with rivers very flowing and of considerable length. Of all its basin, the longest tributary is the Guaviare, longer (about 1550 km) than the Orinoco itself at the point of its confluence, while the largest is the Caroni. Many of its tributaries are navigable rivers, especially those on the left bank, which come from the Llanos, both Colombian and Venezuelan, while the Guayan rivers (tributaries on the right bank) are more flowing but with jumps and rains, which make them very useful in the production of hydro-electric energy, but without use as navigational routes, except for some very short stretches. There are numerous islands, both rocky (erosion reliefs) and sedimentary (sand and other sediments), as well as many pipes or arms, abandoned meanders and horseshoe lakes.\n\nThe main tributaries on the right bank are the Manaviche, Ocamo, Padamo (with its Matacuni tributary on its left bank), Cunucunuma, Ventuari (very flowing river, with its Manapiare tributary on the right), Sipapo with its tributaries Autana and Cuao, both on the right), Samariapo, Parguaza (with several tributaries with a curious bayonet drainage), Suapure, Cuchivero river (with its tributary Guaniamo, on the left bank, a river where the gold has been exploited for a long time), the Caura (with its Erebato tributary on its left bank), a very flowing river and with one of the most notable leaps of Guayana (not so much because of its height but Caudal), the Par\u00e1 jump, the Aro and finally the Caron\u00ed with its tributary the Paragua, dammed both rivers in the Necoima Canyon or Necuima, in a hydro-electric dam of more than 200 m of height that originates a reservoir, the Lake of Guri, with more than 4000 km<sup>2</sup> of surface and a production of about 10 million kW/hour, which defines it as one of the most valuable and productive rivers in the world: to date, the production of the Guri hydro-electric power station is only surpassed by the Itaip\u00fa hydro-electric power station, in the Paran\u00e1 River. In the Cuao river basin (except for the long, or horseshoe-shaped lagoons formed by some abandoned meanders), the only lagoon in the basin: the lagoon of King Leopold, so named because it was discovered during an expedition sponsored by King Leopold III Of Belgium a little more than 50 years ago (at the moment it is very easy to observe it through programs with satellite images, generally of free access in Internet). This lagoon has about 400 m of length by 270 of width, approximately. It is the only lagoon in Venezuelan Guiana, which confirms the irregular nature of the relief of this natural region, which is not favorable to them, and also contradicts the myth of the sixteenth century, of the existence of a huge lake (Lake Parima) from which the Orinoco and Amazon rivers were born, with almost all its tributaries.\n\nOn the left bank we can mention the Mavaca, the unique case in the Casiquiare world (which is not a tributary but, on the contrary, an effluent, that is to say, a derivation of the Orinoco that drains its waters towards the Amazon basin through the Negro River), the Atabapo, the four rivers that come from the Colombian territory, which are the Guaviare (with its tributary the In\u00edrida), Vichada, Tomo and Meta. And again in Venezuelan territory, the Apurean rivers to the north of the Meta: Cinaruco, Capanaparo, Arauca and Apure, the latter with numerous tributaries on its left bank gathered in two great rivers, the Portuguesa and Gu\u00e1rico. And some rivers also llaneros of minor importance and caudal, like the Manapire, Iguana, Zuata and Pao. Finally, the Ca\u00f1o [[Macareo (hidrograf\u00eda)|Manamo]] will end up in the Orinoco delta, the [[Taiga]] with its tributary by its right margin, the Long Morichal and the Guanipa with its tributary by its left bank, the Amana.\n\nEach of the named tributaries of the Orinoco River deserves a more detailed study. Also, some problems that are scarcely investigated, such as the different coloration of the waters of these tributaries, as seen in the image, the phenomenon of the lack of cloudiness in the mornings in the mountiest rivers (a phenomenon that is briefly explained in the articles on the Venezuelan Guayana, in the Amazon river and especially in the article on diathermy), the great extension of dunes or dunes in the Apure state, which is located between the Cinaruco, Capanaparo, Arauca and the own rivers Apure, the comparison of the flow between the different tributaries and between the Guaviare and the Orinoco and others, are also issues that deserve separate treatment, something more detailed than the one that is included later in the documentary study of the basin of the great river Columbia-Venezuelan.\n\n=== Flora ===\n[[File:Matapalo o higuerote (Ficus el\u00e1stica).jpg|thumb|Matapalo or fig tree showing in an opening part of the trunk of the tree on which it supported. [[Parque del Este]], Caracas, Venezuela.]]\n\nIn the Guayana part of the Orinoco basin, the equatorial forests predominate, characterized by the existence of several levels of trees of very varied species, as a consequence of a high competition to obtain a sufficient supply of solar rays.\n\nThis struggle for sunlight is exemplified by the presence of matapalos, trees that originally have a creeping stalk that they use to lean around a large tree in order to reach sunlight. When they overcome the roof and increase the function of photosynthesis they begin to grow strangling the tree on which they had leaned (as well as blocking the sunlight). The most frequent matapalos belong to the genus Ficus, as is the case of natural rubber. The peculiar note of these jungles is the extra-ordinary variety of the vegetation: many vegetal species per hectare, but few copies of each one in that surface. The other distinguishing note is the enormous annual biomass production: about 500 t/yr/ha, against about 300 in the coniferous forests of the Taiga area in the northern hemisphere, under the most favorable conditions. And it is this extra-ordinary diversity that makes it the most useful type of vegetation that exists, especially for its possibilities and for the production of oxygen, although this diversity presents a limitation as far as its commercial exploitation is concerned.\n\nThe jungles of the inter-tropical zone constitute the biggest vegetable lung of the planet since all the vegetables need to absorb an enormous amount of water and CO<sub>2</sub> to produce, through [[photosynthesis]], the carbohydrates that they need for their growth, but they also leave an enormous amount of free oxygen that animals use for their respiration. In the very long term, the balance between production and consumption of both oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> tends to be balanced, according to [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] principle that matter is not created or destroyed, but only transformed. But for millions of years (since the primary era, when the first plant species appeared on our planet) has accumulated an enormous amount of biomass on the earth's surface (and also in the subsoil as hydrocarbons), where it usually there is a close correspondence between production and consumption that fluctuates over time in a process of equilibrium. This means that, as a whole, the balance between production and consumption, both oxygen and carbon dioxide, follows an eternal process of feedback that is responsible for reaching at a given moment a situation of climax, a concept that will need, with time, be revised. We must not forget that, in nature, the number of producers (plants) is much higher than that of consumers (animals).\n\nOf course, this does not mean that the geographic environment (soil, vegetation, fauna, pollutant production) can continue to be depleted without restrictions until reaching irreversible situations. On the other hand, it must be taken into account that ecological problems vary widely at local or regional level: what can be a balancing situation on a global scale does not mean that there are no problems at other scales. What has to be taken into account is that the capacity of regeneration and restoration of the balance lost in the vegetation of the inter-tropical zone, on the one hand, is much greater than what people (including scientists) assume and on the other hand that, in parallel with the processes of desertification due to the poor management of the environment and the depletion of many natural resources, there is a continuous advance in the use and rescue for reforestation and for the cultivation of previously uncultivated and unproductive areas that have giving rise to overproduction in many orders with regard to food, especially in the intertropical zone.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of the enormous amount of vegetal species for the obtaining of medicinal products has an enormous potentiality, that will only be widened to the extent that is better known. The drink known as [[Angostura bitters|Amargo de Angostura]], for example, is an example of the development of a tonic developed in the Angostura of the Orinoco (now Ciudad Bolivar) that was very useful since the nineteenth century because, although with a composition created by Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, and which has always been kept in the greatest secrecy until today, is known to contain among its ingredients quina (hence the bitter taste) and sarrapia, vegetables whose medicinal principles have been perfectly proven for more than three centuries.\n\nIn addition to the vegetation of the equatorial forest, in the Llanos, which share Venezuela and Colombia, savannas predominate, grasses of seasonal pastures, with gallery forests, woods (small clusters isolated from trees) and estuaries with palms ([[Copernicia tectorum|palma llanera]], especialmente), etc.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Keyhole cichlid]]\n* [[Sabana Surinam toad]]\n* [[Physiographic regions of the world]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* DE LE\u00d3N, Rafael y RODR\u00cdGUEZ D\u00cdAZ, Alberto J.

The Orinoco watershed covers an area of about 990000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, making it the third largest in South America, covering most of [[Venezuela]] and eastern part of [[Colombia]].\n\nThe Orinoco is one of the most important rivers in the world due to its length and flow (2140&nbsp;km and more than 30000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s),<ref>Historial del caudal del Orinoco desde 1969, en Musinacio {{cite web |url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/part%274/SOUTH_AMERICA/Venezuela/3vn%60or~2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193548/http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/part'4/SOUTH_AMERICA/Venezuela/3vn%60or~2.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> the extent of its basin (1 million km<sup>2</sup>) and especially its historical importance and economic and the meaning it has had for Venezuela, where most of its basin is spread, with almost two-thirds of it. It is probably the largest river in the world in relation to its basin, similar in extent to that of the [[Danube]] but five times greater in volume.  Its discharge is the third largest of any river worldwide, after the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and the [[Congo River|Congo]], and much greater than that of many rivers of greater length and basin area.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Orinoco river basin synthesizes the three great forms of relief that exist in nature: ancient massifs and shields on the one hand, recently raised (that is the [[Cenozoic|Tertiary]]) ridges on the other and tectonic depressions and basins or accumulation plains, in third place. Each of these forms of relief has its own characteristics, but also its similarities with similar natural regions of other parts of the world. For any country, especially in the inter-tropical zone, it represents a great ecological and economic advantage to have represented in its territory these three forms of relief.  The only other countries in the Americas with a similar geological disposition are Canada and the United States.\n\nTo define the Orinoco basin as a natural region, it is necessary to establish the geographic characteristics that define it, such as extension, relief, [[climate]], [[hydrography]], [[vegetation]], soils, and mineral resources.\n\n== Extension ==\nThe Orinoco basin covers an area of almost 989000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of which 643480&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or slightly more than 65% remain in Venezuelan territory, while the remaining 35% is in Colombian territory in the Colombian Llanos and The eastern slope of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia, a stretch of the great mountain range of the Andes. This Colombian region is called [[Orinoqu\u00eda natural region|Orinoqu\u00eda]]. Of the part located in Venezuela, just over half extend from the Venezuelan Andes and the Cordillera de la Costa to the north-western bank of the Orinoco River (the left bank), forming most of the Venezuelan plains and the delta Orinoco. The southern part of the basin contains most of the waters that come from the [[Guayana venezolana|Venezuelan Guiana]].\n\n== Relief ==\n[[File:Roraima-Tepui Plateau.jpg|thumb|The top of Roraima, the highest Tepui of Venezuelan Guayana. The curious shapes have been produced by erosion.]]\n\nThe sources of the Orinoco River are located at Cerro [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]], at 1047 meters above sea level, discovered in 1951 by the Franco-Venezuelan expedition that went back and explored the Upper Orinoco course to the [[Parima Mountains|Sierra Parima]], headed By Venezuelan army officer Frank Risquez Iribarren. The first reference to this expedition was that of Alberto Contramaestre Torres in 1954.<ref>Alberto Contramaestre Torres. Expedici\u00f3n a las fuentes del Orinoco. Caracas, 1954.</ref> And there are other references to this expedition, for example, that of Pablo J. Anduce.<ref>Pablo J. Anduce. ''Shailili-Ko. Descubrimiento de las fuentes del Orinoco''. Caracas: Talleres Gr\u00e1ficos Ilustraciones S. A., 1960</ref> From the birth of the Orinoco at the foot of the hill Delgado Chalbaud (02\u00ba19\u201905\u201d07 Of latitude north, 63\u00ba21\u201942\u201d63 of longitude west and 1047.35 meters of altitude) until its opening in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the Orinoco describes a great arc and its basin extends like fan, reason why the north-western part Of the basin is somewhat more extensive than the south-east.\n\nAs already indicated, the two sub-regions of the basin have quite different characteristics, due to differences in their geological constitution. The maximum height of the basin is located in the [[Sierra Nevada del Cocuy]], in Colombia (more than 5000 meters above sea level), which forms part of the Eastern Andean Cordillera of Colombia.\n\nThe north-western edge of the basin would consist of the Colombian-Venezuelan Andean slopes and the southern slopes of other mountainous reliefs of northern Venezuela, while the southern edge of the basin would be marked for the most part by the watershed between the Orinoco and the Amazon, which is located on the Guayan\u00e9s massif. Between the two sides extends the Venezuelan Guayana on the right bank of the Orinoco and the Llanos, both Colombian and Venezuelan on the left bank. As we see, the Orinoco river itself marks the natural boundary between these two regions; it could be said that the Orinoco is one of the most remarkable natural borders in the world, although this fact has a simple explanation: the rivers have little slope and have been building for millions of years a level of accumulation with the sediments that they carry from the mountain ranges where they are born. And it is these sediments that push the channel of the Orinoco against the Guayanese shield itself, to the point that in most of its course, the channel is riding on the rocks of the guayan\u00e9s shield, as can be seen in Piedra del Medium in front of [[Ciudad Bol\u00edvar]] (before Angostura). The ancient name of Bolivar City, Angostura of the Orinoco is due to the fact that the rocks of the shield are very resistant to the erosion and presented in that point, a narrowing of about 800 meters of width that gave origin to a species of imprisonment during, probably, millions of years, until the river was gradually excavating the channel on granite rocks.\n\n[[File:Orinocometer.jpg|thumb|right|350 px|The Piedra del Medio, located in front of Ciudad Bolivar is a kind of '' nilometer '' or '' orino-meter '' in this case, in which the lines of different coloration indicate the successive levels reached by the water.]]\n\nThus, the Venezuelan Guiana constitutes, unlike the Llanos, a surface of erosion. From the combination of these two forces that modify the relief, a constructive one, the sedimentation and another destructive one, the erosion, arises the current situation in which the river marks approximately the limit between the two regions. As can be seen from the above, this limit presents exceptions since, in some sections, rounded hills of granite origin (and therefore, Guayan reliefs) can be seen on the left bank of the Orinoco, that is, on the border of the Llanos. In the stone of the middle, you can see the different levels reached by the waters of the river, expressed in the different coloration of the granite, which explains the value of this granite island as \"nilometer\" - according to [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alejandro de Humboldt]]. These lines of distinct coloring should not be interpreted as a reduction of river flow over geological time, but as a descent of river level with sediment transport from the bottom to the sea: we recall that the river delta (almost 40000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) was built with these sediments, while granitic rocks (such as Piedra del Medio) have been much more resistant to erosion.\n\nOn the other hand, the sandstones of the Venezuelan Guayana (of the Roraima formation) have been transformed into sand by the erosion that, although never very intense by the extra-ordinary resistance of the rocks, has been very durable (more than 1 billion of years), for which the sedimentary cover has been transformed into an inverted relief that forms the Tepuis. Moreover, were it not for the fact that the Guayanese Massif has been suffering a slow and long movement of ascent, in the present time it would have already become a penillanura in which almost all the sedimentary cover of sandstones would have disappeared. The sands coming from this erosive process have been deposited in the left bank of the river, especially in the low plains of Apure state, between the rivers [[Meta River|Meta]] and [[Apure]] itself. They were not deposited in the right border because there the relief is higher. And these sands could become over millions of years in strata of sandstones that could also become converted to rise and rejuvenate the relief on plateaus similar to those that now exist in Guyana. This would be a kind of example of the theory of the [[Ciclo geogr\u00e1fico|geographical cycle]].\n\nIn turn, these sands have come to create a unique eco-system in the world: an extensive dune field (occupies about 30,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) that has the peculiarity that it is not a desert climate but a savanna climate in a landscape of natural pastures that alternate with some gallery forests, flowing rivers and [[dune]]s of more than 100&nbsp;km in length and up to 20&nbsp;m in height.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magazine.com.ve/turismo/index.php?id=3303&idSec=8&accion=detalle |title= Ruta de Gallegos: para ver m\u00e9danos y playas de agua dulce en Apure Parte II|accessdate=1 October 2009 |author=Magazine Digital |language= Spanish}}</ref> Some of these dunes are used by the [[Llanero]] to establish in them the cheese,<ref>Fernando Calzadilla Vald\u00e9s.

They also serve to protect the livestock from floods. Thus, this eco-system so curious and picturesque, is the result of wind modeling in a savannah climate. It is not, as stated in the Atlas of Venezuela. A spatial image (also known as the Atlas of [[PDVSA]],<ref>[[PDVSA]]. ''Atlas de Venezuela. Una visi\u00f3n espacial''. Caracas: Instituto de Ingenier\u00eda, 1992</ref> of a paleodunas eco-system formed in an environment with a climate much drier than the present one, but of a mechanism of formation of dunes that only acts during the dry season since. When the level of the waters of the Orinoco falls due to the drought of the rivers, especially those that come from the Llanos, they remain extensive beaches of very fine sand, that the trade winds soon transfer towards the south-east forming what now constitutes the [[Santos Luzardo National Park]], a name taken from one of the main characters in [[Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara]]'s novel by [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]].\n\nThe direction of the winds during the dry season (of the summer as it is said in the Llanos) is on average very constant and with a considerable speed, from the north-east to the south-west, as can be seen in the direction of the elongated dunes in satellite images. This address may vary for a short time but in the long run it is maintained exactly in that direction. In the rainy season (or winter) the direction changes slightly and proceeds practically from the free east. But this is not the most remarkable change, but the decrease of its speed. This is due to the greater humidity that the trade winds bring and to the consequent convection: as the wet winds advance on the savanna they increase of temperature by the heat of the ground due to the solar radiation. In turn, this warming gives rise to the rise of moist air (precisely what we know as convection) and this rise gives rise, in turn, to a decrease in the speed of the winds and the increase of precipitation. So the mechanism of the winds and that of the accumulation of the sands from the Guayanese Massif are almost opposite and this opposition has been favorable for the establishment of agricultural activities in the Llanos: the dunes can become covered with vegetation and serve. The basis for the establishment of houses, herds and roads, and this process becomes more noticeable to the west, not only by the decrease of the speed of the winds as they move in that direction but also because the sands they form. These dunes come from the beaches of the Orinoco and the transport of the same diminishes when the speed of the wind descends. Fernando Calzadilla Vald\u00e9s explains all this process in the central part of the [[Apure state]], where he begins what he calls the Alto Llano, although this concept is not established with a certain level that throughout the Apure is very low until reaching the true piedmont of the Andes (established modern, this yes, in the curve of level of the 200 altitude.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Klimadiagramm-metrisch-deutsch-Ciudad Bolivar.Venezuela.png|thumb|350px|right|Climograph of Ciudad Bol\u00edvar. Rains are indicated in mm and temperatures in \u00b0C.]]\n\nAcross the Orinoco basin, climates are isothermal, i.e, climates with few temperature variations throughout the year (the difference between the average temperature of the warmer months and the less warm months is only 3\u00b0C), as corresponds to the inter-tropical zone. Five major types of climate in the lowlands (up to 800 m above sea level, according to the considerations of [[Antonio W. Goldbrunner]]), which are the jungle climate (Af in the K\u00f6ppen classification), [[savanna]] (Aw in the same climatic classification), the semi-desert and the desert proper. It is disputed whether there is a monsoon climate (according to the K\u00f6ppen nomenclature) in the Orinoco basin, which would become the fifth type of climate. In any case, the existence of this climate would be reduced to the Atlantic coast of the Orinoco delta, where the influence of the northern equatorial current (which here is practically a coastal drift) influences to make the rains much more important On the whole coast common to the Guianas and Venezuela, but that diminish abruptly in Venezuela when advancing inland. At higher altitudes four or five thermal, climatic, biotic or ecological floors can be distinguished according to criteria used by different authors and their interest in their field of research. Temperatures have a very limited annual amplitude (about 3\u00b0C or less), although their daily amplitude is much higher and around 10\u00b0C. Rainfall is high, especially in Venezuelan Guayana, where it reaches very high values (4000 mm or more) in some fairly extensive areas. In Los Llanos, rainfall is much lower (1500 to 2000 mm, with an elevation of this amount towards the foothills of the Andes) and gives rise to the presence of savanna vegetation, with gallery forests next to the rivers, and in the Andean piedmont, tropophile forests, which lose much of their leaves during the dry season. The climate chart of Ciudad Bol\u00edvar shows the behavior of rains (blue line) and temperature (red line). The shading in yellow indicates the season or season of drought (deficit of precipitations, according to the xerothermic index of Gaussen). However, Ciudad Bol\u00edvar's climate is not representative of the entire Orinoco basin, but is rather an anomaly, in the sense that, because of its location with respect to the prevailing winds (by the action of mountains north-eastern Venezuela and the plateaus of the south-east) and this city being somewhat distant from the sea (the influence of the rainfall of the coastal drift in the Venezuelan Atlantic coasts), the precipitations are quite smaller than they should be.\n\n==== Climate for Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n ====\n* Current climate conditions for Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n ([[Bol\u00edvar (state)|Bolivar state]]):\n** Location: latitude 4\u00ba36'N, longitude 61\u00ba06'W, altitude, 910 mm.\n** Temperature: January (21.6\u00b0C), February (22\u00b0C), March (22.5\u00b0C), April (22.3\u00b0C), May (22\u00b0C), June (21.5\u00b0C), July (21.5\u00b0C), August (21.5\u00b0C), September (22\u00b0C), October (22.1\u00b0C), November (22\u00b0C), December (21.8\u00b0C).

The two stripes can be seen by the different coloration of the two rivers.]]\n\nThe Orinoco, with its tributaries, constitutes an extensive hydrographic network with rivers very flowing and of considerable length. Of all its basin, the longest tributary is the Guaviare, longer (about 1550 km) than the Orinoco itself at the point of its confluence, while the largest is the Caroni. Many of its tributaries are navigable rivers, especially those on the left bank, which come from the Llanos, both Colombian and Venezuelan, while the Guayan rivers (tributaries on the right bank) are more flowing but with jumps and rains, which make them very useful in the production of hydro-electric energy, but without use as navigational routes, except for some very short stretches. There are numerous islands, both rocky (erosion reliefs) and sedimentary (sand and other sediments), as well as many pipes or arms, abandoned meanders and horseshoe lakes.\n\nThe main tributaries on the right bank are the Manaviche, Ocamo, Padamo (with its Matacuni tributary on its left bank), Cunucunuma, Ventuari (very flowing river, with its Manapiare tributary on the right), Sipapo with its tributaries Autana and Cuao, both on the right), Samariapo, Parguaza (with several tributaries with a curious bayonet drainage), Suapure, Cuchivero river (with its tributary Guaniamo, on the left bank, a river where the gold has been exploited for a long time), the Caura (with its Erebato tributary on its left bank), a very flowing river and with one of the most notable leaps of Guayana (not so much because of its height but Caudal), the Par\u00e1 jump, the Aro and finally the Caron\u00ed with its tributary the Paragua, dammed both rivers in the Necoima Canyon or Necuima, in a hydro-electric dam of more than 200 m of height that originates a reservoir, the Lake of Guri, with more than 4000 km<sup>2</sup> of surface and a production of about 10 million kW/hour, which defines it as one of the most valuable and productive rivers in the world: to date, the production of the Guri hydro-electric power station is only surpassed by the Itaip\u00fa hydro-electric power station, in the Paran\u00e1 River. In the Cuao river basin (except for the long, or horseshoe-shaped lagoons formed by some abandoned meanders), the only lagoon in the basin: the lagoon of King Leopold, so named because it was discovered during an expedition sponsored by King Leopold III Of Belgium a little more than 50 years ago (at the moment it is very easy to observe it through programs with satellite images, generally of free access in Internet). This lagoon has about 400 m of length by 270 of width, approximately. It is the only lagoon in Venezuelan Guiana, which confirms the irregular nature of the relief of this natural region, which is not favorable to them, and also contradicts the myth of the sixteenth century, of the existence of a huge lake (Lake Parima) from which the Orinoco and Amazon rivers were born, with almost all its tributaries.\n\nOn the left bank we can mention the Mavaca, the unique case in the Casiquiare world (which is not a tributary but, on the contrary, an effluent, that is to say, a derivation of the Orinoco that drains its waters towards the Amazon basin through the Negro River), the Atabapo, the four rivers that come from the Colombian territory, which are the Guaviare (with its tributary the In\u00edrida), Vichada, Tomo and Meta. And again in Venezuelan territory, the Apurean rivers to the north of the Meta: Cinaruco, Capanaparo, Arauca and Apure, the latter with numerous tributaries on its left bank gathered in two great rivers, the Portuguesa and Gu\u00e1rico. And some rivers also llaneros of minor importance and caudal, like the Manapire, Iguana, Zuata and Pao. Finally, the Ca\u00f1o [[Macareo (hidrograf\u00eda)|Manamo]] will end up in the Orinoco delta, the [[Taiga]] with its tributary by its right margin, the Long Morichal and the Guanipa with its tributary by its left bank, the Amana.\n\nEach of the named tributaries of the Orinoco River deserves a more detailed study. Also, some problems that are scarcely investigated, such as the different coloration of the waters of these tributaries, as seen in the image, the phenomenon of the lack of cloudiness in the mornings in the mountiest rivers (a phenomenon that is briefly explained in the articles on the Venezuelan Guayana, in the Amazon river and especially in the article on diathermy), the great extension of dunes or dunes in the Apure state, which is located between the Cinaruco, Capanaparo, Arauca and the own rivers Apure, the comparison of the flow between the different tributaries and between the Guaviare and the Orinoco and others, are also issues that deserve separate treatment, something more detailed than the one that is included later in the documentary study of the basin of the great river Columbia-Venezuelan.\n\n=== Flora ===\n[[File:Matapalo o higuerote (Ficus el\u00e1stica).jpg|thumb|Matapalo or fig tree showing in an opening part of the trunk of the tree on which it supported. [[Parque del Este]], Caracas, Venezuela.]]\n\nIn the Guayana part of the Orinoco basin, the equatorial forests predominate, characterized by the existence of several levels of trees of very varied species, as a consequence of a high competition to obtain a sufficient supply of solar rays.\n\nThis struggle for sunlight is exemplified by the presence of matapalos, trees that originally have a creeping stalk that they use to lean around a large tree in order to reach sunlight. When they overcome the roof and increase the function of photosynthesis they begin to grow strangling the tree on which they had leaned (as well as blocking the sunlight). The most frequent matapalos belong to the genus Ficus, as is the case of natural rubber. The peculiar note of these jungles is the extra-ordinary variety of the vegetation: many vegetal species per hectare, but few copies of each one in that surface. The other distinguishing note is the enormous annual biomass production: about 500 t/yr/ha, against about 300 in the coniferous forests of the Taiga area in the northern hemisphere, under the most favorable conditions. And it is this extra-ordinary diversity that makes it the most useful type of vegetation that exists, especially for its possibilities and for the production of oxygen, although this diversity presents a limitation as far as its commercial exploitation is concerned.\n\nThe jungles of the inter-tropical zone constitute the biggest vegetable lung of the planet since all the vegetables need to absorb an enormous amount of water and CO<sub>2</sub> to produce, through [[photosynthesis]], the carbohydrates that they need for their growth, but they also leave an enormous amount of free oxygen that animals use for their respiration. In the very long term, the balance between production and consumption of both oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> tends to be balanced, according to [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] principle that matter is not created or destroyed, but only transformed. But for millions of years (since the primary era, when the first plant species appeared on our planet) has accumulated an enormous amount of biomass on the earth's surface (and also in the subsoil as hydrocarbons), where it usually there is a close correspondence between production and consumption that fluctuates over time in a process of equilibrium. This means that, as a whole, the balance between production and consumption, both oxygen and carbon dioxide, follows an eternal process of feedback that is responsible for reaching at a given moment a situation of climax, a concept that will need, with time, be revised. We must not forget that, in nature, the number of producers (plants) is much higher than that of consumers (animals).\n\nOf course, this does not mean that the geographic environment (soil, vegetation, fauna, pollutant production) can continue to be depleted without restrictions until reaching irreversible situations. On the other hand, it must be taken into account that ecological problems vary widely at local or regional level: what can be a balancing situation on a global scale does not mean that there are no problems at other scales. What has to be taken into account is that the capacity of regeneration and restoration of the balance lost in the vegetation of the inter-tropical zone, on the one hand, is much greater than what people (including scientists) assume and on the other hand that, in parallel with the processes of desertification due to the poor management of the environment and the depletion of many natural resources, there is a continuous advance in the use and rescue for reforestation and for the cultivation of previously uncultivated and unproductive areas that have giving rise to overproduction in many orders with regard to food, especially in the intertropical zone.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of the enormous amount of vegetal species for the obtaining of medicinal products has an enormous potentiality, that will only be widened to the extent that is better known. The drink known as [[Angostura bitters|Amargo de Angostura]], for example, is an example of the development of a tonic developed in the Angostura of the Orinoco (now Ciudad Bolivar) that was very useful since the nineteenth century because, although with a composition created by Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, and which has always been kept in the greatest secrecy until today, is known to contain among its ingredients quina (hence the bitter taste) and sarrapia, vegetables whose medicinal principles have been perfectly proven for more than three centuries.\n\nIn addition to the vegetation of the equatorial forest, in the Llanos, which share Venezuela and Colombia, savannas predominate, grasses of seasonal pastures, with gallery forests, woods (small clusters isolated from trees) and estuaries with palms ([[Copernicia tectorum|palma llanera]], especialmente), etc.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Keyhole cichlid]]\n* [[Sabana Surinam toad]]\n* [[Physiographic regions of the world]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* DE LE\u00d3N, Rafael y RODR\u00cdGUEZ D\u00cdAZ, Alberto J.

It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate exclusively in the airless vacuum of space, and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth.\n\nStructurally and aerodynamically incapable of flight through Earth's atmosphere, the two-stage lunar module was ferried to lunar orbit attached to the [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM), about twice its mass. Its crew of two flew the complete lunar module from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface.  During takeoff, the spent descent stage was used as a launch pad for the ascent stage which then [[Lunar orbit rendezvous|flew back to the command module]], after which it was also discarded.\n\nOverseen by [[Grumman Aircraft]], the LM's development was plagued with problems that delayed its first uncrewed flight by about ten months and its first crewed flight by about three months. Still, the LM became the most reliable component of the Apollo/Saturn [[space vehicle]], the only component never to suffer a failure that could not be corrected in time to prevent abort of a landing mission.<ref>''Moon Race: The History of Apollo'' DVD, Columbia River Entertainment (Portland, Oregon, 2007)</ref>  The total cost of the LM for development and the units produced was $21.3&nbsp;billion in 2016 dollars, adjusting from a nominal total of $2.2&nbsp;billion<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://georgetyson.com/files/apollostatistics.pdf|title=Apollo by the Numbers|last=Orloff|first=Richard|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=1996|isbn=|location=|page=22}}</ref> using the NASA New Start Inflation Indices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/2013_NNSI_FY14(1).xlsx|title=NASA New Start Inflation Indices|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTen lunar modules were launched into space. Of these, six landed humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. The first two launched were test flights in [[low Earth orbit]]\u2014the first without a crew, the second with one. Another was used by [[Apollo 10]] for a dress rehearsal flight in low lunar orbit, without landing. One lunar module functioned as a lifeboat for the crew of [[Apollo 13]], providing life support and propulsion when their CSM was disabled by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon, forcing the crew to abandon plans for landing.\n\nThe six landed descent stages remain at their landing sites; their corresponding ascent stages crashed into the Moon following use. One ascent stage (Apollo 10's ''Snoopy'') was discarded in a [[heliocentric orbit]] after its descent stage was discarded in lunar orbit.  The other three LMs were burned up in the Earth's atmosphere: the four stages of [[Apollo 5]] and [[Apollo 9]] each re-entered separately, while Apollo 13's ''Aquarius'' re-entered complete, following emergency maneuvers.\n\n==Operational profile==\nAt launch, the lunar module sat directly beneath the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM) with legs folded, inside the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft\u2013lunar module adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft-to-LM adapter (SLA)]] attached to the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket. There it remained through Earth parking orbit and the [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI) rocket burn to send the craft toward the Moon.\n\nSoon after TLI, the SLA opened; the CSM separated, turned around, came back to dock with the lunar module, and extracted it from the S-IVB. During the flight to the Moon, the docking hatches were opened and the lunar module pilot entered the LM to temporarily power up and test all systems except propulsion. The lunar module pilot performed the role of an engineering officer, monitoring the systems of both spacecraft.\n\nAfter achieving a lunar parking orbit, the commander and LM pilot entered and powered up the LM, replaced the hatches and docking equipment, unfolded and locked its landing legs, and separated from the CSM, flying independently. The commander operated the flight controls and engine throttle, while the lunar module pilot operated other spacecraft systems and kept the commander informed about systems status and navigational information. After the command module pilot visually inspected the [[Landing gear (spaceflight)|landing gear]], the LM was withdrawn to a safe distance, then rotated until the descent engine was pointed forward into the direction of travel. A 30-second descent orbit insertion burn was performed to reduce speed and drop the LM's [[perilune]] to within about {{convert|50000|ft|km}} of the surface,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11g_Lunar_Orbit_Phase.htm|title=Apollo 11 Lunar Orbit Phase|publisher=}}</ref> about {{convert|260|nmi|km}} uprange of the landing site.\n\n[[File:Earth, Moon and Lunar Module, AS11-44-6643.jpg|thumb|''Eagle'', the lunar module ascent stage of [[Apollo 11]], in orbit above the Moon. Earth is visible in the distance. Photograph by [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]].]]\n\nAs the craft approached perilune, the engine was started again to begin powered descent. During this time, the crew flew on their backs, depending on the computer to slow the craft's forward and vertical velocity to near zero. Control was exercised with a combination of engine throttling and attitude thrusters, guided by the computer with the aid of landing radar. During braking, the LM descended to about {{convert|10000|ft|km}}, then, in the final approach phase, down to about {{convert|700|ft|m}}. During final approach, the vehicle pitched over to a near-vertical position, allowing the crew to look forward and down to see the lunar surface for the first time.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Gatland\n| first = Kenneth\n| title = Manned Spacecraft, Second Revision\n| publisher = Macmillan Publishing Co.\n| location = New York\n| year = 1976\n| pages = 194\u2013196\n| isbn = 0-02-542820-9 }}\n</ref>\n\nAstronauts flew Apollo spacecraft manually only during the lunar approach.<ref name=\"agle199809\">{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D.C. |date=September 1998 |title=Flying the Gusmobile |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/flying-the-gusmobile-218187/ |magazine=Air & Space |language=en |access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> The final landing phase began about {{convert|2000|ft|km}} uprange of the targeted landing site. At this point, manual control was enabled for the commander, who had enough [[liquid rocket propellant|propellant]] to hover for up to two minutes to survey where the computer was taking the craft and make any necessary corrections. If necessary, landing could have been aborted at almost any time by jettisoning the descent stage and firing the ascent engine to climb back into orbit for an emergency return to the CSM. Finally, one or more of three {{convert|67.2|in|m|adj=on}} probes extending from footpads on the legs of the lander touched the surface, activating the contact indicator light which signaled the commander to manually shut off the descent engine, allowing the LM to settle onto the surface. On touchdown, the probes would be bent as much as 180 degrees, or even break off. The original design used the probes on all four legs, but starting with the first landing (LM-5 on Apollo 11), the one at the ladder was removed out of concern that the bent probe after landing might puncture an astronaut's suit as he descended or stepped off the ladder.\n\nThe original [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) plan, up through at least 1966, was for only one astronaut to leave the LM while the other remained inside \"to maintain communications\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UuRCwsGugg&t=3m20s Landing on the Moon], 1966 episode of MIT's ''Science Reporter'' (posted to YouTube by MIT on Jan 20, 2016)<br />Quote:<br />\"While one astronaut explores the area around the LEM, the second remains inside to maintain communications.\"</ref> Communications were eventually deemed to be reliable enough to allow both crew members to walk on the surface, leaving the spacecraft to be only remotely attended by Mission Control.\n\nBeginning with [[Apollo 14]], extra LM propellant was made available for the powered descent and landing, by using the CSM engine to achieve the {{convert|50000|ft|km|adj=on}} perilune. After the spacecraft undocked, the CSM raised and circularized its orbit for the remainder of the mission.\n\nWhen ready to leave the Moon, the LM's ascent engine fired, leaving the descent stage on the Moon's surface. After a few course correction burns, the LM rendezvoused with the CSM and docked to transfer the crew and rock samples. Having completed its job, the ascent stage was separated. The Apollo 10 ascent stage engine was fired until its fuel was used up, sending it past the Moon into a [[heliocentric orbit]].<ref name=\"nasa_apollo10\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html |title=Apollo 10 |editor-last=Ryba |editor-first=Jeanne |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"disposition\">{{cite web|title=Current locations of the Apollo Command Module Capsules (and Lunar Module crash sites)|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apolloloc.html|website=Apollo: Where are they now?|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> The [[Apollo 11]] ascent stage was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash; all subsequent ascent stages (except for Apollo 13) were intentionally steered into the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the surface.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Joseph Francis Shea.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1962 model of the first LEM design, docked to the command and service module. The model is held by [[Joseph Francis Shea|Joseph Shea]], the key engineer behind the adoption of [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission logistics.]]\nThe lunar module (originally designated the lunar excursion module, known by the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] LEM) was designed after NASA [[Project Apollo#Choosing a mission mode|chose to reach the Moon]] via [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] (LOR) instead of the [[direct ascent]] or [[Earth Orbit Rendezvous]] (EOR) methods. Both direct ascent and EOR would have involved landing a much heavier, complete Apollo spacecraft on the Moon. Once the decision had been made to proceed using LOR, it became necessary to produce a separate craft capable of reaching the lunar surface and ascending back to lunar orbit.\n\n===Contract letting===\nIn July 1962, eleven firms were invited to submit proposals for the LEM. Nine companies responded in September, answering 20 questions posed by the NASA RFP in a 60-page limited technical proposal. [[Grumman Aircraft]] was awarded the contract two months later. Grumman had begun lunar orbit rendezvous studies in the late 1950s and again in 1961. The contract cost was expected to be around $350&nbsp;million. There were initially four major subcontractors: [[Bell Aerosystems]] ([[Ascent Propulsion System|ascent engine]]), [[Hamilton Standard]] (environmental control systems), [[Marquardt Corporation|Marquardt]] (reaction control system) and [[TRW Inc.|TRW's]] [[Space Technology Laboratories]] ([[Descent Propulsion System|descent engine]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch6-5.html |title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft; Engines, Large and Small |author1=Courtney G.

A backup navigation tool, the [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|Abort Guidance System]] (AGS), was developed by TRW.\n\n===Design phase===\n[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|thumb|This 1963 model depicts the second LEM design, which gave rise to informal references as \"the bug\".]]\nThe Apollo Lunar Module was chiefly designed by Grumman aerospace engineer [[Thomas J.

Kelly, 72, Dies; Father of Lunar Module|first=Warren E.|last=Leary|date=27 March 2002|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> The first LEM design looked like a smaller version of the [[Apollo command and service module]] (a cone-shaped cabin atop a cylindrical propulsion section) with folding legs. The second design invoked the idea of a helicopter cockpit with large curved windows and seats, to improve the astronauts' visibility for hover and landing. This also included a second, forward docking port, allowing the LEM crew to take an active role in docking with the CSM.\n\nAs the program continued, there were numerous redesigns to save weight, improve safety, and fix problems. First to go were the heavy cockpit windows and the seats; the astronauts would stand while flying the LEM, supported by a cable and pulley system, with smaller triangular windows giving them sufficient visibility of the landing site. Later, the redundant forward docking port was removed, which meant the Command Pilot gave up active control of the docking to the Command Module Pilot; he could still see the approaching CSM through a small overhead window. Egress while wearing bulky [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-Vehicular Activity]] (EVA) spacesuits was eased by a simpler forward hatch (32 x 32 inches).\n\nThe configuration was frozen in April 1963, when the ascent and descent engine designs were decided. In addition to Rocketdyne, a parallel program for the descent engine was ordered from [[TRW Inc.#Space exploration|Space Technology Laboratories (TRW)]] in July 1963, and by January 1965 the Rocketdyne contract was canceled.\n\nPower was initially to be produced by [[fuel cell]]s built by [[Pratt and Whitney]] similar to the CSM, but in March 1965 these were discarded in favor of an all-battery design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|title=LM Electrical|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201084039/http://astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|archivedate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n<!-- {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} -->\n\nThe initial design had three landing legs, the lightest possible configuration. But as any particular leg would have to carry the weight of the vehicle if it landed at a significant angle, this was also the least stable configuration if one of the legs were damaged during landing. The next landing gear design iteration had five legs and was the most stable configuration for landing on an unknown terrain. That configuration, however, was too heavy and the designers compromised on four landing legs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmlggear.htm|title=LM Landing Gear|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201083530/http://astronautix.com/craft/lmlggear.htm|archivedate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n<!-- {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} -->\n\nIn June 1966, the name was changed to lunar module (LM), eliminating the word \"excursion\".<ref>{{cite web |title=SP-4402 Origins of NASA Names |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4402/ch4.htm |website=NASA History |publisher=NASA |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>Scheer, Julian W.

Successful testing of two LLRV prototypes at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] led in 1966 to three production Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV) which along with the LLRV's were used to train the astronauts at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center. This aircraft proved fairly dangerous to fly, as three of the five were destroyed in crashes. It was equipped with a rocket-powered ejection seat, so in each case the pilot survived, including the first man to walk on the Moon, [[Neil Armstrong]].<ref name=\"ugly\">{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LLRV.html|title=LLRV Monograph|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Development flights===\n[[File:67-H-1230 Lunar module LTA-2 R.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 6]] Lunar Module Test Article (LTA-2R) shortly before being mated with the SLA]]\n\nLM-1 was built to make the first uncrewed flight for propulsion systems testing, launched into low Earth orbit atop a [[Saturn IB]]. This was originally planned for April 1967, to be followed by the first crewed flight later that year. But the LM's development problems had been underestimated, and LM-1's flight was delayed until January 22, 1968, as [[Apollo 5]]. At that time, LM-2 was held in reserve in case the LM-1 flight failed, which did not happen.\n\nLM-3 now became the first crewed LM, again to be flown in low Earth orbit to test all the systems, and practice the separation, rendezvous, and docking planned for Apollo 8 in December 1968. But again, last-minute problems delayed its flight until [[Apollo 9]] on March 3, 1969. A second, higher Earth orbit crewed practice flight had been planned to follow LM-3, but this was canceled to keep the program timeline on track.\n\n[[Apollo 10]] launched on May 18, 1969, using LM-4 for a \"dress rehearsal\" for the lunar landing, practicing all phases of the mission except powered descent initiation through takeoff. The LM descended to {{convert|47400|ft|mi km|1}} above the lunar surface, then jettisoned the descent stage and used its ascent engine to return to the CSM.<ref name='chariots11-2'>{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/contents.html|title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft|author1=Courtney G.

Four days later, the Apollo 11 crew in the Command Module ''Columbia'' splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, completing [[Apollo Program#Background|President John F. Kennedy's goal]]: \"...before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\".\n\nThis was followed by landings by [[Apollo 12]] ''(Intrepid)'' and [[Apollo 14]] ''(Antares)''.[[File:Apollo 11 Lunar Module Eagle in landing configuration in lunar orbit from the Command and Service Module Columbia.jpg|thumb|The Apollo 11 lunar module ''Eagle'' in lunar orbit]]In April 1970, the [[Apollo 13]] lunar module ''Aquarius'' played an unexpected role in saving the lives of the three astronauts after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module|service module]] ruptured, disabling the CSM. ''Aquarius'' served as a \"lifeboat\" for the astronauts during their return to Earth. Its [[Descent Propulsion System|descent stage engine]] was used to replace the crippled CSM Service Propulsion System engine, and its batteries supplied power for the trip home and recharged the Command Module's batteries critical for reentry. The astronauts splashed down safely on April 17, 1970. The LM's systems, designed to support two astronauts for 45 hours (including twice depressurization and repressurization causing loss of oxygen supply), actually stretched to support three astronauts for 90 hours (without depressurization and repressurization and loss of oxygen supply).\n\nHover times were maximized on the last four landing missions by using the Service Module engine to perform the initial descent orbit insertion burn 22 hours before the LM separated from the CSM, a practice begun on Apollo 14. This meant that the complete spacecraft, including the CSM, orbited the Moon with a {{convert|9.1|nmi|km|adj=on}} perilune, enabling the LM to begin its powered descent from that altitude with a full load of descent stage propellant, leaving more reserve propellant for the final approach. The CSM would then raise its perilune back to the normal {{convert|60|nmi|km}}.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = McDivitt\n | first = James A.\n | authorlink = James McDivitt\n | title = Apollo 14 Mission Report\n | chapter = 6.

The descent engine thrust was increased by the addition of a {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=on}} extension to the engine bell, and the descent propellant tanks were enlarged. A waste storage tank was added to the descent stage, with plumbing from the ascent stage. These upgrades allowed stays of up to 75 hours on the Moon.\n\nThe [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] was folded up and carried in Quadrant 1 of the descent stage. It was deployed by the astronauts after landing, allowing them to explore large areas and return a greater variety of lunar samples.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:Lunar Module diagram.jpg|thumb|Lunar module diagram]]\n[[File:Apollo Lunar Module Inside View.jpg|thumb|Lunar module crew cabin]]\n[[File:Apollo LM crew rest positions.jpg|thumb|right|Astronaut rest (sleeping) accommodation]]\n[[File:LM illustration 02.jpg|thumb|Lunar module cutaway illustration]]\nWeights given here are an average for the original pre-ELM spec vehicles. For specific weights for each mission, see the individual mission articles.\n\n===Ascent stage===\nThe ascent stage contained the crew cabin with instrument panels and flight controls. It contained its own [[Ascent Propulsion System]] (APS) engine and two [[hypergolic propellant]] tanks for return to lunar orbit and rendezvous with the [[Apollo command and service module]]. It also contained a Reaction Control System (RCS) for [[attitude control|attitude]] and [[translation (geometry)|translation]] control, which consisted of sixteen hypergolic thrusters similar to those used on the Service Module, mounted in four quads, with their own propellant supply. A forward EVA hatch provided access to and from the lunar surface, while an overhead hatch and docking port provided access to and from the Command Module.\n\nInternal equipment included an environmental control (life support) system; a VHF communications system with two antennas for communication with the Command Module; a [[unified S-band]] system and steerable [[parabolic antenna|parabolic dish antenna]] for communication with Earth; an EVA antenna resembling a miniature parasol which relayed communications from antennas on the astronauts' [[Primary life support system|Portable Life Support System]]s through the LM; [[Apollo PGNCS|primary (PGNCS)]] and [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|backup (AGS)]] guidance and navigation systems; an [[Apollo PGNCS#Optical unit|Alignment Optical Telescope]] for visually determining the spacecraft orientation; rendezvous radar with its own steerable dish antenna; and an system for active thermal control. Electrical storage batteries, cooling water, and breathing oxygen were stored in amounts sufficient for a lunar surface stay of 48 hours initially, extended to 75 hours for the later missions.\n\nDuring rest periods while parked on the Moon, the crew would sleep on hammocks slung crosswise in the cabin.\n\nThe return payload included the lunar rock and soil samples collected by the crew (as much as {{convert|238|lb|kg}} on Apollo 17), plus their exposed [[photographic film]].\n\n* Crew: 2\n* Crew cabin volume: {{convert|235|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}\n* Habitable volume: {{convert|160|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}\n* Crew compartment height: {{convert|7|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Crew compartment depth: {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Height: {{convert|9|ft|3.5|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Width: {{convert|14|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Depth: {{convert|13|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Mass, dry: {{convert|4740|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Mass, gross: {{convert|10300|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Atmosphere: 100% oxygen at {{convert|4.8|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}\n* Water: two {{convert|42.5|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} storage tanks\n* Coolant: {{convert|25|lb|kg}} of [[ethylene glycol]] / water solution\n* Thermal Control: one active water-ice sublimator\n* RCS propellant mass: {{convert|633|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* RCS thrusters: sixteen x {{convert|100|lbf|N|abbr=on}} in four quads\n* RCS propellants: [[Aerozine 50]] fuel / [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|nitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) oxidizer\n* RCS [[specific impulse]]: {{cvt|290|isp}}\n* APS propellant mass: {{convert|5,187|lb|kg|abbr=on}} stored in two {{convert|36|ft3|m3|adj=on|sigfig=3}} propellant tanks \n* APS engine: [[Bell Aircraft|Bell Aerospace]] [[Ascent Propulsion System|LM Ascent Engine]] (LMAE) and [[Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne]] LMAE Injectors\n* APS thrust: {{convert|3,500|lbf|N|abbr=on}} <!-- made consistent with infobox -->\n* APS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n* APS pressurant: two {{convert|6.4|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} helium tanks at {{convert|3000|psi|MPa}}\n* APS [[specific impulse]]: {{cvt|311|isp}}\n* APS [[Delta-v|delta-V]]: {{convert|7,280|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}\n* [[Thrust-to-weight ratio]] at liftoff: 2.124 (in lunar gravity)\n* Batteries: two 28\u201332 volt, 296 [[ampere-hour]] [[Silver-zinc batteries]]; {{convert|125|lb|kg|abbr=on}} each\n* Power: 28 V DC, 115 V 400&nbsp;Hz AC\n\n===Descent stage===\n[[File:Scale model of the Apollo Lunar Module.jpg|thumb|Scale model of the Apollo Lunar Module at the [[Euro Space Center]] in Belgium]]\n[[File:Apollo 11 gold reverse.jpeg|thumb|The Lunar Module ''Eagle'' is portrayed on the 2019 United States [[Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins (United States)|Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins]]]]\nThe descent stage's primary job was to support a powered landing and surface extravehicular activity. When the excursion was over, it served as the launch pad for the ascent stage. Its octagonal shape was supported by four folding landing gear legs, and contained a [[throttle]]able [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS) engine with four [[hypergolic propellant]] tanks. A [[continuous-wave radar|continuous-wave]] [[Doppler radar]] antenna was mounted by the engine [[heat shield]] on the bottom surface, to send altitude and rate of descent data to the guidance system and pilot display during the landing. Almost all external surfaces, except for the top, platform, ladder, descent engine and heat shield, were covered in amber, dark (reddish) amber, black, silver, and yellow aluminized [[Kapton]] foil blankets for thermal insulation. The number 1 (front) landing leg had an attached platform (informally known as the \"porch\") in front of the ascent stage's EVA hatch and a ladder, which the astronauts used to ascend and descend between the cabin to the surface. The footpad of each landing leg incorporated a {{convert|67|in|m|adj=mid|-long}} surface contact sensor probe, which signaled the commander to switch off the descent engine. (The probe was omitted from the number 1 leg of every landing mission, to avoid a suit-puncture hazard to the astronauts, as the probes tended to break off and protrude upwards from the surface.)\n\nEquipment for the lunar exploration was carried in the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA), a drawer mounted on a hinged panel dropping out of the lefthand forward compartment. Besides the astronaut's surface excavation tools and sample collection boxes, the MESA contained a television camera with a tripod; as the commander opened the MESA by pulling on a lanyard while descending the ladder, the camera was automatically activated to send the first pictures of the astronauts on the surface back to Earth. A [[Lunar Flag Assembly|United States flag]] for the astronauts to erect on the surface was carried in a container mounted on the ladder of each landing mission.\n\nThe Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package (EASEP) (later the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP)), was carried in the opposite compartment behind the LM. An external compartment on the right front panel carried a deployable S-band antenna which, when opened looked like an inverted umbrella on a tripod. This was not used on the first landing due to time constraints, and the fact that acceptable communications were being received using the LM's S-band antenna, but was used on Apollo 12 and 14. A hand-pulled [[Modular Equipment Transporter]] (MET), similar in appearance to a golf cart, was carried on Apollo 13 and 14 to facilitate carrying the tools and samples on extended moonwalks. On the extended missions ([[Apollo 15]] and later), the antenna and TV camera were mounted on the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], which was carried folded up and mounted on an external panel. Compartments also contained replacement [[Primary Life Support System|Portable Life Support System]] (PLSS) batteries and extra lithium hydroxide canisters on the extended missions.\n\n* Height: {{convert|10|ft|7.2|in|m|abbr=on}} (plus {{convert|5|ft|7.2|in|m|abbr=on}} landing probes)\n* Width/depth, minus landing gear: {{convert|13|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Width/depth, landing gear extended: {{convert|31.0|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n* Mass including propellant: {{convert|22,783|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Water: one {{convert|151|kg|lb|adj=on|abbr=on}} storage tank\n* DPS propellant mass: {{convert|18,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} stored in four {{convert|67.3|ft3|m3|adj=on|sigfig=4}} propellant tanks\n* DPS engine: [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] [[Descent Propulsion System|LM descent engine (LMDE)]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/tr201.htm |title=TR-201 for Delta rocket second stage derived from LMDE |date=1972 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706190928/http://astronautix.com/engines/tr201.htm |archivedate=2008-07-06 }}</ref>\n* DPS thrust: {{convert|10,125|lbf|N|abbr=on}}, throttleable between 10% and 60% of full thrust\n* DPS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n* DPS pressurant: one {{convert|49|lb|kg|adj=on}} supercritical helium tank at {{convert|1555|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}\n* DPS [[specific impulse]]: 311 s (3,050 N\u22c5s/kg)\n* DPS [[Delta-v|delta-V]]: {{convert|8,100|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}\n* Batteries: four (Apollo 9-14) or five (Apollo 15-17) 28\u201332 V, 415 A\u22c5h silver-zinc batteries; {{convert|135|lb|kg|abbr=on}} each\n\n==Lunar modules produced==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This would have been launched on an uncrewed Saturn 1B, and docked with a crewed [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]], named the Apollo Telescope Mission (ATM).\n\nThis idea was later transferred to the original [[wet workshop]] design for the ''[[Skylab]]'' orbital workshop and renamed the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] to be docked on a side port of the workshop's multiple docking adapter (MDA). When Skylab changed to a \"dry workshop\" design pre-fabricated on the ground and launched on a Saturn V, the telescope was mounted on a hinged arm and controlled from inside the MDA. Only the octagonal shape of the telescope container, solar panels and the Apollo Telescope Mount name were kept, though there was no longer any association with the LM.\n\n===LM Truck===\nThe Apollo LM Truck (also known as Lunar Payload Module) was a stand-alone LM descent stage intended to deliver up to {{convert|11000|lb|t}} of payload to the Moon for an uncrewed landing. This technique was intended to deliver equipment and supplies to a permanent crewed [[lunar base]]. As originally proposed, it would be launched on a Saturn V with a full Apollo crew to accompany it to lunar orbit and guide it to a landing next to the base; then the base crew would unload the \"truck\" while the orbiting crew returned to Earth.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm Apollo LM Truck on Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215210907/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm |date=2005-12-15 }} \u2013 Description of adapted LM descent stage for the uncrewed transport of cargo to a permanent lunar base.</ref> In later AAP plans, the LPM would have been delivered by an uncrewed lunar ferry vehicle.\n\n==Depiction in film and television==\nThe 1995 Ron Howard film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', a dramatization of that mission starring [[Tom Hanks]], [[Kevin Bacon]], and [[Bill Paxton]], was filmed using realistic spacecraft interior reconstructions of the ''Aquarius'' and the Command Module ''Odyssey''.\n\nThe development and construction of the lunar module is dramatized in the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled [[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|\"Spider\"]]. This is in reference to LM-3, used on Apollo 9, which the crew named ''Spider'' after its spidery appearance.

It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate exclusively in the airless vacuum of space, and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth.\n\nStructurally and aerodynamically incapable of flight through Earth's atmosphere, the two-stage lunar module was ferried to lunar orbit attached to the [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM), about twice its mass. Its crew of two flew the complete lunar module from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface.  During takeoff, the spent descent stage was used as a launch pad for the ascent stage which then [[Lunar orbit rendezvous|flew back to the command module]], after which it was also discarded.\n\nOverseen by [[Grumman Aircraft]], the LM's development was plagued with problems that delayed its first uncrewed flight by about ten months and its first crewed flight by about three months. Still, the LM became the most reliable component of the Apollo/Saturn [[space vehicle]], the only component never to suffer a failure that could not be corrected in time to prevent abort of a landing mission.<ref>''Moon Race: The History of Apollo'' DVD, Columbia River Entertainment (Portland, Oregon, 2007)</ref>  The total cost of the LM for development and the units produced was $21.3 billion in 2016 dollars, adjusting from a nominal total of $2.2 billion<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://georgetyson.com/files/apollostatistics.pdf|title=Apollo by the Numbers|last=Orloff|first=Richard|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year=1996|isbn=|location=|page=22}}</ref> using the NASA New Start Inflation Indices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/2013_NNSI_FY14(1).xlsx|title=NASA New Start Inflation Indices|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTen lunar modules were launched into space. Of these, six landed humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. The first two launched were test flights in [[low Earth orbit]]\u2014the first without a crew, the second with one. Another was used by [[Apollo 10]] for a dress rehearsal flight in low lunar orbit, without landing. One lunar module functioned as a lifeboat for the crew of [[Apollo 13]], providing life support and propulsion when their CSM was disabled by an oxygen tank explosion en route to the Moon, forcing the crew to abandon plans for landing.\n\nThe six landed descent stages remain at their landing sites; their corresponding ascent stages crashed into the Moon following use. One ascent stage (Apollo 10's ''Snoopy'') was discarded in a [[heliocentric orbit]] after its descent stage was discarded in lunar orbit.  The other three LMs were burned up in the Earth's atmosphere: the four stages of [[Apollo 5]] and [[Apollo 9]] each re-entered separately, while Apollo 13's ''Aquarius'' re-entered complete, following emergency maneuvers.\n\n==Operational profile==\nAt launch, the lunar module sat directly beneath the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM) with legs folded, inside the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft\u2013lunar module adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft-to-LM adapter (SLA)]] attached to the [[S-IVB]] third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket. There it remained through Earth parking orbit and the [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI) rocket burn to send the craft toward the Moon.\n\nSoon after TLI, the SLA opened; the CSM separated, turned around, came back to dock with the lunar module, and extracted it from the S-IVB. During the flight to the Moon, the docking hatches were opened and the lunar module pilot entered the LM to temporarily power up and test all systems except propulsion. The lunar module pilot performed the role of an engineering officer, monitoring the systems of both spacecraft.\n\nAfter achieving a lunar parking orbit, the commander and LM pilot entered and powered up the LM, replaced the hatches and docking equipment, unfolded and locked its landing legs, and separated from the CSM, flying independently. The commander operated the flight controls and engine throttle, while the lunar module pilot operated other spacecraft systems and kept the commander informed about systems status and navigational information. After the command module pilot visually inspected the [[Landing gear (spaceflight)|landing gear]], the LM was withdrawn to a safe distance, then rotated until the descent engine was pointed forward into the direction of travel. A 30-second descent orbit insertion burn was performed to reduce speed and drop the LM's [[perilune]] to within about {{convert|50000|ft|km}} of the surface,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11g_Lunar_Orbit_Phase.htm|title=Apollo 11 Lunar Orbit Phase|publisher=}}</ref> about {{convert|260|nmi|km}} uprange of the landing site.\n\n[[File:Earth, Moon and Lunar Module, AS11-44-6643.jpg|thumb|''Eagle'', the lunar module ascent stage of [[Apollo 11]], in orbit above the Moon. Earth is visible in the distance. Photograph by [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]].]]\n\nAs the craft approached perilune, the engine was started again to begin powered descent. During this time, the crew flew on their backs, depending on the computer to slow the craft's forward and vertical velocity to near zero. Control was exercised with a combination of engine throttling and attitude thrusters, guided by the computer with the aid of landing radar. During braking, the LM descended to about {{convert|10000|ft|km}}, then, in the final approach phase, down to about {{convert|700|ft|m}}. During final approach, the vehicle pitched over to a near-vertical position, allowing the crew to look forward and down to see the lunar surface for the first time.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last = Gatland\n| first = Kenneth\n| title = Manned Spacecraft, Second Revision\n| publisher = Macmillan Publishing Co.\n| location = New York\n| year = 1976\n| pages = 194\u2013196\n| isbn = 0-02-542820-9 }}\n</ref>\n\nAstronauts flew Apollo spacecraft manually only during the lunar approach.<ref name=\"agle199809\">{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D.C. |date=September 1998 |title=Flying the Gusmobile |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/flying-the-gusmobile-218187/ |magazine=Air & Space |language=en |access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> The final landing phase began about {{convert|2000|ft|km}} uprange of the targeted landing site. At this point, manual control was enabled for the commander, who had enough [[liquid rocket propellant|propellant]] to hover for up to two minutes to survey where the computer was taking the craft and make any necessary corrections. If necessary, landing could have been aborted at almost any time by jettisoning the descent stage and firing the ascent engine to climb back into orbit for an emergency return to the CSM. Finally, one or more of three {{convert|67.2|in|m|adj=on}} probes extending from footpads on the legs of the lander touched the surface, activating the contact indicator light which signaled the commander to manually shut off the descent engine, allowing the LM to settle onto the surface. On touchdown, the probes would be bent as much as 180 degrees, or even break off. The original design used the probes on all four legs, but starting with the first landing (LM-5 on Apollo 11), the one at the ladder was removed out of concern that the bent probe after landing might puncture an astronaut's suit as he descended or stepped off the ladder.\n\nThe original [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) plan, up through at least 1966, was for only one astronaut to leave the LM while the other remained inside \"to maintain communications\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UuRCwsGugg&t=3m20s Landing on the Moon], 1966 episode of MIT's ''Science Reporter'' (posted to YouTube by MIT on Jan 20, 2016)<br />Quote:<br />\"While one astronaut explores the area around the LEM, the second remains inside to maintain communications.\"</ref> Communications were eventually deemed to be reliable enough to allow both crew members to walk on the surface, leaving the spacecraft to be only remotely attended by Mission Control.\n\nBeginning with [[Apollo 14]], extra LM propellant was made available for the powered descent and landing, by using the CSM engine to achieve the {{convert|50000|ft|km|adj=on}} perilune. After the spacecraft undocked, the CSM raised and circularized its orbit for the remainder of the mission.\n\nWhen ready to leave the Moon, the LM's ascent engine fired, leaving the descent stage on the Moon's surface. After a few course correction burns, the LM rendezvoused with the CSM and docked to transfer the crew and rock samples. Having completed its job, the ascent stage was separated. The Apollo 10 ascent stage engine was fired until its fuel was used up, sending it past the Moon into a [[heliocentric orbit]].<ref name=\"nasa_apollo10\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html |title=Apollo 10 |editor-last=Ryba |editor-first=Jeanne |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"disposition\">{{cite web|title=Current locations of the Apollo Command Module Capsules (and Lunar Module crash sites)|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apolloloc.html|website=Apollo: Where are they now?|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref> The [[Apollo 11]] ascent stage was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash; all subsequent ascent stages (except for Apollo 13) were intentionally steered into the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the surface.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Joseph Francis Shea.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1962 model of the first LEM design, docked to the command and service module. The model is held by [[Joseph Francis Shea|Joseph Shea]], the key engineer behind the adoption of [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission logistics.]]\nThe lunar module (originally designated the lunar excursion module, known by the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] LEM) was designed after NASA [[Project Apollo#Choosing a mission mode|chose to reach the Moon]] via [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] (LOR) instead of the [[direct ascent]] or [[Earth Orbit Rendezvous]] (EOR) methods. Both direct ascent and EOR would have involved landing a much heavier, complete Apollo spacecraft on the Moon. Once the decision had been made to proceed using LOR, it became necessary to produce a separate craft capable of reaching the lunar surface and ascending back to lunar orbit.\n\n===Contract letting===\nIn July 1962, eleven firms were invited to submit proposals for the LEM. Nine companies responded in September, answering 20 questions posed by the NASA RFP in a 60-page limited technical proposal. [[Grumman Aircraft]] was awarded the contract two months later. Grumman had begun lunar orbit rendezvous studies in the late 1950s and again in 1961. The contract cost was expected to be around $350 million. There were initially four major subcontractors: [[Bell Aerosystems]] ([[Ascent Propulsion System|ascent engine]]), [[Hamilton Standard]] (environmental control systems), [[Marquardt Corporation|Marquardt]] (reaction control system) and [[TRW Inc.|TRW's]] [[Space Technology Laboratories]] ([[Descent Propulsion System|descent engine]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch6-5.html |title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft; Engines, Large and Small |author1=Courtney G.

A backup navigation tool, the [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|Abort Guidance System]] (AGS), was developed by TRW.\n\n===Design phase===\n[[File:Lunar Lander Model.jpg|thumb|This 1963 model depicts the second LEM design, which gave rise to informal references as \"the bug\".]]\nThe Apollo Lunar Module was chiefly designed by Grumman aerospace engineer [[Thomas J. Kelly (aerospace engineer)|Thomas J. Kelly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/27/nyregion/t-j-kelly-72-dies-father-of-lunar-module.html|title=T. J. Kelly, 72, Dies; Father of Lunar Module|first=Warren E.|last=Leary|date=27 March 2002|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> The first LEM design looked like a smaller version of the [[Apollo command and service module]] (a cone-shaped cabin atop a cylindrical propulsion section) with folding legs. The second design invoked the idea of a helicopter cockpit with large curved windows and seats, to improve the astronauts' visibility for hover and landing. This also included a second, forward docking port, allowing the LEM crew to take an active role in docking with the CSM.\n\nAs the program continued, there were numerous redesigns to save weight, improve safety, and fix problems. First to go were the heavy cockpit windows and the seats; the astronauts would stand while flying the LEM, supported by a cable and pulley system, with smaller triangular windows giving them sufficient visibility of the landing site. Later, the redundant forward docking port was removed, which meant the Command Pilot gave up active control of the docking to the Command Module Pilot; he could still see the approaching CSM through a small overhead window. Egress while wearing bulky [[Extra-vehicular activity|Extra-Vehicular Activity]] (EVA) spacesuits was eased by a simpler forward hatch (32 x 32 inches).\n\nThe configuration was frozen in April 1963, when the ascent and descent engine designs were decided. In addition to Rocketdyne, a parallel program for the descent engine was ordered from [[TRW Inc.#Space exploration|Space Technology Laboratories (TRW)]] in July 1963, and by January 1965 the Rocketdyne contract was canceled.\n\nPower was initially to be produced by [[fuel cell]]s built by [[Pratt and Whitney]] similar to the CSM, but in March 1965 these were discarded in favor of an all-battery design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|title=LM Electrical|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201084039/http://astronautix.com/craft/lmerical.htm|archivedate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n<!-- {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} -->\n\nThe initial design had three landing legs, the lightest possible configuration. But as any particular leg would have to carry the weight of the vehicle if it landed at a significant angle, this was also the least stable configuration if one of the legs were damaged during landing. The next landing gear design iteration had five legs and was the most stable configuration for landing on an unknown terrain. That configuration, however, was too heavy and the designers compromised on four landing legs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmlggear.htm|title=LM Landing Gear|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201083530/http://astronautix.com/craft/lmlggear.htm|archivedate=2010-02-01}}</ref>\n<!-- {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} -->\n\nIn June 1966, the name was changed to lunar module (LM), eliminating the word \"excursion\".<ref>{{cite web |title=SP-4402 Origins of NASA Names |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4402/ch4.htm |website=NASA History |publisher=NASA |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>Scheer, Julian W.

Successful testing of two LLRV prototypes at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] led in 1966 to three production Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV) which along with the LLRV's were used to train the astronauts at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center. This aircraft proved fairly dangerous to fly, as three of the five were destroyed in crashes. It was equipped with a rocket-powered ejection seat, so in each case the pilot survived, including the first man to walk on the Moon, [[Neil Armstrong]].<ref name=\"ugly\">{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-LLRV.html|title=LLRV Monograph|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Development flights===\n[[File:67-H-1230 Lunar module LTA-2 R.jpg|thumb|The [[Apollo 6]] Lunar Module Test Article (LTA-2R) shortly before being mated with the SLA]]\n\nLM-1 was built to make the first uncrewed flight for propulsion systems testing, launched into low Earth orbit atop a [[Saturn IB]]. This was originally planned for April 1967, to be followed by the first crewed flight later that year. But the LM's development problems had been underestimated, and LM-1's flight was delayed until January 22, 1968, as [[Apollo 5]]. At that time, LM-2 was held in reserve in case the LM-1 flight failed, which did not happen.\n\nLM-3 now became the first crewed LM, again to be flown in low Earth orbit to test all the systems, and practice the separation, rendezvous, and docking planned for Apollo 8 in December 1968. But again, last-minute problems delayed its flight until [[Apollo 9]] on March 3, 1969. A second, higher Earth orbit crewed practice flight had been planned to follow LM-3, but this was canceled to keep the program timeline on track.\n\n[[Apollo 10]] launched on May 18, 1969, using LM-4 for a \"dress rehearsal\" for the lunar landing, practicing all phases of the mission except powered descent initiation through takeoff. The LM descended to {{convert|47400|ft|mi km|1}} above the lunar surface, then jettisoned the descent stage and used its ascent engine to return to the CSM.<ref name='chariots11-2'>{{cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/contents.html|title=Chariots for Apollo: A History of Manned Lunar Spacecraft|author1=Courtney G.

Four days later, the Apollo 11 crew in the Command Module ''Columbia'' splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, completing [[Apollo Program#Background|President John F. Kennedy's goal]]: \"...before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\".\n\nThis was followed by landings by [[Apollo 12]] ''(Intrepid)'' and [[Apollo 14]] ''(Antares)''.[[File:Apollo 11 Lunar Module Eagle in landing configuration in lunar orbit from the Command and Service Module Columbia.jpg|thumb|The Apollo 11 lunar module ''Eagle'' in lunar orbit]]In April 1970, the [[Apollo 13]] lunar module ''Aquarius'' played an unexpected role in saving the lives of the three astronauts after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module|service module]] ruptured, disabling the CSM. ''Aquarius'' served as a \"lifeboat\" for the astronauts during their return to Earth. Its [[Descent Propulsion System|descent stage engine]] was used to replace the crippled CSM Service Propulsion System engine, and its batteries supplied power for the trip home and recharged the Command Module's batteries critical for reentry. The astronauts splashed down safely on April 17, 1970. The LM's systems, designed to support two astronauts for 45 hours (including twice depressurization and repressurization causing loss of oxygen supply), actually stretched to support three astronauts for 90 hours (without depressurization and repressurization and loss of oxygen supply).\n\nHover times were maximized on the last four landing missions by using the Service Module engine to perform the initial descent orbit insertion burn 22 hours before the LM separated from the CSM, a practice begun on Apollo 14. This meant that the complete spacecraft, including the CSM, orbited the Moon with a {{convert|9.1|nmi|km|adj=on}} perilune, enabling the LM to begin its powered descent from that altitude with a full load of descent stage propellant, leaving more reserve propellant for the final approach. The CSM would then raise its perilune back to the normal {{convert|60|nmi|km}}.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = McDivitt\n | first = James A.\n | authorlink = James McDivitt\n | title = Apollo 14 Mission Report\n | chapter = 6.

The descent engine thrust was increased by the addition of a {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=on}} extension to the engine bell, and the descent propellant tanks were enlarged. A waste storage tank was added to the descent stage, with plumbing from the ascent stage. These upgrades allowed stays of up to 75 hours on the Moon.\n\nThe [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] was folded up and carried in Quadrant 1 of the descent stage. It was deployed by the astronauts after landing, allowing them to explore large areas and return a greater variety of lunar samples.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:Lunar Module diagram.jpg|thumb|Lunar module diagram]]\n[[File:Apollo Lunar Module Inside View.jpg|thumb|Lunar module crew cabin]]\n[[File:Apollo LM crew rest positions.jpg|thumb|right|Astronaut rest (sleeping) accommodation]]\n[[File:LM illustration 02.jpg|thumb|Lunar module cutaway illustration]]\nWeights given here are an average for the original pre-ELM spec vehicles. For specific weights for each mission, see the individual mission articles.\n\n===Ascent stage===\nThe ascent stage contained the crew cabin with instrument panels and flight controls. It contained its own [[Ascent Propulsion System]] (APS) engine and two [[hypergolic propellant]] tanks for return to lunar orbit and rendezvous with the [[Apollo command and service module]]. It also contained a Reaction Control System (RCS) for [[attitude control|attitude]] and [[translation (geometry)|translation]] control, which consisted of sixteen hypergolic thrusters similar to those used on the Service Module, mounted in four quads, with their own propellant supply. A forward EVA hatch provided access to and from the lunar surface, while an overhead hatch and docking port provided access to and from the Command Module.\n\nInternal equipment included an environmental control (life support) system; a VHF communications system with two antennas for communication with the Command Module; a [[unified S-band]] system and steerable [[parabolic antenna|parabolic dish antenna]] for communication with Earth; an EVA antenna resembling a miniature parasol which relayed communications from antennas on the astronauts' [[Primary life support system|Portable Life Support System]]s through the LM; [[Apollo PGNCS|primary (PGNCS)]] and [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|backup (AGS)]] guidance and navigation systems; an [[Apollo PGNCS#Optical unit|Alignment Optical Telescope]] for visually determining the spacecraft orientation; rendezvous radar with its own steerable dish antenna; and an system for active thermal control. Electrical storage batteries, cooling water, and breathing oxygen were stored in amounts sufficient for a lunar surface stay of 48 hours initially, extended to 75 hours for the later missions.\n\nDuring rest periods while parked on the Moon, the crew would sleep on hammocks slung crosswise in the cabin.\n\nThe return payload included the lunar rock and soil samples collected by the crew (as much as {{convert|238|lb|kg}} on Apollo 17), plus their exposed [[photographic film]].\n\n* Crew: 2\n* Crew cabin volume: {{convert|235|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}\n* Habitable volume: {{convert|160|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}\n* Crew compartment height: {{convert|7|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Crew compartment depth: {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Height: {{convert|9|ft|3.5|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Width: {{convert|14|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Depth: {{convert|13|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Mass, dry: {{convert|4740|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Mass, gross: {{convert|10300|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Atmosphere: 100% oxygen at {{convert|4.8|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}\n* Water: two {{convert|42.5|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} storage tanks\n* Coolant: {{convert|25|lb|kg}} of [[ethylene glycol]] / water solution\n* Thermal Control: one active water-ice sublimator\n* RCS propellant mass: {{convert|633|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* RCS thrusters: sixteen x {{convert|100|lbf|N|abbr=on}} in four quads\n* RCS propellants: [[Aerozine 50]] fuel / [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|nitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) oxidizer\n* RCS [[specific impulse]]: {{cvt|290|isp}}\n* APS propellant mass: {{convert|5,187|lb|kg|abbr=on}} stored in two {{convert|36|ft3|m3|adj=on|sigfig=3}} propellant tanks \n* APS engine: [[Bell Aircraft|Bell Aerospace]] [[Ascent Propulsion System|LM Ascent Engine]] (LMAE) and [[Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne]] LMAE Injectors\n* APS thrust: {{convert|3,500|lbf|N|abbr=on}} <!-- made consistent with infobox -->\n* APS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n* APS pressurant: two {{convert|6.4|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} helium tanks at {{convert|3000|psi|MPa}}\n* APS [[specific impulse]]: {{cvt|311|isp}}\n* APS [[Delta-v|delta-V]]: {{convert|7,280|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}\n* [[Thrust-to-weight ratio]] at liftoff: 2.124 (in lunar gravity)\n* Batteries: two 28\u201332 volt, 296 [[ampere-hour]] [[Silver-zinc batteries]]; {{convert|125|lb|kg|abbr=on}} each\n* Power: 28 V DC, 115 V 400&nbsp;Hz AC\n\n===Descent stage===\n[[File:Scale model of the Apollo Lunar Module.jpg|thumb|Scale model of the Apollo Lunar Module at the [[Euro Space Center]] in Belgium]]\n[[File:Apollo 11 gold reverse.jpeg|thumb|The Lunar Module ''Eagle'' is portrayed on the 2019 United States [[Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins (United States)|Apollo 11 50th Anniversary commemorative coins]]]]\nThe descent stage's primary job was to support a powered landing and surface extravehicular activity. When the excursion was over, it served as the launch pad for the ascent stage. Its octagonal shape was supported by four folding landing gear legs, and contained a [[throttle]]able [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS) engine with four [[hypergolic propellant]] tanks. A [[continuous-wave radar|continuous-wave]] [[Doppler radar]] antenna was mounted by the engine [[heat shield]] on the bottom surface, to send altitude and rate of descent data to the guidance system and pilot display during the landing. Almost all external surfaces, except for the top, platform, ladder, descent engine and heat shield, were covered in amber, dark (reddish) amber, black, silver, and yellow aluminized [[Kapton]] foil blankets for thermal insulation. The number 1 (front) landing leg had an attached platform (informally known as the \"porch\") in front of the ascent stage's EVA hatch and a ladder, which the astronauts used to ascend and descend between the cabin to the surface. The footpad of each landing leg incorporated a {{convert|67|in|m|adj=mid|-long}} surface contact sensor probe, which signaled the commander to switch off the descent engine. (The probe was omitted from the number 1 leg of every landing mission, to avoid a suit-puncture hazard to the astronauts, as the probes tended to break off and protrude upwards from the surface.)\n\nEquipment for the lunar exploration was carried in the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA), a drawer mounted on a hinged panel dropping out of the lefthand forward compartment. Besides the astronaut's surface excavation tools and sample collection boxes, the MESA contained a television camera with a tripod; as the commander opened the MESA by pulling on a lanyard while descending the ladder, the camera was automatically activated to send the first pictures of the astronauts on the surface back to Earth. A [[Lunar Flag Assembly|United States flag]] for the astronauts to erect on the surface was carried in a container mounted on the ladder of each landing mission.\n\nThe Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package (EASEP) (later the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP)), was carried in the opposite compartment behind the LM. An external compartment on the right front panel carried a deployable S-band antenna which, when opened looked like an inverted umbrella on a tripod. This was not used on the first landing due to time constraints, and the fact that acceptable communications were being received using the LM's S-band antenna, but was used on Apollo 12 and 14. A hand-pulled [[Modular Equipment Transporter]] (MET), similar in appearance to a golf cart, was carried on Apollo 13 and 14 to facilitate carrying the tools and samples on extended moonwalks. On the extended missions ([[Apollo 15]] and later), the antenna and TV camera were mounted on the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]], which was carried folded up and mounted on an external panel. Compartments also contained replacement [[Primary Life Support System|Portable Life Support System]] (PLSS) batteries and extra lithium hydroxide canisters on the extended missions.\n\n* Height: {{convert|10|ft|7.2|in|m|abbr=on}} (plus {{convert|5|ft|7.2|in|m|abbr=on}} landing probes)\n* Width/depth, minus landing gear: {{convert|13|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}\n* Width/depth, landing gear extended: {{convert|31.0|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n* Mass including propellant: {{convert|22,783|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n* Water: one {{convert|151|kg|lb|adj=on|abbr=on}} storage tank\n* DPS propellant mass: {{convert|18,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} stored in four {{convert|67.3|ft3|m3|adj=on|sigfig=4}} propellant tanks\n* DPS engine: [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] [[Descent Propulsion System|LM descent engine (LMDE)]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/tr201.htm |title=TR-201 for Delta rocket second stage derived from LMDE |date=1972 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706190928/http://astronautix.com/engines/tr201.htm |archivedate=2008-07-06 }}</ref>\n* DPS thrust: {{convert|10,125|lbf|N|abbr=on}}, throttleable between 10% and 60% of full thrust\n* DPS propellants: Aerozine 50 fuel / nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer\n* DPS pressurant: one {{convert|49|lb|kg|adj=on}} supercritical helium tank at {{convert|1555|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}\n* DPS [[specific impulse]]: 311 s (3,050 N\u22c5s/kg)\n* DPS [[Delta-v|delta-V]]: {{convert|8,100|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}\n* Batteries: four (Apollo 9-14) or five (Apollo 15-17) 28\u201332 V, 415 A\u22c5h silver-zinc batteries; {{convert|135|lb|kg|abbr=on}} each\n\n==Lunar modules produced==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This would have been launched on an uncrewed Saturn 1B, and docked with a crewed [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]], named the Apollo Telescope Mission (ATM).\n\nThis idea was later transferred to the original [[wet workshop]] design for the ''[[Skylab]]'' orbital workshop and renamed the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] to be docked on a side port of the workshop's multiple docking adapter (MDA). When Skylab changed to a \"dry workshop\" design pre-fabricated on the ground and launched on a Saturn V, the telescope was mounted on a hinged arm and controlled from inside the MDA. Only the octagonal shape of the telescope container, solar panels and the Apollo Telescope Mount name were kept, though there was no longer any association with the LM.\n\n===LM Truck===\nThe Apollo LM Truck (also known as Lunar Payload Module) was a stand-alone LM descent stage intended to deliver up to {{convert|11000|lb|t}} of payload to the Moon for an uncrewed landing. This technique was intended to deliver equipment and supplies to a permanent crewed [[lunar base]]. As originally proposed, it would be launched on a Saturn V with a full Apollo crew to accompany it to lunar orbit and guide it to a landing next to the base; then the base crew would unload the \"truck\" while the orbiting crew returned to Earth.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm Apollo LM Truck on Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215210907/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/apotruck.htm |date=2005-12-15 }} \u2013 Description of adapted LM descent stage for the uncrewed transport of cargo to a permanent lunar base.</ref> In later AAP plans, the LPM would have been delivered by an uncrewed lunar ferry vehicle.\n\n==Depiction in film and television==\nThe 1995 Ron Howard film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', a dramatization of that mission starring [[Tom Hanks]], [[Kevin Bacon]], and [[Bill Paxton]], was filmed using realistic spacecraft interior reconstructions of the ''Aquarius'' and the Command Module ''Odyssey''.\n\nThe development and construction of the lunar module is dramatized in the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled [[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|\"Spider\"]]. This is in reference to LM-3, used on Apollo 9, which the crew named ''Spider'' after its spidery appearance. The unused LM-13 stood in during the teleplay to depict LM-3 and LM-5, ''Eagle'', used by Apollo 11.\n\n==Media==\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"110px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Lunar Module Equipment Locations 1 of 2.jpg|Equipment location plans (1 of 2)\nFile:Lunar Module Equipment Locations 2 of 2.jpg|Equipment location plans (2 of 2)\nFile:Lunar Module Control Displays.jpg|Controls plans\nFile:Lunar Module Landing Gear plans.jpg|Landing Gear plans\n</gallery>\n<gallery widths=\"350px\" heights=\"350px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Apollo 15 landing on the Moon.ogg|[[Apollo 15]] landing on the Moon seen from the perspective of the Lunar Module Pilot.
