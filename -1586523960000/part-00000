It was the 72nd edition of the 24 Hour race, as organised by the automotive group, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) since [[1923 24 Hours of Le Mans|1923]]. Unlike other events, it was not a part of any endurance motor racing championship. A test day was held eight weeks prior to the race on 25 April. Approximately 200,000 people attended the race.\n\nThe Audi Sport UK Team Veloqx [[Audi R8 (LMP)|R8]] of [[Jamie Davies]], [[Johnny Herbert]] and [[Guy Smith (racing driver)|Guy Smith]] started from [[pole position]] after Herbert set the overall fastest lap time in the fourth qualifying session. The car led for much of the first eighteen hours until a rear [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] problem created handling difficulties and was corrected in the garage. It gave the lead to the [[Team Goh|Audi Sport Japan Team Goh]] car of [[Seiji Ara]], [[Rinaldo Capello]] and [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]] and although it caught fire during a [[pit stop]], Ara held off the faster Herbert for the remainder of the race to win by 41.354 seconds. It was Ara's first Le Mans win, Capello's second and Kristensen's sixth. Kristensen equalled [[Jacky Ickx]]'s all-time record of six overall victories and was the first driver to win the 24 hour race five times in a row. This was the fourth overall victory for [[Audi]] since the manufacturer's d\u00e9but at the [[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|2000 edition]]. The Audi Sport UK Team Veloqx car finished in second and the [[Champion Racing]] trio of [[JJ Lehto]], [[Emanuele Pirro]] and [[Marco Werner]] recovered from a crash in the second hour to complete the overall podium finishers in third place.\n\nThe Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) category was won by the [[Intersport Racing]] [[Lola B2K/40]] car of [[William Harrison Binnie|William Bennie]], Clint Field and Rick Sutherland, eight laps ahead of the sole other finisher in the class, the [[Welter Racing|Rachel Welter]] WR LM2001 vehicle of [[Yojiro Terada]], Patrice Roussel and Olivier Porta. A [[Chevrolet Corvette C5-R]] driven by [[Olivier Beretta]], [[Oliver Gavin]] and [[Jan Magnussen]] won the Le Mans Grand Touring Sport (LMGTS) class and the sister car of [[Ron Fellows]], [[Max Papis]] and [[Johnny O'Connell]] was eleven laps behind in second place. [[Prodrive]]'s [[Ferrari 550|Ferrari 550-GTS Maranello]] of [[Colin McRae]], [[Rickard Rydell]] and [[Darren Turner]] completed the category podium in third position. Porsches took the first six places in the Le Mans Grand Touring (LMGT) category with the White Lighting Racing [[Porsche 911 GT3|Porsche 911 GT3-RS]] of [[J\u00f6rg Bergmeister]], [[Patrick Long]] and [[Sascha Maassen]] taking the class win for the second consecutive year.\n\n==Background and regulation changes==\n\nThe 2004 [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] was the 72nd edition of the race and took place at the {{Convert|8.482|mi|km|abbr=on}} [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] from 12 to 13 June.<ref name=PressInfo2018>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.lemans.org/explorer/pdf/courses/2018/24-heures-du-mans/press-kit/uk/statistiques-historiques-en.pdf|title=2018 24 Hours of Le Mans \u2013 Press Information|date=June 2018|publisher=[[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]]|pages=7, 10, 16 & 21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190623125350/https://assets.lemans.org/explorer/pdf/courses/2018/24-heures-du-mans/press-kit/uk/statistiques-historiques-en.pdf|archive-date=23 June 2019|url-status=live|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref> The automotive journalist [[Charles Faroux]] proposed the race to Georges Durand, the president of the automotive group, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO), and the industrialist Emile Coquile in 1922 to test vehicle reliability and fuel-efficiency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lemans.org/en/news/commemoration-of-the-90th-anniversary-of-the-le-mans-24-hours/9734|title=Commemoration of the 90th anniversary of the Le Mans 24 Hours|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Automobile Club de l'Ouest|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602163444/https://www.lemans.org/en/news/commemoration-of-the-90th-anniversary-of-the-le-mans-24-hours/9734|archive-date=2 June 2019|url-status=live|access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"RTLMHistory\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/news/a13113/le-mans-how-it-began/|title=Le Mans \u2014 How It Began|date=16 May 2007|website=[[Road & Track]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911022850/http://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/news/a13113/le-mans-how-it-began/|archive-date=11 September 2015|url-status=live|access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref> It is considered one of the world's most prestigious motor races and is part of the [[Triple Crown of Motorsport]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/le-mans-24-hours-attend-style/|title=An insider's guide to the Le Mans 24hours: how to experience the ultimate endurance race in style|last=Hargreaves|first=Eilidh|date=13 May 2019|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=2 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530203845/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/le-mans-24-hours-attend-style/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2003, the ACO announced changes to the [[Le Mans Prototype]] (LMP) classes that first took effect from the 2004 race.<ref name=DSC2004EngineRegs>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2003lemans/lemans022.htm|title=ACO Engine Rules|date=5 March 2003|publisher=DailySportsCar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617131431/http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2003lemans/lemans022.htm|archive-date=17 June 2019|url-status=live|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref> The former Le Mans Grand Touring Prototype and Le Mans Prototype 900 (LMP900) categories were merged and renamed Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) and was limited solely to manufacturers.

Fellows had a rear-left puncture on a crest on the Mulsanne Straight that threw the No. 63 Corvette into a barrier. The car sustained heavy damage to its rear and left-hand corner. [[Paul Belmondo]] crashed the No. 37 Courage C65 car when his vision became obscured by a thick dust cloud. The car sustained a puncture in its tub's front-right hand section and was retired in the garage.

(French: ''72<sup>e</sup> 24 Heures du Mans'') was an [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|automobile endurance race]] for [[Le Mans Prototype]] and [[Grand tourer|Grand Touring]] cars held from 12 to 13 June at the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] at [[Le Mans, France]]. It was the 72nd edition of the 24 Hour race, as organised by the automotive group, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) since [[1923 24 Hours of Le Mans|1923]]. Unlike other events, it was not a part of any endurance motor racing championship. A test day was held eight weeks prior to the race on 25 April. Approximately 200,000 people attended the race.\n\nThe Audi Sport UK Team Veloqx [[Audi R8 (LMP)|R8]] of [[Jamie Davies]], [[Johnny Herbert]] and [[Guy Smith (racing driver)|Guy Smith]] started from [[pole position]] after Herbert set the overall fastest lap time in the fourth qualifying session. The car led for much of the first eighteen hours until a rear [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] problem created handling difficulties and was corrected in the garage. It gave the lead to the [[Team Goh|Audi Sport Japan Team Goh]] car of [[Seiji Ara]], [[Rinaldo Capello]] and [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]] and although it caught fire during a [[pit stop]], Ara held off the faster Herbert for the remainder of the race to win by 41.354 seconds. It was Ara's first Le Mans win, Capello's second and Kristensen's sixth. Kristensen equalled [[Jacky Ickx]]'s all-time record of six overall victories and was the first driver to win the 24 hour race five times in a row. This was the fourth overall victory for [[Audi]] since the manufacturer's d\u00e9but at the [[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|2000 edition]]. The Audi Sport UK Team Veloqx car finished in second and the [[Champion Racing]] trio of [[JJ Lehto]], [[Emanuele Pirro]] and [[Marco Werner]] recovered from a crash in the second hour to complete the overall podium finishers in third place.\n\nThe Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) category was won by the [[Intersport Racing]] [[Lola B2K/40]] car of [[William Harrison Binnie|William Bennie]], Clint Field and Rick Sutherland, eight laps ahead of the sole other finisher in the class, the [[Welter Racing|Rachel Welter]] WR LM2001 vehicle of [[Yojiro Terada]], Patrice Roussel and Olivier Porta. A [[Chevrolet Corvette C5-R]] driven by [[Olivier Beretta]], [[Oliver Gavin]] and [[Jan Magnussen]] won the Le Mans Grand Touring Sport (LMGTS) class and the sister car of [[Ron Fellows]], [[Max Papis]] and [[Johnny O'Connell]] was eleven laps behind in second place. [[Prodrive]]'s [[Ferrari 550|Ferrari 550-GTS Maranello]] of [[Colin McRae]], [[Rickard Rydell]] and [[Darren Turner]] completed the category podium in third position. Porsches took the first six places in the Le Mans Grand Touring (LMGT) category with the White Lighting Racing [[Porsche 911 GT3|Porsche 911 GT3-RS]] of [[J\u00f6rg Bergmeister]], [[Patrick Long]] and [[Sascha Maassen]] taking the class win for the second consecutive year.\n\n==Background and regulation changes==\n\nThe 2004 [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] was the 72nd edition of the race and took place at the {{Convert|8.482|mi|km|abbr=on}} [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] from 12 to 13 June.<ref name=PressInfo2018>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.lemans.org/explorer/pdf/courses/2018/24-heures-du-mans/press-kit/uk/statistiques-historiques-en.pdf|title=2018 24 Hours of Le Mans \u2013 Press Information|date=June 2018|publisher=[[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]]|pages=7, 10, 16 & 21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190623125350/https://assets.lemans.org/explorer/pdf/courses/2018/24-heures-du-mans/press-kit/uk/statistiques-historiques-en.pdf|archive-date=23 June 2019|url-status=live|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref> The automotive journalist [[Charles Faroux]] proposed the race to Georges Durand, the president of the automotive group, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO), and the industrialist Emile Coquile in 1922 to test vehicle reliability and fuel-efficiency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lemans.org/en/news/commemoration-of-the-90th-anniversary-of-the-le-mans-24-hours/9734|title=Commemoration of the 90th anniversary of the Le Mans 24 Hours|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Automobile Club de l'Ouest|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602163444/https://www.lemans.org/en/news/commemoration-of-the-90th-anniversary-of-the-le-mans-24-hours/9734|archive-date=2 June 2019|url-status=live|access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"RTLMHistory\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/news/a13113/le-mans-how-it-began/|title=Le Mans \u2014 How It Began|date=16 May 2007|website=[[Road & Track]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911022850/http://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/news/a13113/le-mans-how-it-began/|archive-date=11 September 2015|url-status=live|access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref> It is considered one of the world's most prestigious motor races and is part of the [[Triple Crown of Motorsport]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/le-mans-24-hours-attend-style/|title=An insider's guide to the Le Mans 24hours: how to experience the ultimate endurance race in style|last=Hargreaves|first=Eilidh|date=13 May 2019|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=2 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530203845/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/le-mans-24-hours-attend-style/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2003, the ACO announced changes to the [[Le Mans Prototype]] (LMP) classes that first took effect from the 2004 race.<ref name=DSC2004EngineRegs>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2003lemans/lemans022.htm|title=ACO Engine Rules|date=5 March 2003|publisher=DailySportsCar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617131431/http://archive.dailysportscar.com/subscribers/news/lemans/2003lemans/lemans022.htm|archive-date=17 June 2019|url-status=live|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref> The former Le Mans Grand Touring Prototype and Le Mans Prototype 900 (LMP900) categories were merged and renamed Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) and was limited solely to manufacturers.

Milan|AC Milan]]. [[Kevin-Prince Boateng]] is a black male from Ghana and during this match was constantly abused for his skin color. <blockquote>\u201cWhen Boateng touched the ball for the first time, a small part of the crowd made monkey noises: Oo -- oo -- oo -- oo...Fifty or so people called him an animal. He locked eyes with them and could see the hate. He pointed to his head, to say, 'You're an idiot.' The chants went on for 20 minutes: Oo -- oo -- oo -- oo...Finally, after about twenty more minutes of the chanting, Boateng picked up the ball, kicked it into the stands and walked off the field. The team then boarded its bus and headed back to the AC Milan compound. \"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/9338962/when-beautiful-game-turns-ugly|title=When The Beautiful Game Turns Ugly|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref></blockquote>The Boateng incident, among others, prove that fans either don't pay attention to, or don't care, about regulating body's rules. The changes made by Association football do not have many effects on the fans, who are the biggest contributors to racism in football, which allows the racism to persist.\n\nSome policies aimed at reducing racism in association football include [[Football Against Racism in Europe]], [[Show Racism The Red Card]], and [[Racism Breaks the Game]] in [[Romania]]; not all passed.\n\n=== Rugby ===\n\n==== Australia ====\n\n[[Anthony Mundine]] made publicity by claiming that [[New South Wales]] is a racist state in terms of the sport of [[rugby league]] and that it is one of the reasons he quit the sport to take up [[boxing]].

In terms of the South maintaining a sense of authority over blacks, in the year 20 \"92.5 percent of university presidents in the FBS were white, 87.5 percent of the athletic directors were white and 100 percent of the conference commissioners were white\".

Despite this resentment, the Olympic Games continued.<ref name=\"la84foundation.org\">Miller, Patrick B. [http://la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1996/olympika0501h.pdf  \"The Nazi Olympics, Berlin, 1936: Exhibition at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C.\"] London, ON Olympika, 1996 (pdf).</ref>\n\nThe bidding for the 1936 Olympic Games was the first to be contested by IOC members, who cast their votes for their favorite host city. The vote occurred in 1931 during the Weimar Republic era, before Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933. By allowing only members of the \"Aryan race\" to compete for [[Nazi]]-controlled Germany, [[Hitler]] further promoted his ideological belief of [[racial supremacy]].\n\nOther nations debated [[boycotting]], with Spain and the Soviet Union going through with a full boycott. The Amateur Athletic Union led newspaper editors and anti-Nazi groups to protest against American participation, contesting that racial discrimination was a violation of Olympic rules and creed and that participation in the Games was tantamount to support for the Third Reich. Most African-American newspapers supported participation in the Olympics. The Philadelphia Tribune and the Chicago Defender both agreed that black victories would undermine Nazi views of Aryan supremacy and spark renewed African-American pride. American Jewish organizations, meanwhile, largely opposed the Olympics. The American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee staged rallies and supported the boycott of German goods to show their disdain for American participation. The 1936 Summer Olympics ultimately boasted the largest number of participating nations of any Olympics to that point. However, some individual athletes, including Jewish Americans [[Milton Green]] and [[Norman Cahners]], chose to boycott the Games.\n\nDuring these Olympics, Margaret Bergmann Lambert was excluded in the 1936 German Olympic team because she was Jewish.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">\" TV SPORTS; 'Hitler's Pawn' on HBO: An Olympic Betrayal.\" The New York Times.

Even though Lambert had equalled the German national record in the high jump a month before the Olympic Games, she was denied the opportunity to participate in the games.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" /> In addition, the Nazi Press described African Americans as \"black auxiliaries\" and eventually called for their exclusion from the Olympics.  Also, Hitler's Nazis created rules and restrictions within Germany that prohibited Jews from being able to use local facilities and playgrounds for appropriate training, occurring as early as March 1933. This gave Jews and other \"non-Aryan\" people unequal training methods.<ref name=\"la84foundation.org\" />\n\nGreat achievements by African Americans, such as Jesse Owens, challenged the \"Aryan\" ideal, or a Caucasian person without Jewish descent. Owens won four gold medals: one in 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump, and 4x100 meter relay. His achievements conveyed both the notions of \"interracial education\" as well as \"muscular assimilation\" to help promote sportsmanship towards African-Americans on and on the Olympic stage.  However, these achievements of interracial awareness and racial cohesion also solidified traditional social hierarchies through the guise of \"scientific\" discoveries in physiology and anatomy.<ref name=\"la84foundation.org\" />\n\nAdditionally, these achievements were met with much speculation and criticism. Since the games, there has existed a speculation of Hitler's unwillingness to shake hands with African-American gold medalists. From reports that Hitler had purposefully avoided acknowledging his victories, and had refused to shake his hand, Owens said at the time:<blockquote>Hitler had a certain time to come to the stadium and a certain time to leave. It happened he had to leave before the victory ceremony after the 100 meters. But before he left I was on my way to a broadcast and passed near his box. He waved at me and I waved back. I think it was bad taste to criticise the 'man of the hour' in another country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zsoaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IkwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1814,6536771&dq=jesse-owens+hitler&hl=en|title=The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref></blockquote>This racism was not limited to Germans, as Americans observed racism as well.  American Track and Field coach Dean Cromwell stated \"It was not long ago that his [the black athlete's] ability to sprint and jump was a life-and-death matter to him in the jungle. His muscles are pliable, and his easy-going disposition is a valuable aid to the mental and physical relaxation that a runner and jumper must have.\" These thoughts percolated throughout the Olympics, and made discrimination commonplace in many aspects of the games.<ref name=\"la84foundation.org\" />\n\n* American sprinters Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman were pulled from the 4 \u00d7 100 relay team the day before the competition, leading to speculation that U.S. Olympic committee did not want to add to the embarrassment of Hitler by having two Jews win gold medals.\n* Hitler called for a rematch of the quarterfinals match to discount Peru's 4\u20132 win over Austria. The Peruvian national Olympic team refused to play the match again and withdrew from the games.\n* During the games, the Nazis demoted Captain Wolfgang F\u00fcrstner, the half-Jewish commandant of the Olympic Village, and replaced him with Werner von Gilsa. After the games' conclusion, F\u00fcrstner, a career officer, committed suicide when he learned that the Nuremberg Laws classified him as a Jew, and, as such, he was to be expelled from the Wehrmacht.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Racism in sport in Australia]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://archive.is/20130208201416/http://www.thesportscampus.com/2008071920/articles/racism-in-sports Racism in Sports], The Sports Campus\n* [http://repository.leedsmet.ac.uk/main/view_record.php?identifier=4825&SearchGroup=Research Crossing the Boundary: a study of the nature and extent of racism in local league cricket], Leeds Metropolitan University\n* [http://repository.leedsmet.ac.uk/main/view_record.php?identifier=5461&SearchGroup=Research What\u2019s the Difference: A study of the nature and extent of racism in Rugby League], Leeds Metropolitan University\n\n{{Supporter Culture}}\n{{Racism topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Racism In Sport}}\n[[Category:Racism in sport| ]]\n[[Category:Sports culture]]\n", "text_old": "'''Racism in sports''' has been a prevalent issue throughout the world, and in particular racism towards African-Americans has been especially bad over the course of the history of [[sports in the United States]] and around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://storify.com/rc20hard/racism-in-sports|title=Racism in Sports and Its Effects On Society (with images, tweets) \u00b7 rc20hard|website=Storify|access-date=2017-03-07}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] (HREOC) released a report in 2007<ref name=\"What's the Score?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/content/racial_discrimination/whats_the_score/pdf/introduction.pdf|title=What's the Score?

Despite this resentment, the Olympic Games continued.<ref name=\"la84foundation.org\">Miller, Patrick B. [http://la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1996/olympika0501h.pdf  \"The Nazi Olympics, Berlin, 1936: Exhibition at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C.\"] London, ON Olympika, 1996 (pdf).</ref>\n\nThe bidding for the 1936 Olympic Games was the first to be contested by IOC members, who cast their votes for their favorite host city. The vote occurred in 1931 during the Weimar Republic era, before Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933. By allowing only members of the \"Aryan race\" to compete for [[Nazi]]-controlled Germany, [[Hitler]] further promoted his ideological belief of [[racial supremacy]].\n\nOther nations debated [[boycotting]], with Spain and the Soviet Union going through with a full boycott. The Amateur Athletic Union led newspaper editors and anti-Nazi groups to protest against American participation, contesting that racial discrimination was a violation of Olympic rules and creed and that participation in the Games was tantamount to support for the Third Reich. Most African-American newspapers supported participation in the Olympics. The Philadelphia Tribune and the Chicago Defender both agreed that black victories would undermine Nazi views of Aryan supremacy and spark renewed African-American pride. American Jewish organizations, meanwhile, largely opposed the Olympics. The American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee staged rallies and supported the boycott of German goods to show their disdain for American participation. The 1936 Summer Olympics ultimately boasted the largest number of participating nations of any Olympics to that point. However, some individual athletes, including Jewish Americans [[Milton Green]] and [[Norman Cahners]], chose to boycott the Games.\n\nDuring these Olympics, Margaret Bergmann Lambert was excluded in the 1936 German Olympic team because she was Jewish.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">\" TV SPORTS; 'Hitler's Pawn' on HBO: An Olympic Betrayal.\" The New York Times. The New York Times. Web. 13 March 2012. <https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/07/sports/tv-sports-hitler-s-pawn-on-hbo-an-olympic-betrayal.html>.</ref>  She had to withhold her anger and frustration in regard to Hitler's unequal and unfair ruling in Germany. Even though Lambert had equalled the German national record in the high jump a month before the Olympic Games, she was denied the opportunity to participate in the games.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\" /> In addition, the Nazi Press described African Americans as \"black auxiliaries\" and eventually called for their exclusion from the Olympics.  Also, Hitler's Nazis created rules and restrictions within Germany that prohibited Jews from being able to use local facilities and playgrounds for appropriate training, occurring as early as March 1933. This gave Jews and other \"non-Aryan\" people unequal training methods.<ref name=\"la84foundation.org\" />\n\nGreat achievements by African Americans, such as Jesse Owens, challenged the \"Aryan\" ideal, or a Caucasian person without Jewish descent. Owens won four gold medals: one in 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump, and 4x100 meter relay. His achievements conveyed both the notions of \"interracial education\" as well as \"muscular assimilation\" to help promote sportsmanship towards African-Americans on and on the Olympic stage.  However, these achievements of interracial awareness and racial cohesion also solidified traditional social hierarchies through the guise of \"scientific\" discoveries in physiology and anatomy.<ref name=\"la84foundation.org\" />\n\nAdditionally, these achievements were met with much speculation and criticism. Since the games, there has existed a speculation of Hitler's unwillingness to shake hands with African-American gold medalists. From reports that Hitler had purposefully avoided acknowledging his victories, and had refused to shake his hand, Owens said at the time:<blockquote>Hitler had a certain time to come to the stadium and a certain time to leave. It happened he had to leave before the victory ceremony after the 100 meters. But before he left I was on my way to a broadcast and passed near his box. He waved at me and I waved back. I think it was bad taste to criticise the 'man of the hour' in another country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zsoaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IkwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1814,6536771&dq=jesse-owens+hitler&hl=en|title=The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref></blockquote>This racism was not limited to Germans, as Americans observed racism as well.  American Track and Field coach Dean Cromwell stated \"It was not long ago that his [the black athlete's] ability to sprint and jump was a life-and-death matter to him in the jungle. His muscles are pliable, and his easy-going disposition is a valuable aid to the mental and physical relaxation that a runner and jumper must have.\" These thoughts percolated throughout the Olympics, and made discrimination commonplace in many aspects of the games.<ref name=\"la84foundation.org\" />\n\n* American sprinters Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman were pulled from the 4 \u00d7 100 relay team the day before the competition, leading to speculation that U.S. Olympic committee did not want to add to the embarrassment of Hitler by having two Jews win gold medals.\n* Hitler called for a rematch of the quarterfinals match to discount Peru's 4\u20132 win over Austria. The Peruvian national Olympic team refused to play the match again and withdrew from the games.\n* During the games, the Nazis demoted Captain Wolfgang F\u00fcrstner, the half-Jewish commandant of the Olympic Village, and replaced him with Werner von Gilsa. After the games' conclusion, F\u00fcrstner, a career officer, committed suicide when he learned that the Nuremberg Laws classified him as a Jew, and, as such, he was to be expelled from the Wehrmacht.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Racism in sport in Australia]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://archive.is/20130208201416/http://www.thesportscampus.com/2008071920/articles/racism-in-sports Racism in Sports], The Sports Campus\n* [http://repository.leedsmet.ac.uk/main/view_record.php?identifier=4825&SearchGroup=Research Crossing the Boundary: a study of the nature and extent of racism in local league cricket], Leeds Metropolitan University\n* [http://repository.leedsmet.ac.uk/main/view_record.php?identifier=5461&SearchGroup=Research What\u2019s the Difference: A study of the nature and extent of racism in Rugby League], Leeds Metropolitan University\n\n{{Supporter Culture}}\n{{Racism topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Racism In Sport}}\n[[Category:Racism in sport| ]]\n[[Category:Sports culture]]\n", "name_user": "49.144.110.213", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eUnited Kingdom)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_sport"}

Based on the 1978 film ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]'', the series was produced by Franklin/Waterman Productions and Rainforest Entertainment and co-created by [[Jeff Franklin]], best known for co-producing ''[[Full House]]''.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=604}}</ref>\n\nA short-lived comic adaptation from [[Harvey Comics]] was written by [[Michael Gallagher (writer)|Michael Gallagher]] and drawn by Nelson Dewey, who worked from scripts and model sheets from the series.\n\n== Characters ==\n=== Stunt Dawgs ===\n* '''Needham''' - The main character and level-headed hero of the series, with an exaggeratedly large chest and chin. He speaks with a [[Texan English|Texan]] accent and has his own theme, which is played in the end credits in some episodes and heard in an instrumental form throughout the series. Needham's main battle cry is \"T.T.K.B.\", which means \"Time To Kick Butt.\" Another of his battle cries is \"I loooove being a Stunt Dawg,\" which he uses when he's enjoying himself, either doing a stunt or foiling one of Fungus's plans. He drives a six-wheeled [[monster truck]] whose name is Oscar (as seen on the tailgate). It has the ability to get through traffic jams by rising high and thinning its tires, and can also fly long distances by rising on its chassis and firing rocket engines from the back, as seen in the episode \"Calling Dr. Fungus.\" Needham was named after former stuntman/director [[Hal Needham]] (who also directed ''Hooper''). In the comic, he is sometimes depicted with black hair and a yellow [[sleeveless shirt]] instead of brown hair and a white [[T-shirt]] with red trim.<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n* '''Splat''' - The rich, laid-back financier of the Stunt Dawgs who speaks with a [[wikt:posh|posh]] accent, denoting his cultured upbringing from a wealthy family. His parents do not approve of his choice of profession. He pilots a military-style [[helicopter]].\n* '''Sizzle''' - The only female member of the Stunt Dawgs, with fiery red hair and a temper to match. She wears purple [[spandex]] and speaks with a [[Southern American English|Southern]] accent very similar to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] of the [[X-Men]] (who was also voiced by [[Lenore Zann]] in [[X-Men (TV series)|the animated series]]). She occasionally flirts with Needham and is revealed to have some sort of history with Fungus's brother. She drives a [[Auto racing|racecar]]-like pink car with giant rear tires and carries a pocket-sized [[flamethrower]].\n* '''Skidd''' - An \"almost crazy\" motorcycle driver who is often found pondering near-nonsensical themes. He is known for his terrible breath and loud burps. His vehicle is a yellow [[motorcycle]]. In the comic, he is sometimes depicted with black hair and a red jacket instead of red hair and a black jacket, and a more suave appearance overall.<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n* '''Crash''' - A bald [[African-American]] stunt driver who, as his name suggests, is known for getting into accidents. He is also often found running away from Velda, who has a crush on him. His vehicle is a red and white [[rocket car]] with giant rear tires like Sizzle's.\n* '''Human''' - The Stunt Dawgs' rather intelligent bulldog. His vehicle is a rocket-powered [[skateboard]] that is shown occasionally on the show; every time he launches from The Wreck (the Stunt Dawgs' hideout), he lands dazed in a dumpster.\n\n=== Stunt Scabs ===\n* '''Richard P. Fungus''' - An egomaniacal director who is obsessed with pursuing money, fame, and the destruction of the Stunt Dawgs. His battle cry is \"[[wikt:lights, camera, action|Lights, Camera, Mayhem]]!!!\" He is also known for exclaiming, \"I de''spise'' him!\" He hates nothing more in all the world than to be called \"Dick.\" He wears a [[toup\u00e9e]] and is revealed in the episode \"Viva Lost Wages\" to have a charismatic but insane brother, who is imprisoned in an asylum and looks to escape so he can commit fratricide. Fungus was originally to have been named \"Peter Bogus,\" allegedly a parody of director [[Peter Bogdanovich]]. He also appears at the end of most shows in the Franklin/Waterman Entertainment logo.\n* '''Airball''' (sometimes Hairball) - Fungus's short-statured second-in-command who imitates [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], frequently calling Fungus \"Mon capitan.\" Fungus usually takes out his frustration on him when things go wrong. His vehicle is a light blue [[airplane]] with an open [[Aircraft canopy|canopy]]. In the comic, Fungus introduces him as \"a skydiver who's had a few rough landings.\"<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n* '''Badyear''' - A large, brawny construction worker with a [[rattlesnake]] for a belt and a [[wikt:leadfoot|lead foot]] (i.e. a right foot made of [[lead]]). He is frugal to the point of being cheap, always trying to extort money from others and cadge rewards for even the most minor services. His vehicle is a blue monster truck with purple tires, which also sports a [[cannon]] and a movable, jaw-like front [[Bumper (car)|bumper]].\n* '''Half-a-Mind''' - Barely a human being and apparently a [[cyborg]] of some kind (with a wheel for a leg), Half-a-Mind is prone to falling apart after getting hit. He has the lowest intelligence in the group. He is briefly infused with intelligence in one episode, calling himself \"Mind-and-a-Half,\" taking over the Stunt Scabs and electing Whiz Vid - who upgraded Half-a-Mind's body with high intellect and new cybernetic bodyparts - his second-in-command and personal assistant. His vehicle is a light green [[motorized tricycle]].\n* '''Lucky''' - A bushy-browed guy who is only slightly more intelligent than Half-a-Mind and suffers from luck of the worst kind. He always looks at his fortunes optimistically with his catchphrase \"Could've been worse,\" although they often get worse immediately after he says it. Ironically (or maybe not), [[Friday the 13th]] is his luckiest day. His vehicle is a light green motorcycle with a [[scorpion]] motif. In the comic, he is sometimes seen wearing [[glasses]].<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n* '''Whiz Vid''' (sometimes Whiz Kid) - A psychotic young genius whose inventions constantly backfire or do the exact opposite of what they should, often leading him to yell \"Glitch!\" His catchphrase is an odd laugh that sounds like \"Whoo-hoy!\" His vehicle is a red and yellow [[Self-propelled artillery|mobile artillery]] with six wheels. In the comic, he is sometimes seen wearing a red and white [[Powered exoskeleton|exosuit]].<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n\n=== Other characters ===\n* '''Slyme''' - The [[Shyster|sleazy lawyer]] of the Stunt Scabs, who is as greedy as Fungus and uses many legal [[malapropism]]s. He travels around in a large purple [[limousine]]. In the comic, he states that his last name is \"Whiplash\" and he works for the law firm of [[Dewey, Cheatem & Howe|Dewey, Cheatam and Howe]], and constantly secretes green slime.<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n* '''Bambi''', '''Bumbi''', '''Bombi''' - The three identical [[bimbo]] girlfriends of Fungus.\n* '''Nina Newscaster''' - A news reporter who is often present for the feuds of the Stunt Dawgs and the Stunt Scabs.\n* '''Velda''' - A woman who has a crush on Crash (bordering on [[Obsessive love|an insanely jealous obsession]]). She was left at the altar by Crash; however, according to him, it was just part of a stunt and not a real marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Neil Crone]] as Whiz Vid and Needham\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] as Badyear and Half-a-Mind\n* [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]] as Slyme and Airball\n* [[Barbara Budd]] as Nina Newscaster\n* Greg Morton as Crash, Velda and Splat\n* [[John Stocker (voice actor)|John Stocker]] as Richard P.

Based on the 1978 film ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]'', the series was produced by Franklin/Waterman Productions and Rainforest Entertainment and co-created by [[Jeff Franklin]], best known for co-producing ''[[Full House]]''.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=604}}</ref>\n\nA short-lived comic adaptation from [[Harvey Comics]] was written by [[Michael Gallagher (writer)|Michael Gallagher]] and drawn by Nelson Dewey, who worked from scripts and model sheets from the series.\n\n== Characters ==\n=== Stunt Dawgs ===\n* '''Needham''' - The main character and level-headed hero of the series, with an exaggeratedly large chest and chin. He speaks with a [[Texan English|Texan]] accent and has his own theme, which is played in the end credits in some episodes and heard in an instrumental form throughout the series. Needham's main battle cry is \"T.T.K.B.\", which means \"Time To Kick Butt.\" Another of his battle cries is \"I loooove being a Stunt Dawg,\" which he uses when he's enjoying himself, either doing a stunt or foiling one of Fungus's plans. He drives a six-wheeled [[monster truck]] whose name is Oscar (as seen on the tailgate). It has the ability to get though traffic jams by rising high and thinning its tires, and can also fly long distances by rising on its chassis and firing rocket engines from the back, as seen in the episode \"Calling Dr. Fungus.\" Needham was named after former stuntman/director [[Hal Needham]] (who also directed ''Hooper''). In the comic, he is sometimes depicted with black hair and a yellow [[sleeveless shirt]] instead of brown hair and a white [[T-shirt]] with red trim.<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n* '''Splat''' - The rich, laid-back financier of the Stunt Dawgs who speaks with a [[wikt:posh|posh]] accent, denoting his cultured upbringing from a wealthy family. His parents do not approve of his choice of profession. He pilots a military-style [[helicopter]].\n* '''Sizzle''' - The only female member of the Stunt Dawgs, with fiery red hair and a temper to match. She wears purple [[spandex]] and speaks with a [[Southern American English|Southern]] accent very similar to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] of the [[X-Men]] (who was also voiced by [[Lenore Zann]] in [[X-Men (TV series)|the animated series]]). She occasionally flirts with Needham and is revealed to have some sort of history with Fungus's brother. She drives a [[Auto racing|racecar]]-like pink car with giant rear tires and carries a pocket-sized [[flamethrower]].\n* '''Skidd''' - An \"almost crazy\" motorcycle driver who is often found pondering near-nonsensical themes. He is known for his terrible breath and loud burps. His vehicle is a yellow [[motorcycle]]. In the comic, he is sometimes depicted with black hair and a red jacket instead of red hair and a black jacket, and a more suave appearance overall.<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n* '''Crash''' - A bald [[African-American]] stunt driver who, as his name suggests, is known for getting into accidents. He is also often found running away from Velda, who has a crush on him. His vehicle is a red and white [[rocket car]] with giant rear tires like Sizzle's.\n* '''Human''' - The Stunt Dawgs' rather intelligent bulldog. His vehicle is a rocket-powered [[skateboard]] that is shown occasionally on the show; every time he launches from The Wreck (the Stunt Dawgs' hideout), he lands dazed in a dumpster.\n\n=== Stunt Scabs ===\n* '''Richard P. Fungus''' - An egomaniacal director who is obsessed with pursuing money, fame, and the destruction of the Stunt Dawgs. His battle cry is \"[[wikt:lights, camera, action|Lights, Camera, Mayhem]]!!!\" He is also known for exclaiming, \"I de''spise'' him!\" He hates nothing more in all the world than to be called \"Dick.\" He wears a [[toup\u00e9e]] and is revealed in the episode \"Viva Lost Wages\" to have a charismatic but insane brother, who is imprisoned in an asylum and looks to escape so he can commit fratricide. Fungus was originally to have been named \"Peter Bogus,\" allegedly a parody of director [[Peter Bogdanovich]]. He also appears at the end of most shows in the Franklin/Waterman Entertainment logo.\n* '''Airball''' (sometimes Hairball) - Fungus's short-statured second-in-command who imitates [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], frequently calling Fungus \"Mon capitan.\" Fungus usually takes out his frustration on him when things go wrong. His vehicle is a light blue [[airplane]] with an open [[Aircraft canopy|canopy]]. In the comic, Fungus introduces him as \"a skydiver who's had a few rough landings.\"<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n* '''Badyear''' - A large, brawny construction worker with a [[rattlesnake]] for a belt and a [[wikt:leadfoot|lead foot]] (i.e. a right foot made of [[lead]]). He is frugal to the point of being cheap, always trying to extort money from others and cadge rewards for even the most minor services. His vehicle is a blue monster truck with purple tires, which also sports a [[cannon]] and a movable, jaw-like front [[Bumper (car)|bumper]].\n* '''Half-a-Mind''' - Barely a human being and apparently a [[cyborg]] of some kind (with a wheel for a leg), Half-a-Mind is prone to falling apart after getting hit. He has the lowest intelligence in the group. He is briefly infused with intelligence in one episode, calling himself \"Mind-and-a-Half,\" taking over the Stunt Scabs and electing Whiz Vid - who upgraded Half-a-Mind's body with high intellect and new cybernetic bodyparts - his second-in-command and personal assistant. His vehicle is a light green [[motorized tricycle]].\n* '''Lucky''' - A bushy-browed guy who is only slightly more intelligent than Half-a-Mind and suffers from luck of the worst kind. He always looks at his fortunes optimistically with his catchphrase \"Could've been worse,\" although they often get worse immediately after he says it. Ironically (or maybe not), [[Friday the 13th]] is his luckiest day. His vehicle is a light green motorcycle with a [[scorpion]] motif. In the comic, he is sometimes seen wearing [[glasses]].<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n* '''Whiz Vid''' (sometimes Whiz Kid) - A psychotic young genius whose inventions constantly backfire or do the exact opposite of what they should, often leading him to yell \"Glitch!\" His catchphrase is an odd laugh that sounds like \"Whoo-hoy!\" His vehicle is a red and yellow [[Self-propelled artillery|mobile artillery]] with six wheels. In the comic, he is sometimes seen wearing a red and white [[Powered exoskeleton|exosuit]].<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n\n=== Other characters ===\n* '''Slyme''' - The [[Shyster|sleazy lawyer]] of the Stunt Scabs, who is as greedy as Fungus and uses many legal [[malapropism]]s. He travels around in a large purple [[limousine]]. In the comic, he states that his last name is \"Whiplash\" and he works for the law firm of [[Dewey, Cheatem & Howe|Dewey, Cheatam and Howe]], and constantly secretes green slime.<ref name=\":0\">http://vlcomic.com/read/comic-stunt-dawgs-eng/1</ref>\n* '''Bambi''', '''Bumbi''', '''Bombi''' - The three identical [[bimbo]] girlfriends of Fungus.\n* '''Nina Newscaster''' - A news reporter who is often present for the feuds of the Stunt Dawgs and the Stunt Scabs.\n* '''Velda''' - A woman who has a crush on Crash (bordering on [[Obsessive love|an insanely jealous obsession]]). She was left at the altar by Crash; however, according to him, it was just part of a stunt and not a real marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Neil Crone]] as Whiz Vid and Needham\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] as Badyear and Half-a-Mind\n* [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]] as Slyme and Airball\n* [[Barbara Budd]] as Nina Newscaster\n* Greg Morton as Crash, Velda and Splat\n* [[John Stocker (voice actor)|John Stocker]] as Richard P.

It was developed by a small team led by [[Ralph H. Baer]] at [[Sanders Associates]] and released by [[Magnavox]] in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set, and two rectangular [[game controller|controllers]] attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots on the screen in [[monochrome]] black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played, and with no sound capabilities. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to create visuals, and the one or two players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one button on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other [[board game]] paraphernalia to go along with the games, and a [[peripheral]] controller\u2014the first video game [[light gun]]\u2014was sold separately.\n\nThe idea for a video game console was thought up by Baer in August 1966, and over the next three years he, along with Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch, created seven successive prototype consoles. The seventh, known as the Brown Box, was shown to several manufacturers before Magnavox agreed to produce it in January 1971. After releasing the console in September 1972 through their dealerships, Magnavox sold between 69,000 and 100,000 units by the end of the year, and 350,000 by the time the console was discontinued in 1975. The console spawned the [[Odyssey series]] of [[dedicated consoles]], as well as the 1978 [[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2]]. One of the 28 games made for the system, a ping pong game, was an inspiration for [[Atari]]'s successful ''[[Pong]]'' arcade game, in turn driving sales of the console. Baer's patents for the system and the games, including what was termed by a judge as \"the pioneering patent of the video game art\", formed the basis of a series of lawsuits spanning 20 years, earning Sanders and Magnavox over US$100 million. The release of the Odyssey marked the end of the [[early history of video games]], and the rise of the commercial [[video game industry]] along with the start of the [[first generation of video game consoles]].\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Magnavox-Odyssey-Controller-FL.jpg|thumb|right|An Odyssey controller]]\n\nThe Odyssey consists of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular [[game controller|controllers]]. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed to sit on a flat surface, contain one button marked Reset on the top of the controller and three [[control knob|knob]]s: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six [[C battery|C batteries]], which were included. An optional [[Alternating current|AC power supply]] was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks [[sound effect|sound capability]] and can only display [[monochrome]] white shapes on a blank black screen.<ref name=\"DS\"/>\n\nInternally, the Odyssey architecture is composed of digital computing parts.  The circuitry is implemented in [[diode\u2013transistor logic]] using discrete [[transistor]]s and [[diode]]s, rather than the newly emerging [[transistor\u2013transistor logic]] integrated circuits, due to cost concerns. The games themselves do not use [[ROM cartridge]]s like later consoles, but instead use \"game cards\" composed of [[printed circuit board]]s that plug into the console. These cards modify the internal circuitry like a set of switches or [[jumper (computing)|jumpers]], causing the Odyssey to display different components and react to inputs differently. Multiple games use the same cards, with different instructions given to the player to change the style of game.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\n[[File:Magnavox-Color-Screen-Overlays.jpg|link=File:Magnavox-Color-Screen-Overlays.jpg|thumb|left|Plastic television overlays]]\nThe Odyssey is capable of displaying three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts the speed of the computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, for example to change the center line of a [[tennis]] game into the side wall of a [[handball]] game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based [[Simon Says]] game.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\nIn addition to the overlays, the Odyssey came with dice, poker chips, score sheets, play money, and game boards much like a traditional [[board game]].<ref name=\"GQ\"/> One [[peripheral]] controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game [[light gun]]. Named the Shooting Gallery, the rifle-shaped device registered a hit when pointed at a light source such as a dot on the television screen.<ref name=\"DS\"/> Four shooting-based games were included with the light gun.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Ralph Baer's Brown Box prototype.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Brown Box\" prototype]]\nIn 1951, while working for military contractor Loral Electronics, engineer [[Ralph H. Baer]] was assigned to build a television set; while doing so, Baer claims he had the idea to build something into a television set that the owner could control in addition to its normal function of receiving signals from a remote television station. Baer did not pursue the idea, but it returned to him in August 1966 while waiting for a bus. Baer, then the head of the Equipment Design Division at military contractor [[Sanders Associates]], came up with the concept of using a television to play games, and the next morning wrote up a four-page proposal for a US$20 \"game box\" that would plug into a television screen and play games on it.<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/><ref name=\"BaerHow\"/> While the commercial [[video game industry]] did not yet exist at that point, the [[early history of video games|very first electronic computer games]] had been developed at the start of the 1950s, and by 1966 several [[early mainframe games]] had been developed for [[mainframe computers]], which were typically only found in large academic or research institutions.<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/><ref name=\"Replay50s\"/> In the proposal, Baer began by referring to the project using military terminology, but by the time he finished it he was referring to it as Channel LP, short for \"let's play\".<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/> The proposed device would transmit a signal that the television set could tune into as if it were a television channel, and Baer described several games that could be played on it.<ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/>\n\nAs Channel LP had little to do with the typical military contracts Sanders worked on, rather than bring the idea to his bosses Baer instead commandeered an empty room and assigned one of his technicians, Bob Tremblay, to work on it with him.<ref name=\"BaerHow\"/><ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/> By December 1966, an initial prototype later christened \"TV Game #1\" was completed, which could display and move a vertical line on a television screen. Baer demonstrated the prototype to the Sanders director of research and development, Herbert Campman, who hesitantly agreed to fund it for US$2,000 of labor and US$500 for materials, making it an official project.<ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/>\n\n[[File:Magnavox Odyssey Cartridge.png|thumb|left|Magnavox Odyssey Cartridge No 6]]\nBaer spent the next few months designing further prototypes, and in February 1967, assigned technician Bill Harrison to begin building the project. Harrison spent the next few months in between other projects building out successive modifications to the prototype.  Baer, meanwhile, collaborated with engineer Bill Rusch on the design of the console, including developing the basis of many games for the system. The first game was developed by May, a two-player game where the players repeatedly press a button in competition to fill or empty a bucket of water, and by June multiple games were completed for what was then a second prototype box.<ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/> These included a game where players controlled dots chasing each other and a [[light gun shooter]] game with a plastic rifle. Baer demonstrated the new prototype to Campman, who enjoyed the shooting game, increased funding, and recommended Baer demonstrate the project to senior management.<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/><ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/> Baer demonstrated the console to the board, who were largely uninterested, though a couple of members were enthusiastic; nevertheless, CEO Royden Sanders authorized the project to be continued with the aim of selling or licensing the console as a commercial product.<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/><ref name=\"BaerHow\"/><ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/>\n\nBy August 1967, Baer and Harrison had completed a third prototype machine, but had found that to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require so much to be excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/> Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming up with a way to display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"Replay60s\"/> By November, the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\n[[File:Magnavox-Odyssey-Accessories.jpg|thumb|right|The Odyssey was packaged with board game accessories like dice and play money, as well as game cards.]]\nThe team first approached the cable television industry, and the prototype attracted the attention of TelePrompter Corporation, who had seen it during a visit. After a few months of talks, cash-flow problems forced TelePrompter to back out in April 1968.<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/> The same economic downturn that caused TelePrompter's problems caused financial difficulties at Sanders as well, which put the project on hold after the fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large-scale layoffs. It was picked up again in September, this time without Rusch, and went through two more iterations resulting in January 1969 in the seventh prototype, known as the \"Brown Box\" due to the wood-grain stickers on the casing.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/> With the system now largely complete, Baer and Harrison were unsure whom to approach to sell it until a Sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers. Baer demonstrated the system to several companies, who all expressed enthusiasm; only [[RCA]] was willing to purchase the device, however, and an agreement could not be reached. Soon afterwards, though, RCA executive Bill Enders left RCA for [[Magnavox]] and convinced them to look at the console again. The three creators of the Brown Box again demonstrated the device to Magnavox in July 1969; they received a tepid reaction from most of the executives, but Vice President of Marketing Gerry Martin was in favor and Magnavox agreed to produce the console. After a long period of negotiations the two companies finally signed an agreement in January 1971.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"HighScore\"/>\n\n[[File:Magnavox-Odyssey-Motherboard-FR.jpg|thumb|left|The Odyssey consisted of 10 daughter-cards that were connected to the motherboard, and the game cards only rewired the circuit for different game modes.]]\nMagnavox designed the exterior of the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/> At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] testing and regulations.<ref name=\"AtariInc147\"/> The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date.<ref name=\"Gamerdad\"/> Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/> The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, ''Shooting Gallery'', and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, to go along with the plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"NGen23\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Festival du Jeu Vid\u00e9o - 2010-09-11 - Magnavox Odyssey 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Magnavox Odyssey at the 2010 Festival du Jeu Vid\u00e9o]]\nMagnavox began advertising the Odyssey in mid-September 1972, including an appearance on the game show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' on October 16, 1972. As neither ''[[Pong]]'' nor the term \"video game\" existed, the company described the console as \"the new electronic game of the future\" and \"closed-circuit electronic playground\".<ref name=\"willaert20180110\"/> After ordering 50,000 units, before release, Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built a larger inventory, as market testing found an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers; the company hoped that as the first such product, consumers would visit its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased with a Magnavox television.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"willaert20180110\"/>\n\nThere are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey product manager Bob Fritsche recalled selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalled sales being closer to 100,000.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"Baerinvasion\"/> Baer stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high price\u2014US$100 in 1972 is {{Inflation|US|100|1972|fmt=eq|r=0}}\u2014and because of Magnavox restricting sales to its dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"NGen23\"/> Other sources have stated that dealers misled customers to sell more televisions, though advertisements explicitly stated that it worked with any set. Customers unfamiliar with the new device may have misunderstood Odyssey's interoperability.<ref name=\"willaert20180110\"/><ref name=\"BTC5459\"/>\n\nMagnavox assistant product planner Don Emry said that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not with the production run.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/> According to Baer, after the initial holiday season Magnavox considered dropping the console, but the modest continuing demand the following year convinced them to manufacture an additional 27,000 units for the 1973 holiday season, selling 20,000 of them. The console was also released in 12 other countries: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela, with different games.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"Baerinvasion\"/><ref name=\"TVGE45\"/> In late 1973, Magnavox ran a large advertising campaign for all of its 1974 products, including sponsoring [[Frank Sinatra]]'s November television special ''[[Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back (TV Program)|Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back]]''.<ref name=\"Inc.Dec1973\"/><ref name=\"Inc.Sep1973\"/> Commercials during the special and advertisements for it showed the Odyssey and other Magnavox products.<ref name=\"willaert20180110\"/> The company sold 129,000 Odyssey units in 1974, or 150,000 according to Baer. Magnavox discontinued the console after 1975; according to Baer it sold 350,000 units in total worldwide, though statements by Fritsche indicate it may have been higher.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"Baerinvasion\"/> The light gun peripheral sold 20,000 units.<ref name=\"DS\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Ralphbaer.jpg|thumb|right|Ralph Baer being given the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation|National Medal of Technology]] in February 2006.]]\n\nAs the Odyssey was discontinued Magnavox released the first successive [[dedicated consoles]]\u2014consoles that could only play games built into the system\u2014in the [[Odyssey series]], the Odyssey 100 and Odyssey 200, as part of the [[first generation of video game consoles]]; the Odyssey 100 was only capable of playing the ping pong and hockey games from the original Odyssey.<ref name=\"BTC5459\"/> Eleven dedicated Odyssey consoles were produced before a true follow-up console in 1978, the [[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2]].<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\nWhile it showed the potential of video game consoles and marked the end of the [[early history of video games]] and the beginning of the commercial video game industry, the Odyssey is not generally considered a major commercial success. Magnavox produced no more games for the console after 1973 and rejected Baer's proposals for an add-on that would add sound to games, a putting controller and associated golf game, and console variants that would have been cheaper or supported up to four players.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"DHGF\"/> While a few clone systems were produced in limited quantities, and multiple dedicated systems\u2014generally focused on ping pong game variants\u2014were created by several companies, no other true home video consoles were produced until the 1976 [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] [[Fairchild Channel F|Channel F]].<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\nIn 2004, Ralph Baer was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation|National Medal of Technology]] for \"his groundbreaking and pioneering creation, development and commercialization of interactive video games, which spawned related uses, applications, and mega-industries in both the entertainment and education realms\".<ref name=\"NMTI\"/> In June 2013, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) added the Magnavox Odyssey to its [[List of video games in the Museum of Modern Art|permanent collection of video games]]. MoMA's Paul Galloway described the console as \"a masterpiece of engineering and industrial design\" and stated that it was \"hard to overstate the importance of [Ralph Baer's] place in the birth of the industry\".<ref name=\"Moma\"/> The Brown Box prototype and the TV Game #1 prototype are located at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n===Lawsuits===\n[[File:Magnavox Odyssey patent.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patent drawing]] for the Magnavox Odyssey<ref name=\"Patent1\" />]]\nIn May 1972, [[Nutting Associates]] chief engineer [[Nolan Bushnell]], designer of the first commercial [[arcade game|arcade video game]], ''[[Computer Space]]'', saw a demonstration of the Odyssey at a dealership.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"Gamerdad\"/> Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]], he assigned [[Allan Alcorn]] to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey ''Table Tennis'' game. Alcorn soon developed ''Pong'', which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. ''Pong'' was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of ''Table Tennis'', in turn because of ''Pong'', and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]], and [[WMS Industries|Williams Electronics]] for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/> Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits.<ref name=\"DHGF\"/> The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer\u2014one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.<ref name=\"Patent1\"/><ref name=\"Patent2\"/>\n\nThe judge ruled that Baer's more general patent for the Odyssey constituted \"the pioneering patent of the video game art\", and held the defendants' games as infringing the patents. Atari settled early on in the court case with Magnavox, and in return were granted a license in exchange for US$1.5 million and access granted to Magnavox to all technology produced by Atari from June 1976 to June 1977, while the other defendants paid higher penalties.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"Baerinvasion\"/><ref name=\"AtariInc204\"/> Over the next twenty years, Sanders and Magnavox sued several other companies over the issue, focusing on \"[[paddle (game controller)|paddle-and-ball]]\" type games like ''Pong'' and ''Table Tennis'' that were more clearly related to the ping pong game patent; the final lawsuits ended in the mid 1990s.<ref name=\"BaerHow\"/><ref name=\"DHGF\"/> Defendants included Coleco, [[Mattel]], [[Seeburg Corporation|Seeburg]], and [[Activision]]; Sanders and Magnavox won or settled every lawsuit.<ref name=\"BaerHow\"/><ref name=\"NYT1\"/><ref name=\"NYT2\"/> Many of the defendants unsuccessfully attempted to claim that the patents only applied to the specific hardware implementations that Baer had used, or that they were invalidated by prior computer or electronic games.<ref name=\"BTC234237\"/> In 1985, [[Nintendo]] sued and tried to invalidate Baer's patents, claiming as prior art the 1958 ''[[Tennis for Two]]'' game built by [[William Higinbotham]]. The court, however, ruled that the [[oscilloscope]]-based game did not use video signals and therefore did not qualify as a video game, and ruled again in favor of Magnavox and Sanders.<ref name=\"DS\"/> Magnavox won more than US$100 million in the various patent lawsuits and settlements involving the Odyssey related patents.<ref name=\"NPR\"/> In addition, they had a large number of licensees of patents, with over one hundred already by the mid-1970s.<ref name=\"Gamerdad\"/>\n\n==List of games==\nA total of 28 games distributed on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were included with the console\u2014a set of 12 in America and a different set of 10 in other countries\u2014with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in a pack for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, ''Percepts'', was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, ''Shooting Gallery'', was available for purchase, and included four games on two cards that used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/> The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is left up to the players.<ref name=\"HighScore\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"13%\"|Title<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"3%\"|Game card\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60%\"|Description\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"12%\"|US version\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"12%\"|International version\n|-\n| ''Table Tennis'' || 1 || Two players use paddles to knock a ball back and forth on a screen;

It was developed by a small team led by [[Ralph H. Baer]] at [[Sanders Associates]] and released by [[Magnavox]] in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set, and two rectangular [[game controller|controllers]] attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots on the screen in [[monochrome]] black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played, and with no sound capabilities. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to create visuals, and the one or two players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one button on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other [[board game]] paraphernalia to go along with the games, and a [[peripheral]] controller\u2014the first video game [[light gun]]\u2014was sold separately.\n\nThe idea for a video game console was thought up by Baer in August 1966, and over the next three years he, along with Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch, created seven successive prototype consoles. The seventh, known as the Brown Box, was shown to several manufacturers before Magnavox agreed to produce it in January 1971. After releasing the console in September 1972 through their dealerships, Magnavox sold between 69,000 and 100,000 units by the end of the year, and 350,000 by the time the console was discontinued in 1975. The console spawned the [[Odyssey series]] of [[dedicated consoles]], as well as the 1978 [[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2]]. One of the 28 games made for the system, a ping pong game, was an inspiration for [[Atari]]'s successful ''[[Pong]]'' arcade game, in turn driving sales of the console. Baer's patents for the system and the games, including what was termed by a judge as \"the pioneering patent of the video game art\", formed the basis of a series of lawsuits spanning 20 years, earning Sanders and Magnavox over US$100 million. The release of the Odyssey marked the end of the [[early history of video games]], and the rise of the commercial [[video game industry]] along with the start of the [[first generation of video game consoles]].\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Magnavox-Odyssey-Controller-FL.jpg|thumb|right|An Odyssey controller]]\n\nThe Odyssey consists of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular [[game controller|controllers]]. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed to sit on a flat surface, contain one button marked Reset on the top of the controller and three [[control knob|knob]]s: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off during a game. The system can be powered by six [[C battery|C batteries]], which were included. An optional [[Alternating current|AC power supply]] was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks [[sound effect|sound capability]] and can only display [[monochrome]] white shapes on a blank black screen.<ref name=\"DS\"/>\n\nInternally, the Odyssey architecture is composed of digital computing parts.  The circuitry is implemented in [[diode\u2013transistor logic]] using discrete [[transistor]]s and [[diode]]s, rather than the newly emerging [[transistor\u2013transistor logic]] integrated circuits, due to cost concerns. The games themselves do not use [[ROM cartridge]]s like later consoles, but instead use \"game cards\" composed of [[printed circuit board]]s that plug into the console. These cards modify the internal circuitry like a set of switches or [[jumper (computing)|jumpers]], causing the Odyssey to display different components and react to inputs differently. Multiple games use the same cards, with different instructions given to the player to change the style of game.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\n[[File:Magnavox-Color-Screen-Overlays.jpg|link=File:Magnavox-Color-Screen-Overlays.jpg|thumb|left|Plastic television overlays]]\nThe Odyssey is capable of displaying three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts the speed of the computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, for example to change the center line of a [[tennis]] game into the side wall of a [[handball]] game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based [[Simon Says]] game.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\nIn addition to the overlays, the Odyssey came with dice, poker chips, score sheets, play money, and game boards much like a traditional [[board game]].<ref name=\"GQ\"/> One [[peripheral]] controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game [[light gun]]. Named the Shooting Gallery, the rifle-shaped device registered a hit when pointed at a light source such as a dot on the television screen.<ref name=\"DS\"/> Four shooting-based games were included with the light gun.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Ralph Baer's Brown Box prototype.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Brown Box\" prototype]]\nIn 1951, while working for military contractor Loral Electronics, engineer [[Ralph H. Baer]] was assigned to build a television set; while doing so, Baer claims he had the idea to build something into a television set that the owner could control in addition to its normal function of receiving signals from a remote television station. Baer did not pursue the idea, but it returned to him in August 1966 while waiting for a bus. Baer, then the head of the Equipment Design Division at military contractor [[Sanders Associates]], came up with the concept of using a television to play games, and the next morning wrote up a four-page proposal for a US$20 \"game box\" that would plug into a television screen and play games on it.<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/><ref name=\"BaerHow\"/> While the commercial [[video game industry]] did not yet exist at that point, the [[early history of video games|very first electronic computer games]] had been developed at the start of the 1950s, and by 1966 several [[early mainframe games]] had been developed for [[mainframe computers]], which were typically only found in large academic or research institutions.<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/><ref name=\"Replay50s\"/> In the proposal, Baer began by referring to the project using military terminology, but by the time he finished it he was referring to it as Channel LP, short for \"let's play\".<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/> The proposed device would transmit a signal that the television set could tune into as if it were a television channel, and Baer described several games that could be played on it.<ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/>\n\nAs Channel LP had little to do with the typical military contracts Sanders worked on, rather than bring the idea to his bosses Baer instead commandeered an empty room and assigned one of his technicians, Bob Tremblay, to work on it with him.<ref name=\"BaerHow\"/><ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/> By December 1966, an initial prototype later christened \"TV Game #1\" was completed, which could display and move a vertical line on a television screen. Baer demonstrated the prototype to the Sanders director of research and development, Herbert Campman, who hesitantly agreed to fund it for US$2,000 of labor and US$500 for materials, making it an official project.<ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/>\n\n[[File:Magnavox Odyssey Cartridge.png|thumb|left|Magnavox Odyssey Cartridge No 6]]\nBaer spent the next few months designing further prototypes, and in February 1967, assigned technician Bill Harrison to begin building the project. Harrison spent the next few months in between other projects building out successive modifications to the prototype.  Baer, meanwhile, collaborated with engineer Bill Rusch on the design of the console, including developing the basis of many games for the system. The first game was developed by May, a two-player game where the players repeatedly press a button in competition to fill or empty a bucket of water, and by June multiple games were completed for what was then a second prototype box.<ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/> These included a game where players controlled dots chasing each other and a [[light gun shooter]] game with a plastic rifle. Baer demonstrated the new prototype to Campman, who enjoyed the shooting game, increased funding, and recommended Baer demonstrate the project to senior management.<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/><ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/> Baer demonstrated the console to the board, who were largely uninterested, though a couple of members were enthusiastic; nevertheless, CEO Royden Sanders authorized the project to be continued with the aim of selling or licensing the console as a commercial product.<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/><ref name=\"BaerHow\"/><ref name=\"VGHbaer\"/>\n\nBy August 1967, Baer and Harrison had completed a third prototype machine, but had found that to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require so much to be excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/> Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming up with a way to display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"Replay60s\"/> By November, the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\n[[File:Magnavox-Odyssey-Accessories.jpg|thumb|right|The Odyssey was packaged with board game accessories like dice and play money, as well as game cards.]]\nThe team first approached the cable television industry, and the prototype attracted the attention of TelePrompter Corporation, who had seen it during a visit. After a few months of talks, cash-flow problems forced TelePrompter to back out in April 1968.<ref name=\"Replay60s\"/> The same economic downturn that caused TelePrompter's problems caused financial difficulties at Sanders as well, which put the project on hold after the fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large-scale layoffs. It was picked up again in September, this time without Rusch, and went through two more iterations resulting in January 1969 in the seventh prototype, known as the \"Brown Box\" due to the wood-grain stickers on the casing.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/> With the system now largely complete, Baer and Harrison were unsure whom to approach to sell it until a Sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers. Baer demonstrated the system to several companies, who all expressed enthusiasm; only [[RCA]] was willing to purchase the device, however, and an agreement could not be reached. Soon afterwards, though, RCA executive Bill Enders left RCA for [[Magnavox]] and convinced them to look at the console again. The three creators of the Brown Box again demonstrated the device to Magnavox in July 1969; they received a tepid reaction from most of the executives, but Vice President of Marketing Gerry Martin was in favor and Magnavox agreed to produce the console. After a long period of negotiations the two companies finally signed an agreement in January 1971.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"HighScore\"/>\n\n[[File:Magnavox-Odyssey-Motherboard-FR.jpg|thumb|left|The Odyssey consisted of 10 daughter-cards that were connected to the motherboard, and the game cards only rewired the circuit for different game modes.]]\nMagnavox designed the exterior of the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/> At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] testing and regulations.<ref name=\"AtariInc147\"/> The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date.<ref name=\"Gamerdad\"/> Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/> The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, ''Shooting Gallery'', and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, to go along with the plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"NGen23\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Festival du Jeu Vid\u00e9o - 2010-09-11 - Magnavox Odyssey 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Magnavox Odyssey at the 2010 Festival du Jeu Vid\u00e9o]]\nMagnavox began advertising the Odyssey in mid-September 1972, including an appearance on the game show ''[[What's My Line?]]'' on October 16, 1972. As neither ''[[Pong]]'' nor the term \"video game\" existed, the company described the console as \"the new electronic game of the future\" and \"closed-circuit electronic playground\".<ref name=\"willaert20180110\"/> After ordering 50,000 units, before release, Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built a larger inventory, as market testing found an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers; the company hoped that as the first such product, consumers would visit its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased with a Magnavox television.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"willaert20180110\"/>\n\nThere are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey product manager Bob Fritsche recalled selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalled sales being closer to 100,000.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"Baerinvasion\"/> Baer stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high price\u2014US$100 in 1972 is {{Inflation|US|100|1972|fmt=eq|r=0}}\u2014and because of Magnavox restricting sales to its dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"NGen23\"/> Other sources have stated that dealers misled customers to sell more televisions, though advertisements explicitly stated that it worked with any set. Customers unfamiliar with the new device may have misunderstood Odyssey's interoperability.<ref name=\"willaert20180110\"/><ref name=\"BTC5459\"/>\n\nMagnavox assistant product planner Don Emry said that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not with the production run.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/> According to Baer, after the initial holiday season Magnavox considered dropping the console, but the modest continuing demand the following year convinced them to manufacture an additional 27,000 units for the 1973 holiday season, selling 20,000 of them. The console was also released in 12 other countries: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela, with different games.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"Baerinvasion\"/><ref name=\"TVGE45\"/> In late 1973, Magnavox ran a large advertising campaign for all of its 1974 products, including sponsoring [[Frank Sinatra]]'s November television special ''[[Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back (TV Program)|Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back]]''.<ref name=\"Inc.Dec1973\"/><ref name=\"Inc.Sep1973\"/> Commercials during the special and advertisements for it showed the Odyssey and other Magnavox products.<ref name=\"willaert20180110\"/> The company sold 129,000 Odyssey units in 1974, or 150,000 according to Baer. Magnavox discontinued the console after 1975; according to Baer it sold 350,000 units in total worldwide, though statements by Fritsche indicate it may have been higher.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"Baerinvasion\"/> The light gun peripheral sold 20,000 units.<ref name=\"DS\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Ralphbaer.jpg|thumb|right|Ralph Baer being given the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation|National Medal of Technology]] in February 2006.]]\n\nAs the Odyssey was discontinued Magnavox released the first successive [[dedicated consoles]]\u2014consoles that could only play games built into the system\u2014in the [[Odyssey series]], the Odyssey 100 and Odyssey 200, as part of the [[first generation of video game consoles]]; the Odyssey 100 was only capable of playing the ping pong and hockey games from the original Odyssey.<ref name=\"BTC5459\"/> Eleven dedicated Odyssey consoles were produced before a true follow-up console in 1978, the [[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2]].<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\nWhile it showed the potential of video game consoles and marked the end of the [[early history of video games]] and the beginning of the commercial video game industry, the Odyssey is not generally considered a major commercial success. Magnavox produced no more games for the console after 1973 and rejected Baer's proposals for an add-on that would add sound to games, a putting controller and associated golf game, and console variants that would have been cheaper or supported up to four players.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/><ref name=\"DHGF\"/> While a few clone systems were produced in limited quantities, and multiple dedicated systems\u2014generally focused on ping pong game variants\u2014were created by several companies, no other true home video consoles were produced until the 1976 [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] [[Fairchild Channel F|Channel F]].<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n\nIn 2004, Ralph Baer was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation|National Medal of Technology]] for \"his groundbreaking and pioneering creation, development and commercialization of interactive video games, which spawned related uses, applications, and mega-industries in both the entertainment and education realms\".<ref name=\"NMTI\"/> In June 2013, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) added the Magnavox Odyssey to its [[List of video games in the Museum of Modern Art|permanent collection of video games]]. MoMA's Paul Galloway described the console as \"a masterpiece of engineering and industrial design\" and stated that it was \"hard to overstate the importance of [Ralph Baer's] place in the birth of the industry\".<ref name=\"Moma\"/> The Brown Box prototype and the TV Game #1 prototype are located at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n===Lawsuits===\n[[File:Magnavox Odyssey patent.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patent drawing]] for the Magnavox Odyssey<ref name=\"Patent1\" />]]\nIn May 1972, [[Nutting Associates]] chief engineer [[Nolan Bushnell]], designer of the first commercial [[arcade game|arcade video game]], ''[[Computer Space]]'', saw a demonstration of the Odyssey at a dealership.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"Gamerdad\"/> Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]], he assigned [[Allan Alcorn]] to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey ''Table Tennis'' game. Alcorn soon developed ''Pong'', which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. ''Pong'' was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of ''Table Tennis'', in turn because of ''Pong'', and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, [[Midway Games|Bally Midway]], and [[WMS Industries|Williams Electronics]] for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/> Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits.<ref name=\"DHGF\"/> The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer\u2014one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.<ref name=\"Patent1\"/><ref name=\"Patent2\"/>\n\nThe judge ruled that Baer's more general patent for the Odyssey constituted \"the pioneering patent of the video game art\", and held the defendants' games as infringing the patents. Atari settled early on in the court case with Magnavox, and in return were granted a license in exchange for US$1.5 million and access granted to Magnavox to all technology produced by Atari from June 1976 to June 1977, while the other defendants paid higher penalties.<ref name=\"Replay70s\"/><ref name=\"Baerinvasion\"/><ref name=\"AtariInc204\"/> Over the next twenty years, Sanders and Magnavox sued several other companies over the issue, focusing on \"[[paddle (game controller)|paddle-and-ball]]\" type games like ''Pong'' and ''Table Tennis'' that were more clearly related to the ping pong game patent; the final lawsuits ended in the mid 1990s.<ref name=\"BaerHow\"/><ref name=\"DHGF\"/> Defendants included Coleco, [[Mattel]], [[Seeburg Corporation|Seeburg]], and [[Activision]]; Sanders and Magnavox won or settled every lawsuit.<ref name=\"BaerHow\"/><ref name=\"NYT1\"/><ref name=\"NYT2\"/> Many of the defendants unsuccessfully attempted to claim that the patents only applied to the specific hardware implementations that Baer had used, or that they were invalidated by prior computer or electronic games.<ref name=\"BTC234237\"/> In 1985, [[Nintendo]] sued and tried to invalidate Baer's patents, claiming as prior art the 1958 ''[[Tennis for Two]]'' game built by [[William Higinbotham]]. The court, however, ruled that the [[oscilloscope]]-based game did not use video signals and therefore did not qualify as a video game, and ruled again in favor of Magnavox and Sanders.<ref name=\"DS\"/> Magnavox won more than US$100 million in the various patent lawsuits and settlements involving the Odyssey related patents.<ref name=\"NPR\"/> In addition, they had a large number of licensees of patents, with over one hundred already by the mid 1970s.<ref name=\"Gamerdad\"/>\n\n==List of games==\nA total of 28 games distributed on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were included with the console\u2014a set of 12 in America and a different set of 10 in other countries\u2014with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in a pack for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, ''Percepts'', was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, ''Shooting Gallery'', was available for purchase, and included four games on two cards that used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry.<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/> The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is left up to the players.<ref name=\"HighScore\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"13%\"|Title<ref name=\"VGHttl\"/>\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"3%\"|Game card\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60%\"|Description\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"12%\"|US version\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"12%\"|International version\n|-\n| ''Table Tennis'' || 1 || Two players use paddles to knock a ball back and forth on a screen;

Biden, the former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] and a former [[United States Senator|U.S. senator]] from [[Delaware]], had been the subject of widespread speculation as a potential [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 candidate]] after declining to be a candidate in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].\n\nBiden is generally described as a [[moderate]]. His positions include codifying ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' into statute, a [[public option]] for health insurance, [[decriminalization]] of recreational cannabis, passing the [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]], free [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]], and a $1.7 trillion climate plan embracing the framework of the [[Green New Deal]]. He supports regulation as opposed to a complete ban on [[fracking]].  \n\nAs a former vice president, Biden entered the race with very high name recognition. From his campaign announcement up to the start of elections, he has been the candidate most identified as the frontrunner. He led most national polls through 2019, but did not rank as one of the top three candidates in either the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses]] or the [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire Democratic primary]]. He won a landslide victory in the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary]] on February 29, 2020, which was widely seen as reinvigorating his campaign. In March, Biden was endorsed by 10 of his former competitors, bringing the total number of such endorsements to 12.

Biden, the former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] and a former [[United States Senator|U.S. senator]] from [[Delaware]], had been the subject of widespread speculation as a potential [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 candidate]] after declining to be a candidate in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].\n\nBiden is generally described as a [[moderate]]. His positions include codifying ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' into statute, a [[public option]] for health insurance, [[decriminalization]] of recreational cannabis, passing the [[Equality Act (United States)|Equality Act]], free [[Community colleges in the United States|community college]], and a $1.7 trillion climate plan embracing the framework of the [[Green New Deal]]. He supports regulation as opposed to a complete ban on [[fracking]].  \n\nAs a former vice president, Biden entered the race with very high name recognition. From his campaign announcement up to the start of elections, he has been the candidate most identified as the frontrunner. He led most national polls through 2019, but did not rank as one of the top three candidates in either the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses]] or the [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire Democratic primary]]. He won a landslide victory in the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary]] on February 29, 2020, which was widely seen as reinvigorating his campaign. In March, Biden was endorsed by 10 of his former competitors, bringing the total number of such endorsements to 12. Biden earned enough delegates on [[Super Tuesday 2020]] to pull ahead of Senator [[Bernie Sanders]]. On April 8, 2020, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Joe Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n==Background==\n===Previous presidential campaigns===\n{{main|Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign}}\n\nBiden's 2020 presidential campaign is his third attempt to seek election for president of the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/upshot/trump-biden-warren-polls.html|title=One Year From Election, Trump Trails Biden but Leads Warren in Battlegrounds|last=Cohn|first=Nate|date=November 4, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 29, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> His first campaign was made in the [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988 Democratic Party primaries]] where he was initially considered one of the potentially strongest candidates.

Like his first presidential bid, Biden failed to garner endorsements and support. He withdrew from the race after his poor performance in the [[Iowa caucus]] in January 3, 2008. He was eventually chosen by [[Barack Obama]] as his running mate and won the general election as [[vice president of the United States]], being sworn in on January 20, 2009.\n\n===Speculation===\nVice President Joe Biden was seen as a potential candidate to succeed [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].
