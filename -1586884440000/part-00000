It was written by [[Roland Orzabal]], [[Ian Stanley]], and [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]] and produced by Hughes. The song was first released on 18 March 1985 by [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]], [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], and [[Vertigo Records]] as the third single from the band's second album, ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (1985). \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is a [[new wave music|new wave]] song. Its lyrics detail the desire humans have for control and power and centre on themes of [[corruption]].\n\nMusic critics praised \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" in their retrospective reviews, with some including the song in their respective decade lists. It is regarded as the group's [[signature song]], along with \"[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]\" (1984). It garnered success on charts internationally, peaking at number two in Ireland and the United Kingdom and at number one in Canada, New Zealand, and on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was certified gold by both [[Music Canada]] (MC) and the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).\n\n[[Nigel Dick]] directed the music video, which received promotion from [[MTV]]. It shows bassist [[Curt Smith]] (who sings lead vocal) driving an antique [[Austin-Healey 3000]] sports car around [[Southern California]] intercut with shots of the band performing the song in a studio. In 1986, the song won \"[[Brit Award for British Single of the Year|Best Single]]\" at the [[Brit Awards]]. The group re-recorded the song as a charity single for the [[Sport Aid]] campaign. New Zealand singer [[Lorde]] recorded a cover of the song, which was included in the [[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] for ''[[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire]]'' (2013).\n\n==Background and release==\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was written by [[Roland Orzabal]], [[Ian Stanley]] and [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]], and produced by Hughes. The song was a \"last-minute\" addition during recording sessions of ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (1985). The decision to include the song in the album came after Orzabal played two chords on his acoustic guitar for Hughes.<ref name=\"Rosenberg\">{{cite web|first= Tal |last= Rosenberg |title= Tears for Fears: Songs from the Big Chair Album Review |website= [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date= 20 August 2017 |accessdate= 16 June 2018 |url= https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tears-for-fears-songs-from-the-big-chair/}}</ref> It was recorded in two weeks and added as the final track on the album. According to Orzabal, he initially regarded the song as a lightweight that would not fit with the rest of the album.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]'' magazine, Hughes said that \"as a piece of recording history, [the song is] bland as hell.\" The lyrics of the song were originally \"everybody wants to go to war\", which Orzabal felt was lackluster.<ref>{{cite web|first= Tess |last= Vigeland |first2= Jacob |last2= Margolis |title= Tears for Fears reissue \"Songs from the Big Chair,\" 30 years on |website= Scpr.org |date= 26 November 2014 |accessdate= 22 March 2015 |url= http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2014/11/26/40524/tears-for-fears-reissue-songs-from-the-big-chair-3/}}</ref> However, Hughes convinced Orzabal to record it, in a calculated effort to gain American chart success.

It was written by [[Roland Orzabal]], [[Ian Stanley]], and [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]] and produced by Hughes. The song was first released on 18 March 1985 by [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]], [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], and [[Vertigo Records]] as the third single from the band's second album, ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (1985). \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is a [[new wave music|new wave]] song. Its lyrics detail the desire humans have for control and power and centre on themes of [[corruption]].\n\nMusic critics praised \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" in their retrospective reviews, with some including the song in their respective decade lists. It is regarded as the group's [[signature song]], along with \"[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]\" (1984). It garnered success on charts internationally, peaking at number two in Ireland and the United Kingdom and at number one in Canada, New Zealand, and on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was certified gold by both [[Music Canada]] (MC) and the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).\n\n[[Nigel Dick]] directed the music video, which received promotion from [[MTV]]. It shows bassist [[Curt Smith]] (who sings lead vocal) driving an antique [[Austin-Healey 3000]] sports car around [[Southern California]] intercut with shots of the band performing the song in a studio. In 1986, the song won \"[[Brit Award for British Single of the Year|Best Single]]\" at the [[Brit Awards]]. The group re-recorded the song as a charity single for the [[Sport Aid]] campaign. New Zealand singer [[Lorde]] recorded a cover of the song, which was included in the [[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] for ''[[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire]]'' (2013).\n\n==Background and release==\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was written by [[Roland Orzabal]], [[Ian Stanley]] and [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]], and produced by Hughes. The song was a \"last-minute\" addition during recording sessions of ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (1985). The decision to include the song in the album came after Orzabal played two chords on his acoustic guitar for Hughes.<ref name=\"Rosenberg\">{{cite web|first= Tal |last= Rosenberg |title= Tears for Fears: Songs from the Big Chair Album Review |website= [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date= 20 August 2017 |accessdate= 16 June 2018 |url= https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tears-for-fears-songs-from-the-big-chair/}}</ref> It was recorded in two weeks and added as the final track on the album. According to Orzabal, he initially regarded the song as a lightweight that would not fit with the rest of the album.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]'' magazine, Hughes said that \"as a piece of recording history, [the song is] bland as hell.\" The lyrics of the song were originally \"everybody wants to go to war\", which Orzabal felt was lackluster.<ref>{{cite web|first= Tess |last= Vigeland |first2= Jacob |last2= Margolis |title= Tears for Fears reissue \"Songs from the Big Chair,\" 30 years on |website= Scpr.org |date= 26 November 2014 |accessdate= 22 March 2015 |url= http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2014/11/26/40524/tears-for-fears-reissue-songs-from-the-big-chair-3/}}</ref> However, Hughes convinced Orzabal to record it, in a calculated effort to gain American chart success.

The [[McLaren Group|McLaren]] edition from the [[OnePlus 6T|6T]] returns on the 7T Pro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/10/oneplus-7t-pro-mclaren-edition-announcement/|title=The OnePlus 7T Pro is a speedier take on a familiar design|work=[[Engadget]]|last=Bonifacic|first=Igor|date=10 October 2019|accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref> Both have minor upgrades as with previous T phones, such as new software, upgraded cameras and a faster chipset.\n\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nThe 7T and 7T Pro's designs are similar to their predecessors, with an anodized aluminum frame and [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. The 7T has a near-full screen display with an 86.5% screen-to-body ratio; a small notch at the top of the phone houses the front camera. The camera module on the rear is now circular, with the flash located inside the lens. The 7T Pro is nearly identical to the 7 Pro externally with an 88.1% screen-to-body ratio. The 7T is available in Frosted Silver and Glacial Blue, both of which have a matte finish, and the 7T Pro is available in Haze Blue, which is a lighter shade than the 7 Pro's Nebula Blue.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oneplus.com/7t/specs?from=7t|title=OnePlus 7T Specification{{Snd}} OnePlus (United States)|website=www.oneplus.com|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_7t-9816.php|title=OnePlus 7T{{Snd}} Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nInternally, both the 7T and 7T Pro use the Snapdragon 855+ processor with the [[Adreno]] 640 GPU, both of which have a higher [[Clock rate|clock speed]] than the chipset used in the 7 and 7 Pro. They are available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage and 8&nbsp;GB of [[LPDDR4X]] RAM.

The 7T uses a 3800 mAh battery, while the 7T Pro uses a 4085 mAh battery which is marginally larger than the 7 Pro's. Power and data connections are provided through the USB-C port; fast charging is supported at 30W. Warp Charge 30T is now supported, which is 23% faster than Warp Charge 30 which was used on the 7 Pro.

The 7T Pro uses a mechanized pop-up camera like on the 7 Pro. The array on both phones consists of a primary lens, a telephoto (zoom) lens, and an ultrawide lens. The primary wide lens has a 48&nbsp;MP sensor, while a 16&nbsp;MP sensor is used for the ultrawide lens and a 12&nbsp;MP sensor is used for the telephoto lens. The 7T Pro's camera hardware is unchanged, with a 48&nbsp;MP lens, a 16&nbsp;MP ultrawide lens and an 8&nbsp;MP telephoto lens, but it can now record ultra slow-motion 720p video at 960&nbsp;fps (the 7T also receives the same upgraded slow-motion capabilities) and the laser autofocus has been relocated to the left of the camera. While the 7T's telephoto lens benefits from an increase in resolution and a wider f/2.2 [[aperture]], it lacks the 7T Pro's [[Image stabilization#Optical image stabilization|optical image stabilization]] and laser autofocus and only has 2x optical zoom compared to the 7T Pro's 3x optical zoom, resulting in a smaller 51&nbsp;mm [[focal length]] opposed to the 7T Pro's 78&nbsp;mm focal length. The ultrawide lens has also been upgraded; it is 17&nbsp;mm compared to 13&nbsp;mm on the 7T Pro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/oneplus-announces-the-oneplus-7t-a-90hz-display-phone-for-599/|title=The OnePlus 7T packs a 90&nbsp;Hz display, Snapdragon 855+ for $599|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=26 September 2019|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, both phones benefit from a new macro mode which allows users to take photos from as close as 2.5&nbsp;cm away from the subject.<ref name=\"Verge 7T Pro\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/10/20906256/oneplus-7t-pro-release-date-price-news-features-pop-up-selfie-camera-90hz-screen|title=The OnePlus 7T Pro is a spec bump upgrade that won't come to the US|work=[[The Verge|Circuitbreaker]]|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=10 October 2019|accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref> A new Hybrid Image Stabilization for video is also available, and Portrait Mode and Night Scape can now be used on the wide and ultrawide lenses respectively.\n\n===Software===\nThe 7T and 7T Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]].\n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 46, 48 \n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 66\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41\n|}\nThe OnePlus 7T Pro will only be available in Europe, India, China and Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/oneplus-best-phone-isnt-coming-to-the-us/|title=OnePlus' best phone isn't coming to the US|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=10 October 2019|accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Variants===\nBoth OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro have several variants.

The 7T has a near-full screen display with an 86.5% screen-to-body ratio; a small notch at the top of the phone houses the front camera. The camera module on the rear is now circular, with the flash located inside the lens. The 7T Pro is nearly identical to the 7 Pro externally with an 88.1% screen-to-body ratio. The 7T is available in Frosted Silver and Glacial Blue, both of which have a matte finish, and the 7T Pro is available in Haze Blue, which is a lighter shade than the 7 Pro's Nebula Blue.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oneplus.com/7t/specs?from=7t|title=OnePlus 7T Specification{{Snd}} OnePlus (United States)|website=www.oneplus.com|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_7t-9816.php|title=OnePlus 7T{{Snd}} Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nInternally, both the 7T and 7T Pro use the Snapdragon 855+ processor with the [[Adreno]] 640 GPU, both of which have a higher [[Clock rate|clock speed]] than the chipset used in the 7 and 7 Pro.

The 7T uses a 3800 mAh battery, while the 7T Pro uses a 4085 mAh battery which is marginally larger than the 7 Pro's. Power and data connections are provided through the USB-C port; fast charging is supported at 30W. Warp Charge 30T is now supported, which is 23% faster than Warp Charge 30 which was used on the 7 Pro.

The 7T Pro uses a mechanized pop-up camera like on the 7 Pro. The array on both phones consists of a primary lens, a telephoto (zoom) lens, and an ultrawide lens. The primary wide lens has a 48&nbsp;MP sensor, while a 16&nbsp;MP sensor is used for the ultrawide lens and a 12&nbsp;MP sensor is used for the telephoto lens. The 7T Pro's camera hardware is unchanged, with a 48&nbsp;MP lens, a 16&nbsp;MP ultrawide lens and an 8&nbsp;MP telephoto lens, but it can now record ultra slow-motion 720p video at 960&nbsp;fps (the 7T also receives the same upgraded slow-motion capabilities) and the laser autofocus has been relocated to the left of the camera. While the 7T's telephoto lens benefits from an increase in resolution and a wider f/2.2 [[aperture]], it lacks the 7T Pro's [[Image stabilization#Optical image stabilization|optical image stabilization]] and laser autofocus and only has 2x optical zoom compared to the 7T Pro's 3x optical zoom, resulting in a smaller 51&nbsp;mm [[focal length]] opposed to the 7T Pro's 78&nbsp;mm focal length. The ultrawide lens has also been upgraded; it is 17&nbsp;mm compared to 13&nbsp;mm on the 7T Pro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/oneplus-announces-the-oneplus-7t-a-90hz-display-phone-for-599/|title=The OnePlus 7T packs a 90&nbsp;Hz display, Snapdragon 855+ for $599|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=26 September 2019|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> Additionally, both phones benefit from a new macro mode which allows users to take photos from as close as 2.5&nbsp;cm away from the subject.<ref name=\"Verge 7T Pro\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/10/20906256/oneplus-7t-pro-release-date-price-news-features-pop-up-selfie-camera-90hz-screen|title=The OnePlus 7T Pro is a spec bump upgrade that won't come to the US|work=[[The Verge|Circuitbreaker]]|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=10 October 2019|accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref> A new Hybrid Image Stabilization for video is also available, and Portrait Mode and Night Scape can now be used on the wide and ultrawide lenses respectively.\n\n===Software===\nThe 7T and 7T Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]].\n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 46, 48 \n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 66\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41\n|}\nThe OnePlus 7T Pro will only be available in Europe, India, China and Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/oneplus-best-phone-isnt-coming-to-the-us/|title=OnePlus' best phone isn't coming to the US|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=10 October 2019|accessdate=10 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Variants===\nBoth OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro have several variants.

{"title_page": "Medical image computing", "text_new": "'''Medical image computing (MIC)''' is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of [[computer science]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[medicine]]. This field develops computational and mathematical methods for solving problems pertaining to medical images and their use for biomedical research and clinical care.\n\nThe main goal of MIC is to extract clinically relevant information or knowledge from medical images. While closely related to the field of [[medical imaging]], MIC focuses on the computational analysis of the images, not their acquisition. The methods can be grouped into several broad categories: [[#Segmentation|image segmentation]], [[#Registration|image registration]], [[#Image-based Physiological Modelling|image-based physiological modeling]], and others.\n\n== Data forms ==\n\nMedical image computing typically operates on uniformly sampled data with regular x-y-z spatial spacing (images in 2D and volumes in 3D, generically referred to as images). At each sample point, data is commonly represented in [[Integer (computer science)|integral]] form such as signed and unsigned short (16-bit), although forms from unsigned char (8-bit) to 32-bit float are not uncommon. The particular meaning of the data at the sample point depends on modality: for example a [[X-ray computed tomography|CT acquisition]] collects radiodensity values, while a [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI acquisition]] may collect [[T1 relaxation|T1]] or [[Spin-spin relaxation time|T2]]-weighted images. Longitudinal, time-varying acquisitions may or may not acquire images with regular time steps. Fan-like images due to modalities such as [[High-intensity focused ultrasound|curved-array ultrasound]] are also common and require different representational and algorithmic techniques to process.

Although there are many [[Segmentation (image processing)|computer vision techniques for image segmentation]], some have been adapted specifically for medical image computing. Below is a sampling of techniques within this field; the implementation relies on the expertise that clinicians can provide.\n\n* '''Atlas-Based Segmentation''': For many applications, a clinical expert can manually label several images; segmenting unseen images is a matter of extrapolating from these manually labeled training images. Methods of this style are typically referred to as atlas-based segmentation methods. Parametric atlas methods typically combine these training images into a single atlas image,<ref name=\"Gee-1993\" /> while nonparametric atlas methods typically use all of the training images separately.<ref name=\"Sabuncu-2010\" /> Atlas-based methods usually require the use of [[#Registration|image registration]] in order to align the atlas image or images to a new, unseen image.\n* '''Shape-Based Segmentation''': Many methods parametrize a template shape for a given structure, often relying on control points along the boundary. The entire shape is then deformed to match a new image. Two of the most common shape-based techniques are Active Shape Models <ref name=\"Cootes-Taylor-1995\" /> and Active Appearance Models.<ref name=\"Cootes-2001\" /> These methods have been very influential, and have given rise to similar models.<ref name=\"MedImagingBook\">{{cite book|author1=G.

An algorithm can then iteratively refine such a segmentation, with or without guidance from the clinician. Manual segmentation, using tools such as a paint brush to explicitly define the tissue class of each pixel, remains the gold standard for many imaging applications. Recently, principles from feedback [[control theory]] have been incorporated into segmentation, which give the user much greater flexibility and allow for the automatic correction of errors.<ref name=\"feedback-2011\" />\n*'''Subjective surface Segmentation:''' This method is based on the idea of evolution of segmentation function which is governed by an advection-diffusion model.<ref>K.

Typically, one image is treated as the target image and the other is treated as a source image; the source image is transformed to match the target image. The [[Mathematical optimization|optimization procedure]] updates the transformation of the source image based on a similarity value that evaluates the current quality of the alignment. This iterative procedure is repeated until a (local) optimum is found. An example is the registration of CT and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] images to combine structural and metabolic information (see figure).\n\nImage registration is used in a variety of medical applications:\n* Studying temporal changes. [[Longitudinal studies]] acquire images over several months or years to study long-term processes, such as disease progression. [[Time series]] correspond to images acquired within the same session (seconds or minutes). They can be used to study cognitive processes, heart deformations and respiration.\n* Combining complementary information from different [[Medical imaging|imaging modalities]]. An example is the fusion of anatomical and functional information. Since the size and shape of structures vary across modalities, it is more challenging to evaluate the alignment quality. This has led to the use of [[similarity measure]]s such as [[mutual information]].<ref name=\"pluim-2003\"/>\n* Characterizing a population of subjects. In contrast to intra-subject registration, a one-to-one mapping may not exist between subjects, depending on the structural variability of the organ of interest. Inter-subject registration is required for atlas construction in [[computational anatomy]].<ref name=\"grenander-1998\"/> Here, the objective is to statistically model the anatomy of organs across subjects.\n* [[Computer-assisted surgery]]. In computer-assisted surgery pre-operative images such as CT or MRI are registered to intra-operative images or tracking systems to facilitate image guidance or navigation.\n\nThere are several important considerations when performing image registration:\n* The [[Transformation geometry|transformation model]]. Common choices are [[Rigid transformation|rigid]], [[Affine transformation|affine]], and [[Deformation (engineering)|deformable]] transformation models. [[B-spline]] and [[thin plate spline]] models are commonly used for parameterized transformation fields. Non-parametric or dense deformation fields carry a displacement vector at every grid location; this necessitates additional [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] constraints. A specific class of deformation fields are [[diffeomorphisms]], which are invertible transformations with a smooth inverse.\n* The similarity metric. A distance or similarity function is used to quantify the registration quality. This similarity can be calculated either on the original images or on features extracted from the images. Common similarity measures are sum of squared distances (SSD), [[coefficient of determination|correlation coefficient]], and [[mutual information]]. The choice of similarity measure depends on whether the images are from the same modality; the acquisition noise can also play a role in this decision. For example, SSD is the optimal similarity measure for images of the same modality with [[Gaussian noise]].<ref name=\"viola-1995\"/> However, the image statistics in ultrasound are significantly different from Gaussian noise, leading to the introduction of ultrasound specific similarity measures.<ref name=\"wachinger-2011\"/> Multi-modal registration requires a more sophisticated similarity measure; alternatively, a different image representation can be used, such as structural representations<ref name=\"wachinger-2012\"/> or registering adjacent anatomy.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1994-04-01|title=Medical image registration using knowledge of adjacency of anatomical structures|journal=Image and Vision Computing|volume=12|issue=3|pages=173\u2013178|doi=10.1016/0262-8856(94)90069-8|issn=0262-8856|last1=Hill|first1=Derek LG|last2=Hawkes|first2=David J|citeseerx=10.1.1.421.5162}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Toth|first=Daniel|last2=Panayiotou|first2=Maria|last3=Brost|first3=Alexander|last4=Behar|first4=Jonathan M.|last5=Rinaldi|first5=Christopher A.|last6=Rhode|first6=Kawal S.|last7=Mountney|first7=Peter|date=2016-10-17|title=Registration with Adjacent Anatomical Structures for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Guidance|journal=Statistical Atlases and Computational Models of the Heart.

Either [[continuous optimization|continuous]] or [[discrete optimization]] is performed. For continuous optimization, [[Gradient method|gradient-based optimization]] techniques are applied to improve the convergence speed.\n\n== Visualization ==\n[[File:Visualization of Medical Imaging.png|thumb|300px|Volume rendering (left), axial cross-section (right top), and sagittal cross-section (right bottom) of a CT image of a subject with multiple nodular lesions (white line) in the lung.]]\n\nVisualization plays several key roles in Medical Image Computing. Methods from [[scientific visualization]] are used to understand and communicate about medical images, which are inherently spatial-temporal. [[Data visualization]] and [[data analysis]] are used on [[unstructured data]] forms, for example when evaluating statistical measures derived during algorithmic processing. [[Interactive visualization|Direct interaction]] with data, a key feature of the visualization process, is used to perform visual queries about data, annotate images, guide segmentation and registration processes, and control the visual representation of data (by controlling lighting rendering properties and viewing parameters). Visualization is used both for initial exploration and for conveying intermediate and final results of analyses.\n\nThe figure \"Visualization of Medical Imaging\" illustrates several types of visualization: 1. the display of cross-sections as gray scale images; 2. reformatted views of gray scale images (the sagittal view in this example has a different orientation than the original direction of the image acquisition; and 3. A [[Volume rendering|3D volume rendering]] of the same data. The nodular lesion is clearly visible in the different presentations and has been annotated with a white line.\n\n== Atlases ==\nMedical images can vary significantly across individuals due to people having organs of different shapes and sizes. Therefore, representing medical images to account for this variability is crucial. A popular approach to represent medical images is through the use of one or more atlases. Here, an atlas refers to a specific model for a population of images with parameters that are learned from a training dataset.<ref name=\"decraene_et_al\" /><ref name=\"twining_et_al\" />\n\nThe simplest example of an atlas is a mean intensity image, commonly referred to as a template. However, an atlas can also include richer information, such as local image statistics and the probability that a particular spatial location has a certain label. New medical images, which are not used during training, can be mapped to an atlas, which has been tailored to the specific application, such as [[#Segmentation|segmentation]] and [[#Group Analysis|group analysis]]. Mapping an image to an atlas usually involves [[#Registration|registering]] the image and the atlas. This deformation can be used to address variability in medical images.\n\n=== Single template ===\nThe simplest approach is to model medical images as deformed versions of a single template image. For example, anatomical MRI brain scans are often mapped to the MNI template <ref name=\"mni_template\" /> as to represent all the brain scans in common coordinates. The main drawback of a single-template approach is that if there are significant differences between the template and a given test image, then there may not be a good way to map one onto the other. For example, an anatomical MRI brain scan of a patient with severe brain abnormalities (i.e., a tumor or surgical procedure), may not easily map to the MNI template.\n\n=== Multiple templates ===\nRather than relying on a single template, multiple templates can be used. The idea is to represent an image as a deformed version of one of the templates. For example, there could be one template for a healthy population and one template for a diseased population. However, in many applications, it is not clear how many templates are needed. A simple albeit computationally expensive way to deal with this is to have every image in a training dataset be a template image and thus every new image encountered is compared against every image in the training dataset. A more recent approach automatically finds the number of templates needed.<ref name=\"icluster\" />\n\n== Statistical analysis ==\nStatistical methods combine the medical imaging field with modern [[Computer Vision]], [[Machine Learning]] and [[Pattern Recognition]]. Over the last decade, several large datasets have been made publicly available (see for example ADNI, 1000 functional Connectomes Project), in part due to collaboration between various institutes and research centers. This increase in data size calls for new algorithms that can mine and detect subtle changes in the images to address clinical questions. Such clinical questions are very diverse and include group analysis, imaging biomarkers, disease phenotyping and longitudinal studies.\n\n=== Group analysis ===\nIn the Group Analysis, the objective is to detect and quantize abnormalities induced by a disease by comparing the images of two or more cohorts. Usually one of these cohorts consist of normal (control) subjects, and the other one consists of abnormal patients. Variation caused by the disease can manifest itself as abnormal deformation of anatomy (see [[Voxel-based morphometry]]). For example, shrinkage of sub-cortical tissues such as the [[Hippocampus]] in brain may be linked to [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Additionally, changes in biochemical (functional) activity can be observed using imaging modalities such as [[Positron Emission Tomography]].\n\nThe comparison between groups is usually conducted on the [[voxel]] level. Hence, the most popular pre-processing pipeline, particularly in [[neuroimaging]], transforms all of the images in a dataset to a common coordinate frame via ([[#Registration|Medical Image Registration]]) in order to maintain correspondence between voxels. Given this voxel-wise correspondence, the most common [[Frequentist]] method is to extract a statistic for each voxel (for example, the mean voxel intensity for each group) and perform [[statistical hypothesis testing]] to evaluate whether a null hypothesis is or is not supported. The null hypothesis typically assumes that the two cohorts are drawn from the same distribution, and hence, should have the same statistical properties (for example, the mean values of two groups are equal for a particular voxel). Since medical images contain large numbers of voxels, the issue of [[multiple comparison]] needs to be addressed,.<ref name=\"Ashburner2000\" /><ref name=\"Davat2004\" /> There are also [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] approaches to tackle group analysis problem.<ref name=\"Friston2002\" />\n\n=== Classification ===\nAlthough group analysis can quantify the general effects of a pathology on an anatomy and function, it does not provide subject level measures, and hence cannot be used as biomarkers for diagnosis (see Imaging Biomarkers). Clinicians, on the other hand, are often interested in early diagnosis of the pathology (i.e. classification,<ref name=\"Yong2008\" /><ref name=\"remi2011\" />) and in learning the progression of a disease (i.e. regression <ref name=\"wang2011\" />). From methodological point of view, current techniques varies from applying standard machine learning algorithms to medical imaging datasets (e.g. [[Support Vector Machine]] <ref name=\"benoit2009\" />), to developing new approaches adapted for the needs of the field.<ref name=\"batman2012\" /> The main difficulties are as follows:\n\n* Small sample size ([[Curse of Dimensionality]]): a large medical imaging dataset contains hundreds to thousands of images, whereas the number of voxels in a typical volumetric image can easily go beyond millions. A remedy to this problem is to reduce the number of features in an informative sense (see [[dimensionality reduction]]). Several unsupervised and semi-/supervised,<ref name=\"batman2012\" /><ref name=\"Fung2007\" /><ref name=\"chaves2009\" /><ref name=\"liu2004\" /> approaches have been proposed to address this issue.\n* Interpretability: A good generalization accuracy is not always the primary objective, as clinicians would like to understand which parts of anatomy are affected by the disease. Therefore, interpretability of the results is very important; methods that ignore the image structure are not favored. Alternative methods based on [[feature selection]] have been proposed,.<ref name=\"Fung2007\" /><ref name=\"chaves2009\" /><ref name=\"liu2004\" /><ref name=\"savio2012\" />\n\n=== Clustering ===\nImage-based pattern classification methods typically assume that the neurological effects of a disease are distinct and well defined. This may not always be the case. For a number of medical conditions, the patient populations are highly heterogeneous, and further categorization into sub-conditions has not been established. Additionally, some diseases (e.g., [[autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD), [[schizophrenia]], [[mild cognitive impairment]] (MCI)) can be characterized by a continuous or nearly-continuous spectra from mild cognitive impairment to very pronounced pathological changes. To facilitate image-based analysis of heterogeneous disorders, methodological alternatives to pattern classification have been developed. These techniques borrow ideas from high-dimensional clustering <ref name=\"filip2011\" /> and high-dimensional pattern-regression to cluster a given population into homogeneous sub-populations. The goal is to provide a better quantitative understanding of the disease within each sub-population.\n\n=== Shape analysis ===\n[[Statistical shape analysis|Shape Analysis]] is the field of Medical Image Computing that studies [[geometry|geometrical]] properties of structures obtained from different [[Medical imaging#Imaging technology|imaging modalities]]. Shape analysis recently become of increasing interest to the medical community due to its potential to precisely locate [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] changes between different populations of structures, i.e. healthy vs pathological, female vs male, young vs elderly. Shape Analysis includes two main steps: shape correspondence and statistical analysis.\n\n* Shape correspondence is the methodology that computes correspondent locations between geometric shapes represented by triangle meshes, contours, point sets or volumetric images. Obviously definition of correspondence will influence directly the analysis. Among the different options for correspondence frameworks we can find: Anatomical correspondence, manual landmarks, functional correspondence (i.e. in brain morphometry locus responsible for same neuronal functionality), geometry correspondence, (for image volumes) intensity similarity, etc. Some approaches, e.g. spectral shape analysis, do not require correspondence but compare shape descriptors directly.\n* Statistical analysis will provide measurements of structural change at correspondent locations.\n\n=== Longitudinal studies ===\n\nIn longitudinal studies the same person is imaged repeatedly. This information can be incorporated both into the [[image analysis]], as well as into the statistical modeling. \n* In longitudinal image processing, segmentation and analysis methods of individual time points are informed and regularized with common information usually from a within-subject template. This regularization is designed to reduce measurement noise and thus helps increase sensitivity and statistical power. At the same time over-regularization needs to be avoided, so that effect sizes remain stable. Intense regularization, for example, can lead to excellent test-retest reliability, but limits the ability to detect any true changes and differences across groups. Often a trade-off needs to be aimed for, that optimizes noise reduction at the cost of limited effect size loss. Another common challenge in longitudinal image processing is the, often unintentional, introduction of processing bias. When, for example, follow-up images get registered and resampled to the baseline image, interpolation artifacts get introduced to only the follow-up images and not the baseline. These artifact can cause spurious effects (usually a bias towards overestimating longitudinal change and thus underestimating required sample size). It is therefore essential that all-time points get treated exactly the same to avoid any processing bias.\n*  Post-processing and statistical analysis of longitudinal data usually requires dedicated statistical tools such as repeated measure ANOVA or the more powerful linear mixed effects models. Additionally, it is advantageous to consider the spatial distribution of the signal. For example, cortical thickness measurements will show a correlation within-subject across time and also within a neighborhood on the cortical surface - a fact that can be used to increase statistical power. Furthermore, time-to-event (aka survival) analysis is frequently employed to analyze longitudinal data and determine significant predictors.\n\n== Image-based physiological modelling ==\n\nTraditionally, medical image computing has seen to address the quantification and fusion of structural or functional information available at the point and time of image acquisition. In this regard, it can be seen as quantitative sensing of the underlying anatomical, physical or physiological processes. However, over the last few years, there has been a growing interest in the predictive assessment of disease or therapy course. Image-based modelling, be it of biomechanical or physiological nature, can therefore extend the possibilities of image computing from a descriptive to a predictive angle.\n\nAccording to the STEP research roadmap,<ref>[http://www.europhysiome.org/roadmap STEP research roadmap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828022132/http://www.europhysiome.org/roadmap |date=2008-08-28 }}. europhysiome.org</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=J.

These two broad research areas include the transformation of generic computational models to represent specific subjects, thus paving the way for personalized computational models.<ref>N.

Viceconti (2005) [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/health/docs/events/barcelona2005/ec-vph-white-paper2005nov.pdf \"Towards virtual physiological human: Multilevel modelling and simulation of the human anatomy and physiology\"]. Directorate General INFSO & Directorate General JRC, White paper</ref>  Individualization of generic computational models through imaging can be realized in three complementary directions: \n* definition of the subject-specific computational domain (anatomy) and related subdomains (tissue types);  \n* definition of boundary and initial conditions from (dynamic and/or functional) imaging; and  \n* characterization of structural and functional tissue properties.\n\nIn addition, imaging also plays a pivotal role in the evaluation and validation of such models both in humans and in animal models, and in the translation of models to the clinical setting with both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this specific context, molecular, biological, and pre-clinical imaging render additional data and understanding of basic structure and function in molecules, cells, tissues and animal models that may be transferred to human physiology where appropriate.\n\nThe applications of image-based VPH/Physiome models in basic and clinical domains are vast. Broadly speaking, they promise to become new ''virtual imaging techniques''. Effectively more, often non-observable, parameters will be imaged ''in silico'' based on the integration of observable but sometimes sparse and inconsistent multimodal images and physiological measurements. Computational models will serve to engender interpretation of the measurements in a way compliant with the underlying biophysical, biochemical or biological laws of the physiological or pathophysiological processes under investigation. Ultimately, such investigative tools and systems will help our understanding of disease processes, the natural history of disease evolution, and the influence on the course of a disease of pharmacological and/or interventional therapeutic procedures.\n\nCross-fertilization between imaging and modelling goes beyond interpretation of measurements in a way consistent with physiology. Image-based patient-specific modelling, combined with models of medical devices and pharmacological therapies, opens the way to predictive imaging whereby one will be able to understand, plan and optimize such interventions ''in silico''.\n\n== Mathematical methods in medical imaging ==\nA number of sophisticated mathematical methods have entered medical imaging, and have already been\nimplemented in various software packages. These include approaches based on [[partial differential equations]] (PDEs) and curvature driven flows for enhancement, segmentation, and registration. Since they employ PDEs, the methods are amenable to parallelization and implementation on GPGPUs. A number of these techniques have been inspired from ideas in [[optimal control]]. Accordingly, very recently ideas from control have recently made their way into interactive methods, especially segmentation. Moreover, because of noise and the need for statistical estimation techniques for more dynamically changing imagery, the [[Kalman filter]] <ref>{{cite journal |author1=Boulfelfel D. |author2=Rangayyan R.M. |author3=Hahn L.J. |author4=Kloiber R. |author5=Kuduvalli G.R. | year = 1994 | title = Restoration of single photon emission computed tomography images by the Kalman filter | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 102\u2013109 | doi=10.1109/42.276148 | pmid=18218487}}</ref> and [[particle filter]] have come into use. A survey of these methods with an extensive list of references may be found in.<ref name=\"mathematical-2006\"/>\n\n==Modality specific computing==\n\nSome imaging modalities provide very specialized information. The resulting images cannot be treated as regular scalar images and give rise to new sub-areas of Medical Image Computing. Examples include [[#Diffusion MRI|diffusion MRI]],\n[[#Functional MRI|functional MRI]] and others.\n\n===Diffusion MRI===\n[[File:DiffusionMRI glyphs.png|thumb|right|A mid-axial slice of the ICBM diffusion tensor image template. Each voxel's value is a tensor represented here by an ellipsoid. Color denotes principal orientation: red = left-right, blue=inferior-superior, green = posterior-anterior]]\n\n[[Diffusion MRI]] is a structural [[magnetic resonance imaging]] modality that allows measurement of the diffusion process of molecules. Diffusion is measured by applying a gradient pulse to a magnetic field along a particular direction. In a typical acquisition, a set of uniformly distributed gradient directions is used to create a set of diffusion weighted volumes. In addition, an unweighted volume is acquired under the same magnetic field without application of a gradient pulse. As each acquisition is associated with multiple volumes, [[diffusion MRI]] has created a variety of unique challenges in medical image computing.\n\nIn medicine, there are two major computational goals in [[diffusion MRI]]:\n* Estimation of local tissue properties, such as diffusivity;\n* Estimation of local directions and global pathways of diffusion.\n\nThe [[Diffusion tensor imaging|diffusion tensor]],<ref name=\"Basser-1994\"/> a 3 &times; 3 symmetric [[positive-definite matrix]], offers a straightforward solution to both of these goals. It is proportional to the covariance matrix of a Normally distributed local diffusion profile and, thus, the dominant eigenvector of this matrix is the principal direction of local diffusion. Due to the simplicity of this model, a maximum likelihood estimate of the diffusion tensor can be found by simply solving a system of linear equations at each location independently. However, as the volume is assumed to contain contiguous tissue fibers, it may be preferable to estimate the volume of diffusion tensors in its entirety by imposing regularity conditions on the underlying field of tensors.<ref name=\"Fillard-2007\"/> Scalar values can be extracted from the diffusion tensor, such as the [[fractional anisotropy]], mean, axial and radial diffusivities, which ''indirectly'' measure tissue properties such as the dysmyelination of axonal fibers <ref name=\"Song-2002\"/> or the presence of edema.<ref name=\"Barzo-1997\"/> Standard scalar image computing methods, such as registration and segmentation, can be applied directly to volumes of such scalar values. However, to fully exploit the information in the diffusion tensor, these methods have been adapted to account for tensor valued volumes when performing registration <ref name=\"Alexander-2001\"/><ref name=\"Cao-2006\"/> and segmentation.<ref name=\"Wang-2005\"/><ref name=\"Pichon-2008\"/>\n\nGiven the principal direction of diffusion at each location in the volume, it is possible to estimate the global pathways of diffusion through a process known as [[tractography]].<ref name=\"Mori-1999\"/> However, due to the relatively low resolution of [[diffusion MRI]], many of these pathways may cross, kiss or fan at a single location. In this situation, the single principal direction of the [[Diffusion tensor imaging|diffusion tensor]] is not an appropriate model for the local diffusion distribution. The most common solution to this problem is to estimate multiple directions of local diffusion using more complex models. These include mixtures of diffusion tensors,<ref name=\"Tuch-2002\"/> Q-ball imaging,<ref name=\"Tuch-2004\"/> diffusion spectrum imaging <ref name=\"Wedeen-2005\"/> and fiber orientation distribution functions,<ref name=\"Jansons-2003\"/><ref name=\"Tournier-2004\"/> which typically require [[Diffusion MRI#HARDI: High-angular-resolution diffusion imaging and Q-ball vector analysis|HARDI]] acquisition with a large number of gradient directions. As with the diffusion tensor, volumes valued with these complex models require special treatment when applying image computing methods, such as [[Image registration|registration]] <ref name=\"Geng-2009\"/><ref name=\"Yap-2011\"/><ref name=\"Zhang-2012\"/> and segmentation.<ref name=\"Descoteaux-2007\"/>\n\n=== Functional MRI ===\n[[Fmri|Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] is a medical imaging modality that indirectly measures neural activity by observing the local [[hemodynamic response|hemodynamics]], or blood oxygen level dependent signal (BOLD). fMRI data offers a range of insights, and can be roughly divided into two categories:\n\n* '''Task related fMRI''' is acquired as the subject is performing a sequence of timed experimental conditions. In block-design experiments, the conditions are present for short periods of time (e.g., 10 seconds) and are alternated with periods of rest. Event-related experiments rely on a random sequence of stimuli and use a single time point to denote each condition. The standard approach to analyze task related fMRI is the [[general linear model]] (GLM) <ref name=\"friston-1995\"/>\n* '''[[Resting state fMRI]]''' is acquired in the absence of any experimental task. Typically, the objective is to study the intrinsic network structure of the brain. Observations made during rest have also been linked to specific cognitive processes such as encoding or reflection. Most studies of resting state fMRI focus on low frequency fluctuations of the fMRI signal (LF-BOLD). Seminal discoveries include the [[default network]],<ref name=\"buckner-2008\"/> a comprehensive cortical parcellation,<ref name=\"yeo-2011\"/> and the linking of network characteristics to behavioral parameters.\n\nThere is a rich set of methodology used to analyze functional neuroimaging data, and there is often no consensus regarding the ''best'' method. Instead, researchers approach each problem independently and select a suitable model/algorithm. In this context there is a relatively active exchange among [[neuroscience]], [[computational biology]], [[statistics]], and [[machine learning]] communities. Prominent approaches include\n\n* '''Massive univariate approaches''' that probe individual voxels in the imaging data for a relationship to the experiment condition. The prime approach is the [[general linear model]] (GLM) <ref name=\"friston-1995\"/>\n* '''Multivariate- and classifier based approaches''', often referred to as multi voxel pattern analysis or multi-variate pattern analysis probe the data for global and potentially distributed responses to an experimental condition. Early approaches used [[Support vector machine|support vector machines (SVM)]] to study responses to visual stimuli.<ref name=\"haxby-2001\"/> Recently, alternative pattern recognition algorithms have been explored, such as [[random forest]] based gini contrast <ref name=\"langs-2011-gini\"/> or sparse regression and dictionary learning <ref name=\"varoquaux-2011\"/>\n* '''Functional connectivity analysis''' studies the intrinsic network structure of the brain, including the interactions between regions. The majority of such studies focus on resting state data to parcelate the brain <ref name=\"yeo-2011\"/> or to find correlates to behavioral measures.<ref name=\"heuvel-2009\"/> Task specific data can be used to study causal relationships among brain regions (e.g., dynamic causal mapping (DCM) <ref name=\"friston-2003\"/>).\n\nWhen working with large cohorts of subjects, the normalization (registration) of individual subjects into a common reference frame is crucial. A body of work and tools exist to perform normalization based on anatomy ([[FMRIB Software Library|FSL]], [[FreeSurfer]], [[Statistical parametric mapping|SPM]]). Alignment taking spatial variability across subjects into account is a more recent line of work. Examples are the alignment of the cortex based on fMRI signal correlation,<ref name=\"sabuncu-2010-alignment\"/> the alignment based on the global functional connectivity structure both in task-, or resting state data,<ref name=\"langs-2011\"/> and the alignment based on stimulus specific activation profiles of individual voxels.<ref name=\"haxby-2011\"/>\n\n== Software ==\nSoftware for medical image computing is a complex combination of systems providing IO, visualization and interaction, user interface, data management and computation. Typically system architectures are layered to serve algorithm developers, application developers, and users. The bottom layers are often libraries and/or toolkits which provide base computational capabilities; while the top layers are specialized applications which address specific medical problems, diseases, or body systems.\n\n== Additional notes ==\n\nMedical Image Computing is also related to the field of [[Computer Vision]]. An international society, [[The MICCAI Society]] represents the field and organizes an annual conference and associated workshops. Proceedings for this conference are published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1007/BFb0056181|volume=1496|year=1998|title=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-65136-9|last1=Wells|first1=William M|last2=Colchester|first2=Alan|last3=Delp|first3=Scott|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:33776182|type=Submitted manuscript}}</ref> In 2000, N.

This field develops computational and mathematical methods for solving problems pertaining to medical images and their use for biomedical research and clinical care.\n\nThe main goal of MIC is to extract clinically relevant information or knowledge from medical images. While closely related to the field of [[medical imaging]], MIC focuses on the computational analysis of the images, not their acquisition. The methods can be grouped into several broad categories: [[#Segmentation|image segmentation]], [[#Registration|image registration]], [[#Image-based Physiological Modelling|image-based physiological modeling]], and others.\n\n== Data forms ==\n\nMedical image computing typically operates on uniformly sampled data with regular x-y-z spatial spacing (images in 2D and volumes in 3D, generically referred to as images). At each sample point, data is commonly represented in [[Integer (computer science)|integral]] form such as signed and unsigned short (16-bit), although forms from unsigned char (8-bit) to 32-bit float are not uncommon. The particular meaning of the data at the sample point depends on modality: for example a [[X-ray computed tomography|CT acquisition]] collects radiodensity values, while a [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI acquisition]] may collect [[T1 relaxation|T1]] or [[Spin-spin relaxation time|T2]]-weighted images. Longitudinal, time-varying acquisitions may or may not acquire images with regular time steps. Fan-like images due to modalities such as [[High-intensity focused ultrasound|curved-array ultrasound]] are also common and require different representational and algorithmic techniques to process. Other data forms include sheared images due to [http://www.impactscan.org/slides/techniquesandtechnology/img19.html gantry tilt] during acquisition; and [[Unstructured grid|unstructured meshes]], such as hexahedral and tetrahedral forms, which are used in advanced [[Biomechanics|biomechanical analysis]] (e.g., tissue deformation, vascular transport, bone implants).\n\n== Segmentation ==\n\n[[File:MeningiomaMRISegmentation.png|thumb|A [[MRI#T1-weighted MRI|T1 weighted MR]] image of the brain of a patient with a meningioma after injection of a [[MRI contrast agent]] (top left), and the same image with the result of an interactive segmentation overlaid in green (3D model of the segmentation on the top right, axial and coronal views at the bottom).]]\n\nSegmentation is the process of partitioning an image into different meaningful segments. In medical imaging, these segments often correspond to different tissue classes, [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], pathologies, or other biologically relevant structures.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Forghani| first1 = M. | last2 = Forouzanfar | first2 = M.| last3 = Teshnehlab| first3 = M. | year = 2010 | title = Parameter optimization of improved fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm for brain MR image segmentation | url = | journal = Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 160\u2013168 | doi = 10.1016/j.engappai.2009.10.002 }}</ref> Medical image segmentation is made difficult by low contrast, noise, and other imaging ambiguities. Although there are many [[Segmentation (image processing)|computer vision techniques for image segmentation]], some have been adapted specifically for medical image computing. Below is a sampling of techniques within this field; the implementation relies on the expertise that clinicians can provide.\n\n* '''Atlas-Based Segmentation''': For many applications, a clinical expert can manually label several images; segmenting unseen images is a matter of extrapolating from these manually labeled training images. Methods of this style are typically referred to as atlas-based segmentation methods. Parametric atlas methods typically combine these training images into a single atlas image,<ref name=\"Gee-1993\" /> while nonparametric atlas methods typically use all of the training images separately.<ref name=\"Sabuncu-2010\" /> Atlas-based methods usually require the use of [[#Registration|image registration]] in order to align the atlas image or images to a new, unseen image.\n* '''Shape-Based Segmentation''': Many methods parametrize a template shape for a given structure, often relying on control points along the boundary. The entire shape is then deformed to match a new image. Two of the most common shape-based techniques are Active Shape Models <ref name=\"Cootes-Taylor-1995\" /> and Active Appearance Models.<ref name=\"Cootes-2001\" /> These methods have been very influential, and have given rise to similar models.<ref name=\"MedImagingBook\">{{cite book|author1=G.

An algorithm can then iteratively refine such a segmentation, with or without guidance from the clinician. Manual segmentation, using tools such as a paint brush to explicitly define the tissue class of each pixel, remains the gold standard for many imaging applications. Recently, principles from feedback [[control theory]] have been incorporated into segmentation, which give the user much greater flexibility and allow for the automatic correction of errors.<ref name=\"feedback-2011\" />\n*'''Subjective surface Segmentation:''' This method is based on the idea of evolution of segmentation function which is governed by an advection-diffusion model.<ref>K.

Typically, one image is treated as the target image and the other is treated as a source image; the source image is transformed to match the target image. The [[Mathematical optimization|optimization procedure]] updates the transformation of the source image based on a similarity value that evaluates the current quality of the alignment. This iterative procedure is repeated until a (local) optimum is found. An example is the registration of CT and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] images to combine structural and metabolic information (see figure).\n\nImage registration is used in a variety of medical applications:\n* Studying temporal changes. [[Longitudinal studies]] acquire images over several months or years to study long-term processes, such as disease progression. [[Time series]] correspond to images acquired within the same session (seconds or minutes). They can be used to study cognitive processes, heart deformations and respiration.\n* Combining complementary information from different [[Medical imaging|imaging modalities]]. An example is the fusion of anatomical and functional information. Since the size and shape of structures vary across modalities, it is more challenging to evaluate the alignment quality. This has led to the use of [[similarity measure]]s such as [[mutual information]].<ref name=\"pluim-2003\"/>\n* Characterizing a population of subjects. In contrast to intra-subject registration, a one-to-one mapping may not exist between subjects, depending on the structural variability of the organ of interest. Inter-subject registration is required for atlas construction in [[computational anatomy]].<ref name=\"grenander-1998\"/> Here, the objective is to statistically model the anatomy of organs across subjects.\n* [[Computer-assisted surgery]]. In computer-assisted surgery pre-operative images such as CT or MRI are registered to intra-operative images or tracking systems to facilitate image guidance or navigation.\n\nThere are several important considerations when performing image registration:\n* The [[Transformation geometry|transformation model]]. Common choices are [[Rigid transformation|rigid]], [[Affine transformation|affine]], and [[Deformation (engineering)|deformable]] transformation models. [[B-spline]] and [[thin plate spline]] models are commonly used for parameterized transformation fields. Non-parametric or dense deformation fields carry a displacement vector at every grid location; this necessitates additional [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] constraints. A specific class of deformation fields are [[diffeomorphisms]], which are invertible transformations with a smooth inverse.\n* The similarity metric. A distance or similarity function is used to quantify the registration quality. This similarity can be calculated either on the original images or on features extracted from the images. Common similarity measures are sum of squared distances (SSD), [[coefficient of determination|correlation coefficient]], and [[mutual information]]. The choice of similarity measure depends on whether the images are from the same modality; the acquisition noise can also play a role in this decision. For example, SSD is the optimal similarity measure for images of the same modality with [[Gaussian noise]].<ref name=\"viola-1995\"/> However, the image statistics in ultrasound are significantly different from Gaussian noise, leading to the introduction of ultrasound specific similarity measures.<ref name=\"wachinger-2011\"/> Multi-modal registration requires a more sophisticated similarity measure; alternatively, a different image representation can be used, such as structural representations<ref name=\"wachinger-2012\"/> or registering adjacent anatomy.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1994-04-01|title=Medical image registration using knowledge of adjacency of anatomical structures|journal=Image and Vision Computing|volume=12|issue=3|pages=173\u2013178|doi=10.1016/0262-8856(94)90069-8|issn=0262-8856|last1=Hill|first1=Derek LG|last2=Hawkes|first2=David J|citeseerx=10.1.1.421.5162}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Toth|first=Daniel|last2=Panayiotou|first2=Maria|last3=Brost|first3=Alexander|last4=Behar|first4=Jonathan M.|last5=Rinaldi|first5=Christopher A.|last6=Rhode|first6=Kawal S.|last7=Mountney|first7=Peter|date=2016-10-17|title=Registration with Adjacent Anatomical Structures for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Guidance|journal=Statistical Atlases and Computational Models of the Heart.

Either [[continuous optimization|continuous]] or [[discrete optimization]] is performed. For continuous optimization, [[Gradient method|gradient-based optimization]] techniques are applied to improve the convergence speed.\n\n== Visualization ==\n[[File:Visualization of Medical Imaging.png|thumb|300px|Volume rendering (left), axial cross-section (right top), and sagittal cross-section (right bottom) of a CT image of a subject with multiple nodular lesions (white line) in the lung.]]\n\nVisualization plays several key roles in Medical Image Computing. Methods from [[scientific visualization]] are used to understand and communicate about medical images, which are inherently spatial-temporal. [[Data visualization]] and [[data analysis]] are used on [[unstructured data]] forms, for example when evaluating statistical measures derived during algorithmic processing. [[Interactive visualization|Direct interaction]] with data, a key feature of the visualization process, is used to perform visual queries about data, annotate images, guide segmentation and registration processes, and control the visual representation of data (by controlling lighting rendering properties and viewing parameters). Visualization is used both for initial exploration and for conveying intermediate and final results of analyses.\n\nThe figure \"Visualization of Medical Imaging\" illustrates several types of visualization: 1. the display of cross-sections as gray scale images; 2. reformatted views of gray scale images (the sagittal view in this example has a different orientation than the original direction of the image acquisition; and 3. A [[Volume rendering|3D volume rendering]] of the same data. The nodular lesion is clearly visible in the different presentations and has been annotated with a white line.\n\n== Atlases ==\nMedical images can vary significantly across individuals due to people having organs of different shapes and sizes. Therefore, representing medical images to account for this variability is crucial. A popular approach to represent medical images is through the use of one or more atlases. Here, an atlas refers to a specific model for a population of images with parameters that are learned from a training dataset.<ref name=\"decraene_et_al\" /><ref name=\"twining_et_al\" />\n\nThe simplest example of an atlas is a mean intensity image, commonly referred to as a template. However, an atlas can also include richer information, such as local image statistics and the probability that a particular spatial location has a certain label. New medical images, which are not used during training, can be mapped to an atlas, which has been tailored to the specific application, such as [[#Segmentation|segmentation]] and [[#Group Analysis|group analysis]]. Mapping an image to an atlas usually involves [[#Registration|registering]] the image and the atlas. This deformation can be used to address variability in medical images.\n\n=== Single template ===\nThe simplest approach is to model medical images as deformed versions of a single template image. For example, anatomical MRI brain scans are often mapped to the MNI template <ref name=\"mni_template\" /> as to represent all the brain scans in common coordinates. The main drawback of a single-template approach is that if there are significant differences between the template and a given test image, then there may not be a good way to map one onto the other. For example, an anatomical MRI brain scan of a patient with severe brain abnormalities (i.e., a tumor or surgical procedure), may not easily map to the MNI template.\n\n=== Multiple templates ===\nRather than relying on a single template, multiple templates can be used. The idea is to represent an image as a deformed version of one of the templates. For example, there could be one template for a healthy population and one template for a diseased population. However, in many applications, it is not clear how many templates are needed. A simple albeit computationally expensive way to deal with this is to have every image in a training dataset be a template image and thus every new image encountered is compared against every image in the training dataset. A more recent approach automatically finds the number of templates needed.<ref name=\"icluster\" />\n\n== Statistical analysis ==\nStatistical methods combine the medical imaging field with modern [[Computer Vision]], [[Machine Learning]] and [[Pattern Recognition]]. Over the last decade, several large datasets have been made publicly available (see for example ADNI, 1000 functional Connectomes Project), in part due to collaboration between various institutes and research centers. This increase in data size calls for new algorithms that can mine and detect subtle changes in the images to address clinical questions. Such clinical questions are very diverse and include group analysis, imaging biomarkers, disease phenotyping and longitudinal studies.\n\n=== Group analysis ===\nIn the Group Analysis, the objective is to detect and quantize abnormalities induced by a disease by comparing the images of two or more cohorts. Usually one of these cohorts consist of normal (control) subjects, and the other one consists of abnormal patients. Variation caused by the disease can manifest itself as abnormal deformation of anatomy (see [[Voxel-based morphometry]]). For example, shrinkage of sub-cortical tissues such as the [[Hippocampus]] in brain may be linked to [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Additionally, changes in biochemical (functional) activity can be observed using imaging modalities such as [[Positron Emission Tomography]].\n\nThe comparison between groups is usually conducted on the [[voxel]] level. Hence, the most popular pre-processing pipeline, particularly in [[neuroimaging]], transforms all of the images in a dataset to a common coordinate frame via ([[#Registration|Medical Image Registration]]) in order to maintain correspondence between voxels. Given this voxel-wise correspondence, the most common [[Frequentist]] method is to extract a statistic for each voxel (for example, the mean voxel intensity for each group) and perform [[statistical hypothesis testing]] to evaluate whether a null hypothesis is or is not supported. The null hypothesis typically assumes that the two cohorts are drawn from the same distribution, and hence, should have the same statistical properties (for example, the mean values of two groups are equal for a particular voxel). Since medical images contain large numbers of voxels, the issue of [[multiple comparison]] needs to be addressed,.<ref name=\"Ashburner2000\" /><ref name=\"Davat2004\" /> There are also [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] approaches to tackle group analysis problem.<ref name=\"Friston2002\" />\n\n=== Classification ===\nAlthough group analysis can quantify the general effects of a pathology on an anatomy and function, it does not provide subject level measures, and hence cannot be used as biomarkers for diagnosis (see Imaging Biomarkers). Clinicians, on the other hand, are often interested in early diagnosis of the pathology (i.e. classification,<ref name=\"Yong2008\" /><ref name=\"remi2011\" />) and in learning the progression of a disease (i.e. regression <ref name=\"wang2011\" />). From methodological point of view, current techniques varies from applying standard machine learning algorithms to medical imaging datasets (e.g. [[Support Vector Machine]] <ref name=\"benoit2009\" />), to developing new approaches adapted for the needs of the field.<ref name=\"batman2012\" /> The main difficulties are as follows:\n\n* Small sample size ([[Curse of Dimensionality]]): a large medical imaging dataset contains hundreds to thousands of images, whereas the number of voxels in a typical volumetric image can easily go beyond millions. A remedy to this problem is to reduce the number of features in an informative sense (see [[dimensionality reduction]]). Several unsupervised and semi-/supervised,<ref name=\"batman2012\" /><ref name=\"Fung2007\" /><ref name=\"chaves2009\" /><ref name=\"liu2004\" /> approaches have been proposed to address this issue.\n* Interpretability: A good generalization accuracy is not always the primary objective, as clinicians would like to understand which parts of anatomy are affected by the disease. Therefore, interpretability of the results is very important; methods that ignore the image structure are not favored. Alternative methods based on [[feature selection]] have been proposed,.<ref name=\"Fung2007\" /><ref name=\"chaves2009\" /><ref name=\"liu2004\" /><ref name=\"savio2012\" />\n\n=== Clustering ===\nImage-based pattern classification methods typically assume that the neurological effects of a disease are distinct and well defined. This may not always be the case. For a number of medical conditions, the patient populations are highly heterogeneous, and further categorization into sub-conditions has not been established. Additionally, some diseases (e.g., [[autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD), [[schizophrenia]], [[mild cognitive impairment]] (MCI)) can be characterized by a continuous or nearly-continuous spectra from mild cognitive impairment to very pronounced pathological changes. To facilitate image-based analysis of heterogeneous disorders, methodological alternatives to pattern classification have been developed. These techniques borrow ideas from high-dimensional clustering <ref name=\"filip2011\" /> and high-dimensional pattern-regression to cluster a given population into homogeneous sub-populations. The goal is to provide a better quantitative understanding of the disease within each sub-population.\n\n=== Shape analysis ===\n[[Statistical shape analysis|Shape Analysis]] is the field of Medical Image Computing that studies [[geometry|geometrical]] properties of structures obtained from different [[Medical imaging#Imaging technology|imaging modalities]]. Shape analysis recently become of increasing interest to the medical community due to its potential to precisely locate [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] changes between different populations of structures, i.e. healthy vs pathological, female vs male, young vs elderly. Shape Analysis includes two main steps: shape correspondence and statistical analysis.\n\n* Shape correspondence is the methodology that computes correspondent locations between geometric shapes represented by triangle meshes, contours, point sets or volumetric images. Obviously definition of correspondence will influence directly the analysis. Among the different options for correspondence frameworks we can find: Anatomical correspondence, manual landmarks, functional correspondence (i.e. in brain morphometry locus responsible for same neuronal functionality), geometry correspondence, (for image volumes) intensity similarity, etc. Some approaches, e.g. spectral shape analysis, do not require correspondence but compare shape descriptors directly.\n* Statistical analysis will provide measurements of structural change at correspondent locations.\n\n=== Longitudinal studies ===\n\nIn longitudinal studies the same person is imaged repeatedly. This information can be incorporated both into the [[image analysis]], as well as into the statistical modeling. \n* In longitudinal image processing, segmentation and analysis methods of individual time points are informed and regularized with common information usually from a within-subject template. This regularization is designed to reduce measurement noise and thus helps increase sensitivity and statistical power. At the same time over-regularization needs to be avoided, so that effect sizes remain stable. Intense regularization, for example, can lead to excellent test-retest reliability, but limits the ability to detect any true changes and differences across groups. Often a trade-off needs to be aimed for, that optimizes noise reduction at the cost of limited effect size loss. Another common challenge in longitudinal image processing is the, often unintentional, introduction of processing bias. When, for example, follow-up images get registered and resampled to the baseline image, interpolation artifacts get introduced to only the follow-up images and not the baseline. These artifact can cause spurious effects (usually a bias towards overestimating longitudinal change and thus underestimating required sample size). It is therefore essential that all-time points get treated exactly the same to avoid any processing bias.\n*  Post-processing and statistical analysis of longitudinal data usually requires dedicated statistical tools such as repeated measure ANOVA or the more powerful linear mixed effects models. Additionally, it is advantageous to consider the spatial distribution of the signal. For example, cortical thickness measurements will show a correlation within-subject across time and also within a neighborhood on the cortical surface - a fact that can be used to increase statistical power. Furthermore, time-to-event (aka survival) analysis is frequently employed to analyze longitudinal data and determine significant predictors.\n\n== Image-based physiological modelling ==\n\nTraditionally, medical image computing has seen to address the quantification and fusion of structural or functional information available at the point and time of image acquisition. In this regard, it can be seen as quantitative sensing of the underlying anatomical, physical or physiological processes. However, over the last few years, there has been a growing interest in the predictive assessment of disease or therapy course. Image-based modelling, be it of biomechanical or physiological nature, can therefore extend the possibilities of image computing from a descriptive to a predictive angle.\n\nAccording to the STEP research roadmap,<ref>[http://www.europhysiome.org/roadmap STEP research roadmap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828022132/http://www.europhysiome.org/roadmap |date=2008-08-28 }}. europhysiome.org</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=J.

These two broad research areas include the transformation of generic computational models to represent specific subjects, thus paving the way for personalized computational models.<ref>N. Ayache, J.-P. Boissel, S. Brunak, G. Clapworthy, G. Lonsdale, J. Fingberg, A. F. Frangi, G.Deco, P. J. Hunter, P.Nielsen, M.Halstead, D. R. Hose, I. Magnin, F. Martin-Sanchez, P. Sloot, J. Kaandorp, A. Hoekstra, S. Van Sint Jan, and M. Viceconti (2005) [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/health/docs/events/barcelona2005/ec-vph-white-paper2005nov.pdf \"Towards virtual physiological human: Multilevel modelling and simulation of the human anatomy and physiology\"]. Directorate General INFSO & Directorate General JRC, White paper</ref>  Individualization of generic computational models through imaging can be realized in three complementary directions: \n* definition of the subject-specific computational domain (anatomy) and related subdomains (tissue types);  \n* definition of boundary and initial conditions from (dynamic and/or functional) imaging; and  \n* characterization of structural and functional tissue properties.\n\nIn addition, imaging also plays a pivotal role in the evaluation and validation of such models both in humans and in animal models, and in the translation of models to the clinical setting with both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this specific context, molecular, biological, and pre-clinical imaging render additional data and understanding of basic structure and function in molecules, cells, tissues and animal models that may be transferred to human physiology where appropriate.\n\nThe applications of image-based VPH/Physiome models in basic and clinical domains are vast. Broadly speaking, they promise to become new ''virtual imaging techniques''. Effectively more, often non-observable, parameters will be imaged ''in silico'' based on the integration of observable but sometimes sparse and inconsistent multimodal images and physiological measurements. Computational models will serve to engender interpretation of the measurements in a way compliant with the underlying biophysical, biochemical or biological laws of the physiological or pathophysiological processes under investigation. Ultimately, such investigative tools and systems will help our understanding of disease processes, the natural history of disease evolution, and the influence on the course of a disease of pharmacological and/or interventional therapeutic procedures.\n\nCross-fertilization between imaging and modelling goes beyond interpretation of measurements in a way consistent with physiology. Image-based patient-specific modelling, combined with models of medical devices and pharmacological therapies, opens the way to predictive imaging whereby one will be able to understand, plan and optimize such interventions ''in silico''.\n\n== Mathematical methods in medical imaging ==\nA number of sophisticated mathematical methods have entered medical imaging, and have already been\nimplemented in various software packages. These include approaches based on [[partial differential equations]] (PDEs) and curvature driven flows for enhancement, segmentation, and registration. Since they employ PDEs, the methods are amenable to parallelization and implementation on GPGPUs. A number of these techniques have been inspired from ideas in [[optimal control]]. Accordingly, very recently ideas from control have recently made their way into interactive methods, especially segmentation. Moreover, because of noise and the need for statistical estimation techniques for more dynamically changing imagery, the [[Kalman filter]] <ref>{{cite journal |author1=Boulfelfel D. |author2=Rangayyan R.M. |author3=Hahn L.J. |author4=Kloiber R. |author5=Kuduvalli G.R. | year = 1994 | title = Restoration of single photon emission computed tomography images by the Kalman filter | url = | journal = IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 102\u2013109 | doi=10.1109/42.276148 | pmid=18218487}}</ref> and [[particle filter]] have come into use. A survey of these methods with an extensive list of references may be found in.<ref name=\"mathematical-2006\"/>\n\n==Modality specific computing==\n\nSome imaging modalities provide very specialized information. The resulting images cannot be treated as regular scalar images and give rise to new sub-areas of Medical Image Computing. Examples include [[#Diffusion MRI|diffusion MRI]],\n[[#Functional MRI|functional MRI]] and others.\n\n===Diffusion MRI===\n[[File:DiffusionMRI glyphs.png|thumb|right|A mid-axial slice of the ICBM diffusion tensor image template. Each voxel's value is a tensor represented here by an ellipsoid. Color denotes principal orientation: red = left-right, blue=inferior-superior, green = posterior-anterior]]\n\n[[Diffusion MRI]] is a structural [[magnetic resonance imaging]] modality that allows measurement of the diffusion process of molecules. Diffusion is measured by applying a gradient pulse to a magnetic field along a particular direction. In a typical acquisition, a set of uniformly distributed gradient directions is used to create a set of diffusion weighted volumes. In addition, an unweighted volume is acquired under the same magnetic field without application of a gradient pulse. As each acquisition is associated with multiple volumes, [[diffusion MRI]] has created a variety of unique challenges in medical image computing.\n\nIn medicine, there are two major computational goals in [[diffusion MRI]]:\n* Estimation of local tissue properties, such as diffusivity;\n* Estimation of local directions and global pathways of diffusion.\n\nThe [[Diffusion tensor imaging|diffusion tensor]],<ref name=\"Basser-1994\"/> a 3 &times; 3 symmetric [[positive-definite matrix]], offers a straightforward solution to both of these goals. It is proportional to the covariance matrix of a Normally distributed local diffusion profile and, thus, the dominant eigenvector of this matrix is the principal direction of local diffusion. Due to the simplicity of this model, a maximum likelihood estimate of the diffusion tensor can be found by simply solving a system of linear equations at each location independently. However, as the volume is assumed to contain contiguous tissue fibers, it may be preferable to estimate the volume of diffusion tensors in its entirety by imposing regularity conditions on the underlying field of tensors.<ref name=\"Fillard-2007\"/> Scalar values can be extracted from the diffusion tensor, such as the [[fractional anisotropy]], mean, axial and radial diffusivities, which ''indirectly'' measure tissue properties such as the dysmyelination of axonal fibers <ref name=\"Song-2002\"/> or the presence of edema.<ref name=\"Barzo-1997\"/> Standard scalar image computing methods, such as registration and segmentation, can be applied directly to volumes of such scalar values. However, to fully exploit the information in the diffusion tensor, these methods have been adapted to account for tensor valued volumes when performing registration <ref name=\"Alexander-2001\"/><ref name=\"Cao-2006\"/> and segmentation.<ref name=\"Wang-2005\"/><ref name=\"Pichon-2008\"/>\n\nGiven the principal direction of diffusion at each location in the volume, it is possible to estimate the global pathways of diffusion through a process known as [[tractography]].<ref name=\"Mori-1999\"/> However, due to the relatively low resolution of [[diffusion MRI]], many of these pathways may cross, kiss or fan at a single location. In this situation, the single principal direction of the [[Diffusion tensor imaging|diffusion tensor]] is not an appropriate model for the local diffusion distribution. The most common solution to this problem is to estimate multiple directions of local diffusion using more complex models. These include mixtures of diffusion tensors,<ref name=\"Tuch-2002\"/> Q-ball imaging,<ref name=\"Tuch-2004\"/> diffusion spectrum imaging <ref name=\"Wedeen-2005\"/> and fiber orientation distribution functions,<ref name=\"Jansons-2003\"/><ref name=\"Tournier-2004\"/> which typically require [[Diffusion MRI#HARDI: High-angular-resolution diffusion imaging and Q-ball vector analysis|HARDI]] acquisition with a large number of gradient directions. As with the diffusion tensor, volumes valued with these complex models require special treatment when applying image computing methods, such as [[Image registration|registration]] <ref name=\"Geng-2009\"/><ref name=\"Yap-2011\"/><ref name=\"Zhang-2012\"/> and segmentation.<ref name=\"Descoteaux-2007\"/>\n\n=== Functional MRI ===\n[[Fmri|Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]] is a medical imaging modality that indirectly measures neural activity by observing the local [[hemodynamic response|hemodynamics]], or blood oxygen level dependent signal (BOLD). fMRI data offers a range of insights, and can be roughly divided into two categories:\n\n* '''Task related fMRI''' is acquired as the subject is performing a sequence of timed experimental conditions. In block-design experiments, the conditions are present for short periods of time (e.g., 10 seconds) and are alternated with periods of rest. Event-related experiments rely on a random sequence of stimuli and use a single time point to denote each condition. The standard approach to analyze task related fMRI is the [[general linear model]] (GLM) <ref name=\"friston-1995\"/>\n* '''[[Resting state fMRI]]''' is acquired in the absence of any experimental task. Typically, the objective is to study the intrinsic network structure of the brain. Observations made during rest have also been linked to specific cognitive processes such as encoding or reflection. Most studies of resting state fMRI focus on low frequency fluctuations of the fMRI signal (LF-BOLD). Seminal discoveries include the [[default network]],<ref name=\"buckner-2008\"/> a comprehensive cortical parcellation,<ref name=\"yeo-2011\"/> and the linking of network characteristics to behavioral parameters.\n\nThere is a rich set of methodology used to analyze functional neuroimaging data, and there is often no consensus regarding the ''best'' method. Instead, researchers approach each problem independently and select a suitable model/algorithm. In this context there is a relatively active exchange among [[neuroscience]], [[computational biology]], [[statistics]], and [[machine learning]] communities. Prominent approaches include\n\n* '''Massive univariate approaches''' that probe individual voxels in the imaging data for a relationship to the experiment condition. The prime approach is the [[general linear model]] (GLM) <ref name=\"friston-1995\"/>\n* '''Multivariate- and classifier based approaches''', often referred to as multi voxel pattern analysis or multi-variate pattern analysis probe the data for global and potentially distributed responses to an experimental condition. Early approaches used [[Support vector machine|support vector machines (SVM)]] to study responses to visual stimuli.<ref name=\"haxby-2001\"/> Recently, alternative pattern recognition algorithms have been explored, such as [[random forest]] based gini contrast <ref name=\"langs-2011-gini\"/> or sparse regression and dictionary learning <ref name=\"varoquaux-2011\"/>\n* '''Functional connectivity analysis''' studies the intrinsic network structure of the brain, including the interactions between regions. The majority of such studies focus on resting state data to parcelate the brain <ref name=\"yeo-2011\"/> or to find correlates to behavioral measures.<ref name=\"heuvel-2009\"/> Task specific data can be used to study causal relationships among brain regions (e.g., dynamic causal mapping (DCM) <ref name=\"friston-2003\"/>).\n\nWhen working with large cohorts of subjects, the normalization (registration) of individual subjects into a common reference frame is crucial. A body of work and tools exist to perform normalization based on anatomy ([[FMRIB Software Library|FSL]], [[FreeSurfer]], [[Statistical parametric mapping|SPM]]). Alignment taking spatial variability across subjects into account is a more recent line of work. Examples are the alignment of the cortex based on fMRI signal correlation,<ref name=\"sabuncu-2010-alignment\"/> the alignment based on the global functional connectivity structure both in task-, or resting state data,<ref name=\"langs-2011\"/> and the alignment based on stimulus specific activation profiles of individual voxels.<ref name=\"haxby-2011\"/>\n\n== Software ==\nSoftware for medical image computing is a complex combination of systems providing IO, visualization and interaction, user interface, data management and computation. Typically system architectures are layered to serve algorithm developers, application developers, and users. The bottom layers are often libraries and/or toolkits which provide base computational capabilities; while the top layers are specialized applications which address specific medical problems, diseases, or body systems.\n\n== Additional notes ==\n\nMedical Image Computing is also related to the field of [[Computer Vision]].

Central Presbyterian Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\nThe building was designed by architects [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings|Carrere & Hastings]] and Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. Carr\u00e8re and Hastings also designed the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]]. \u00a0\n\nThe church's architecture reflects the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it. \n\nThere is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. Next door is the adjoining church house, which was built for the many social and religious activities the church fostered. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d\n\n== Early History ==\nThe history of Central Presbyterian Church is entwined with the history of [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair, NJ]] and the history of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church in the United States]]. \u00a0Although Central\u2019s official beginning is 1837, when the first cornerstone was laid, Central\u2019s origins reach back to 1667 when four men, Jasper Crane, Robert Treat, John Treat and John Curtis successfully requested and were granted land to freely practice their religious beliefs. King Charles II of England granted \u201cletters patent\u201d for a New Jersey colony. The four men, part of a group of 23 colonists, moved from Branford, Connecticut to the new colony \u201cat Newark on the Passaic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McSpadden|first=J Walker|title=The Central Presbyterian Church: The Story of a Hundred Years|publisher=|year=1937|isbn=|location=Montclair, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== 1667 - The Church in Newark ===\nJasper Crane, a member of the prestigious Crane family of Montclair, was one of the original founders of the church in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, NJ]]. Dedicated on January 20, 1667, the church was 36 feet by 36 feet and was located on Broad Street south of Market Street. By 1706, the church was predominantly known as a Presbyterian church. In 1708, a much larger church of stone with a steeple and a bell was built. Throughout the 1700\u2019s, the colonists traveled 8 or more miles by foot or by horse to attend the Newark church. They came from the Oranges, the \u2018Mountain\u2019 as Montclair was called, and Bloomfield to hear their Sunday sermon. \u00a0\n\nWhile the Newark church was growing, the framework of the Presbyterian church was also taking shape. The first written record of the General Presbytery dates to 1705. By 1717, the First Synod, organized in Philadelphia, PA included four Presbyteries: Philadelphia, New Castle, Snow Hill and Long Island.\n\nIn 1776, war broke out between the colonists and England. The colonists longed for independence from the Mother Country. Presbyterians have long been considered primarily responsible for the American Revolution in 1776:\n\nPresbyterians were very involved in he American Revolution. In numbers, they were one of the most dominant national groups. They had migrated from Scotland and from the north of Ireland because of wars with the English kings; and persecutions developed by the English rulers. \n\nThe war continued for seven years until 1783, when colonists won the American Revolution. Religious freedom was integral to the newly independent, self-governing United States of America. In 1794, the first Presbyterian General Assembly began its Sessions.\n\nIn 1794, desiring their own local church, Bloomfield and [[Cranetown, New Jersey|Cranetown]] residents (as Montclair was called at that time) petitioned the Presbytery for a separate society located in Bloomfield. On October 20, 1796, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of Bloomfield\u201d was born. On May 8, 1797, the cornerstone was laid in Bloomfield. The church bell was presented by Major Nathaniel Crane. Major Bloomfield gave $140.00, and Mrs. Bloomfield donated a Bible and Psalm book for the pulpit.\n\nIsaac Dodd was elected President of the Society. Samuel Ward, Ephraim Morris, Oliver Crane and Joseph Davis were trustees. The original subscribers who agreed to hire a minister for six months included the following Cranetown residents:\n\nOliver Crane, Stephen Fordham, William Crane, Simeon Crane, Widow Susanna Crane, Job Crane, Isaac Tomkins, Phineas Crane, Widow Dorcas Williams, David Riker, Samuel McChesney, Samuel Ward, John Vincent, Noah Crane, Jr., Noah Crane, Phebe Dod, James Gubs, Jr., Joseph Crane, John Baldwin, Nathaniel Dod, Israel Crane, Caleb Martin, Aaron Crane, Reuben Dod, Lewis Baldwin, Nathaniel Crane, Isaac Mitchell, Benjamin Crane, Eliakim Crane, Elizabeth Rouge, Thomas Force, William Holmes, Daniel Ougheltree, Levi Vincent, Cornelius Vincent, John Smith, Henry Shoemaker, John Fry, Widow Jane Crane, Zadok Crane, Samuel Tichenor, Peter Davis and Matthew Dod. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== 1837 \u2013 The Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield ===\n\u201cResolved that it is expedient to build a church in this place.\u201d \u00a0 According to the Session Record dated August 31, 1837, this resolution officially marked the beginning of the Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. A board of trustees and officers, elected at a meeting at the local schoolhouse, started planning for a Presbyterian society for West Bloomfield, the township informally known as Cranetown that later, in 1870, was officially recognized as Montclair.\n[[File:Central Presbyterian Church session.png|alt=1837 session notes|thumb|1837 session notes]]\n\n\nDespite the severe national economic downturn in 1837, when banks failed and bankruptcies were rife across America, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield\u201d was born and a new church was built. The schoolhouse already on the property was renovated. Its second story was removed and the school rooms were refinished for social meetings and Sunday school. The church was made of wood and built over these rooms. The church was located in the center of town, on a triangular-shaped block bordered by Bloomfield Avenue, Park Street and Church Street. Almost one year later to the day, on August 9, 1838, the church was formally dedicated.\n\nA $10,000 bequest by Major Nathaniel Crane provided the bedrock for the initial funding for the church. The committee and trustees included: Amos Crane, Eliam B. Crane, James Crane, Zenas S. Crane, Dr. Isaac D. Dodd, Jared E. Harrison, John Munn, Captain Joseph Munn, Cyrus Pierson, and William Smith. Decatur Harrison, an architect and Cranetown resident, designed the renovations and extensions.\n\nThe church cost $3,196.95 in addition to the $400 spent for the lot. Burial plots to the cemetery adjoining the church were sold to offset the deficit. The new church boasted 71 members and pews were sold for $25-$90 per year to offset the annual budget.\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Ware Fischer, son of one of New Jersey\u2019s noted preachers, was unanimously elected by Session to serve as the church\u2019s first pastor. He served from 1839 to 1849 and later served as President of Hamilton College. His initial salary, $7.00 per week, was eventually increased to $700 per year.\u00a0 In 1843, the chorister, Calvin S. Baldwin was paid $40 per year.\n\nThe first Session members were Mathias Smith, Elias Crane, Isaac B. Wheeler, and Moses Stiles. The first clerk of Session, John Munn, remained at this post for 25 years. The early records of the church were pristinely maintained by John Munn\u2019s fastidious attention to detail.\n\n=== 1856 \u2013 The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair \u2013 \u201cOld First\u201d ===\nBy 1856, the church membership\u2019s growth dictated the necessity for a larger building. The new building was built in back of the old one with $16,000 in subscriptions, stone from local freestone quarries, and the prayers, visions and hard work of many. Miss Mary Crane, Israel Crane\u2019s daughter, donated the 1,084 pound bell tuned in the Key of G and made at the foundry of Messrs. Jones & Hitchcock in Troy, New York.\n\nBy 1860, there were 85 families and 196 communicants. Pews cost $65-$340 per year and were sold to the highest bidder. Although Reverend Job Foster Halsey organized the building of the new larger church, a supply pastor, the Reverend Silas Billings officiated at the building\u2019s dedication. The church\u2019s new name: The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair.\n\n<br />\n\n=== The Civil War Years and Beyond ===\nFrom 1858-1861, Reverend Josiah Addison Priest served but resigned at the outbreak of the Civil War. During the Civil War years, from 1862-1867, the Reverend Nelson Millard served. Reverend Millard denounced slavery and supported the Union. His sermons were infused with political ideology.\n\nAt one point during his service, he took a leave of absence to serve as a senior member of the Christian Commission in Richmond, Virginia. He was charged with reestablishing local government and providing food and medical services to the war-ravaged area.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the church\u2019s growth reflected the town\u2019s rapidly expanding population. By 1870, Montclair\u2019s population reached 2,583, and the State Legislature authorized the town\u2019s name change to Montclair.\n\nBy the end of 1867, the congregation had grown to 300 members with a subscription of $4,101. The church bought the school next door and expanded the church to accommodate 700 people. In 1868, the new Township of Montclair\u2019s first board meeting was held in the church\u2019s lecture room.\n\nThe church\u2019s membership continued to grow. From 1870 -1887, despite a split of members to organize the Congregational Church, 532 persons joined. The Reverend Doctor J. Romeyn Barry led the congregation at First. The growth in spirituality corresponded with an enormous increase in giving. $50,000 of debt was liquidated, a stone chapel was built on Church Street, and $10,000 was set aside to build a parsonage. The congregation was so delighted with the Reverend Dr. J.R. Barry that, after his first year of service in 1870, they presented him with a purse of gold worth $300. Upon his leaving in 1887, the church gave him a gift of $5,000.\n\nThe church included a roster of townspeople who were integral to the founding and growth of Montclair. From the 17<sup>th</sup> century through World War II, the Crane family figured prominently in both Montclair\u2019s development and the church\u2019s growth. \n\nPhilip Doremus, whose family ran the largest general store in Montclair during the 19<sup>th</sup> century and in 1908, helped incorporate Montclair. \u00a0Doremus, who wrote a book on Montclair\u2019s history, was Superintendent of the church's Sunday school for almost 20 years. In 1856, Doremus hand wrote \u201cA Constitution of the West Bloomfield Presbyterian Sabbath School\u201d. He formed young people\u2019s societies for leadership opportunities and a social group for high school age children. He also led a discussion group for college-age adults.\n\nDuring this time, William B. Bradbury, the famous hymn writer and piano manufacturer used to visit the Sunday school and help teach the children the songs from his own books. When Bradbury was ill and near his death, Mr. Doremus surprised him with a large group of the Sunday school\u2019s children who filed in and marched around his room singing the hymns that Bradbury had written.\n\nIn 1886, a split in the congregation concerning church policy led to the formation of the Trinity Presbyterian Church. \u2018Old First\u2019, however, continued to grow during the years 1888-1900, when Reverend William F. Junkin served. Reverend Junkin, a former Confederate officer, had served as a lieutenant colonel and chaplain on General Stonewall Jackson\u2019s staff and served at the General\u2019s funeral service. Reverend Junkin passed away in 1900.\n\nFrom 1901-1913, Reverend Llewellyn Stover Fulmer served. He was the last minister to serve \u2018Old First\u2019. During this time, Trinity and Old First were engaged in conversations concerning a possible reunification. Reverend Fulmer resigned in 1913 to help bridge the new union when Old First and Trinity reunited.\n\n=== 1913 \u2013 The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair ===\nOn December 2, 1913, Trinity and Old First merged and officially became The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. Together, there were 927 members. The Reverend Edmund Melville Wylie served as the first pastor of Central. During his years of service, from 1914-1931, Central grew and flourished. The new congregation held services at Trinity's church, located on the northwest corner of Midland and Claremont Avenues.\n\nCentral supported missionary work both domestically and around the globe. So prominent was the mission work of Central that the missionaries\u2019 names were featured on the cover of the weekly Sunday service program.\n\n''Following is a list of the missionaries supported by Central:''\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary ........................\u00a0 Elat Station, West Africa\n\nMiss F. Elizabeth Harris ...............................\u00a0 Dry Creek, West Virginia\n\nRev. and Mrs. Alfred William Moore ........... \u00a0Mainpuri, India\n\nRev. Giacinto J. Reale, Italian Mission ......... Montclair, New Jersey\n\n\n''Members engaged in mission work:''\n\nRev. Thomas F. Carter ...........................Nanhsuchou, China\n\nDr. Edward Mills Dodd .......................... Tabriz, Persia\n\nPeter Carter Speers ................................ Lahore, India\n\nJohn L. Mott ........................................... Nagpur, India\n\nJames L. Speers, Jr. ................................ Nanking, China\n\nDr. and Mrs. William S. Dodd ................. Konia, Turkey\n\nMarjorie C. Geary .................................... Czecho-Slavakia\n\nDr. Wilson Farnsworth Dodd .........Constantinople, Turkey\n\nMarian Crawford ..................................... Smith, Kentucky\n\nFlorence Goodall ..................................... Smith, Kentucky\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary were the first missionaries supported by Central. In 1903, they went to [[Cameroon]], Elat, West Africa. Although Mr. McCleary died six months after they arrived in West Africa, Mrs. McCleary stayed and taught more than 6,000 boys.\n\nCentral supported domestic missions as well. Miss F. Elizabeth Harris rode on horseback over 1,000 miles per year to help the community in Dry Creek, Virginia. Other missions included the Mountaineers School at Rock Creek, Tennessee; the Spring Street Neighborhood House in New York City. The Presbyterian Italian Mission in Montclair provided Italian immigrants with sermons in their native language.\n\nCentral\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild was renowned for its philosophy of service and good works.\u00a0 During World War I, Central\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild aided the relief agencies. \u00a0The Guild paid Mrs. McCleary\u2019s salary in West Africa. They formed a sewing department to make clothes for local charities and missionary requests. \u2018The Cut and Contrive Club\u2019 made dresses and coats for children, new suits and clothing for the missionaries. During World War I, the Guild partnered with the Red Cross to sew pajamas, shirts for the wounded, pneumonia jackets, gauze masks and bandages. While Pastor Wylie was away, after having been called to serve at a YMCA training camp in the South, the Guild formed a branch called \u2018Group Work\u2019. The groups were divided into districts of 50 families each and the women acted as Big Sisters reporting illness or trouble.<ref>\u201cA Celebration of Women in Central Presbyterian Church: Past and Present\u201d, a paper presented to the Women\u2019s Guild in 1977, Tate Elder.</ref>\n\n== 1922 - The Central Presbyterian Church at 46 Park Street ==\nBy 1916, Central had outgrown its building. The \u2018Committee of Twelve\u2019 was appointed and chose the site for the church currently at the corner of Park Street and Claremont Avenue. The architectural design company Carrere and Hastings, Shreve, Lamb and Blake Associates was hired. This company also designed the New York Public Library. \u00a0\n\nThe new church, the same church worshipped in today, is an architectural treasure embodying the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. There is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it.\n\nNext door is the adjoining church house, built for the many social and religious activities the church hoped to foster. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d The new building had space for 750 Sunday School students! Reverend Wylie decried the enrollment in 1922 at 400 \u201cis but half the number that a School commensurate with the membership of our Church should comprise.\u201d\n\nOn October 15, 1922, the new Central Presbyterian Church held its dedication ceremony. At 10:30 a.m., the Gloria Trumpeters, using long trumpets and dressed in ankle-length white robes, stood outside the church portals and played \u201cA Mighty Fortress is Our God\u201d. The doors opened and the congregation filed in.\n\nReverend Wylie, the new associate pastor Reverend Rock and the officers met at the old church, held a brief service, and then marched to the new building. Before entering the building, they stood outside and sang two verses of the 100<sup>th</sup> Psalm, \u201cAll people that on earth do dwell.\u201d When they marched down the aisles, the entire congregation rose and sang the last two verses with them.\n\nDr. Cleland B. McAfee from the McCormick Theological Seminary preached the sermon aptly named \u201cThe Glory of the House.\u201d The church celebrated with a week\u2019s worth of activities including an organ recital, a Young People\u2019s Musical Service, and several special services.\n\nReverend Wylie called the church and adjoining church house \u201ca factory\u201d. There was always something going on. The church was a place where the congregation enjoyed spiritual education, work and play. The church was both a religious retreat and community center \u2013 a very different model than the than the church the forefathers probably had in mind! There was a gym for basketball, badminton, evening parties and dancing; an auditorium-sized stage for plays and programs, and a kitchen for church suppers. The four manual Skinner organ was a gift from the Women\u2019s Guild in memory of Mrs. Wylie, the minister\u2019s wife, who died unexpectedly in 1919.\n\nFrom 1927-1937, Carl F. Mueller was appointed organist and then Minister of Music. Mueller was already recognized as a masterful organist in his native hometown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mueller developed a volunteer choir and steadily over the course of several years built the choir from forty voices to several different choirs totaling 100 voices. Through Mueller\u2019s inspired direction, Central\u2019s choir became very well-known throughout New Jersey and even sang on radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1931, Mueller united the Central Choir with the State Teachers College in Montclair to form the Montclair Acapella Choir. Mr. Mueller wrote and published much of the music sung by the choir. Mueller's choral work, \"Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God\", sold nearly 2 million copies.\n\nIn 1931, citing ill health, Pastor Wylie resigned. The Great Depression was in full force. Central was not immune to the financial upheaval. The budget dropped by 25% causing much consternation and anxiety.\n\nIn April, 1932, the Reverend Morgan Phelps Noyes came to Central. A much loved pastor, he served until 1957. By 1937, the church was back on sound financial footing, the manse at 66 Park Street was razed and a house on North Mountain Avenue was leased for the pastor and his family. The membership had grown to 1,018 and the local and international mission work continued.\n\nReverend Noyes\u2019 service at Central encompassed World War II. During this time, many women from our church volunteered with the Red Cross working in local canteens, aiding nurses, visiting V.A. hospitals and working overseas. After the war, two Central Presbyterian church women were awarded Gold Stars for their work.\n\nWhen soldiers on leave visited Central, they were often invited for a home-cooked meal. Church members quite regularly corresponded with the soldiers. A scrapbook with thank you letters from the soldiers was kept by the church.\n\nDuring these years, the Women\u2019s Guild continued to meet one Tuesday each month for Guild Day. The women sewed in the morning, ate a luncheon for 25 cents, met for an afternoon business meeting and then enjoyed a program. Speakers on missions and social issues both local and national dominated the programs. \u00a0\n\n= Post World War II =\nIn 1950, Central ordained its first women elders. \u00a0Central member Edna Thistle, the first woman to serve communion at Central, wisely commented: \u201cThe significance of this victory for women was not the gaining of power per se but, rather, an affirmation of the responsibility they had assumed through their faithful work, their study, their training, their giving and their worship.\u201d \u00a0The first women elders were Lois Dean, Nellie Dodd Speers, and Rose Marzano. Two years later, Lila Speers, Lillian Applegate and Maude Dean were ordained. \u00a0\n\nIn the early 1950\u2019s, due to restrictive budgets and domestic needs, financial support for missionary work abroad had to be curtailed. Central\u2019s strong commitment to mission found a new outlet in giving: the nationally based Presbyterian Major Mission Fund. One third of the money went to special domestic and international programs, one third was targeted by donors for \u2018use wherever the need was greatest\u2019, and the balance was given without restrictions. Central was known to have exceeded its goal by $20,000 and to have given seven times the national per capita average.\n\n= The \u201860\u2019s =\nFrom 1958-1965, Reverend Paul Conine served at Central. At the time, budgetary problems caused a series of cutbacks for the church.\n\nIn 1966, Reverend Doctor Roger Hubert was called to serve Central. Considered a breath of fresh air by many, he brought many major contemporary issues to the attention of the church membership. Questions about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, civil rights, women\u2019s rights and civil liberties, however, caused much dissension among church members, resulting in a large number of members leaving the church. Reverend Hubert remained until 1975. Following a period of poor health, he resigned, went to law school and joined the staff at Seton Hall Law School. \n\n= The Last Years of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century \u00a0 \u00a0 =\nFrom 1977 through 1987, Reverend Ernie Fogg served as Senior Pastor at Central. Before coming to Central, Reverend Fogg had balanced a career between leading mission efforts in Indonesia and running programs at Presbyterian headquarters at 475 Riverside Avenue in New York city. While at Central, Reverend Fogg mentored a dozen [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] students. He was involved with the Montclair Clergy Association, the Montclair Rotary, and Senior Care and Activity Center. Reverend Fogg was National President of the American Leprosy Association. At Central, Ernie excelled at both pastoral calling and organizing memorable worship services. During his time here, a successful Capital Campaign was held to update the kitchen and restore the steeple.\n\nEarly in his ministry, Central was one of the leading churches in New Jersey. Central supported the UPC\u2019s Major Mission Fund to create educational and medical mission programs here and overseas. His wife, C\u2019lee Fogg, was very active in the church, and the couple were very popular with the congregation. \n\nBy the 1980\u2019s, Central women were leading Newark presbytery committees. Alice Price, Bessie Marsh, Carole Brand and Mary Lee Fitzgerald led these various committees. Alice Price served as Central\u2019s first woman Clerk of Session. From 1985-86, she also served as moderator of the Newark Presbytery. The Sunday school, led by Connie Thurber, Marlene French, Terye McAnally and Liz Ploth, was brimming with creativity, energy and devotion.\n\nFrom 1976 - 2009,\u00a0 Central\u2019s Choir was led by the inimitable Gaylord French whose great talents and musical artistry filled the church with truly inspirational music. For 33 years, Gaylord directed the choir and played his classical repertoire. Through the years, Central has not only attracted superb singers, but has been the church home to many fine musicians.\n\nA man immersed in music, Gaylord took advantage of the many talented musicians in the congregation and organized the Family Ensemble, a group who would play periodically at church services. He chose a repertoire that showed off the musical talents of many in solos performed with the choir on any given Sunday. Gaylord played for the Christmas Pageant and the beloved annual Talent Show. He also performed solo and played with guest musicians for many Sunday afternoon recitals at the church.\n\nIt's impossible to mention Gaylord without giving due attention to his wife Marlene, who also contributed greatly to the Women\u2019s Guild.\n\nIn 1988, Reverend Dr. N. Barry Dancy served as interim pastor to provide continuity while Central searched for a new pastor. During his year of service, a group of young people from our church went to England to share the news of Christ\u2019s peace. A photo exhibit at William Patterson College used Central\u2019s church building as an outstanding example of American Renaissance church architecture in New Jersey. In October, Central\u2019s sanctuary building was selected for registry as a national historic landmark.\n\nFrom 1989 \u2013 1996, Reverend Charles Henderson served as pastor. His wife, Reverend Katherine Henderson served as Parish Associate. During his tenure, the church established a Long-Range Committee to help develop a three year plan to meet the needs of the physical structure of the church. Additionally, the Committee studied and ultimately recommended that Central institute a new system of church government combining the work of Session and the Board of Trustees into one governing body. In 1994, a successful Capital Campaign raised $20,000 more than its target goal of $350,000 for building improvements.\n\nIn August, 1997, the Reverend Dr. Richard Crocker began his five and an half year tenure as Pastor of Central. Dr. Crocker\u2019s wry, sophisticated sermons, peppered with comments on modern life and the travails of raising a family, were a big hit with the congregation. His wife Carolyn also had a great influence on the Sunday school and the women\u2019s group she organized and led. \n\nIn 1998, a three-year campaign raised $360,000. A second fund-raiser collected enough money to pay off the mortgage on the manse and for the first time in many years, Central was debt free.\n\n= The Early Years of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century \u00a0 =\nIn 2000, under the direction of Central\u2019s two seminarians, David Baker and Mark Hanna, Central launched a new Young Adult program and ministry. In 2002, seminarian Patricia Hill was hired as Director of Youth and Family Ministry.\n\nDr. Crocker shepherded the congregation through the dark days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks; but in 2002 he accepted a position as Dean of the Tucker Foundation and Chaplain of Dartmouth College. Two interim pastors served Central while the congregation searched for a permanent pastor. Reverend Ray Vande Giessen and Reverend Phyllis Zoon worked tirelessly to keep our congregation on course while we searched for a new pastor. Their efforts were greatly appreciated.\n\nIn 2004, Reverend Laurie McNeill became Central\u2019s first female Senior Pastor and Head of Staff. Seminarian Mark McDowell replaced Tricia Hill as Director of Youth and Family Ministry. During this time, the local Senior Care and Activities Center\u2019s new facility was finally completed and after 27 years, moved their space out of Central to their new building.\n\nIn 2010, in response to differing viewpoints with Reverend McNeill and her leadership, the congregation voted to dissolve its relationship with her. Fortunately In, 2011, Reverend Ron Johnson became he church's pastor and helped the divided congregation heal.\n<br />\n\n= Central Presbyterian Church Pastors & Dates of Service \u00a0 =\n'''Called Pastors:'''\n\n1839 \u2013 1843 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rev.

Central Presbyterian Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\nThe building was designed by architects [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings|Carrere & Hastings]] and Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. Carr\u00e8re and Hastings also designed the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]]. \u00a0\n\nThe church's architecture reflects the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it. \n\nThere is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. Next door is the adjoining church house, which was built for the many social and religious activities the church fostered. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d\n\n== Early History ==\nThe history of Central Presbyterian Church is entwined with the history of [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair, NJ]] and the history of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church in the United States]]. \u00a0Although Central\u2019s official beginning is 1837, when the first cornerstone was laid, Central\u2019s origins reach back to 1667 when four men, Jasper Crane, Robert Treat, John Treat and John Curtis successfully requested and were granted land to freely practice their religious beliefs. King Charles II of England granted \u201cletters patent\u201d for a New Jersey colony. The four men, part of a group of 23 colonists, moved from Branford, Connecticut to the new colony \u201cat Newark on the Passaic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McSpadden|first=J Walker|title=The Central Presbyterian Church: The Story of a Hundred Years|publisher=|year=1937|isbn=|location=Montclair, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== 1667 - The Church in Newark ===\nJasper Crane, a member of the prestigious Crane family of Montclair, was one of the original founders of the church in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, NJ]]. Dedicated on January 20, 1667, the church was 36 feet by 36 feet and was located on Broad Street south of Market Street. By 1706, the church was predominantly known as a Presbyterian church. In 1708, a much larger church of stone with a steeple and a bell was built. Throughout the 1700\u2019s, the colonists traveled 8 or more miles by foot or by horse to attend the Newark church. They came from the Oranges, the \u2018Mountain\u2019 as Montclair was called, and Bloomfield to hear their Sunday sermon. \u00a0\n\nWhile the Newark church was growing, the framework of the Presbyterian church was also taking shape. The first written record of the General Presbytery dates to 1705. By 1717, the First Synod, organized in Philadelphia, PA included four Presbyteries: Philadelphia, New Castle, Snow Hill and Long Island.\n\nIn 1776, war broke out between the colonists and England. The colonists longed for independence from the Mother Country. Presbyterians have long been considered primarily responsible for the American Revolution in 1776:\n\nPresbyterians were very involved in he American Revolution. In numbers, they were one of the most dominant national groups. They had migrated from Scotland and from the north of Ireland because of wars with the English kings; and persecutions developed by the English rulers. \n\nThe war continued for seven years until 1783, when colonists won the American Revolution. Religious freedom was integral to the newly independent, self-governing United States of America. In 1794, the first Presbyterian General Assembly began its Sessions.\n\nIn 1794, desiring their own local church, Bloomfield and [[Cranetown, New Jersey|Cranetown]] residents (as Montclair was called at that time) petitioned the Presbytery for a separate society located in Bloomfield. On October 20, 1796, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of Bloomfield\u201d was born. On May 8, 1797, the cornerstone was laid in Bloomfield. The church bell was presented by Major Nathaniel Crane. Major Bloomfield gave $140.00, and Mrs. Bloomfield donated a Bible and Psalm book for the pulpit.\n\nIsaac Dodd was elected President of the Society. Samuel Ward, Ephraim Morris, Oliver Crane and Joseph Davis were trustees. The original subscribers who agreed to hire a minister for six months included the following Cranetown residents:\n\nOliver Crane, Stephen Fordham, William Crane, Simeon Crane, Widow Susanna Crane, Job Crane, Isaac Tomkins, Phineas Crane, Widow Dorcas Williams, David Riker, Samuel McChesney, Samuel Ward, John Vincent, Noah Crane, Jr., Noah Crane, Phebe Dod, James Gubs, Jr., Joseph Crane, John Baldwin, Nathaniel Dod, Israel Crane, Caleb Martin, Aaron Crane, Reuben Dod, Lewis Baldwin, Nathaniel Crane, Isaac Mitchell, Benjamin Crane, Eliakim Crane, Elizabeth Rouge, Thomas Force, William Holmes, Daniel Ougheltree, Levi Vincent, Cornelius Vincent, John Smith, Henry Shoemaker, John Fry, Widow Jane Crane, Zadok Crane, Samuel Tichenor, Peter Davis and Matthew Dod. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== 1837 \u2013 The Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield ===\n\u201cResolved that it is expedient to build a church in this place.\u201d \u00a0 According to the Session Record dated August 31, 1837, this resolution officially marked the beginning of the Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. A board of trustees and officers, elected at a meeting at the local schoolhouse, started planning for a Presbyterian society for West Bloomfield, the township informally known as Cranetown that later, in 1870, was officially recognized as Montclair.\n[[File:Central Presbyterian Church session.png|alt=1837 session notes|thumb|1837 session notes]]\n\n\nDespite the severe national economic downturn in 1837, when banks failed and bankruptcies were rife across America, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield\u201d was born and a new church was built. The schoolhouse already on the property was renovated. Its second story was removed and the school rooms were refinished for social meetings and Sunday school. The church was made of wood and built over these rooms. The church was located in the center of town, on a triangular-shaped block bordered by Bloomfield Avenue, Park Street and Church Street. Almost one year later to the day, on August 9, 1838, the church was formally dedicated.\n\nA $10,000 bequest by Major Nathaniel Crane provided the bedrock for the initial funding for the church. The committee and trustees included: Amos Crane, Eliam B. Crane, James Crane, Zenas S. Crane, Dr. Isaac D. Dodd, Jared E. Harrison, John Munn, Captain Joseph Munn, Cyrus Pierson, and William Smith. Decatur Harrison, an architect and Cranetown resident, designed the renovations and extensions.\n\nThe church cost $3,196.95 in addition to the $400 spent for the lot. Burial plots to the cemetery adjoining the church were sold to offset the deficit. The new church boasted 71 members and pews were sold for $25-$90 per year to offset the annual budget.\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Ware Fischer, son of one of New Jersey\u2019s noted preachers, was unanimously elected by Session to serve as the church\u2019s first pastor. He served from 1839 to 1849 and later served as President of Hamilton College. His initial salary, $7.00 per week, was eventually increased to $700 per year.\u00a0 In 1843, the chorister, Calvin S. Baldwin was paid $40 per year.\n\nThe first Session members were Mathias Smith, Elias Crane, Isaac B. Wheeler, and Moses Stiles. The first clerk of Session, John Munn, remained at this post for 25 years. The early records of the church were pristinely maintained by John Munn\u2019s fastidious attention to detail.\n\n=== 1856 \u2013 The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair \u2013 \u201cOld First\u201d ===\nBy 1856, the church membership\u2019s growth dictated the necessity for a larger building. The new building was built in back of the old one with $16,000 in subscriptions, stone from local freestone quarries, and the prayers, visions and hard work of many. Miss Mary Crane, Israel Crane\u2019s daughter, donated the 1,084 pound bell tuned in the Key of G and made at the foundry of Messrs. Jones & Hitchcock in Troy, New York.\n\nBy 1860, there were 85 families and 196 communicants. Pews cost $65-$340 per year and were sold to the highest bidder. Although Reverend Job Foster Halsey organized the building of the new larger church, a supply pastor, the Reverend Silas Billings officiated at the building\u2019s dedication. The church\u2019s new name: The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair.\n\n<br />\n\n=== The Civil War Years and Beyond ===\nFrom 1858-1861, Reverend Josiah Addison Priest served but resigned at the outbreak of the Civil War. During the Civil War years, from 1862-1867, the Reverend Nelson Millard served. Reverend Millard denounced slavery and supported the Union. His sermons were infused with political ideology.\n\nAt one point during his service, he took a leave of absence to serve as a senior member of the Christian Commission in Richmond, Virginia. He was charged with reestablishing local government and providing food and medical services to the war-ravaged area.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the church\u2019s growth reflected the town\u2019s rapidly expanding population. By 1870, Montclair\u2019s population reached 2,583, and the State Legislature authorized the town\u2019s name change to Montclair.\n\nBy the end of 1867, the congregation had grown to 300 members with a subscription of $4,101. The church bought the school next door and expanded the church to accommodate 700 people. In 1868, the new Township of Montclair\u2019s first board meeting was held in the church\u2019s lecture room.\n\nThe church\u2019s membership continued to grow. From 1870 -1887, despite a split of members to organize the Congregational Church, 532 persons joined. The Reverend Doctor J. Romeyn Barry led the congregation at First. The growth in spirituality corresponded with an enormous increase in giving. $50,000 of debt was liquidated, a stone chapel was built on Church Street, and $10,000 was set aside to build a parsonage. The congregation was so delighted with the Reverend Dr. J.R. Barry that, after his first year of service in 1870, they presented him with a purse of gold worth $300. Upon his leaving in 1887, the church gave him a gift of $5,000.\n\nThe church included a roster of townspeople who were integral to the founding and growth of Montclair. From the 17<sup>th</sup> century through World War II, the Crane family figured prominently in both Montclair\u2019s development and the church\u2019s growth. \n\nPhilip Doremus, whose family ran the largest general store in Montclair during the 19<sup>th</sup> century and in 1908, helped incorporate Montclair. \u00a0Doremus, who wrote a book on Montclair\u2019s history, was Superintendent of the church's Sunday school for almost 20 years. In 1856, Doremus hand wrote \u201cA Constitution of the West Bloomfield Presbyterian Sabbath School\u201d. He formed young people\u2019s societies for leadership opportunities and a social group for high school age children. He also led a discussion group for college-age adults.\n\nDuring this time, William B. Bradbury, the famous hymn writer and piano manufacturer used to visit the Sunday school and help teach the children the songs from his own books. When Bradbury was ill and near his death, Mr. Doremus surprised him with a large group of the Sunday school\u2019s children who filed in and marched around his room singing the hymns that Bradbury had written.\n\nIn 1886, a split in the congregation concerning church policy led to the formation of the Trinity Presbyterian Church. \u2018Old First\u2019, however, continued to grow during the years 1888-1900, when Reverend William F. Junkin served. Reverend Junkin, a former Confederate officer, had served as a lieutenant colonel and chaplain on General Stonewall Jackson\u2019s staff and served at the General\u2019s funeral service. Reverend Junkin passed away in 1900.\n\nFrom 1901-1913, Reverend Llewellyn Stover Fulmer served. He was the last minister to serve \u2018Old First\u2019. During this time, Trinity and Old First were engaged in conversations concerning a possible reunification. Reverend Fulmer resigned in 1913 to help bridge the new union when Old First and Trinity reunited.\n\n=== 1913 \u2013 The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair ===\nOn December 2, 1913, Trinity and Old First merged and officially became The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. Together, there were 927 members. The Reverend Edmund Melville Wylie served as the first pastor of Central. During his years of service, from 1914-1931, Central grew and flourished. The new congregation held services at Trinity's church, located on the northwest corner of Midland and Claremont Avenues.\n\nCentral supported missionary work both domestically and around the globe. So prominent was the mission work of Central that the missionaries\u2019 names were featured on the cover of the weekly Sunday service program.\n\n''Following is a list of the missionaries supported by Central:''\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary ........................\u00a0 Elat Station, West Africa\n\nMiss F.

Smith, Kentucky\n\nFlorence Goodall ..................................... Smith, Kentucky\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary were the first missionaries supported by Central. In 1903, they went to [[Cameroon]], Elat, West Africa. Although Mr. McCleary died six months after they arrived in West Africa, Mrs. McCleary stayed and taught more than 6,000 boys.\n\nCentral supported domestic missions as well. Miss F. Elizabeth Harris rode on horseback over 1,000 miles per year to help the community in Dry Creek, Virginia. Other missions included the Mountaineers School at Rock Creek, Tennessee; the Spring Street Neighborhood House in New York City. The Presbyterian Italian Mission in Montclair provided Italian immigrants with sermons in their native language.\n\nCentral\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild was renowned for its philosophy of service and good works.\u00a0 During World War I, Central\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild aided the relief agencies. \u00a0The Guild paid Mrs. McCleary\u2019s salary in West Africa. They formed a sewing department to make clothes for local charities and missionary requests. \u2018The Cut and Contrive Club\u2019 made dresses and coats for children, new suits and clothing for the missionaries. During World War I, the Guild partnered with the Red Cross to sew pajamas, shirts for the wounded, pneumonia jackets, gauze masks and bandages. While Pastor Wylie was away, after having been called to serve at a YMCA training camp in the South, the Guild formed a branch called \u2018Group Work\u2019. The groups were divided into districts of 50 families each and the women acted as Big Sisters reporting illness or trouble.<ref>\u201cA Celebration of Women in Central Presbyterian Church: Past and Present\u201d, a paper presented to the Women\u2019s Guild in 1977, Tate Elder.</ref>\n\n== 1922 - The Central Presbyterian Church at 46 Park Street ==\nBy 1916, Central had outgrown its building. The \u2018Committee of Twelve\u2019 was appointed and chose the site for the church currently at the corner of Park Street and Claremont Avenue. The architectural design company Carrere and Hastings, Shreve, Lamb and Blake Associates was hired. This company also designed the New York Public Library. \u00a0\n\nThe new church, the same church worshipped in today, is an architectural treasure embodying the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. There is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it.\n\nNext door is the adjoining church house, built for the many social and religious activities the church hoped to foster. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d The new building had space for 750 Sunday School students! Reverend Wylie decried the enrollment in 1922 at 400 \u201cis but half the number that a School commensurate with the membership of our Church should comprise.\u201d\n\nOn October 15, 1922, the new Central Presbyterian Church held its dedication ceremony. At 10:30 a.m., the Gloria Trumpeters, using long trumpets and dressed in ankle-length white robes, stood outside the church portals and played \u201cA Mighty Fortress is Our God\u201d. The doors opened and the congregation filed in.\n\nReverend Wylie, the new associate pastor Reverend Rock and the officers met at the old church, held a brief service, and then marched to the new building. Before entering the building, they stood outside and sang two verses of the 100<sup>th</sup> Psalm, \u201cAll people that on earth do dwell.\u201d When they marched down the aisles, the entire congregation rose and sang the last two verses with them.\n\nDr. Cleland B. McAfee from the McCormick Theological Seminary preached the sermon aptly named \u201cThe Glory of the House.\u201d The church celebrated with a week\u2019s worth of activities including an organ recital, a Young People\u2019s Musical Service, and several special services.\n\nReverend Wylie called the church and adjoining church house \u201ca factory\u201d. There was always something going on. The church was a place where the congregation enjoyed spiritual education, work and play. The church was both a religious retreat and community center \u2013 a very different model than the than the church the forefathers probably had in mind! There was a gym for basketball, badminton, evening parties and dancing; an auditorium-sized stage for plays and programs, and a kitchen for church suppers. The four manual Skinner organ was a gift from the Women\u2019s Guild in memory of Mrs. Wylie, the minister\u2019s wife, who died unexpectedly in 1919.\n\nFrom 1927-1937, Carl F. Mueller was appointed organist and then Minister of Music. Mueller was already recognized as a masterful organist in his native hometown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mueller developed a volunteer choir and steadily over the course of several years built the choir from forty voices to several different choirs totaling 100 voices. Through Mueller\u2019s inspired direction, Central\u2019s choir became very well-known throughout New Jersey and even sang on radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1931, Mueller united the Central Choir with the State Teachers College in Montclair to form the Montclair Acapella Choir. Mr. Mueller wrote and published much of the music sung by the choir. Mueller's choral work, \"Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God\", sold nearly 2 million copies.\n\nIn 1931, citing ill health, Pastor Wylie resigned. The Great Depression was in full force. Central was not immune to the financial upheaval. The budget dropped by 25% causing much consternation and anxiety.\n\nIn April, 1932, the Reverend Morgan Phelps Noyes came to Central. A much loved pastor, he served until 1957. By 1937, the church was back on sound financial footing, the manse at 66 Park Street was razed and a house on North Mountain Avenue was leased for the pastor and his family. The membership had grown to 1,018 and the local and international mission work continued.\n\nReverend Noyes\u2019 service at Central encompassed World War II. During this time, many women from our church volunteered with the Red Cross working in local canteens, aiding nurses, visiting V.A. hospitals and working overseas. After the war, two Central Presbyterian church women were awarded Gold Stars for their work.\n\nWhen soldiers on leave visited Central, they were often invited for a home-cooked meal. Church members quite regularly corresponded with the soldiers. A scrapbook with thank you letters from the soldiers was kept by the church.\n\nDuring these years, the Women\u2019s Guild continued to meet one Tuesday each month for Guild Day. The women sewed in the morning, ate a luncheon for 25 cents, met for an afternoon business meeting and then enjoyed a program. Speakers on missions and social issues both local and national dominated the programs. \u00a0\n\n= Post World War II =\nIn 1950, Central ordained its first women elders. \u00a0Central member Edna Thistle, the first woman to serve communion at Central, wisely commented: \u201cThe significance of this victory for women was not the gaining of power per se but, rather, an affirmation of the responsibility they had assumed through their faithful work, their study, their training, their giving and their worship.\u201d \u00a0The first women elders were Lois Dean, Nellie Dodd Speers, and Rose Marzano. Two years later, Lila Speers, Lillian Applegate and Maude Dean were ordained. \u00a0\n\nIn the early 1950\u2019s, due to restrictive budgets and domestic needs, financial support for missionary work abroad had to be curtailed. Central\u2019s strong commitment to mission found a new outlet in giving: the nationally based Presbyterian Major Mission Fund. One third of the money went to special domestic and international programs, one third was targeted by donors for \u2018use wherever the need was greatest\u2019, and the balance was given without restrictions. Central was known to have exceeded its goal by $20,000 and to have given seven times the national per capita average.\n\n= The \u201860\u2019s =\nFrom 1958-1965, Reverend Paul Conine served at Central. At the time, budgetary problems caused a series of cutbacks for the church.\n\nIn 1966, Reverend Doctor Roger Hubert was called to serve Central. Considered a breath of fresh air by many, he brought many major contemporary issues to the attention of the church membership. Questions about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, civil rights, women\u2019s rights and civil liberties, however, caused much dissension among church members, resulting in a large number of members leaving the church. Reverend Hubert remained until 1975. Following a period of poor health, he resigned, went to law school and joined the staff at Seton Hall Law School. \n\n= The Last Years of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century \u00a0 \u00a0 =\nFrom 1977 through 1987, Reverend Ernie Fogg served as Senior Pastor at Central. Before coming to Central, Reverend Fogg had balanced a career between leading mission efforts in Indonesia and running programs at Presbyterian headquarters at 475 Riverside Avenue in New York city. While at Central, Reverend Fogg mentored a dozen [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] students. He was involved with the Montclair Clergy Association, the Montclair Rotary, and Senior Care and Activity Center. Reverend Fogg was National President of the American Leprosy Association. At Central, Ernie excelled at both pastoral calling and organizing memorable worship services. During his time here, a successful Capital Campaign was held to update the kitchen and restore the steeple.\n\nEarly in his ministry, Central was one of the leading churches in New Jersey. Central supported the UPC\u2019s Major Mission Fund to create educational and medical mission programs here and overseas. His wife, C\u2019lee Fogg, was very active in the church, and the couple were very popular with the congregation. \n\nBy the 1980\u2019s, Central women were leading Newark presbytery committees. Alice Price, Bessie Marsh, Carole Brand and Mary Lee Fitzgerald led these various committees. Alice Price served as Central\u2019s first woman Clerk of Session. From 1985-86, she also served as moderator of the Newark Presbytery. The Sunday school, led by Connie Thurber, Marlene French, Terye McAnally and Liz Ploth, was brimming with creativity, energy and devotion.\n\nFrom 1976 - 2009,\u00a0 Central\u2019s Choir was led by the inimitable Gaylord French whose great talents and musical artistry filled the church with truly inspirational music. For 33 years, Gaylord directed the choir and played his classical repertoire. Through the years, Central has not only attracted superb singers, but has been the church home to many fine musicians.\n\nA man immersed in music, Gaylord took advantage of the many talented musicians in the congregation and organized the Family Ensemble, a group who would play periodically at church services. He chose a repertoire that showed off the musical talents of many in solos performed with the choir on any given Sunday. Gaylord played for the Christmas Pageant and the beloved annual Talent Show. He also performed solo and played with guest musicians for many Sunday afternoon recitals at the church.\n\nIt's impossible to mention Gaylord without giving due attention to his wife Marlene, who also contributed greatly to the Women\u2019s Guild.\n\nIn 1988, Reverend Dr. N. Barry Dancy served as interim pastor to provide continuity while Central searched for a new pastor. During his year of service, a group of young people from our church went to England to share the news of Christ\u2019s peace. A photo exhibit at William Patterson College used Central\u2019s church building as an outstanding example of American Renaissance church architecture in New Jersey. In October, Central\u2019s sanctuary building was selected for registry as a national historic landmark.\n\nFrom 1989 \u2013 1996, Reverend Charles Henderson served as pastor. His wife, Reverend Katherine Henderson served as Parish Associate. During his tenure, the church established a Long-Range Committee to help develop a three year plan to meet the needs of the physical structure of the church. Additionally, the Committee studied and ultimately recommended that Central institute a new system of church government combining the work of Session and the Board of Trustees into one governing body. In 1994, a successful Capital Campaign raised $20,000 more than its target goal of $350,000 for building improvements.\n\nIn August, 1997, the Reverend Dr. Richard Crocker began his five and an half year tenure as Pastor of Central. Dr. Crocker\u2019s wry, sophisticated sermons, peppered with comments on modern life and the travails of raising a family, were a big hit with the congregation. His wife Carolyn also had a great influence on the Sunday school and the women\u2019s group she organized and led. \n\nIn 1998, a three-year campaign raised $360,000. A second fund-raiser collected enough money to pay off the mortgage on the manse and for the first time in many years, Central was debt free.\n\n= The Early Years of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century \u00a0 =\nIn 2000, under the direction of Central\u2019s two seminarians, David Baker and Mark Hanna, Central launched a new Young Adult program and ministry. In 2002, seminarian Patricia Hill was hired as Director of Youth and Family Ministry.\n\nDr. Crocker shepherded the congregation through the dark days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks; but in 2002 he accepted a position as Dean of the Tucker Foundation and Chaplain of Dartmouth College. Two interim pastors served Central while the congregation searched for a permanent pastor. Reverend Ray Vande Giessen and Reverend Phyllis Zoon worked tirelessly to keep our congregation on course while we searched for a new pastor. Their efforts were greatly appreciated.\n\nIn 2004, Reverend Laurie McNeill became Central\u2019s first female Senior Pastor and Head of Staff. Seminarian Mark McDowell replaced Tricia Hill as Director of Youth and Family Ministry. During this time, the local Senior Care and Activities Center\u2019s new facility was finally completed and after 27 years, moved their space out of Central to their new building.\n\nIn 2010, in response to differing viewpoints with Reverend McNeill and her leadership, the congregation voted to dissolve its relationship with her. Fortunately In, 2011, Reverend Ron Johnson became he church's pastor and helped the divided congregation heal.\n<br />\n\n= Central Presbyterian Church Pastors & Dates of Service \u00a0 =\n'''Called Pastors:'''\n\n1839 \u2013 1843 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rev.

Although the architect was American, he employed a [[Flemish Brabant|Flemish]] style for this commission. His building in turn suffered severe damage in the [[Second World War]], but has been restored. (''For more details of this library, see [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)#Library|Catholic University of Leuven]].'')\n\n== France ==\nThe [[Carnegie library of Reims]] is the single Carnegie library in France.  Reims was devastated in the First World War and the losses included library accommodation in the town-hall.  The provision of a new library was conceived as a contribution to the city's reconstruction.  Reims was one of three \"front-line\" cities to be given a Carnegie library, the other two being Leuven and Belgrade.\n\nThe [[Art Deco]] building was finished in 1927, and opened the following year in the presence of [[Gaston Doumergue]], the French President and [[Myron T. Herrick]], the US ambassador.  The building was restored at the beginning of the 21st century.

The English Carnegie libraries began to be built at the beginning of the 20th century. Carnegie, who in his retirement divided his time between the US and Scotland, opened some British libraries personally.\n\nIn Britain the process of applying for a Carnegie library was broadly similar to that in the US. It was adapted to British legislation, e.g. the [[Public Libraries Act 1850|Public Libraries Act]], which permitted expenditure from the [[rates (tax)|rates]] on local libraries. Carnegie assessed applications using criteria which favoured poorer towns, but applicants had to undertake to support their library, providing it with books etc. from the rates.  While most towns were very grateful to receive a grant, Carnegie's project was not without controversy. For example, some people objected to the way in which he had made his money. In the case of [[Stratford-on-Avon]] there were objections to the proposed building for conservation reasons, and this resulted in a library which blends into the [[half-timbered]] neighbouring buildings.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990DEEDF173AE733A2575BC2A9609C946297D6CF \"Carnegie and Corelli\"] ''New York Times'' article from 1903.

(This pattern of town and academic libraries was in line with his policy in the US where he provided a number of college libraries, for example at [[Tuskegee University]].<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Up_From_Slavery/Chapter_XII&oldid=538157 ''Up from Slavery''], [[Booker T.

Although the architect was American, he employed a [[Flemish Brabant|Flemish]] style for this commission. His building in turn suffered severe damage in the [[Second World War]], but has been restored.

Reims was one of three \"front-line\" cities to be given a Carnegie library, the other two being Leuven and Belgrade.\n\nThe [[Art Deco]] building was finished in 1927, and opened the following year in the presence of [[Gaston Doumergue]], the French President and [[Myron T.

The English Carnegie libraries began to be built at the beginning of the 20th century. Carnegie, who in his retirement divided his time between the US and Scotland, opened some British libraries personally.\n\nIn Britain the process of applying for a Carnegie library was broadly similar to that in the US. It was adapted to British legislation, e.g. the [[Public Libraries Act 1850|Public Libraries Act]], which permitted expenditure from the [[rates (tax)|rates]] on local libraries. Carnegie assessed applications using criteria which favoured poorer towns, but applicants had to undertake to support their library, providing it with books etc. from the rates.  While most towns were very grateful to receive a grant, Carnegie's project was not without controversy. For example, some people objected to the way in which he had made his money. In the case of [[Stratford-on-Avon]] there were objections to the proposed building for conservation reasons, and this resulted in a library which blends into the [[half-timbered]] neighbouring buildings.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990DEEDF173AE733A2575BC2A9609C946297D6CF \"Carnegie and Corelli\"] ''New York Times'' article from 1903. (Carnegie libraries usually avoided using wood, although Stratford-on-Avon is not the only example of wooden construction, the material is used at Hull's [[Carnegie Heritage Centre]], for example). http://www.carnegiehull.co.uk</ref>\n\nMost Carnegie libraries served the general population of towns and cities, but he also provided some academic libraries in the UK. (This pattern of town and academic libraries was in line with his policy in the US where he provided a number of college libraries, for example at [[Tuskegee University]].<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Up_From_Slavery/Chapter_XII&oldid=538157 ''Up from Slavery''], [[Booker T.

The trust continued to fund libraries after Carnegie's death in 1919, but its priorities shifted to other areas of its charitable work.\n\n=== Current status of Carnegie libraries ===\nAs at 2011 many of the UK's Carnegie libraries continue to be used for their original purpose.  However, Carnegie libraries are being affected by local authority budget cuts which are reducing the number of public libraries across the country.<ref name=\"Indie\">{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/boyd-tonkin-a-fresh-wind-from-the-humber-2264694.html?origin=internalSearch | title=A fresh wind from the Humber | work=[[The Independent]] | date=April 2011 | accessdate=4 December 2013 | author=Tonmkin, Boyd}}</ref>\n\nSome Carnegie libraries are unprotected by the listing system.

Hay himself approached party leaders and recommended his own expulsion. The party decided to expel him as a \"security risk\", but declared him a \"Lifelong Friend of the People\" in recognition of his previous work for the party.<ref name=\"workers\">{{Cite news |title=Harry Hay: Painful partings |first=Leslie |last=Feinberg |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=2007-11-01 |url=http://www.workers.org/2005/us/lavender-red-40/ |periodical=[[Workers World Party|Workers World]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015105/http://www.workers.org/2005/us/lavender-red-40/ |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nMattachine was originally organized in similar structure to the Communist Party, with cells, oaths of secrecy and five different levels of membership, each of which required greater levels of involvement and commitment. As the organization grew, the levels were expected to subdivide into new cells, creating both the potential for horizontal and vertical growth.<ref>{{harvnb|D'Emilio|1983|p=64}}</ref> The founding members constituted the so-called \"Fifth Order\" and from the outset remained anonymous. \n\nMattachine's membership grew slowly at first but received a major boost in February 1952 when founder Jennings was arrested in a Los Angeles park and charged with lewd behavior. Often, men in Jennings' situation would simply plead guilty to the charge and hope to quietly rebuild their lives. Jennings and the rest of the Fifth Order saw the charges as a means to address the issue of police entrapment of homosexual men. The group began publicizing the case (under the name \"Citizens Committee to Outlaw Entrapment\") and the publicity it generated brought in financial support and volunteers. Jennings admitted during his trial to being a homosexual but insisted he was not guilty of the specific charge. The jury deadlocked and Mattachine declared victory.<ref>{{harvnb|D'Emilio|1983|pp=69\u201370}}</ref>\n\n== Naming ==\nThe Mattachine Society was named by Harry Hay at the suggestion of James Gruber, inspired by a French medieval and renaissance [[masque]] group he had studied while preparing a course on the history of popular music for a workers' education project. In a 1976 interview with Jonathan Ned Katz, Hay was asked the origin of the name Mattachine. He mentioned the medieval-Renaissance French ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Joyeuses]]'':\n\n{{quote|One [[masque]] group was known as the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mattachine.\" These societies, lifelong secret fraternities of unmarried townsmen who never performed in public unmasked, were dedicated to going out into the countryside and conducting dances and rituals during the [[Feast of Fools]], at the [[Vernal Equinox]]. Sometimes these dance rituals, or masques, were peasant protests against oppression\u2014with the maskers, in the people's name, receiving the brunt of a given lord's vicious retaliation. So we took the name Mattachine because we felt that we 1950s Gays were also a masked people, unknown and anonymous, who might become engaged in morale building and helping ourselves and others, through struggle, to move toward total redress and change.|Jonathan Katz|''Gay American History''. Crowell Publishers, 1976.<ref name=\"katz\">Katz, Jonathan. ''Gay American History''. Crowell Publishers; 1976.</ref>}}\n\nThis French group was named in turn after [[Mattaccino]] (or the Anglicized Mattachino), a character in Italian theater. Mattaccino was a kind of court [[jester]], who would speak the truth to the king when nobody else would. The \"mattachin\" (from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''mutawajjihin''\u2014\"mask-wearers\") were originally [[Moors|Moorish]] (Hispano-Arab) sword-dancers who wore elaborate, colorful costumes and masks.<ref>{{harvnb|Johansson|Percy|1994|p=92}}</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society used so-called [[harlequin]] diamonds as their [[emblem]]. The design consisted of four diamonds arranged in a pattern to form a larger diamond.\n\n== Affiliations ==\nMost of the Mattachine founders were [[communist]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} As the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] progressed, the association with communism concerned some members as well as supporters and Hay, a dedicated member of the [[Communist Party USA|CPUSA]] for 15 years, stepped down as the Society's leader. Others were similarly ousted, and the leadership structure became influenced less by communism, replaced by a moderate ideology similar to that espoused by the liberal reformist [[civil rights]] organizations that existed for [[African American]]s. Although Hay claimed \"never to have even heard\" of the earlier [[gay liberation]] struggle in [[Germany]]\u2014by the people around [[Adolf Brand]], [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and the [[Austrian-Hungarian]] [[Leontine Sagan]]\u2014he is known to have talked about it with German \u00e9migr\u00e9s in America, including the [[Austria]]n-born [[Rudi Gernreich]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe Mattachine Society existed as a single national organization headquartered first in Los Angeles and then, beginning around 1956, in San Francisco. Outside of Los Angeles and San Francisco, chapters were established in New York; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and other locales. Due to internal disagreements, the national organization disbanded in 1961.

The Daughters of Bilitis were the counterpart [[lesbian]] organization to the Mattachine Society, and the two organizations worked together on some campaigns, although their approaches to visibility in the mass media differed considerably.\n\nOn the eve of January 1, 1965, several homophile organizations in San Francisco, California - including Mattachine, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], the [[Council on Religion and the Homosexual]], and the [[Society for Individual Rights]] - held a fund-raising ball for their mutual benefit at California Hall on Polk Street.<ref name=\"miller_p348\">Miller, Neil (1995).

Membership diversified, with more women and people from a broader political spectrum becoming involved. With that growth came concern about the radical left slant of the organization. In particular, [[Hal Call]] and others out of San Francisco along with Ken Burns from Los Angeles wanted Mattachine to amend its constitution to clarify its opposition to so-called \"subversive elements\" and to affirm that members were loyal to the United States and its laws (which declared homosexuality illegal). In an effort to preserve their vision of the organization, the Fifth Order members revealed their identities and resigned their leadership positions at Mattachine's May 1953 convention. With the founders gone, Call, Burns and other like-minded individuals stepped into the leadership void,<ref>{{harvnb|Loughery|1998|pp=228\u201329}}</ref> and Mattachine officially adopted non-confrontation as an organizational policy. Some historians argue that these changes reduced the effectiveness of this newly organized Mattachine and led to a precipitous drop in membership and participation.<ref>{{harvnb|Hogan|Hudson|1998|p=383}}</ref> Other historians contend that the Mattachine Society between 1953 and 1966 was enormously effective as it published a magazine, developed relationships with allies in the fight for homosexual equality, and influenced public opinion on the topic too.<ref>{{harvnb|Meeker|2006|pp=37\u201376}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, the various unaffiliated Mattachine Societies, especially the Mattachine Society in San Francisco and MSNY, were among the foremost gay rights groups in the United States, but beginning in the middle 1960s and, especially, following the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, they began increasingly to be seen as too traditional, and not willing enough to be confrontational. Like the divide that occurred within the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the late 1960s and the 1970s brought a new generation of activists, many of whom felt that the gay rights movement needed to endorse a larger and more radical agenda to address other forms of oppression, the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[sexual revolution]]. Several unaffiliated entities that went under the name Mattachine eventually lost support or fell prey to internal division.\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn the ''[[Quantum Leap]]'' comic book titled ''Up Against a Stonewall'' (1992), the Mattachine Society and the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] are mentioned as two groups campaigning for LGBT rights prior to the [[Stonewall riots]].\n\nThe 1995 film ''[[Stonewall (1995 film)|Stonewall]]'' included members of the Mattachine Society of New York among its characters. Mattachine members are seen leafleting, attending meetings and participating in the [[Annual Reminder]] picket in Philadelphia. However, the film sets the Reminder earlier in the summer than it really was, predating the June 28 [[Stonewall riots]].\n\nIn 2002 Mattachine Midwest was inducted into the [[Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page%3Dinductees%26todo%3Dyear |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017032241/http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&todo=year |archivedate=2015-10-17 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 the Mattachine Society and its founders became the subjects of the play ''[[The Temperamentals]]'' by [[Jon Marans]].

Hay himself approached Party leaders and recommended his own expulsion. The Party decided to expel him as a \"security risk\", but declared him a \"Lifelong Friend of the People\" in recognition of his previous work for the party.<ref name=\"workers\">{{Cite news |title=Harry Hay: Painful partings |first=Leslie |last=Feinberg |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=2007-11-01 |url=http://www.workers.org/2005/us/lavender-red-40/ |periodical=[[Workers World Party|Workers World]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015105/http://www.workers.org/2005/us/lavender-red-40/ |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nMattachine was originally organized in similar structure to the Communist Party, with cells, oaths of secrecy and five different levels of membership, each of which required greater levels of involvement and commitment. As the organization grew, the levels were expected to subdivide into new cells, creating both the potential for horizontal and vertical growth.<ref>{{harvnb|D'Emilio|1983|p=64}}</ref> The founding members constituted the so-called \"Fifth Order\" and from the outset remained anonymous. \n\nMattachine's membership grew slowly at first but received a major boost in February 1952 when founder Jennings was arrested in a Los Angeles park and charged with lewd behavior. Often, men in Jennings' situation would simply plead guilty to the charge and hope to quietly rebuild their lives. Jennings and the rest of the Fifth Order saw the charges as a means to address the issue of police entrapment of homosexual men. The group began publicizing the case (under the name \"Citizens Committee to Outlaw Entrapment\") and the publicity it generated brought in financial support and volunteers. Jennings admitted during his trial to being a homosexual but insisted he was not guilty of the specific charge. The jury deadlocked and Mattachine declared victory.<ref>{{harvnb|D'Emilio|1983|pp=69\u201370}}</ref>\n\n== Naming ==\nThe Mattachine Society was named by Harry Hay at the suggestion of James Gruber, inspired by a French medieval and renaissance [[masque]] group he had studied while preparing a course on the history of popular music for a workers' education project. In a 1976 interview with Jonathan Ned Katz, Hay was asked the origin of the name Mattachine. He mentioned the medieval-Renaissance French ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Joyeuses]]'':\n\n{{quote|One [[masque]] group was known as the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mattachine.\" These societies, lifelong secret fraternities of unmarried townsmen who never performed in public unmasked, were dedicated to going out into the countryside and conducting dances and rituals during the [[Feast of Fools]], at the [[Vernal Equinox]]. Sometimes these dance rituals, or masques, were peasant protests against oppression\u2014with the maskers, in the people's name, receiving the brunt of a given lord's vicious retaliation. So we took the name Mattachine because we felt that we 1950s Gays were also a masked people, unknown and anonymous, who might become engaged in morale building and helping ourselves and others, through struggle, to move toward total redress and change.|Jonathan Katz|''Gay American History''. Crowell Publishers, 1976.<ref name=\"katz\">Katz, Jonathan. ''Gay American History''. Crowell Publishers; 1976.</ref>}}\n\nThis French group was named in turn after [[Mattaccino]] (or the Anglicized Mattachino), a character in Italian theater. Mattaccino was a kind of court [[jester]], who would speak the truth to the king when nobody else would. The \"mattachin\" (from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''mutawajjihin''\u2014\"mask-wearers\") were originally [[Moors|Moorish]] (Hispano-Arab) sword-dancers who wore elaborate, colorful costumes and masks.<ref>{{harvnb|Johansson|Percy|1994|p=92}}</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society used so-called [[harlequin]] diamonds as their [[emblem]]. The design consisted of four diamonds arranged in a pattern to form a larger diamond.\n\n== Affiliations ==\nMost of the Mattachine founders were [[communist]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} As the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] progressed, the association with communism concerned some members as well as supporters and Hay, a dedicated member of the [[Communist Party USA|CPUSA]] for 15 years, stepped down as the Society's leader. Others were similarly ousted, and the leadership structure became influenced less by communism, replaced by a moderate ideology similar to that espoused by the liberal reformist [[civil rights]] organizations that existed for [[African American]]s. Although Hay claimed \"never to have even heard\" of the earlier [[gay liberation]] struggle in [[Germany]]\u2014by the people around [[Adolf Brand]], [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and the [[Austrian-Hungarian]] [[Leontine Sagan]]\u2014he is known to have talked about it with German \u00e9migr\u00e9s in America, including the [[Austria]]n-born [[Rudi Gernreich]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe Mattachine Society existed as a single national organization headquartered first in Los Angeles and then, beginning around 1956, in San Francisco. Outside of Los Angeles and San Francisco, chapters were established in New York; Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and other locales. Due to internal disagreements, the national organization disbanded in 1961. The San Francisco national chapter retained the name \"Mattachine Society\", while the New York chapter became \"[[Mattachine Society of New York, Inc]]\" and was commonly known by its acronym MSNY. Other independent groups using the name Mattachine were formed in Washington, D.C.

The Daughters of Bilitis were the counterpart [[lesbian]] organization to the Mattachine Society, and the two organizations worked together on some campaigns, although their approaches to visibility in the mass media differed considerably.\n\nOn the eve of January 1, 1965, several homophile organizations in San Francisco, California - including Mattachine, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], the [[Council on Religion and the Homosexual]], and the [[Society for Individual Rights]] - held a fund-raising ball for their mutual benefit at California Hall on Polk Street.<ref name=\"miller_p348\">Miller, Neil (1995).

Membership diversified, with more women and people from a broader political spectrum becoming involved. With that growth came concern about the radical left slant of the organization. In particular, [[Hal Call]] and others out of San Francisco along with Ken Burns from Los Angeles wanted Mattachine to amend its constitution to clarify its opposition to so-called \"subversive elements\" and to affirm that members were loyal to the United States and its laws (which declared homosexuality illegal). In an effort to preserve their vision of the organization, the Fifth Order members revealed their identities and resigned their leadership positions at Mattachine's May 1953 convention. With the founders gone, Call, Burns and other like-minded individuals stepped into the leadership void,<ref>{{harvnb|Loughery|1998|pp=228\u201329}}</ref> and Mattachine officially adopted non-confrontation as an organizational policy. Some historians argue that these changes reduced the effectiveness of this newly organized Mattachine and led to a precipitous drop in membership and participation.<ref>{{harvnb|Hogan|Hudson|1998|p=383}}</ref> Other historians contend that the Mattachine Society between 1953 and 1966 was enormously effective as it published a magazine, developed relationships with allies in the fight for homosexual equality, and influenced public opinion on the topic too.<ref>{{harvnb|Meeker|2006|pp=37\u201376}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, the various unaffiliated Mattachine Societies, especially the Mattachine Society in San Francisco and MSNY, were among the foremost gay rights groups in the United States, but beginning in the middle 1960s and, especially, following the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, they began increasingly to be seen as too traditional, and not willing enough to be confrontational. Like the divide that occurred within the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the late 1960s and the 1970s brought a new generation of activists, many of whom felt that the gay rights movement needed to endorse a larger and more radical agenda to address other forms of oppression, the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[sexual revolution]]. Several unaffiliated entities that went under the name Mattachine eventually lost support or fell prey to internal division.\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn the ''[[Quantum Leap]]'' comic book titled ''Up Against a Stonewall'' (1992), the Mattachine Society and the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] are mentioned as two groups campaigning for LGBT rights prior to the [[Stonewall riots]].\n\nThe 1995 film ''[[Stonewall (1995 film)|Stonewall]]'' included members of the Mattachine Society of New York among its characters. Mattachine members are seen leafleting, attending meetings and participating in the [[Annual Reminder]] picket in Philadelphia. However, the film sets the Reminder earlier in the summer than it really was, predating the June 28 [[Stonewall riots]].\n\nIn 2002 Mattachine Midwest was inducted into the [[Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page%3Dinductees%26todo%3Dyear |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017032241/http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&todo=year |archivedate=2015-10-17 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 the Mattachine Society and its founders became the subjects of the play ''[[The Temperamentals]]'' by [[Jon Marans]].

Wilf and Arlette have been arguing over whether to sell land Arlette recently inherited; Wilf, citing that a man's pride is his land, is strongly opposed to Arlette's plans to sell the farm and move to [[Omaha]]. Wilf decides to convince Henry to help him murder his mother in order to prevent losing his land and his son, holding Henry's girlfriend Shannon (Kaitlyn Bernard), with whose relationship Arlette opposes, at stake. Henry reluctantly agrees to assist his father in carrying out the murder.\n\nWilf pretends to agree to the sale, appeasing Arlette. As she celebrates, she becomes inebriated. After carrying her to bed in a drunken stupor, Henry covers her face while Wilf cuts her throat with a [[butcher's knife]]. Wilf intends to bury Arlette in one of his corn fields; however Henry collapses from the ordeal, prompting Wilf to dump her body into a dry well where her corpse is soon fed upon by rats. The next day, they drop a cow into the well to hide Arlette's body as well as provide a reason for filling in the well. However, Sheriff Jones ([[Brian d'Arcy James]]) is suspicious following her sudden disappearance. While searching the house, he questions Wilf about Arlette, with Wilf stating she left them on her own accord. Finding no proof of a crime, Sheriff Jones leaves, tentatively believing Wilf's details of his wife's departure.\n\nAs time passes Henry becomes brooding and isolated, regretting the crime that he and his father have committed. His girlfriend Shannon grows increasingly concerned and is subsequently discovered to be pregnant with their unborn child. Her parents decide she is to be sent away to a Catholic institution in Omaha until the baby is born and can be given up for adoption. However, Henry steals Wilf's car, arrives in Omaha and runs away with Shannon.\n\nAs the winter passes away, Wilf appears to be going insane, being constantly harassed by rats. It is clear the rats remind him of his wife, and are a symbol of his growing guilt. He takes out a mortgage on his house to fix it up, but never actually does the work. The roof on his barn caves in, as does the roof of his home. However, he is too consumed by guilt and alcohol to fix it. His house falls in to a state of total disrepair, leaking, dark, and with one of his cows living in it. It also becomes completed infested by rats. One rat bites his hand, which becomes infected, and must be amputated. \n\nIn a climactic scene, Wilf is confronted by the ghost of his wife, surrounded by the rats which ate her. She corners him in the basement and sadistically whispers to him. She recounts, as the viewer sees, the fate of Henry and Shannon. They became robbers, known as the \"Sweetheart Bandits\", very similar to Bonnie and Clyde. During one of their heists, Shannon is shot, causing her to lose the baby and ultimately die from massive blood loss. After finding his girlfriend dead, Henry lies down next to her and kills himself with the handgun he used to rob his victims. \nLater, an unidentified woman's body is found on the side of the road which the sheriff assumes is Arlette. Henry's body is delivered to Wilf, which, like his mother's body, has been chewed through by rats. No one attends Henry's funeral, except for Wilf. He turns, and again sees the ghost of his wife, surrounded by rats. \n\nWilf attempts to sell his land to Shannon's father ([[Neal McDonough]]), who bluntly tells Wilf to leave his property and never come back. Wilf moves to Omaha to find work, but cannot escape being followed by rats.\n\nEight years later, in 1930, Wilf writes his confession, stating, \"In the end, we all get caught.\" By this point, dozens of rats have swarmed his room. Arlette, Henry, and Shannon's corpses have appeared in front of the frightened Wilf. Brandishing the same butcher's knife used to kill his mother, Henry tells Wilf that his death will be quick.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as Wilfred James\n* Dylan Schmid as Henry James\n* [[Molly Parker]] as Arlette James\n* [[Neal McDonough]] as Harlan Cotterie\n* Kaitlyn Bernard as Shannon Cotterie\n* [[Brian d'Arcy James]] as Sheriff Jones\n* [[Bob Frazer]] as Mr. Lester\n\n== Reception ==\n''1922'' received positive reviews.
