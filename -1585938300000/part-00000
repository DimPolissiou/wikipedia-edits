In 2005, he was a cofounder of the Catalyst Collaborative at MIT, a partnership between MIT and Central\nSquare Theater, in Cambridge, that sponsors plays involving science and the culture of science.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spectrum.mit.edu/continuum/qa-alan-lightman/|title=Physicist and Novelist Alan Lightman Looks Back on a Decade of Science on Stage|website=MIT Spectrum}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arts.mit.edu/about/partners/catalyst-collaborative-at-mit/|title=Catalyst Collaborative at MIT}}</ref> In the same year, Lightman cofounded the graduate program in science writing at MIT.\n\n==Scientific work==\nIn his scientific work, Lightman has made contributions to the theory of astrophysical processes under extreme temperatures and densities. In particular, his research has focused on relativistic gravitation theory, the structure and behavior of [[accretion disks]], [[stellar dynamics]], [[radiative processes]], and [[relativistic plasmas]]. Some of his significant achievements are his discovery, with [[Douglas Eardley]], of a structural instability in orbiting disks of matter, called accretion disks, that form around massive condensed objects such as [[black holes]], with wide application in astronomy;<ref>Astrophysical Journal Letters, vol. 187, pg. L1 (1974)</ref> his proof, with [[David L.

That first facility was completed in 2006, the first dormitory for college women in the country. \n\nDuring this work, Lightman founded Harpswell <ref name=\"harpswell\" />, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance a new generation of women leaders in Southeast Asia. Harpswell now operates two dormitory and leadership centers in Phnom Penh. In addition to providing free housing, food, and medical care, the facility gives outstanding young women a rigorous in-house program in leadership skills and critical thinking.   The in-house program includes English instruction, computer literacy, debate, analytical writing, comparative genocide studies, strategies for civic engagement, leadership training, and discussion and analysis of national and international events.  As of Fall 2019, the Cambodian program has about 180 graduates and about 76 current students. Harpswell graduates are advancing into leadership positions as project managers at NGOs, lawyers, businesswomen, journalists, engineers, health care workers, teachers and professors, government staff, and bankers.\n\nIn 2017, Harpswell launched a new program in leadership for young professional women<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://harpswell-asean-kanita.weebly.com/|title=Harpswell ASEAN Program in Women's Leadership|website=HARPSWELL }}</ref> from all ten countries of Southeast Asia: Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei, plus Nepal.  The Harpswell-ASEAN Program in Women's Leadership consists of an intense, two week summer program in Penang Malaysia, with lectures and workshops in critical thinking, civic engagement, Southeast Asian geography and society, technology and communication, and gender issues. The program has a total of 25 participants each year, who are flown to Penang from their respective countries.\n\n==Major awards and honors==\n\n*Honorary doctoral degrees from Bowdoin College (2005)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/college-history-and-archives/bowdoin-honorary-degree-recipients.shtml|title=Special Collections & Archives: Bowdoin Honorary Degree Recipients|website=library.bowdoin.edu}}</ref>, Memphis College of Art (2006),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mca.edu/about/history/|title=History|website=Memphis College of Art}}</ref>, University of Maryland (2006)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://provost.umbc.edu/additional_resources/umbc-honorary-degrees-awarded-and-commencement-speakers/|title=UMBC Honorary Degrees Awarded and Commencement Speakers - Office of the Provost - UMBC|website=provost.umbc.edu}}</ref>, University of Massachusetts (2010),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2010/05/31/commencement_honors_and_speakers/|title=Commencement honors and speakers|first=Mark Shanahan & Meredith|last=Goldstein|via=The Boston Globe}}</ref> Colgate University (2017),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.colgate.edu/news/stories/poet-claudia-rankine-deliver-2017-commencement-keynote|title=Poet Claudia Rankine to deliver 2017 commencement keynote &#124; Colgate University|website=www.colgate.edu}}</ref>, and Skidmore College (2019)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skidmore.edu/news/2019/0308-commencement.php|title=Skidmore announces 2019 Commencement speakers|website=www.skidmore.edu}}</ref>\n*Inaugural winner of 2017 Humanism in Literature award, given by Humanist Hub of Harvard<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Announcing--Alan-Lightman-Accepts-Humanism-in-Literature-Award.html?soid=1101815297099&aid=-xuBRtNWkGw|title=Announcing: Alan Lightman Accepts Humanism in Literature Award|website=myemail.constantcontact.com}}</ref>\n*2016 Distinguished Artist of the Year Award from St. Botolph\u2019s Club of Boston <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shass.mit.edu/news/news-2016-lightman-receives-distinguished-artist-award-st-botolph-club-foundation|title=MIT SHASS: News - 2016 - Lightman receives Distinguished Artist Award from the St. Botolph Club Foundation|website=shass.mit.edu}}</ref>\n*2016 Sydney Award for the best magazine essays of 2011, for \"What Came Before the Big Bang?\", awarded by David Brooks of ''The New York Times'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/opinion/the-2016-sidney-awards-part-deux.html|title=Opinion &#124; The 2016 Sidney Awards, Part Deux|first=David|last=Brooks|date=December 30, 2016|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n*Screening Room (2015) named by the Washington Post as one of the best books of the year<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/the-best-nonfiction-of-2015/2015/11/18/326c89e8-7902-11e5-b9c1-f03c48c96ac2_story.html|title=Notable nonfiction of 2015|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n*2011 Sydney Award for the best magazine essays of 2011, for \"The Accidental Universe,\" awarded by David Brooks of ''The New York Times''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/opinion/brooks-the-sidney-awards-part-i.html|title=Opinion &#124; The Sidney Awards, Part I|first=David|last=Brooks|date=December 19, 2011|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n*Gold Medal for humanitarian service to Cambodia, awarded by the government of Cambodia in 2008\n*2006 John P.

In particular, his research has focused on relativistic gravitation theory, the structure and behavior of [[accretion disks]], [[stellar dynamics]], [[radiative processes]], and [[relativistic plasmas]]. Some of his significant achievements are his discovery, with [[Douglas Eardley]], of a structural instability in orbiting disks of matter, called accretion disks, that form around massive condensed objects such as [[black holes]], with wide application in astronomy;<ref>Astrophysical Journal Letters, vol. 187, pg. L1 (1974)</ref> his proof, with [[David L.

That first facility was completed in 2006, the first dormitory for college women in the country. \n\nDuring this work, Lightman founded Harpswell <ref name=\"harpswell\" />, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance a new generation of women leaders in Southeast Asia. Harpswell now operates two dormitory and leadership centers in Phnom Penh. In addition to providing free housing, food, and medical care, the facility gives outstanding young women a rigorous in-house program in leadership skills and critical thinking.   The in-house program includes English instruction, computer literacy, debate, analytical writing, comparative genocide studies, strategies for civic engagement, leadership training, and discussion and analysis of national and international events.  As of Fall 2019, the Cambodian program has about 180 graduates and about 76 current students. Harpswell graduates are advancing into leadership positions as project managers at NGOs, lawyers, businesswomen, journalists, engineers, health care workers, teachers and professors, government staff, and bankers.\n\nIn 2017, Harpswell launched a new program in leadership for young professional women<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://harpswell-asean-kanita.weebly.com/|title=Harpswell ASEAN Program in Women's Leadership|website=HARPSWELL }}</ref> from all ten countries of Southeast Asia: Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei, plus Nepal.  The Harpswell-ASEAN Program in Women's Leadership consists of an intense, two week summer program in Penang Malaysia, with lectures and workshops in critical thinking, civic engagement, Southeast Asian geography and society, technology and communication, and gender issues. The program has a total of 25 participants each year, who are flown to Penang from their respective countries.\n\n==Major awards and honors==\n\n*Honorary doctoral degrees from Bowdoin College (2005)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.bowdoin.edu/arch/college-history-and-archives/bowdoin-honorary-degree-recipients.shtml|title=Special Collections & Archives: Bowdoin Honorary Degree Recipients|website=library.bowdoin.edu}}</ref>, Memphis College of Art (2006),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mca.edu/about/history/|title=History|website=Memphis College of Art}}</ref>, University of Maryland (2006)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://provost.umbc.edu/additional_resources/umbc-honorary-degrees-awarded-and-commencement-speakers/|title=UMBC Honorary Degrees Awarded and Commencement Speakers - Office of the Provost - UMBC|website=provost.umbc.edu}}</ref>, University of Massachusetts (2010),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2010/05/31/commencement_honors_and_speakers/|title=Commencement honors and speakers|first=Mark Shanahan & Meredith|last=Goldstein|via=The Boston Globe}}</ref> Colgate University (2017),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.colgate.edu/news/stories/poet-claudia-rankine-deliver-2017-commencement-keynote|title=Poet Claudia Rankine to deliver 2017 commencement keynote &#124; Colgate University|website=www.colgate.edu}}</ref>, and Skidmore College (2019)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skidmore.edu/news/2019/0308-commencement.php|title=Skidmore announces 2019 Commencement speakers|website=www.skidmore.edu}}</ref>\n*Inaugural winner of 2017 Humanism in Literature award, given by Humanist Hub of Harvard<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Announcing--Alan-Lightman-Accepts-Humanism-in-Literature-Award.html?soid=1101815297099&aid=-xuBRtNWkGw|title=Announcing: Alan Lightman Accepts Humanism in Literature Award|website=myemail.constantcontact.com}}</ref>\n*2016 Distinguished Artist of the Year Award from St. Botolph\u2019s Club of Boston <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shass.mit.edu/news/news-2016-lightman-receives-distinguished-artist-award-st-botolph-club-foundation|title=MIT SHASS: News - 2016 - Lightman receives Distinguished Artist Award from the St. Botolph Club Foundation|website=shass.mit.edu}}</ref>\n*2016 Sydney Award for the best magazine essays of 2011, for \"What Came Before the Big Bang?\", awarded by David Brooks of ''The New York Times'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/opinion/the-2016-sidney-awards-part-deux.html|title=Opinion &#124; The 2016 Sidney Awards, Part Deux|first=David|last=Brooks|date=December 30, 2016|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n*Screening Room (2015) named by the Washington Post as one of the best books of the year<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/the-best-nonfiction-of-2015/2015/11/18/326c89e8-7902-11e5-b9c1-f03c48c96ac2_story.html|title=Notable nonfiction of 2015|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n*2011 Sydney Award for the best magazine essays of 2011, for \"The Accidental Universe,\" awarded by David Brooks of ''The New York Times''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/opinion/brooks-the-sidney-awards-part-i.html|title=Opinion &#124; The Sidney Awards, Part I|first=David|last=Brooks|date=December 19, 2011|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n*Gold Medal for humanitarian service to Cambodia, awarded by the government of Cambodia in 2008\n*2006 John P.

It was released on April 12, 1999, as the lead single from their third studio album, ''[[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]]''. It was written by [[Max Martin]] and [[Andreas Carlsson]], while Martin and [[Kristian Lundin]] produced it. The [[Sentimental ballad|pop ballad]] talks about a relationship strained by matters of emotional or physical distance.\n\nCritically, the song was met with positive reception, with many critics commending its catchiness, also calling it the pop ballad of the year. The song was nominated for three [[Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], and has been included in lists by [[Blender (magazine)|''Blender'']], [[MTV]], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[VH1]].\n \n\"I Want It That Way\" is the Backstreet Boys\u2019 [[signature song]], and commercially it reached the number-one spot in more than 25 countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2ydRvGWo9M |title=Backstreet Boys 'In a World Like This:' Before July 30 Release Date, Relive BSB's Discography with The 11 Best Backstreet Boys Songs [VIDEOS&#93; : Music |publisher=Mstarz |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> including Austria, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for eight non-consecutive weeks, while it topped the [[Adult Contemporary|Adult]] and [[Top 40 Mainstream]] charts.\n\nThe song has been widely covered and parodied by a range of artists, including other boy bands such as [[JLS]] and [[One Direction]], while its music video, directed by [[Wayne Isham]], received famous parodies, including [[Blink 182]] on their music video for \"[[All the Small Things]]\", [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]] on their music video for \"[[24/Seven (album)#Track listing|Like Nobody's Around]]\" and [[The Wanted]] on their video for \"[[Walks Like Rihanna]]\". The original music video received four [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards|VMA]] nominations, winning [[MTV Video Music Award \u2013 Viewer's Choice|Viewer's Choice]].\n\n== Background and history ==\nAfter the success of their first two albums, ''[[Backstreet Boys (1996 album)|Backstreet Boys]]'' (1996) and ''[[Backstreet's Back]]'' (1997), the band recorded their third studio album, during 1998 and 1999. When the members of the [[Backstreet Boys]] came to [[Stockholm]] in November 1998 for a two-week recording engagement, they were eventually presented the demo of \"I Want It That Way\", which at the time only consisted of the main chorus. Upon leaving Sweden on November 16 for a November 17 Oprah taping (Dec. 3 airing), vocals for the song had been completed in two days.\n\nOriginally, \"[[Larger than Life (song)|Larger Than Life]]\" was intended to be the [[lead single]], following the similar formula of their first two albums, having an upbeat lead single. However, after hearing the final version of \"I Want It That Way\", the group wanted to move in a more mature direction, by utilizing a mid-tempo track as the lead single. [[Zomba Recording]] executives had to be convinced to approve of the song as the first single, due to them citing that the group could \"alienate fans\" with a mid-tempo song that had vague lyrical meaning. In the end, press information in the form of snippets was authorized for release to radio stations in March 1999, to precede the song's release to radio in April.\n\n=== Censorship ===\nOn August 19, 2011, China's [[Ministry of Culture (China)|Ministry of Culture]] released a list of 100 songs including the then twelve-year-old \"I Want it That Way\" that were required to be removed from the Internet. This purge came about because the Ministry claimed that these songs had been released without first being subjected to a mandatory screening process conducted by Ministry officials as per official government policy. Media sites were given until September 15 to delete the named songs or face unspecified penalties. The Chinese government claims that such measures are necessary for national security purposes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga and Katy Perry: banned in China for 'being vulgar'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2ydRvGWo9M|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=February 4, 2014|location=London|first=Dorian|last=Lynskey|date=August 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Writing and inspiration ==\n{{Listen\n| filename    = I_Want_It_That_Way_intro.ogg\n| title       = I Want It That Way\n| description = The guitar intro and first verse of the song\n| pos         = right\n}}\n\"I Want It That Way\" was written by [[Andreas Carlsson]] and [[Max Martin]], while Martin and [[Kristian Lundin]] produced the track.

For Westhoff, \"Mainly, the meaning of 'that' is at issue.\" While analyzing the lyrics, Westhoff perceived that, \"None of the sentiments in the chorus seem to go with any of the other ones. Even worse, no further explanation is given for what 'that' is.\" The critic assumed that in the song \"someone simply doesn't like it when his lover expresses preferences, never wanting to hear when his girlfriend says she wants things in particular ways\".<ref name=laweekly>{{cite news|last=Westhoff|first=Ben|title=What The Hell Is Backstreet Boys' \"I Want It That Way\" About?

Unterberger also noted that \"The phrase 'I want it that way' is similarly devoid of inherent meaning, but it\u2019s used recurringly as a kind of conclusive phrase, always calling back to those first two lines, as the song gets gradually more despairing in nature.\" Unterberger also found out that \"The chorus would appear to be in direct opposition to the rest of the song.\"<ref name=popdust>{{cite news|last=Unterberger|first=Andrew|title=Backstreet Boys' 'I Want It That Way' Lyrics Analysis: Which Way Is It, Exactly?|url=http://popdust.com/2012/11/27/backstreet-boys-i-want-it-that-way-lyrics/|accessdate=January 30, 2014|newspaper=PopDust|date=November 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnterberger concluded that the song \"is about a relationship that\u2019s troubled by matters of emotional and/or physical distance, but that the singer feels strongly enough about to keep it going just the same\u2026until the chorus, at which point he decides that it\u2019s not worth the trouble.

In the final chorus, as the band prepares to board their plane, a [[Boeing 727]], they are greeted by a crowd of screaming fans bearing signs and flowers. The scenes involving the plane and the final scenes which featured the fans were filmed in one of the hangars of LAX. Additionally, a [[Delta Air Lines]] [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar|L-1011]] appears when [[Howie D.]] sings the fourth verse.\n\nThe video features prominent special effects scene transitions between shots. Notably, a high-speed zoom effect which makes it appear that the foreground subject has not changed to a new shot while the background has, fades in and out of white, and shifting between different film speeds during shots. Another special effects sequence using [[chroma key|greenscreen]], in which the band, dressed in white, would perform a dance sequence while being manipulated over the backdrop of the Tom Bradley terminal lobby was mostly cut from the video, as it was felt that a dance sequence did not fit with the song, though elements of the dance remain in the second chorus, as do non-dance elements in that sequence.\n\nThe video reached number 35 on \"[[Muchmusic]]'s 100 Best Videos\".

It was written by [[Max Martin]] and [[Andreas Carlsson]], while Martin and [[Kristian Lundin]] produced it. The [[Sentimental ballad|pop ballad]] talks about a relationship strained by matters of emotional or physical distance.\n\nCritically, the song was met with positive reception, with many critics commending its catchiness, also calling it the pop ballad of the year. The song was nominated for three [[Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], and has been included in lists by [[Blender (magazine)|''Blender'']], [[MTV]], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[VH1]].\n \n\"I Want It That Way\" is the Backstreet Boys\u2019 [[signature song]], and commercially it reached the number-one spot in more than 25 countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2ydRvGWo9M |title=Backstreet Boys 'In a World Like This:' Before July 30 Release Date, Relive BSB's Discography with The 11 Best Backstreet Boys Songs [VIDEOS&#93; : Music |publisher=Mstarz |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> including Austria, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song peaked at number 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for eight non-consecutive weeks, while it topped the [[Adult Contemporary|Adult]] and [[Top 40 Mainstream]] charts.\n\nThe song has been widely covered and parodied by a range of artists, including other boy bands such as [[JLS]] and [[One Direction]], while its music video, directed by [[Wayne Isham]], received famous parodies, including [[Blink 182]] on their music video for \"[[All the Small Things]]\", [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]] on their music video for \"[[24/Seven (album)#Track listing|Like Nobody's Around]]\" and [[The Wanted]] on their video for \"[[Walks Like Rihanna]]\". The original music video received four [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards|VMA]] nominations, winning [[MTV Video Music Award \u2013 Viewer's Choice|Viewer's Choice]].\n\n== Background and history ==\nAfter the success of their first two albums, ''[[Backstreet Boys (1996 album)|Backstreet Boys]]'' (1996) and ''[[Backstreet's Back]]'' (1997), the band recorded their third studio album, during 1998 and 1999. When the members of the [[Backstreet Boys]] came to [[Stockholm]] in November 1998 for a two-week recording engagement, they were eventually presented the demo of \"I Want It That Way\", which at the time only consisted of the main chorus. Upon leaving Sweden on November 16 for a November 17 Oprah taping (Dec. 3 airing), vocals for the song had been completed in two days.\n\nOriginally, \"[[Larger than Life (song)|Larger Than Life]]\" was intended to be the [[lead single]], following the similar formula of their first two albums, having an upbeat lead single. However, after hearing the final version of \"I Want It That Way\", the group wanted to move in a more mature direction, by utilizing a mid-tempo track as the lead single. [[Zomba Recording]] executives had to be convinced to approve of the song as the first single, due to them citing that the group could \"alienate fans\" with a mid-tempo song that had vague lyrical meaning. In the end, press information in the form of snippets was authorized for release to radio stations in March 1999, to precede the song's release to radio in April.\n\n=== Censorship ===\nOn August 19, 2011, China's [[Ministry of Culture (China)|Ministry of Culture]] released a list of 100 songs including the then twelve-year-old \"I Want it That Way\" that were required to be removed from the Internet. This purge came about because the Ministry claimed that these songs had been released without first being subjected to a mandatory screening process conducted by Ministry officials as per official government policy. Media sites were given until September 15 to delete the named songs or face unspecified penalties. The Chinese government claims that such measures are necessary for national security purposes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga and Katy Perry: banned in China for 'being vulgar'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2ydRvGWo9M|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=February 4, 2014|location=London|first=Dorian|last=Lynskey|date=August 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Writing and inspiration ==\n{{Listen\n| filename    = I_Want_It_That_Way_intro.ogg\n| title       = I Want It That Way\n| description = The guitar intro and first verse of the song\n| pos         = right\n}}\n\"I Want It That Way\" was written by [[Andreas Carlsson]] and [[Max Martin]], while Martin and [[Kristian Lundin]] produced the track.

Even worse, no further explanation is given for what 'that' is.\" The critic assumed that in the song \"someone simply doesn't like it when his lover expresses preferences, never wanting to hear when his girlfriend says she wants things in particular ways\".<ref name=laweekly>{{cite news|last=Westhoff|first=Ben|title=What The Hell Is Backstreet Boys' \"I Want It That Way\" About?

Unterberger also noted that \"The phrase 'I want it that way' is similarly devoid of inherent meaning, but it\u2019s used recurringly as a kind of conclusive phrase, always calling back to those first two lines, as the song gets gradually more despairing in nature.\" Unterberger also found out that \"The chorus would appear to be in direct opposition to the rest of the song.\"<ref name=popdust>{{cite news|last=Unterberger|first=Andrew|title=Backstreet Boys' 'I Want It That Way' Lyrics Analysis: Which Way Is It, Exactly?|url=http://popdust.com/2012/11/27/backstreet-boys-i-want-it-that-way-lyrics/|accessdate=January 30, 2014|newspaper=PopDust|date=November 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnterberger concluded that the song \"is about a relationship that\u2019s troubled by matters of emotional and/or physical distance, but that the singer feels strongly enough about to keep it going just the same\u2026until the chorus, at which point he decides that it\u2019s not worth the trouble.

In the final chorus, as the band prepares to board their plane, a [[Boeing 727]], they are greeted by a crowd of screaming fans bearing signs and flowers. The scenes involving the plane and the final scenes which featured the fans were filmed in one of the hangars of LAX. Additionally, a [[Delta Air Lines]] [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar|L-1011]] appears when [[Howie D.]] sings the fourth verse.\n\nThe video features prominent special effects scene transitions between shots. Notably, a high-speed zoom effect which makes it appear that the foreground subject has not changed to a new shot while the background has, fades in and out of white, and shifting between different film speeds during shots. Another special effects sequence using [[chroma key|greenscreen]], in which the band, dressed in white, would perform a dance sequence while being manipulated over the backdrop of the Tom Bradley terminal lobby was mostly cut from the video, as it was felt that a dance sequence did not fit with the song, though elements of the dance remain in the second chorus, as do non-dance elements in that sequence.\n\nThe video reached number 35 on \"[[Muchmusic]]'s 100 Best Videos\". The song's music video has been parodied by [[Blink-182]] in their music video for the song \"[[All the Small Things]]\".

The first attempts to reuse the abandoned  [[saltworks|Lucija saltworks]] began in 1964, when a boathouse was built for sport and recreation activities, although it gained little popularity over the years. In 1970, efforts got underway to establish a new water sports facility ({{lang-sl|Dom vodnih \u0161portov}}). In 1973, the Casino gambling company expressed interest in building various tourism and yachting facilities on the saltpans, which were in ruins after years of neglect. Construction of the marina began in 1977; the first phase was finished in 1982 and the second in 1986. The official opening took place in May 1986. The marina is now a popular site, and the international nautical exhibition is held there every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinap.si/si/company/history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926220037/http://www.marinap.si/si/company/history/ |archivedate=2010-09-26 }}</ref><ref>http://kraji.eu/slovenija/marina_portoroz/slo</ref><ref>http://www.piran.si/index.php?page=static&item=88</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.geopedia.si/#L410_F10122961_T13_b4_x391968.37_y41346.65549999999_s15 Lucija on Geopedia]\n*{{commonscat-inline|Lucija}}\n\n{{Piran}}\n{{Slovenian Riviera}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in the Municipality of Piran]]\n[[Category:Slovenian Riviera]]\n\n{{Piran-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name          = Lucija\n|other_name             = Sveta Lucija (until 1961), Lucia \n|native_name            =  <!-- for cities whose native name is not in English -->\n|nickname               =\n|settlement_type        = <!--For Town or Village (Leave blank for the default City)-->\n|motto                  =\n|image_skyline          =Lucija (14154978431).jpg\n|imagesize              = 280px\n|image_caption          =\n|image_flag             =\n|flag_size              =\n|image_seal             =\n|seal_size              =\n|image_shield           =\n|shield_size            =\n|image_blank_emblem     =\n|blank_emblem_type      =\n|blank_emblem_size      =\n|image_map              =\n|mapsize                =\n|map_caption            =\n|image_map1             =\n|mapsize1               =\n|map_caption1           =\n|image_dot_map          =\n|dot_mapsize            =\n|dot_map_caption        =\n|dot_x =  |dot_y =\n|pushpin_map            = Slovenia<!-- the name of a location map as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Location_map -->\n|pushpin_label_position = bottom\n|pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Slovenia\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = [[File:Flag of Slovenia.svg|25px]] [[Slovenia]]\n|subdivision_type1      = Region\n| subdivision_type1     = Traditional region\n| subdivision_name1     = [[Slovenian Littoral]]\n| subdivision_type2     = [[Statistical regions of Slovenia|Statistical region]]\n| subdivision_name2     = [[Coastal\u2013Karst Statistical Region|Coastal\u2013Karst]]\n| subdivision_type3     = [[Municipalities of Slovenia|Municipality]]\n| subdivision_name3     = [[Municipality of Piran|Piran]]\n|subdivision_type4      =\n|subdivision_name4      =\n|leader_name            =\n|leader_title1          =\n|leader_name1           =\n|leader_title2          =\n|leader_name2           =\n|leader_title3          =\n|leader_name3           =\n|leader_title4          =\n|leader_name4           =\n|established_title      =\n|established_date       =\n|established_title2     =\n|established_date2      =\n|established_title3     =\n|established_date3      =\n|area_magnitude         =\n|area_footnotes           =\n|area_total_km2           =4.42\n|area_land_km2            =\n|area_water_km2           =\n|area_total_sq_mi         =\n|area_land_sq_mi          =\n|area_water_sq_mi         =\n|area_water_percent       =\n|area_urban_km2           =\n|area_urban_sq_mi         =\n|area_metro_km2           =\n|area_metro_sq_mi         =\n|area_blank1_title        =\n|area_blank1_km2          =\n|area_blank1_sq_mi        =\n|population_as_of               =2018\n|population_footnotes           =\n|population_note                =\n|population_total               =6057\n|population_density_km2         =1400\n|population_density_sq_mi       =\n|population_metro               =\n|population_density_metro_km2   =\n|population_density_metro_sq_mi =\n|population_urban               =\n|population_density_urban_km2   =\n|population_density_urban_sq_mi =\n|population_blank1_title        =Ethnicities\n|population_blank1              =\n|population_blank2_title        =Religions\n|population_blank2              =\n|population_density_blank1_km2 =\n|population_density_blank1_sq_mi =\n|timezone               =\n|utc_offset             =\n|timezone_DST           =\n|utc_offset_DST         =\n|coordinates            = {{coord|45|30|24.23|N|13|36|5.73|E|region:SI|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation_footnotes    =\n|elevation_m            = 3.6\n|elevation_ft           =\n|postal_code_type       =\n|postal_code            =\n|area_code              =\n|blank_name             =\n|blank_info             =\n|blank1_name            =\n|blank1_info            =\n|website                =\n|footnotes              = <ref>[http://www.stat.si/eng/index.asp Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia]</ref>\n}}\n'''Lucija''' ({{IPA-sl|lu\u02c8tsi\u02d0ja|pron}}; {{lang-it|Lucia}}) is a settlement in the [[Municipality of Piran]] in the [[Slovenian Littoral|Littoral]] region of [[Slovenia]].

After finishing nine grades of school in 1940 he trained at the Kramatorsky aeroclub, which he graduated from in 1941. In May that year he entered the Red Army, and in February 1943 he graduated from the Voroshilov Military Aviation School of Pilots.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=214}}\n\n== World War II ==\nHaving graduated from training in February, Nedbaylo arrived at the Eastern Front of World War II in March. He was placed in the 505th Assault Aviation Regiment, which was soon honored with the Guards designation and renamed the 75th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment on 18 March 1943. During a mission on 6 September 1943 he shot down a Ju-87 dive bomber over Vasilyevka raion.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=214}}\n\nStarting in 1944, Nedbaylo flew missions with Anton Malyuk as his gunner. They flew roughly 100 sorties together, and on two separate occasions they were shot down. On 5 February 1944 while returning from a target over [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]] in poor weather, they got into a mid-air collision with another plane, leaving Nedbaylo seriously injured. Malyuk and local infantrymen helped pull the unconscious pilot out of the mangled cockpit. Both aviators in the other plane, I.A.Okhtin and T.A.Tsvirkunov, were killed by the crash. With a fractured left hand he was sent to a hospital, but in less than two months he returned to flying. After Malyuk sustained a serious head injury on mission with another pilot, Nedbaylo began flying with Dmitry Matveev as his gunner.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=215}}\n\nOn 26 June Nedbaylo successfully led a mission that resulted in the destruction of Axis trains in Orsha-Tolochin, [[Vitebsk Region|Vitebsk]]. During another mission he shot down a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|FW-190]] over [[Vilkavi\u0161kis]]. During a mission in Autumn 1944, Nedbaylo felt a chest pain, but when he landed at his designated airfield after the flight, he discovered that he had been hit by enemy fire; he survived because the bullet had hit his parachute strap locks and flattened before it hit him.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=215}} For flying 130 missions on the Il-2 he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 19 April 1945, and he was awarded the title again on 29 June 1945 for flying at total of 219 missions.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=217}}\n\nDuring the war he executed a [[Belly landing|belly-landing]], sustained serious damaged to his aircraft from enemy fire, returned to the airbase with half the tail of his plane gone, and was shot down three times. Originally a low-ranking pilot in his regiment, he rose through the ranks to the position of flight commander and eventually squadron commander.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=214}}{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=216}}\n\n== Postwar ==\nAfter the end of the war Nedbaylo remained in the military, and participated in the [[Moscow Victory Parade of 1945|victory day parade]]. In 1951 he graduated from the Air Force Academy in Monino. From then until December 1953 he was the deputy head of the Supreme Officer's Flight School. He then became a lecturer of combat training at the academy in Monino, and in November 1956 he became the chief of staff of an aviation regiment. In December 1957 he was placed in charge of the department of tactics and military history at the Kharkov Higher Military Command School, but in October 1960 he was switched to the department of military history at the facility's School of Engineering. In 1962 he became the deputy head of the Kazan Higher Command Engineering School, after which he was part of the faculty at the Riga Higher Military Command School starting in 1964.

In May that year he entered the Red Army, and in February 1943 he graduated from the Voroshilov Military Aviation School of Pilots.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=214}}\n\n== World War II ==\nHaving graduated from training in February, Nedbaylo arrived at the Eastern Front of World War II in March. He was placed in the 505th Assault Aviation Regiment, which was soon honored with the Guards designation and renamed the 75th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment on 18 March 1943. During a mission on 6 September 1943 he shot down a Ju-87 dive bomber over Vasilyevka raion.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=214}}\n\nStarting in 1944, Nedbaylo flew missions with Anton Malyuk as his gunner. They flew roughly 100 sorties together, and on two separate occasions they were shot down. On 5 February 1944 while returning from a target over [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]] in poor weather, they got into a mid-air collision with another plane, leaving Nedbaylo seriously injured. Malyuk and local infantrymen helped pull the unconscious pilot out of the mangled cockpit. Both aviators in the other plane, I.A.Okhtin and T.A.Tsvirkunov, were killed by the crash. With a fractured left hand he was sent to a hospital, but in less than two months he returned to flying. After Malyuk sustained a serious head injury on mission with another pilot, Nedbaylo began flying with Dmitry Matveev as his gunner.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=215}}\n\nOn 26 June Nedbaylo successfully led a mission that resulted in the destruction of Axis trains in Orsha-Tolochin, [[Vitebsk Region|Vitebsk]]. During another mission he shot down a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|FW-190]] over [[Vilkavi\u0161kis]]. During a mission in Autumn 1944, Nedbaylo felt a chest pain, but when he landed at his designated airfield after the flight, he discovered that he had been hit by enemy fire; he survived because the bullet had hit his parachute strap locks and flattened before it hit him.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=215}} For flying 130 missions on the Il-2 he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 19 April 1945, and he was awarded the title again on 29 June 1945 for flying at total of 219 missions.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=217}}\n\nDuring the war he executed a [[Belly landing|belly-landing]], sustained serious damaged to his aircraft from enemy fire, returned to the airbase with half the tail of his plane plane gone, and was shot down three times. Originally a low-ranking pilot in his regiment, he rose through the ranks to the position of flight commander and eventually squadron commander.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=214}}{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=216}}\n\n== Postwar ==\nAfter the end of the war Nedbaylo remained in the military, and participated in the [[Moscow Victory Parade of 1945|victory day parade]]. In 1951 he graduated from the Air Force Academy in Monino. From then until December 1953 he was the deputy head of the Supreme Officer's Flight School. He then became a lecturer of combat training at the academy in Monino, and in November 1956 he became the chief of staff of an aviation regiment. In December 1957 he was placed in charge of the department of tactics and military history at the Kharkov Higher Military Command School, but in October 1960 he was switched to the department of military history at the facility's School of Engineering. In 1962 he became the deputy head of the Kazan Higher Command Engineering School, after which he was part of the faculty at the Riga Higher Military Command School starting in 1964. He was the deputy superintendent of the Kiev Higher Air Force Engineering Academy from 1968 until his retirement in 1983.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=216}} He was promoted to the rank lieutenant-colonel in 1949 and colonel in 1954 before he became a General-major of Aviation in 1970.{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=217}}\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n* Twice [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] (19 April 1945 and 29 June 1945)\n* [[Order of Lenin]] (19 April 1945)\n* Three [[Order of the Red Banner]] (31 October 1943, 7 January 1944, and 29 January 1945)\n* [[Order of Alexander Nevsky|Order of Aleksandr Nevsky]] (18 September 1944)\n* Three [[Order of the Patriotic War]] 1st class (15 August 1944, 19 April 1945, and 11 March 1985)\n* Order of the Patriotic War 2nd class (3 May 1944)\n* Two [[Order of the Red Star]] (23 July 1943 and 16 February 1982)\n* [[Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] (3rd class - 7 May 1995; 2nd class - 5 May 1999; 1st class - 14 October 1999)\n* campaign and service medals{{sfn|Simonov|Bodrikhin|2017|p=217}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1005741956|title=\u0411\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u0451\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u2014 \u0434\u0432\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0434\u044b \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u0430|last=Simonov|first=Andrey|last2=Bodrikhin|first2=Nikolai|publisher=\u0424\u043e\u043d\u0434 \u00ab\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0412\u0438\u0442\u044f\u0437\u0438\u00bb, \u041c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e|year=2017|isbn=9785990960510|location=Moscow|oclc=1005741956|ref=harv}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nedbaylo, Anatoly}}\n[[Category:1923 births]]\n[[Category:2008 deaths]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Soviet World War II pilots]]\n[[Category:Soviet major generals]]\n[[Category:People from Izium]]\n[[Category:Soviet Air Force generals]]\n[[Category:Lieutenant generals of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, 1st class]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, 2nd class]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, 3rd class]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Alexander Nevsky]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of the Patriotic War, 2nd class]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWorld War II:Typo fixing, replaced: plane plane \u2192 plane", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Nedbaylo"}

The game involves using a laser cannon to destroy falling meteors, bombs, and other targets.<ref name=\"Astrosmash\">''Astrosmash'', [[Mattel]] Electronics (1981).</ref>  With more than one million copies sold, ''Astrosmash'' was among the top five best selling Intellivision games.  A free by mail offer, with the purchase of a master component, boosted ''Astrosmash'' sales figures.<ref>http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/people/askhal/askhal.html#C1</ref>  It also benefitted from other promotions in the United States and Canada, including a high score contest where top scorers across the United States were flown to Houston for the finals.<ref>http://intvfunhouse.com/games/mash.php</ref>\n\nA port of ''Astrosmash'' was released for the [[Atari 2600]] under [[Mattel]]'s [[M Network]] label as '''''Astroblast'''''.\n\n==Basic description==\nThe Intellivision game catalog features the exciting caption, \"Spin. Blast. And drop into hyperspace to avoid a killer asteroid shower. Power on. Attack computer engaged. Fire a quick burst at the alien antagonists.  Got 'em!\"<ref>[[Intellivision]] game catalog, [[Mattel]] Inc. (1982).</ref><ref name=\"intellivisionlives.com\">[http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/credits/space.html#astrosmash intellivisionlives.com]</ref>  The actual package gives a more specific description: \"You're in command of a battery of laser guns.  You have unlimited ammo and a lot of targets!  You can roll up big scores by hitting a spectactular barrage of falling rocks, bombs, guided missiles and attacking UFOs...\"<ref name=\"Astrosmash\"/>\n''Astrosmash'' resembles a cross between the early arcade games ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.  The player controls a laser cannon that can scroll left or right along a flat plane in order to target falling objects, such as large or small meteors, large or small spinning bombs, and guided missiles, as well as a UFO that crosses the screen from time to time at higher levels.<ref name=\"WeissCHVG\" />  Low hills and stars are seen in the background.  Unlike in ''Space Invaders'', the player does not face direct enemy fire, cannot hide beneath bunkers, and the game does not end when targets hit the ground.<ref name=\"Astrosmash\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:AstrosmashGP.jpg|thumb|left|A laser cannon defends the Earth from a [[meteor shower]].]]\nThere are four types of targets, each of which may move at a range of speeds.  As the game advances, the range of speeds for each type of target increases.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\">''Astrosmash'' Cartridge Instructions, [[Mattel]] Inc. (1981).</ref>\n\n*The bulk of the targets are meteors, which come in two sizes and various colors.  Both sizes fall vertically when entering the screen.  Large meteors may be destroyed with a direct hit, or may split into two smaller meteors, which fall diagonally in opposite directions.  Small meteors are destroyed with a single hit.\n*The player must also shoot spinning bombs, or spinners, which are white, come in two sizes, and spin while falling vertically.  Each spinner emits a loud whistling sound, which gradually lowers in pitch as it approaches the ground.\n*Guided missiles appear occasionally as white dots making a pulsing sound, and may fall diagonally toward the player's initial location, or track the laser cannon as it moves left and right.  If a missile reaches the ground, it may disappear, or it may continue to track left or right, and can only be avoided by entering [[hyperspace]].  The missile may change directions several times before disappearing.\n*UFOs may cross the screen occasionally, beginning at level 4, firing non-guided salvos aimed at the player's laser cannon.\n\nThe player loses a laser cannon each time it is hit by a falling meteor, a guided missile, a non-guided salvo, or by shrapnel from a nearby explosion, and any time a spinner reaches the ground, even if it does not strike the gun.  Each target hit increases the player's score; it decreases by half as much each time a meteor reaches the ground, or a laser cannon is destroyed.  An extra gun is awarded each time the player's peak score increases by 1,000 points.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\nThe game has six levels, each of which features increased speed and scoring.  Each level is represented by a differently-colored background.  Level 1, up to 999 points, is black; level 2, from 1,000 to 4,999 points, is blue; level 3, from 5,000 to 19,999 points, is purple; level 4, from 20,000 to 49,999 points, is turquoise; level 5, from 50,000 to 99,999 points, is gray; and level 6, above 100,000 points, is black again.  Speed continues to increase along with the player's peak score, at 200,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 points.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\nThe player has the option of firing single shots by pressing the fire buttons, or switching to automatic fire at a rate of three shots per second.  The hyperspace option moves the gun to a random location, which may or may not be safer than the starting point.  The game can also be paused at any time.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Intellivision - gi 1326971.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Intellivision Master Component, with ''Astrosmash'' loaded and an ''Astrosmash'' overlay on the left controller.]]\n''Astrosmash'' was originally conceived when a game called ''Meteor!'', an ''Asteroids'' clone, did not fill up the ROM space of an entire cartridge.  The extra space was used to create a variation of the game called ''Avalanche!''  The ''Meteor!'' game was cancelled at the last minute, due to concerns that it was too similar to ''Asteroids''.<ref name=\"GamespyCGIntellivision\">{{cite web | url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=ConsoleMuseum.Detail&id=17&game=9 | title=Mattel Intellivision - 1980-1984 |work=ClassicGaming |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2008-05-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080623232114/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=ConsoleMuseum.Detail&id=17&game=9| archivedate= 23 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"WeissCHVG\">Brett Weiss, ''Classic Home Video Games, 1972\u20131984: A Complete Reference Guide'', McFarland (2007).</ref>  Programmer John Sohl programmed a \"branch\" around the opening-screen menu, leading directly to the ''Avalanche!'' variation, retitled ''Astrosmash''.

The pacing of the early stages in the game was described as \"dull and plodding\", although later in the game the pace becomes much more challenging. The color-coding of stages corresponding with difficulty level and player score was described as \"not a bad idea\", but reviewers noted that \"the greyish blue used for the 1000-to-4999-point range is especially odious\" and described this hue as \"assaulting the [[optic nerve]]s\". Despite the lackluster review, the game was ultimately recommended as \"probably worth a try\" for Intellivision users seeking a new experience because the Intellivision \"traditionally lacks arcade programs\",<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= March 1982 |title= Arcade Alley: Mixed Reviews for Intellivision |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 5|issue= 12|pages= 40\u201342|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|42}} and eight months later in ''Video''{{'}}s 1982 Guide to Electronic Games, ''Astrosmash'' was described as \"probably the most popular action game produced by Mattel for play on the Intellivision\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= November 1982 |title= Video's Guide to Electronic Games |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 8|pages= 47\u201356, 108|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|53}}\n\n==Legacy==\n* ''Astrosmash'' T-shirts are worn by the characters Cisco Ramon, in the first season of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', and Sheldon Cooper, in various episodes of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.<ref>''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', [[Warner Bros.

The game involves using a laser cannon to destroy falling meteors, bombs, and other targets.<ref name=\"Astrosmash\">''Astrosmash'', [[Mattel]] Electronics (1981).</ref>  With more than one million copies sold, ''Astrosmash'' was among the top five best selling Intellivision games.  A free by mail offer, with the purchase of a master component, boosted ''Astrosmash'' sales figures.<ref>http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/people/askhal/askhal.html#C1</ref>  It also benefitted from other promotions in the United States and Canada, including a high score contest where top scorers across the United States were flown to Houston for the finals.<ref>http://intvfunhouse.com/games/mash.php</ref>\n\nA port of ''Astrosmash'' was released for the [[Atari 2600]] under [[Mattel]]'s [[M Network]] label as '''''Astroblast'''''.\n\n==Basic description==\nThe Intellivision game catalog features the exciting caption, \"Spin. Blast. And drop into hyperspace to avoid a killer asteroid shower. Power on. Attack computer engaged. Fire a quick burst at the alien antagonists.  Got 'em!\"<ref>[[Intellivision]] game catalog, [[Mattel]] Inc. (1982).</ref><ref name=\"intellivisionlives.com\">[http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/credits/space.html#astrosmash intellivisionlives.com]</ref>  The actual package gives a more specific description: \"You're in command of a battery of laser guns.  You have unlimited ammo and a lot of targets!  You can roll up big scores by hitting a spectactular barrage of falling rocks, bombs, guided missiles and attacking UFOs...\"<ref name=\"Astrosmash\"/>\n''Astrosmash'' resembles a cross between the early arcade games ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.  The player controls a laser cannon that can scroll left or right along a flat plane in order to target falling objects, such as large or small meteors, large or small spinning bombs, and guided missiles, as well as a UFO that crosses the screen from time to time at higher levels.<ref name=\"WeissCHVG\" />  Low hills and stars are seen in the background.  Unlike in ''Space Invaders'', the player does not face direct enemy fire, cannot hide beneath bunkers, and the game does not end when targets hit the ground.<ref name=\"Astrosmash\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:AstrosmashGP.jpg|thumb|left|A laser cannon defends the Earth from a [[meteor shower]].]]\nThere are four types of targets, each of which may move at a range of speeds.  As the game advances, the range of speeds for each type of target increases.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\">''Astrosmash'' Cartridge Instructions, [[Mattel]] Inc. (1981).</ref>\n\n*The bulk of the targets are meteors, which come in two sizes and various colors.  Both sizes fall vertically when entering the screen.  Large meteors may be destroyed with a direct hit, or may split into two smaller meteors, which fall diagonally in opposite directions.  Small meteors are destroyed with a single hit.\n*The player must also shoot spinning bombs, or spinners, which are white, come in two sizes, and spin while falling vertically.  Each spinner emits a loud whistling sound, which gradually lowers in pitch as it approaches the ground.\n*Guided missiles appear occasionally as white dots making a pulsing sound, and may fall diagonally toward the player's initial location, or track the laser cannon as it moves left and right.  If a missile reaches the ground, it may disappear, or it may continue to track left or right, and can only be avoided by entering [[hyperspace]].  The missile may change directions several times before disappearing.\n*UFOs may cross the screen occasionally, beginning at level 4, firing non-guided salvos aimed at the player's laser cannon.\n\nThe player loses a laser cannon each time it is hit by a falling meteor, a guided missile, a non-guided salvo, or by shrapnel from a nearby explosion, and any time a spinner reaches the ground, even if it does not strike the gun.  Each target hit increases the player's score; it decreases by half as much each time a meteor reaches the ground, or a laser cannon is destroyed.  An extra gun is awarded each time the player's peak score increases by 1,000 points.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\nThe game has six levels, each of which features increased speed and scoring.  Each level is represented by a differently-colored background.  Level 1, up to 999 points, is black; level 2, from 1,000 to 4,999 points, is blue; level 3, from 5,000 to 19,999 points, is purple; level 4, from 20,000 to 49,999 points, is turquoise; level 5, from 50,000 to 99,999 points, is gray; and level 6, above 100,000 points, is black again.  Speed continues to increase along with the player's peak score, at 200,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 points.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\nThe player has the option of firing single shots by pressing the fire buttons, or switching to automatic fire at a rate of three shots per second.  The hyperspace option moves the gun to a random location, which may or may not be safer than the starting point.  The game can also be paused at any time.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Intellivision - gi 1326971.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Intellivision Master Component, with ''Astrosmash'' loaded and an ''Astrosmash'' overlay on the left controller.]]\n''Astrosmash'' was originally conceived when a game called ''Meteor!'', an ''Asteroids'' clone, did not fill up the ROM space of an entire cartridge.  The extra space was used to create a variation of the game called ''Avalanche!''  The ''Meteor!'' game was cancelled at the last minute, due to concerns that it was too similar to ''Asteroids''.<ref name=\"GamespyCGIntellivision\">{{cite web | url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=ConsoleMuseum.Detail&id=17&game=9 | title=Mattel Intellivision - 1980-1984 |work=ClassicGaming |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2008-05-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080623232114/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=ConsoleMuseum.Detail&id=17&game=9| archivedate= 23 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"WeissCHVG\">Brett Weiss, ''Classic Home Video Games, 1972\u20131984: A Complete Reference Guide'', McFarland (2007).</ref>  Programmer John Sohl programmed a \"branch\" around the opening-screen menu, leading directly to the ''Avalanche!'' variation, retitled ''Astrosmash''.  The games were compatible, since they were designed together, and used the same sprites and sound effects.  In rare instances, if the console's reset button is pressed rapidly, an error can occur, resulting in the game starting in the original ''Meteor!'' format.<ref name=\"intellivisionlives.com\"/>\n\nMattel released the game for the [[Atari 2600]].

The pacing of the early stages in the game was described as \"dull and plodding\", although later in the game the pace becomes much more challenging. The color-coding of stages corresponding with difficulty level and player score was described as \"not a bad idea\", but reviewers noted that \"the greyish blue used for the 1000-to-4999-point range is especially odious\" and described this hue as \"assaulting the [[optic nerve]]s\". Despite the lackluster review, the game was ultimately recommended as \"probably worth a try\" for Intellivision users seeking a new experience because the Intellivision \"traditionally lacks arcade programs\",<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= March 1982 |title= Arcade Alley: Mixed Reviews for Intellivision |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 5|issue= 12|pages= 40\u201342|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|42}} and eight months later in ''Video''{{'}}s 1982 Guide to Electronic Games, ''Astrosmash'' was described as \"probably the most popular action game produced by Mattel for play on the Intellivision\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kunkel |first1= Bill |author-link1= Bill Kunkel (gaming)|last2= Katz |first2= Arnie |author-link2= Arnie Katz|date= November 1982 |title= Video's Guide to Electronic Games |journal= [[Video (magazine)|Video]]|publisher= Reese Communications|volume= 6|issue= 8|pages= 47\u201356, 108|issn= 0147-8907}}</ref>{{rp|53}}\n\n==Legacy==\n* ''Astrosmash'' T-shirts are worn by the characters Cisco Ramon, in the first season of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', and Sheldon Cooper, in various episodes of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.<ref>''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', [[Warner Bros.
