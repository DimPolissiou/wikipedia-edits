She debuted as a member of girl group [[Girls' Generation]] (and later its subgroup [[Oh!GG|Girls' Generation-Oh!GG]]) in August 2007, which went on to become one of the best-selling artists in South Korea and one of South Korea's most popular girl groups worldwide. Apart from her group's activities, Sunny has participated in numerous side projects including original soundtracks, television variety shows, musical acting and radio hosting.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1989\u20132007: Early life and career beginnings===\nSunny was born on May 15, 1989, in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], California.<ref name=\"past and present\"/> Her family consists of her parents and two older sisters who are ten and fifteen years older than her. She and her sisters share the same birthday.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:\uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 \uc368\ub2c8\uc5d0\uac8c 5\uc6d415\uc77c\uc774\ub780\u2026\ud655\ub960 13\ub9cc\ubd84\uc758 1|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=003&aid=0003676070|publisher=[[Naver]]|date=February 6, 2011|language=Korean}}</ref> Her father, Lee Soo-young, was also known to be the elder brother of [[SM Entertainment]] founder [[Lee Soo-man]]. While Sunny was still an infant, her family moved to [[Kuwait]], then moved again shortly after to [[South Korea]], during the time of the [[Gulf War]]. As a result of her brief war experience, Sunny grew up being scared of loud noises. She was influenced to become a singer by her father, who was in a college band. In 1998, Sunny joined SM Entertainment and became a trainee for five years. She transferred to Starworld agency, where her father worked as a manager, and was to debut in a duo group called Sugar. The group, however, never came to fruition. In early 2007, singer [[Iconiq|Ayumi Lee]] convinced Sunny to rejoin SM Entertainment. She continued her training there and made her official debut as a member of [[Girls' Generation]] in August 2007.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:Invincible Youth \uccad\ucd98\ubd88\ud328 - Ep.15 : Lettuce patch planting, Mushroom cultivating|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-z2EuzMlaM|website=[[KBS World (TV channel)|KBS World]] on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=March 31, 2016|time=53:08|format=Video upload|date=July 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=200903150049281001 |script-title=ko:\uc368\ub2c8 \"\ud0dc\uc5b4\ub098\uc790\ub9c8\uc790 \uac78\ud504\uc804 \ud53c\ub09c\ubbfc \uc0dd\ud65c\ud588\ub2e4\" \uae5c\uc9dd \uace0\ubc31|publisher=Newsen|date=March 15, 2009|language=korean|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:Talk 1, \ud1a0\ud06c, Lalala 20090625|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82sC6X7vQc|website=[[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=April 3, 2016|time=3:20|format=Video upload|date=June 3, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"past and present\">{{Cite news|title=[Past And Present] Small But Cutest Girl, Sunny |last=Ahn|first=Woorim|work=BNT News|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=July 11, 2015|url=http://www.bntnews.co.uk/app/news.php?nid=14820}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2007113015350222567&nvr=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904123255/http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2007113015350222567&nvr= |script-title=ko:\uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 \uc368\ub2c8 SM \uc774\uc218\ub9cc \uce5c\uc870\uce74 '\uc288\uac00 \ud6c4\uc18d \uadf8\ub8f9 \uba64\ubc84 \ub420 \ubed4'|archivedate=September 4, 2011|website=[[Korea Economic Daily]]|date=November 30, 2007|accessdate=March 31, 2016|language=korean}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=076&aid=0000084242 |script-title=ko:\uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 \uc368\ub2c8, '\uc74c\uc545\uac00 \uc9d1\uc548' \uc774\uc218\ub9cc \uce5c\uc870\uce74 \ud654\uc81c|date=December 3, 2007|publisher=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|language=korean|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=003&aid=0003676070 |script-title=ko:\uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 \uc368\ub2c8\uc5d0\uac8c 5\uc6d415\uc77c\uc774\ub780\u2026\ud655\ub960 13\ub9cc\ubd84\uc758 1|date=February 6, 2011|accessdate=March 31, 2016|publisher=Newsis|language=korean}}</ref> The group gained significant popularity with the release of their hit single \"[[Gee (Girls' Generation song)|Gee]]\" in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|first=Do-yeun|last=Kim|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2011/11/135_97862.html|title=Girls' Generation featured on Yale School of Art website|date=November 2, 2011|accessdate=February 28, 2015|publisher=Korea Times}}</ref>\n\n===2008\u2013present: Solo activities===\n\nAside from Girls' Generation's activities, Sunny has participated in a number of side-projects.

She debuted as a member of girl group [[Girls' Generation]] (and later its subgroup [[Oh!GG|Girls' Generation-Oh!GG]]) in August 2007, which went on to become one of the best-selling artists in South Korea and one of South Korea's most popular girl groups worldwide. Apart from her group's activities, Sunny has participated in numerous side projects including original soundtracks, television variety shows, musical acting and radio hosting.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1989\u20132007: Early life and career beginnings===\nSunny was born on May 15, 1989, in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], California.<ref name=\"past and present\"/> Her family consists of her parents and two older sisters who are ten and fifteen years older than her. She and her sisters share the same birthday.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:\uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 \uc368\ub2c8\uc5d0\uac8c 5\uc6d415\uc77c\uc774\ub780\u2026\ud655\ub960 13\ub9cc\ubd84\uc758 1|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=003&aid=0003676070|publisher=[[Naver]]|date=February 6, 2011|language=Korean}}</ref> Her father, Lee Soo-young, was also known to be the elder brother of [[SM Entertainment]] founder [[Lee Soo-man]]. While Sunny was still an infant, her family moved to [[Kuwait]], then moved again shortly after to [[South Korea]], during the time of the [[Gulf War]]. As a result of her brief war experience, Sunny grew up being scared of loud noises. She was influenced to become a singer by her father, who was in a college band. In 1998, Sunny joined SM Entertainment and became a trainee for five years. She transferred to Starworld agency, where her father worked as a manager, and was to debut in a duo group called Sugar. The group, however, never came to fruition. In early 2007, singer [[Iconiq|Ayumi Lee]] convinced Sunny to rejoin SM Entertainment.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''[[Hardal]]'' (\u1e24aredi Le'umi) community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', referring to the knitted or crocheted [[kippot|skullcaps]] (Hebrew ''kippa'', pl. ''kippot'') worn by many of the men. (However, there are also men who wear other types of headcoverings, such as ''kippot'' in black velvet.) \nTheir dress, otherwise, is largely the same as for secular Israelis.\nWomen usually wear skirts, and often cover their hair.\nSee under [[Tzniut]]: [[Tzniut#Dress|#Dress]] and [[Tzniut#Hair covering|#Hair covering]].\n\nIn the ''Hardal'' community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat.  \nThe Kippot, also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for [[tzitzit]] to be worn visibly, as is the [[Haredi]] practice; ''[[Payot]]'' (sidelocks) are common, and an (untrimmed) beard.\nWomen invariably cover their hair - usually with a [[snood]], or a ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for \"kerchief\") - and often wear sandals.\n\nAt prayer, members of the community use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''[[Hardal]]'' (\u1e24aredi Le'umi) community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', referring to the knitted or crocheted [[kippot|skullcaps]] (Hebrew ''kippa'', pl. ''kippot'') worn by many of the men. (However, there are also men who wear other types of headcoverings, such as ''kippot'' in black velvet.) \nTheir dress, otherwise, is largely the same as for secular Israelis.\nWomen usually wear skirts, and often cover their hair.\nSee under [[Tzniut]]: [[Tzniut#Dress|#Dress]] and [[Tzniut#Hair covering|#Hair covering]].\n\nIn the ''Hardal'' community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat.  \nThe Kippot, also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for [[tzitzit]] to be worn visibly, as is the [[Haredi]] practice; ''[[Payot]]'' (sidelocks) are common, and an (untrimmed) beard.\nWomen invariably cover their hair - usually with a [[snood]], or a ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for \"kerchief\") - and often wear sandals.\n\nAt prayer, members of the community use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF.

Keene|James R. Keene's]] [[Castleton Farm]]. Keene, whose health was failing (he died in 1913), sold all his holdings in 1912 to [[Edward R. Bradley|Colonel Edward R. Bradley's]] [[Idle Hour Stock Farm]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Some confusion occurred over this sale, and Bradley resold most of the lot, but one of those he kept was a very dark brown yearling he named Black Toney. The price tag for the son of future [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Peter Pan I|Peter Pan]], whose own sire was another future Hall of Famer, [[Commando (horse)|Commando]], by the great [[Domino (horse)|Domino]], was $1,600. Black Toney's dam was Belgravia, the best daughter of future Hall of Famer [[Ben Brush (horse)|Ben Brush]]. This meant that the almost black yearling with no white markings and a fine head and body was a member of the last crop bred by Keene from his famous Domino/Ben Brush cross.\n\n==Racing career==\nBlack Toney was a good [[racehorse]] but far from a great one. He raced for four years, coming in the money in 31 of his 40 starts.\n\n==Stud record==\nBlack Toney became a very successful breeding stallion, siring many of the horses for which the Idle Hour Stock Farm became famous. The names of Bradley\u2019s horses all began with a \"B,\" a quirk of Bradley's (perhaps because his own name began with a B, or perhaps because of Black Toney.)\n\nBradley bred him sparingly and yet, even from 21 small crops and a total of 221 foals, the quality of his get was very high. Overall, he sired 40 stakes winners, which amounts to 18 percent of his foals. Black Toney was 10 times among the top 20 American sires by earnings.

Keene|James R. Keene's]] [[Castleton Farm]]. Keene, whose health was failing (he died in 1913), sold all his holdings in 1912 to [[Edward R. Bradley|Colonel Edward R. Bradley's]] [[Idle Hour Stock Farm]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Some confusion occurred over this sale, and Bradley resold most of the lot, but one of those he kept was a very dark brown yearling he named Black Toney. The price tag for the son of future [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Peter Pan I|Peter Pan]], whose own sire was another future Hall of Famer, [[Commando (horse)|Commando]], by the great [[Domino (horse)|Domino]], was $1,600. Black Toney's dam was Belgravia, the best daughter of future Hall of Famer [[Ben Brush (horse)|Ben Brush]]. This meant that the almost black yearling with no white markings and a fine head and body was a member of the last crop bred by Keene from his famous Domino/Ben Brush cross.\n\n==Racing career==\nBlack Toney was a good [[racehorse]] but far from a great one. He raced for four years, coming in the money in 31 of his 40 starts.\n\n==Stud record==\nBlack Toney became a very successful breeding stallion, siring many of the horses for which the Idle Hour Stock Farm became famous. The names of Bradley\u2019s horses all began with a \"B,\" a quirk of Bradley's (perhaps because his own name began with a B, or perhaps because of Black Toney.)\n\nBradley bred him sparingly and yet, even from 21 small crops and a total of 221 foals, the quality of his get was very high. Overall, he sired 40 stakes winners, which amounts to 18 percent of his foals. Black Toney was 10 times among the top 20 American sires by earnings. He was second on the general sire list in 1933 and fifth in 1939.\n\nBlack Toney spent his whole stud career at Idle Hour, producing many fine broodmares as well as winners. He died there on September 19, 1938, at the age of 27 of an apparent heart attack.  Colonel Bradley commissioned a [[bronze]] statue that he placed over his greatest stallion's grave.

He was the son of the Hashimite chief, [[Abd al-Muttalib]]. He was a brother of [[Muhammad]]'s father, [[Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Abdullah]], who had died before Muhammad's birth. After the death of Muhammad's mother [[Aminah bint Wahab]], Muhammad as a child was taken into the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib. When Muhammad reached eight years of age, Abd al-Muttalib died. One of Muhammad's uncles was to take him in. The oldest, Al-Harith was not wealthy enough to take him in.

After Muhammad began preaching the message of [[Islam]], members of the other [[Quraysh]]ite clans increasingly came to feel threatened by Mu\u1e25ammad. In attempts to quiet him, they pressured Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101lib to silence his nephew or control him. Despite these pressures, Abu Talib maintained his support of Mu\u1e25ammad, defending him from the other leaders of the Quraysh. Leaders of the Quraysh directly confronted Abu Talib several times. Abu Talib brushed them off and continued to support Muhammad even when it put a rift between him and the Quraysh. In one account, the Quraysh even threatened to fight the Banu Hashim over this conflict.<ref name=\"Rubin 1995 150\">{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Uri|title=The Eye of the Beholder|year=1995|publisher=Darwin Press, Inc.|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=150}}</ref> In a particular narration of one such confrontation, Abu Talib summoned Muhammad to speak with the Quraysh.

They told Abu Talib that if he let them get hold of Muhammad, then he could adopt 'Umarah ibn al Walid ibn al Mughirah, the most handsome youth in Quraysh.<ref name=\"Rubin 1995 150\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=The History of al-Tabari|year=1985|publisher=State University Press|location=New York|page=97}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Haykal|first=Muhammad Husayn|title=The Life of Muhammad|year=1976|publisher=North American Trust Publications|page=88}}</ref> When this also failed, the Quraysh elicited the support of other tribes to boycott trading with or marrying members of the Banu Hashim lineage. This boycott started seven years after Muhammad first received revelation and lasted for three years.<ref name=\"Encyclopaedia of Islam\" /> The goal was to put pressure on the Hashimites and even starve them into submission.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1993 129\">{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=Muhammad: A Biography of the Prophet|year=1993|publisher=Harper Collins|location=San Francisco|page=129}}</ref> For the sake of security, many members of the Banu Hashim moved near to Abu Talib (Encyclopedia of Islam), and the place became like a [[ghetto]].<ref name=\"Armstrong 1993 129\"/> This didn't cause undue hardship<ref>{{cite book|title=The History of al-Tabari|year=1985|publisher=State University Press|location=New York|page=xliv}}</ref> because many had family members in other tribes that would smuggle goods to them.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1993 129\"/> Abu Talib's brother, [[Abu Lahab]], sided with the Quraysh on this issue; he moved to a house in the district of Abd Shams to demonstrate support for the Quraysh.<ref name=\"Armstrong 1993 129\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Lings|first=Martin|title=Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources|year=2006|publisher=Inner Traditions|location=Rochester, Vermont|page=90}}</ref> He thought Muhammad was either mad or an impostor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lings|first=Martin|title=Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources|year=2006|publisher=Inner Traditions|location=Rochester, Vermont|page=52}}</ref>\n\nProtecting Muhammad put considerable pressure on Abu Talib and the Banu Hashim. In one instance Abu Talib exclaimed to Muhammad, \"Save me and yourself, and do not put a greater burden on me than I cannot bear.\" Muhammad responded, \"Oh uncle!

BBC Four began originally as a late schedule to BBC Two, before it received its own channel, along with [[BBC Three]]. Curiously, BBC Four had to launch before BBC Three as a result of the government delaying approval plans. The channel replaced [[BBC Knowledge]], an educational and cultural channel which had undergone many changes throughout its lifetime; in its final format it carried a schedule of documentaries and art programming, essentially a test of the new BBC Four schedule. BBC Four would rebrand this channel, and bring it into line with the well recognised BBC One and Two brands at the same time. Planning for the new channel, along with the new [[BBC Three]], had been in progress since October 2000; however, the incumbent government delayed approving the new BBC digital plans. The BBC Four plans were approved earlier, and as a result launched before BBC Three.\n\nBBC Four was different from the old BBC Knowledge: the channel would be more heavily promoted with more new and original programming and the channel would not be broadcast 24 hours a day. This was because on the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial]] platform, BBC Four is broadcast in a [[statistical time division multiplexing|statistically multiplexed]] stream in Multiplex B that timeshares with the [[CBeebies]] channel (which is on air from 06:00 until 19:00). As a result, BBC Four broadcasts from 19:00 to around 03:35 each night, with an hour's down-time and promotions for CBeebies before the start of that channel's schedule.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, BBC Four was added to the Sky [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] in the Republic of Ireland on channel 230. It later moved to EPG 211 to free up space for new channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theairwaves.net/channelnews/4399-ireland-extra-bbc-channels-being-added-to-sky-epg |title=Ireland: Extra BBC channels being added to Sky EPG |publisher=The Airwaves |date=2 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507070203/http://www.theairwaves.net/channelnews/4399-ireland-extra-bbc-channels-being-added-to-sky-epg |archivedate=7 May 2011 }}</ref> It later moved to channel 143 on 1 May 2018 to sit beside BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Two Northern Ireland there, and the 200s being used for +1 channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.a516digital.com/2018/05/sky-completes-biggest-channel-reshuffle.html |title=Sky completes biggest channel reshuffle - a516digital |publisher=a516digital |date=1 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 August 2018, BBC Four announced BBC 4.1, a special two nights of programming which would revolve around [[artifical intelligence]] (AI) selecting the programmes broadcast on the channel, based on \"what BBC Four audiences might like, based on the channel\u2019s previous schedules and programme attributes.\" It would then \"[rank] programmes it thought were most relevant [to what BBC Four viewers would like].\"<ref name=\"BBCMediaCentre\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200221125701/https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/bbc-four-ai|title=BBC Four announces experimental AI and archive programming|last=|first=|date=17 August 2018|website=BBC Media Centre|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2018/bbc-four-ai|archive-date=21 February 2020|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> The programming was aired on the nights of 4 and 5 September 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200423105339/https://inews.co.uk/news/ai-to-create-channel-schedule-and-new-programmes-in-bbc-technology-trial-508623|title=AI to create BBC channel schedule and new programmes in technology trial|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|date=17 August 2018|website=i News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://inews.co.uk/news/ai-to-create-channel-schedule-and-new-programmes-in-bbc-technology-trial-508623|archive-date=23 April 2020|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> This included a few special programmes about AI,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200423104927/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06jt9ng|title=AI TV on BBC 4.1|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06jt9ng|archive-date=23 April 2020|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> such as \"Made by Machine: When AI Met The Archive\", which documented how the AI works,<ref name=\"BBCMediaCentre\" /> and \"The Joy of AI\", where \"the emergence of machine learning\" is discussed, as well as \"why [AI] shouldn't spook us\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20190709132807/https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/tech/bbc-4-turns-to-ai-to-create-two-nights-of-programming-about-ai/5131773.article|title=BBC 4 turns to AI to create two nights of programming about AI|last=Bickerton|first=Jake|date=20 August 2018|website=Broadcast|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/tech/bbc-4-turns-to-ai-to-create-two-nights-of-programming-about-ai/5131773.article|archive-date=9 July 2018|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20191026222356/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bhwhw1|title=BBC Four {{en dash}} The Joy of AI|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bhwhw1|archive-date=26 October 2019|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 February 2019, Virgin Media stopped providing BBC Four in standard definition.<ref>[https://www.a516digital.com/2019/02/virgin-media-to-move-bbc-hd-channels-to.html Virgin Media to move BBC HD channels to prime EPG slots]</ref>\n\nIn Autumn 2019, BBC Four moved from channel 75 in Scotland, up the EPG in that region to channel 68.<ref>https://www.rxtvlog.com/2019/10/why-bbc-four-is-moving-channels-again.html</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\nThe channel direction is determined by the channel's remit, set by royal charter and the corporation's governing body (the [[BBC Board]]), and by the channel controller.

As a result, no two idents were ever the same. The first continuity announcer was [[Zeb Soanes]].\n\nWhen the channel first started airing, it used the slogan \"Everybody Needs A Place To Think\", but the BBC stopped using this several months after the launch. However the BBC Four logo and above slogan can be found, engraved on benches along the [[South Bank]] in London, between the London Eye and [[Waterloo Bridge]].\n\nOn 10 September 2005, the channel began showing new idents comprising a central BBC Four logo surrounded by four quadrants which show different stages of the same footage thus making for a sort of optical illusion; for example, a swimming pool where a person on an inflatable ring appears in the bottom-left corner, though ripples don't enter the remaining quarters. Although the image appears as one at the start of the ident, by the end it is clearly four separate images. \n\nIn March 2019, BBC Four added several new idents inspired by \"[[oddly satisfying videos]]\" in tandem with the quadrants theme, originally premiering for a programme season honouring the 30th anniversary of the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|BBC}}\n{{Wikipedia books|BBC Channels (UK)}}\n*[[List of documentary channels]]\n*[[BBC Four World Cinema Awards|BBC Four World Cinema Award]]\n*[[List of television stations in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{bbc.co.uk|id=bbcfour|title=BBC Four}}\n\n{{BBC Television}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|television}}\n{{Freeview}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bbc Four}}\n[[Category:2002 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:BBC television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the BBC radio stations|BBC Radio 4|BBC Radio 4 Extra}}\n{{EngvarB|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2019}}\n{{Infobox TV channel\n| name  = BBC Four\n| logofile   = BBC Four.svg\n| logosize   = 200px\n| launch  = {{start date and age|df=yes|2002|3|2}}\n| picture format  = [[1080i]] [[HDTV]]<br />{{small|(downscaled to [[16:9]] [[576i]] for the [[SDTV]] feed)}}\n| share  = 1.21%\n| share as of  = {{Start date|df=yes|2018|6}}\n| share source  = [http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/monthly-viewing-summary?_s=4 BARB]\n| owner  = [[BBC]]\n| country  = United Kingdom\n| replaced names  = [[BBC Knowledge]]\n| web  = {{URL|https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour|BBC Four}}\n| sister names  = [[BBC One]]<br>[[BBC Two]]<br>[[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]]<br>[[BBC Parliament]]<br>[[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]]<br>[[CBeebies]]\n| terr serv 1  = [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]\n| terr chan 1  = Channel 9 (Eng/Wal/NI)<br>Channel 68 (Scot)<br>Channel 106 (HD)\n| sat serv 1  = [[Freesat]]\n| sat chan 1  = Channel 107 (SD/HD)<br>Channel 173 (SD)\n| sat serv 2  = [[Sky UK|Sky]]\n| sat chan 2  = Channel 116 (SD/HD)<br>Channel 815 (SD)\n| sat serv 3  = [[Sky Ireland|Sky]] <small>(Ireland)</small>\n| sat chan 3  = Channel 143 (SD/HD)<br>Channel 833 (SD)\n| sat serv 4  = [[Astra 2E]] <small>([[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0E]])</small>\n| sat chan 4  = 10773 H 22000 5/6\n| sat serv 5  = [[Astra 2G]] <small>([[Astra 28.2\u00b0E|28.2\u00b0E]])</small>\n| sat chan 5  = 11023 H 23000 3/4 (HD)\n| cable serv 1  = [[Virgin Media]]\n| cable chan 1  = Channel 107 (HD)\n| cable serv 2  = [[Virgin Media Ireland|Virgin Media]] <small>(Ireland)</small>\n| cable chan 2  = Channel 117\n| cable serv 3  = [[WightFibre]]\n| cable chan 3  = Channel 18\n| cable serv 4  = Kabeltex <small>(Netherlands)</small>\n| cable chan 4  = Channel 164\n| cable serv 5  = [[UPC Switzerland]] <small>(Switzerland)</small>\n| cable chan 5  = Channel 204 (HD)\n| adsl serv 1  = [[BT TV]]\n| adsl chan 1  = Channel 106 (HD)\n| adsl serv 2  = [[Swisscom]]TV <br><small>(Switzerland)</small>\n| adsl chan 2  = Channel arbitrary\n| iptv chan 4  = Channel 207<br />Channel 211 (HD)\n| iptv serv 4  = [[Eir (telecommunications)|Eir Vision]]\n| adsl serv 3  = [[KPN]] <small>(Netherlands)</small>\n| adsl chan 3  = Channel arbitrary\n| online serv 1  = [[BBC iPlayer]]\n| online chan 1  = [https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/live/bbcfour Watch live] (UK only)\n| online serv 2  = [[TVPlayer]]\n| online chan 2  = [http://www.tvplayer.com/watch/bbcfour Watch live] (UK only)\n| online serv 3  = Horizon Go\n| online chan 3  = [https://www.horizon.tv/en_ie/live-channels/live-channel.html/28866599416/BBC-FOUR.html Watch live] (Ireland only)<br>[https://www.horizon.tv/de_ch/live-sender/live-channel.html/27920935356/BBC-Four_Cbeebies.html Watch live] (Switzerland only)\n}}\n\n'''BBC Four''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[free-to-air]] [[television channel]] owned and operated by the [[BBC]].

BBC Four began originally as a late schedule to BBC Two, before it received its own channel, along with [[BBC Three]]. Curiously, BBC Four had to launch before BBC Three as a result of the government delaying approval plans. The channel replaced [[BBC Knowledge]], an educational and cultural channel which had undergone many changes throughout its lifetime; in its final format it carried a schedule of documentaries and art programming, essentially a test of the new BBC Four schedule. BBC Four would rebrand this channel, and bring it into line with the well recognised BBC One and Two brands at the same time. Planning for the new channel, along with the new [[BBC Three]], had been in progress since October 2000; however, the incumbent government delayed approving the new BBC digital plans. The BBC Four plans were approved earlier, and as a result launched before BBC Three.\n\nBBC Four was different from the old BBC Knowledge: the channel would be more heavily promoted with more new and original programming and the channel would not be broadcast 24 hours a day. This was because on the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial]] platform, BBC Four is broadcast in a [[statistical time division multiplexing|statistically multiplexed]] stream in Multiplex B that timeshares with the [[CBeebies]] channel (which is on air from 06:00 until 19:00). As a result, BBC Four broadcasts from 19:00 to around 03:35 each night, with an hour's down-time and promotions for CBeebies before the start of that channel's schedule.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, BBC Four was added to the Sky [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] in the Republic of Ireland on channel 230.

As a result, no two idents were ever the same. The first continuity announcer was [[Zeb Soanes]].\n\nWhen the channel first started airing, it used the slogan \"Everybody Needs A Place To Think\", but the BBC stopped using this several months after the launch. However the BBC Four logo and above slogan can be found, engraved on benches along the [[South Bank]] in London, between the London Eye and [[Waterloo Bridge]].\n\nOn 10 September 2005, the channel began showing new idents comprising a central BBC Four logo surrounded by four quadrants which show different stages of the same footage thus making for a sort of optical illusion; for example, a swimming pool where a person on an inflatable ring appears in the bottom-left corner, though ripples don't enter the remaining quarters. Although the image appears as one at the start of the ident, by the end it is clearly four separate images. \n\nIn March 2019, BBC Four added several new idents inspired by \"[[oddly satisfying videos]]\" in tandem with the quadrants theme, originally premiering for a programme season honouring the 30th anniversary of the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|BBC}}\n{{Wikipedia books|BBC Channels (UK)}}\n\n*[[List of documentary channels]]\n*[[BBC Four World Cinema Awards|BBC Four World Cinema Award]]\n*[[List of television stations in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{bbc.co.uk|id=bbcfour|title=BBC Four}}\n\n{{BBC Television}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|television}}\n{{Freeview}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bbc Four}}\n[[Category:2002 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:BBC television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Thatoneweirdwikier", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:rm space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Four"}

Over the next five decades, TNT developed an enviable global reputation, particularly in contract logistics.\n\nOn the opposite side of the world, EGL was born in Houston, Texas, USA in 1984.  Within just a decade and a half, it had become a global force in freight management - with operations in more than 100 countries.\n\nBy 1996, TNT had been acquired by the Dutch postal and telecommunications company KPN. And two years later, it was split into three divisions - Logistics, Express and Post.\n\nIn the autumn of 2006, TNT Logistics was sold to affiliates of New York, USA - headquartered venture capitalists Apollo Management LP, who renamed the company CEVA Logistics. Six months later, EGL left the NASDAQ where it had been traded, and was also bought by Apollo and merged into CEVA Logistics.\nIn May 2018, CEVA Logistics was listed on SIX Swiss Exchange under ticker symbol CEVA.\n\nIn April 2019, CEVA Logistics was acquired by CMA CGM, a leading worldwide shipping group, to form a strategic partnership with the aim to offer end-to-end logistics solutions to each partner\u2019s customers.  At the same time, CMA CGM Freight Management (FM) activities, including CMA CGM Logistics (CC Log), LCL Logistix, ANL Log, and USL cargo services came under the umbrella of CEVA Logistics as of 1 October, 2019. This acquisition strengthened CEVA Logistics\u2019 footprint in Ocean Freight Management with 170,000 additional controlled TEUs and enabled expansion of CEVA Logistics product offering in the field of Sea FCL (Full Container Load) and LCL (Less than Container Load), Customs Clearance, carrier haulage and Airfreight Forwarding.\n\nToday, CEVA Logistics is a full service transportation and logistics company with freight management and contract logistics operations spanning 1,000 locations in 160 countries. Many of the world\u2019s best-known brands count on CEVA Logistics to serve their markets. \n\nIn January 2020, Mathieu Friedberg was announced as the CEO of CEVA Logistics.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Logistics companies of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Companies with year of establishment missing]]\n\n\n{{Netherlands-company-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:CEVA Logo Sign.jpg|alt=CEVA Logistics logo on a building|thumb|266x266px]]\n'''CEVA Logistics''' is a global [[logistics]] and [[supply chain]] company in both freight management and contract logistics with US$7 billion in revenues.

The song is about how money interferes with personal relationships.\n\n==The Brains recordings==\nThe original single was released in 1978 by the Brains as a 45 rpm single on Gray Matter Records. The B side of the single was a song called \"Quick with Your Lip\". The initial underground success of the song led to the Brains being signed by [[Mercury Records]]. They rerecorded the song under the guidance of producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] for their 1980 debut album, ''The Brains''. Critic [[Greil Marcus]], listing it at number 10 of his Real-Life Rock Top Ten 1979, said, \"Singer Tom Gray told his story in a strangled voice, as if he were trying to explain, but instead he laid a curse.

He was ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of [[Gau Franconia]] and rose to the rank of ''[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' in the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA).\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born the fifth child of a [[Heliography|heliographer]], also named Karl Holz. He finished ''[[Volksschule]]'' and an [[apprenticeship]] as a [[sales]]man, working thereafter as a clerk.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Holz served in a number of [[Prussian Army|Prussian]] units between 1915 and 1918: Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment 16, Infanterie-Regiment 144, Infanterie-Regiment 79, and J\u00e4ger-Regiment 2 on the Western Front. He sustained a number of wounds. After the war ended, he returned in September 1919 and took a job as an official in Nuremberg. In 1920 he joined the German-Socialist Party (''Deutschsozialistische Partei''). In 1921 its chairman, [[Julius Streicher]] joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), bringing with him enough members of the German-Socialist Party to almost double the size of the NSDAP overnight.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=188}}{{sfn|Rees|2017|p=23}} Holz officially joined the Nazi Party on 11 November 1922 and his membership number was 77. Holz joined the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA).\n\nQuite early on, Holz established a close relationship with Streicher. In 1924, Holz was elected to Nuremberg City Council, which he quit the following year.

In 1933 he was given the position of ministerial adviser.\n\nAs of 1 January 1934, Holz operated as Streicher's representative in his capacity as ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of Franconia.

He was ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of [[Gau Franconia]] and rose to the rank of ''[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' in the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA).\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born the fifth child of a [[Heliography|heliographer]], also named Karl Holz. He finished ''[[Volksschule]]'' and an [[apprenticeship]] as a [[sales]]man, working thereafter as a clerk.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Holz served in a number of [[Prussian Army|prussian]] units between 1915 and 1918: Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment 16, Infanterie-Regiment 144, Infanterie-Regiment 79, and J\u00e4ger-Regiment 2 on the Western Front. He sustained a number of wounds. After the war ended, he returned in September 1919 and took a job as an official in Nuremberg. In 1920 he joined the German-Socialist Party (''Deutschsozialistische Partei''). In 1921 its chairman, [[Julius Streicher]] joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), bringing with him enough members of the German-Socialist Party to almost double the size of the NSDAP overnight.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=188}}{{sfn|Rees|2017|p=23}} Holz officially joined the Nazi Party on 11 November 1922 and his membership number was 77. Holz joined the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA).\n\nQuite early on, Holz established a close relationship with Streicher. In 1924, Holz was elected to Nuremberg City Council, which he quit the following year. Between 1927 and 1933, he held the post of [[editing|editor]]-in-chief of ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'', Streicher's [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] weekly [[newspaper]]. In 1933 he was given the position of ministerial adviser.\n\nAs of 1 January 1934, Holz operated as Streicher's representative in his capacity as ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of Franconia. In July 1934, Holz was appointed NSDAP ''Kreis'' leader of Nuremberg-town, and in November was promoted to the rank of SA-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]''.\n\nIn 1940, in connection with the Streicher irregularities involving the [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] of [[Jew]]ish assets, Holz was temporarily stripped of all his offices.
