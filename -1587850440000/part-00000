Lead vocals by [[Barry Gibb]] on the verses and [[Robin Gibb]] on the chorus.\n\n==Writing and recording==\n[[Robin Gibb]] recalls in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' on 1 November 2009:\n\n<blockquote>We wrote this is at our manager [[Robert Stigwood]]'s house in [[Beverly Hills]]. He was a great visionary and championed our beliefs and chemistry as brothers. Lyrically, this song chronicles the wishes of a man who longs to be noticed by a broken-hearted girl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=17529 |title=Bee Gees - \"Run to Me\" |publisher=Songfacts |accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobin also recalls, \"We recorded 'Run to Me' and [[Andy Williams]] cut it on his LP.

It was very much in the mold of the last two successful singles, \"[[Don't Wanna Live Inside Myself]]\" and \"[[My World (Bee Gees song)|My World]]\". The song has a straight verse-chorus number with vocal by both Barry and Robin.
