During [[World War II]], the 327th was a [[Military glider|glider-borne]] regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. It fought during [[World War I]] as part of the [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd Division]]. It has also been deployed in the [[Vietnam War]], [[Gulf War]], and most recently to [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]].  The song \"Glider Rider\" describes (humorously) some of the slights that glider-borne troops felt they received from the Army during World War II; though the regiment's public fame rose with the 1949 movie ''[[Battleground (film)|Battleground]]'' about the [[Siege of Bastogne]] in late 1944.\n\n== World War I ==\n[[File:Waco CG-4A USAF.JPG|thumb| ]]\n[[File:Jeep being loaded into waco glider.jpg|thumb|Jeep loading onto Waco glider.]]\nIn [[World War I|WWI]] the 327th Infantry Regiment served as part of the 164th Infantry Brigade in the [[82nd Infantry Division]].<ref>\"82nd Division Composition (World War I)\".

Elements of the 327th Infantry moved up to the front lines at the end of that summer. On 9 June 1918, Cpt Jewett Williams became the first man in the regiment killed in combat.<ref>''The 327th Under Fire: History of the 327th infantry Regiment, 82nd division in the Great War''  by George McIntosh Sparks, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, 1920 Page 12</ref>\n\nThe 82nd Infantry Division's first exposure to combat, as a division, occurred on 25 June when it was assigned to the Lagney sector.  While this was earmarked as a quiet sector, the 327th actively patrolled and executed raids for several weeks.<ref>''The 327th Under Fire: History of the 327th infantry Regiment, 82nd division in the Great War'' by George McIntosh Sparks, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, 1920 Page 16</ref>\n\n=== Saint-Mihiel ===\n\nTHE 82nd Division was occupying the Marbache sector in the Moselle Valley with orders to protect the flank of attacking U.S. forces. But as the Germans were reinforcing this sector in anticipation of a coming Allied offensive, the Division ordered a series of raids to mislead the Germans on the exact location of attacking units.  The 327th Infantry, conducted a raid on a German strongpoint known as the Bel Air Farm on 13 September with 2 companies, E and K, as the assault force.  After initial success the assault group was pushed back to the original U.S. lines.  E & K companies suffered 6 dead, 11 severely wounded, 69 wounded and 10 missing.<ref>''Official History of the 82nd Division: American Expeditionary Force, 1917\u20131919'', Bobbs-Merill, Indianapolis, Ind., 1920) page 31</ref>  The 82nd continued operations in [[Saint-Mihiel]] until, on 17 September, it was relieved by troops of the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Infantry Division]] just west of the Moselle River.  The 82nd Division went into reserve to prepare for the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], but the 327th was attached to the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Division]] and remained on the front until early October.\n\n=== Meuse-Argonne ===\n\nThe 82nd Division was given a new axis of advance early in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]] to attack and fill a gap to the left flank of the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Division]] which was advancing to capture Hill 223 as part of operations to rescue the 77th Infantry Division's [[Lost Battalion (World War I)|Lost Battalion]].  On the night of 6/7 October 1918, the regiment relieved troops on the left of the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Division]] on the Aire River. On 7 October, it attacked toward the Argonne Forest, making some progress toward Cornay. On 8 October rescuers reached the Lost Battalion.  The next day the 327th continued to attack towards the high ground northwest of Ch\u00e2tel-Ch\u00e9h\u00e9ry.  The 327th then continued to fight in the Ardennes region, capturing Conray and Hill 180.  On 4 November the regiment was pulled from the line and moved into training area; it was there when it learned of the 11 November Armistice.<ref>''Official History of the 82nd Division: American Expeditionary Force, 1917\u20131919'', Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis, IN, 1920</ref>\n\nThe 327th Infantry suffered 331 killed in action, 73 died of wounds and 1959 wounded in the First World War.<ref>[https://history.army.mil/documents/wwi/82div/82div.htm#appendix \"82nd Division: Summary of Operations by the American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Printing Office 1944\"].

All equipment and personnel assigned to the regiment were designed to be carried in the [[Waco CG-4A]] glider.  Although a glider infantry regiment, the majority of the unit landed by sea on Utah Beach in the afternoon of 7 June 1944, because of a shortage of planes to tow its gliders. Some elements did reach shore on [[D-Day]], 6 June, but because of rough seas, beach traffic, and the fact that the paratroopers of the 101st had already achieved many of their objectives, the landing was delayed.  The 327th suffered a few casualties going ashore from enemy fire and were strafed by enemy aircraft.  Near Ste. Come DuMont (southeast of the village), the 327th was camped right next to German paratroopers, separated by thick hedgerows.  German-speaking soldiers in the 327th engaged in taunting the enemy.  The 327th took several casualties by enemy mortars. By 8 June, the 327th had entered the front line, largely in reserve of the 506th until crossing the Douve River near Carentan.  First and Second Battalions guarded Utah Beachhead's left flank northeast of Carentan. Company C was hit hard by friendly fire mortars while crossing the Douve. Official findings blamed enemy mines. Company B also suffered casualties in the incident.\n\nThe 327th suffered heavy casualties while advancing on Carentan via what is now the city Marina from a northeast direction and other casualties approaching Carentan from the east.  G Company led the attack on the west bank of the marina canal.  A Company of the attached 401st Glider Infantry Regiment was on the east bank of the canal.  Concealed German machine guns and mortars inflicted the most casualties.  Chaplain Gordon Cosby earned a Silver Star for bravery in the face of the enemy for assisting wounded glider men in front of heavily armed German soldiers.  The 327th played a pivotal role with the 501st and 506th of the 101st in taking Carentan.  The 327th marched through the town and East to be possibly the first unit of the Utah Beachhead to link up with the Omaha Beachhead around the four-villages area of le Fourchette, le Mesnil, le Rocher and Cotz.  It was then directed South between the bulk of the 101st and the 75th Infantry Division of the Omaha Beachhead.\n\nThe unit was commanded by Col. George S. Wear through 10 June, when command was turned over to Col. Joseph H. Harper.  Although not official, the men of the 327th understood that Wear was replaced because of friendly-fire artillery casualties while crossing the Douve River.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  Officially, enemy mortars were blamed.\n\n=== Holland ===\nThe regiment played a pivotal role in [[Operation Market Garden]] battle near [[Best, Netherlands|Best]], in the Netherlands, encircling a large German force which had been pressured from the west by the tank-supported 502nd of the 101st.  Sgt. Manuel Hidalgo and Lt. Hibbard of G Company risked their lives in a humanitarian effort to get the enemy to surrender before being annihilated by the 327th.  In the Market Garden operations, some companies in the 327th suffered two-thirds casualty rates before arriving at Opheusden. 2nd Battalion, especially Company G, suffered heavy casualties from a brutal shelling in the churchyard at [[Veghel]].  The large artillery shells were launched from the [[Erp, Netherlands|Erp]] vicinity.  Dutch collaborators aided German scouts and were executed by the Dutch underground after the shelling.\n\nAt [[Opheusden]], the 327th withstood repeated assaults by the enemy and heavy artillery barrages.  In ''Rendezvous with Destiny'', Rapport and Arthur cite British officers that indicated that the barrage suffered by the 327 was as intense as anything they had seen, and rivaled what the British pummeled the Germans with at El Alamein in North Africa. The fighting along the west and northwest perimeter in the Ophuesden (the Island) area was as intense as any fighting in the area.  E Company engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy near the railroad track switch house south of Opheusden. The enemy repeatedly hurled their units unsuccessfully at the glider men and suffered high casualties.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n=== Bastogne ===\nAt [[Bastogne]], Belgium, the 327 held half of the perimeter (including the 401, which was acting as the Regiment's 3rd Battalion and later officially became a part of the 327).  Numerous intense fights erupted along the 327 sector including two brutal fights at Marvie and more to the west in the 401 section. The Germans attacking were of the Volksgrenadiers and the elite tank-based Panzer Lehr. At Marvie the 327 was outnumbered by 15 to 1.  Facing only two US companies, G Company, supported by several tanks from the 10th Armored Division and E Company in reserve, the German commander took his whole division further west.  At Marvie, the Germans lost six tanks and several half tracks.  One tank did break into Marvie, but was destroyed trying to make a run towards Bastogne.  Several days later, during the night of 23 December, the enemy attacked in force with tanks.  The road through Marvie was blocked when G Company mistook a US tank destroyer for a German tank and destroyed it on the village bridge.  The Germans overran Hill 500 just to the west of Marvie and broke through the gap between F and G Company.  The enemy then put rear pressure on the F Company Command Post.  A platoon sized paratrooper element came to support F Company.  The German forces managed to place tanks behind US lines between Marvie and Bastogne.  The glider men of Company G and Company F were pushed back from 500 to 1,000 yards during the intense fighting, but did not break. Unable to make quick progress, the Germans pressed the attack until morning, but withdrew when the German Command Center was destroyed by US artillery.  Again, the 327 was badly outnumbered by the enemy.\n\nAfter the break through by General Patton's tanks, the 327th proceeded to the north sector of the Bastogne theater of operations. There, 2nd Battalion was involved in clearing Champs after a German armored element broke through paratrooper lines.  Companies A and C suffered intense casualties and were consolidated into one company call ACE.  Later, the 327 made an open field maneuver against armored enemy troops east of Foy, which helped secure that village.  The ferocity and speed of the open-field attack surprised the Germans and the paratrooper regiments on the flanks of the attack.  German forces attacked the flank and surrounded ACE Company in Bois Jacques.  After that, the enemy was primarily in withdrawal mode back to Germany.\n\nThe 327 often is slighted by fans of the 101st Airborne Division as riding in a glider is not deemed as perilous as parachuting in battle.  Several companies of the 327 suffered casualty rates as high or higher than many paratrooper regiments.  Some companies, such as A, C, and G, and the 401st took casualties as severe as the most engaged paratrooper regiments.  On D+2, glider flights into Market Garden suffered a 30% loss of gliders. Later, the 327 was involved in action near Hagenau, France in Alsace.\n\n== Post WWII ==\nInactivated on 30 November 1945 in France, the regiment was redesignated as the [[516th Airborne Infantry Regiment]] on 18 June 1948 and active from 6 July 1948 to 1 April 1949 and from 25 August 1950 to 1 December 1953 at [[Camp Breckinridge]], [[Kentucky]].  As was the case with many combat divisions of World War II fame, the colors of the [[101st Airborne Division]] and its subordinate elements were active only as training units and were not organized as parachute or glider units.\n\nOn 27 April 1954 the 516th was relieved from assignment to the 101st Airborne Division and activated at [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], [[South Carolina]], on 15 May 1954, again as a training unit.  On 1 July 1956 it was reorganized and redesignated as the 327th Airborne Infantry Regiment, an element of the 101st.\nOn 25 April 1957 the colors of Company A, 327AIR were reorganized and redesignated as [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company|HHC]], 1st Airborne Battle Group, 327th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated).  This was the only active element of the 327th Infantry during the Pentomic era.  When the Army abandoned battle groups for brigades and battalions, the unit was reorganized and redesignated on 3 February 1963 as the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry, an element of the [[1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (United States)|1st Brigade]], [[101st Airborne Division]].\n\nOn 21 January 1964 the lineage of the former Company B, 327AIR was redesignated as HHC, 2d Battalion, 327th Infantry, assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted) and activated on 3 February 1963, also as an element of the [[1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (United States)|1st Brigade]], [[101st Airborne Division]].\n\n== Vietnam ==\nAs elements of the 1st Brigade, the 1st and 2nd Battalions 327th Infantry deployed to [[Vietnam]] in 1965, where they were joined by the rest of the division in late 1967. The 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry, was the last unit of the 101st Airborne to leave Vietnam, departing in April 1972, making it the longest serving unit in combat during the Vietnam War. While still at [[Fort Campbell]], [[Kentucky]], the remaining elements of the 101st were severely stripped of personnel to support the war effort. When ordered to deploy, it was necessary to fill empty manning slots with non-airborne-qualified soldiers, effectively making these units of the division airborne in name only. In mid-1968, the army created a second airmobile division (the other being the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]]) by reorganizing the 101st and its subordinate elements, to include the battalions of the [[327th Infantry]]. The division has remained a helicopter-deployed unit to the present day.\n\n== Post-war reorganization ==\nDuring the early 1980s the army adopted a battalion rotation program that paired combat battalions based in the continental United States with those stationed overseas. As part of this program, the lineage of the former Company C, 327AIR was redesignated on 21 January 1983 as [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company|HHC]], 3d Battalion, 327th Infantry, and assigned to the [[1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (United States)|1st Brigade]], [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault). This was accomplished by reflagging the existing 2nd Battalion, [[502nd Infantry]]. In Alaska the existing infantry battalions of the 172nd Infantry Brigade were reflagged as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, [[327th Infantry]], with the three \"C\" companies' back on airborne status, thus reactivating the lineages of the former companies D, E, and F, 327AIR.  The rotational program was later abandoned and the [[Alaska]]-based battalions were reflagged again, leaving only the Fort Campbell-based battalions with 327th designations.\n\nWhen the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) was inactivated and replaced by the newly re-activated 6th Infantry Division (Light) in 1986; the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, 327th Infantry were also inactivated and replaced by the 1st and 2nd Battalion, 17th Infantry (Fort Richardson, AK); and the 4th and 5th Battalion, 9th Infantry (Fort Wainwright, AK).\n\n=== Modularity ===\nWith the recent Army-wide reorganization adding one brigade to each division and eliminating one infantry or armor battalion from each brigade, 3-327th was inactivated and replaced by the 1st Squadron (RSTA), 32nd Cavalry Regiment.  The [[1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (United States)|1st Brigade Combat Team]], [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault) also includes the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry regiment; 2nd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment; the 426th Brigade Support Battalion; and the 326th Brigade Engineer Battalion.<ref>{{cite web|author=U.S. Army Center of Military History (CMH) |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/inf/0327in001bn.htm |title=1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment &#124; Lineage and Honors &#124; U.S. Army Center of Military History (CMH) |publisher=History.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/inf/0327in002bn.htm |title=2d Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment &#124; Lineage and Honors &#124; U.S. Army Center of Military History |publisher=History.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/inf/0327in003bn.htm |title=3d Battalion, 327th Infantry |publisher=History.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n== Operation Desert Storm ==\nIn 1990 the 1st BCT (including the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 327th) was deployed to [[Saudi Arabia]] during [[Operation Desert Shield]]. The 1st BCT established defensive positions north of Tap Line Road approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} south of the Iraq border.  On 17 January the 327th Infantry Regiment conducted a ground movement to Camp Eagle II in preparation for deployment into Iraq. Over the course of the next week the regiment regrouped and by C-130 and ground convey repositioned to RaFa in northern Saudi Arabia and further into TAA Campbell where it remained for approximately 30 days. With the commencement of ground operations, under the command of Colonel Tom Hill the 327th conducted the deepest and largest air assault operation in history establishing FOB Cobra approximately {{convert|85|mi|km}} inside Iraq. Subordinate elements were 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Battalion commanded by LTC Hancock, 2nd Battalion, 327th commanded by LTC Charles Garey Thomas, 3rd Battalion 327th commanded by LTC (P) Gary J. Bridges and 1st Battalion 502nd commanded by LTC Jim Donald. 2nd Battalion 320 FA artillery was commanded by LTC Lynn Hartsell. The 3rd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment conducted a second air assault operation to seize FOB White under the command of 2nd Brigade 101st Airborne Division for further seal the defeat of Iraqi forces. Not a single 101st Airborne Division soldier was lost.\n\n== Operation Iraqi Freedom ==\nIn early 2003 the entire 101st Airborne Division deployed to Kuwait in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] where the 1st Brigade Combat Team made up of the 327th Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel [[Ben Hodges]] and its support elements prepared for battle at Camp Pennsylvania. The majority of the 327th Infantry Regiment later shifted to Camp Udairi, Kuwait and from there, conducted a massive air assault into southern Iraq while other soldiers crossed the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border in a massive maneuver known as a GAC, or Ground Assault Convoy. Once in Iraq, the 327th encountered heavy to light resistance from both fleeing Iraqi soldiers as well as the Fedayeen Saddam and other less organized fighters. The 327th fought through [[An Najaf]], [[Al Kufa]], [[Karbala]], [[Baghdad]], and then headed north to conduct Stability and Security Operations in [[Qayyarah West]] and [[Mosul]] or Al Mawsil.\n\nThey returned to the U.S. in early 2004 and were re-deployed to Iraq again in the fall of 2005. During their second tour in Iraq, they were stationed in the [[Kirkuk]] province and under the command of LTC Marc Hutson and CSM David Allard. The majority of the 1st Brigade Combat Team were positioned on FOB Warrior at the Kirkuk Regional Air Base while 1st Battalion and other attachments were spread out amongst FOB McHenry outside of Hawijah, FOB Caldwell just south of Kirkuk, and FOB Bernstien southwest of Kirkuk.\n\nFor their third OIF deployment, the Bastogne Bulldogs were split up, with the 1st Battalion deployed near [[Baiji, Iraq]], and the 2nd Battalion deployed in the vicinity of [[Samarra]], Iraq. Both battalions served 15 month deployments beginning in September 2007, and ending in late November 2008.\n\n== War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132014) ==\n[[File:U.S. Army firefight in Kunar.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Soldiers with 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division return fire during a firefight with Taliban forces in Barawala Kalay Valley in Kunar province, Afghanistan, March 31, 2011]]\nThe 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division conducted a major combat operation in Barawala Kalay Valley, Kunar Province, Afghanistan in late March\u2013April 2011.

It fought during [[World War I]] as part of the [[82nd Airborne Division|82nd Division]]. It has also been deployed in the [[Vietnam War]], [[Gulf War]], and most recently to [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]].

Elements of the 327th Infantry moved up to the front lines at the end of that summer. On 9 June 1918, Cpt Jewett Williams became the first man in the regiment killed in combat.<ref>''The 327th Under Fire: History of the 327th infantry Regiment, 82nd division in the Great War''  by George McIntosh Sparks, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, 1920 Page 12</ref>\n\nThe 82nd Infantry Division's first exposure to combat, as a division, occurred on 25 June when it was assigned to the Lagney sector.  While this was earmarked as a quiet sector, the 327th actively patrolled and executed raids for several weeks.<ref>''The 327th Under Fire: History of the 327th infantry Regiment, 82nd division in the Great War'' by George McIntosh Sparks, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, 1920 Page 16</ref>\n\n=== Saint-Mihiel ===\n\nTHE 82nd Division was occupying the Marbache sector in the Moselle Valley with orders to protect the flank of attacking U.S. forces. But as the Germans were reinforcing this sector in anticipation of a coming Allied offensive, the Division ordered a series of raids to mislead the Germans on the exact location of attacking units.  The 327th Infantry, conducted a raid on a German strongpoint known as the Bel Air Farm on 13 September with 2 companies, E and K, as the assault force.  After initial success the assault group was pushed back to the original U.S. lines.  E & K companies suffered 6 dead, 11 severely wounded, 69 wounded and 10 missing.<ref>''Official History of the 82nd Division: American Expeditionary Force, 1917\u20131919'', Bobbs-Merill, Indianapolis, Ind., 1920) page 31</ref>  The 82nd continued operations in [[Saint-Mihiel]] until, on 17 September, it was relieved by troops of the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Infantry Division]] just west of the Moselle River.  The 82nd Division went into reserve to prepare for the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], but the 327th was attached to the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Division]] and remained on the front until early October.\n\n=== Meuse-Argonne ===\n\nThe 82nd Division was given a new axis of advance early in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]] to attack and fill a gap to the left flank of the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Division]] which was advancing to capture Hill 223 as part of operations to rescue the 77th Infantry Division's [[Lost Battalion (World War I)|Lost Battalion]].  On the night of 6/7 October 1918, the regiment relieved troops on the left of the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Division]] on the Aire River. On 7 October, it attacked toward the Argonne Forest, making some progress toward Cornay. On 8 October rescuers reached the Lost Battalion.  The next day the 327th continued to attack towards the high ground northwest of Ch\u00e2tel-Ch\u00e9h\u00e9ry.  The 327th then continued to fight in the Ardennes region, capturing Conray and Hill 180.  On 4 November the regiment was pulled from the line and moved into training area; it was there when it learned of the 11 November Armistice.<ref>''Official History of the 82nd Division: American Expeditionary Force, 1917\u20131919'', Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis, IN, 1920</ref>\n\nThe 327th Infantry suffered 331 killed in action, 73 died of wounds and 1959 wounded in the First World War.<ref>[https://history.army.mil/documents/wwi/82div/82div.htm#appendix \"82nd Division: Summary of Operations by the American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Printing Office 1944\"].

All equipment and personnel assigned to the regiment were designed to be carried in the [[Waco CG-4A]] glider.  Although a glider infantry regiment, the majority of the unit landed by sea on Utah Beach in the afternoon of 7 June 1944, because of a shortage of planes to tow its gliders. Some elements did reach shore on [[D-Day]], 6 June, but because of rough seas, beach traffic, and the fact that the paratroopers of the 101st had already achieved many of their objectives, the landing was delayed.  The 327th suffered a few casualties going ashore from enemy fire and were strafed by enemy aircraft.  Near Ste. Come DuMont (southeast of the village), the 327th was camped right next to German paratroopers, separated by thick hedgerows.  German-speaking soldiers in the 327th engaged in taunting the enemy.  The 327th took several casualties by enemy mortars. By 8 June, the 327th had entered the front line, largely in reserve of the 506th until crossing the Douve River near Carentan.  First and Second Battalions guarded Utah Beachhead's left flank northeast of Carentan. Company C was hit hard by friendly fire mortars while crossing the Douve. Official findings blamed enemy mines. Company B also suffered casualties in the incident.\n\nThe 327th suffered heavy casualties while advancing on Carentan via what is now the city Marina from a northeast direction and other casualties approaching Carentan from the east.  G Company led the attack on the west bank of the marina canal.  A Company of the attached 401st Glider Infantry Regiment was on the east bank of the canal.  Concealed German machine guns and mortars inflicted the most casualties.  Chaplain Gordon Cosby earned a Silver Star for bravery in the face of the enemy for assisting wounded glider men in front of heavily armed German soldiers.  The 327th played a pivotal role with the 501st and 506th of the 101st in taking Carentan.  The 327th marched through the town and East to be possibly the first unit of the Utah Beachhead to link up with the Omaha Beachhead around the four-villages area of le Fourchette, le Mesnil, le Rocher and Cotz.  It was then directed South between the bulk of the 101st and the 75th Infantry Division of the Omaha Beachhead.\n\nThe unit was commanded by Col. George S. Wear through 10 June, when command was turned over to Col. Joseph H. Harper.  Although not official, the men of the 327th understood that Wear was replaced because of friendly-fire artillery casualties while crossing the Douve River.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  Officially, enemy mortars were blamed.\n\n=== Holland ===\nThe regiment played a pivotal role in [[Operation Market Garden]] battle near [[Best, Netherlands|Best]], in the Netherlands, encircling a large German force which had been pressured from the west by the tank-supported 502nd of the 101st.  Sgt. Manuel Hidalgo and Lt. Hibbard of G Company risked their lives in a humanitarian effort to get the enemy to surrender before being annihilated by the 327th.  In the Market Garden operations, some companies in the 327th suffered two-thirds casualty rates before arriving at Opheusden. 2nd Battalion, especially Company G, suffered heavy casualties from a brutal shelling in the churchyard at [[Veghel]].  The large artillery shells were launched from the [[Erp, Netherlands|Erp]] vicinity.  Dutch collaborators aided German scouts and were executed by the Dutch underground after the shelling.\n\nAt [[Opheusden]], the 327th withstood repeated assaults by the enemy and heavy artillery barrages.  In ''Rendezvous with Destiny'', Rapport and Arthur cite British officers that indicated that the barrage suffered by the 327 was as intense as anything they had seen, and rivaled what the British pummeled the Germans with at El Alamein in North Africa. The fighting along the west and northwest perimeter in the Ophuesden (the Island) area was as intense as any fighting in the area.  E Company engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy near the railroad track switch house south of Opheusden. The enemy repeatedly hurled their units unsuccessfully at the glider men and suffered high casualties.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n=== Bastogne ===\nAt [[Bastogne]], Belgium, the 327 held half of the perimeter (including the 401, which was acting as the Regiment's 3rd Battalion and later officially became a part of the 327).  Numerous intense fights erupted along the 327 sector including two brutal fights at Marvie and more to the west in the 401 section. The Germans attacking were of the Volksgrenadiers and the elite tank-based Panzer Lehr. At Marvie the 327 was outnumbered by 15 to 1.  Facing only two US companies, G Company, supported by several tanks from the 10th Armored Division and E Company in reserve, the German commander took his whole division further west.  At Marvie, the Germans lost six tanks and several half tracks.  One tank did break into Marvie, but was destroyed trying to make a run towards Bastogne.  Several days later, during the night of 23 December, the enemy attacked in force with tanks.  The road through Marvie was blocked when G Company mistook a US tank destroyer for a German tank and destroyed it on the village bridge.  The Germans overran Hill 500 just to the west of Marvie and broke through the gap between F and G Company.  The enemy then put rear pressure on the F Company Command Post.  A platoon sized paratrooper element came to support F Company.  The German forces managed to place tanks behind US lines between Marvie and Bastogne.  The glider men of Company G and Company F were pushed back from 500 to 1,000 yards during the intense fighting, but did not break. Unable to make quick progress, the Germans pressed the attack until morning, but withdrew when the German Command Center was destroyed by US artillery.  Again, the 327 was badly outnumbered by the enemy.\n\nAfter the break through by General Patton's tanks, the 327th proceeded to the north sector of the Bastogne theater of operations. There, 2nd Battalion was involved in clearing Champs after a German armored element broke through paratrooper lines.  Companies A and C suffered intense casualties and were consolidated into one company call ACE.  Later, the 327 made an open field maneuver against armored enemy troops east of Foy, which helped secure that village.  The ferocity and speed of the open-field attack surprised the Germans and the paratrooper regiments on the flanks of the attack.  German forces attacked the flank and surrounded ACE Company in Bois Jacques.  After that, the enemy was primarily in withdrawal mode back to Germany.\n\nThe 327 often is slighted by fans of the 101st Airborne Division as riding in a glider is not deemed as perilous as parachuting in battle.  Several companies of the 327 suffered casualty rates as high or higher than many paratrooper regiments.  Some companies, such as A, C, and G, and the 401st took casualties as severe as the most engaged paratrooper regiments.  On D+2, glider flights into Market Garden suffered a 30% loss of gliders. Later, the 327 was involved in action near Hagenau, France in Alsace.\n\n== Post WWII ==\nInactivated on 30 November 1945 in France, the regiment was redesignated as the [[516th Airborne Infantry Regiment]] on 18 June 1948 and active from 6 July 1948 to 1 April 1949 and from 25 August 1950 to 1 December 1953 at [[Camp Breckinridge]], [[Kentucky]].  As was the case with many combat divisions of World War II fame, the colors of the [[101st Airborne Division]] and its subordinate elements were active only as training units and were not organized as parachute or glider units.\n\nOn 27 April 1954 the 516th was relieved from assignment to the 101st Airborne Division and activated at [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], [[South Carolina]], on 15 May 1954, again as a training unit.  On 1 July 1956 it was reorganized and redesignated as the 327th Airborne Infantry Regiment, an element of the 101st.\nOn 25 April 1957 the colors of Company A, 327AIR were reorganized and redesignated as [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company|HHC]], 1st Airborne Battle Group, 327th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated).  This was the only active element of the 327th Infantry during the Pentomic era.  When the Army abandoned battle groups for brigades and battalions, the unit was reorganized and redesignated on 3 February 1963 as the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry, an element of the [[1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (United States)|1st Brigade]], [[101st Airborne Division]].\n\nOn 21 January 1964 the lineage of the former Company B, 327AIR was redesignated as HHC, 2d Battalion, 327th Infantry, assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted) and activated on 3 February 1963, also as an element of the [[1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (United States)|1st Brigade]], [[101st Airborne Division]].\n\n== Vietnam ==\nAs elements of the 1st Brigade, the 1st and 2nd Battalions 327th Infantry deployed to [[Vietnam]] in 1965, where they were joined by the rest of the division in late 1967. The 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry, was the last unit of the 101st Airborne to leave Vietnam, departing in April 1972, making it the longest serving unit in combat during the Vietnam War. While still at [[Fort Campbell]], [[Kentucky]], the remaining elements of the 101st were severely stripped of personnel to support the war effort. When ordered to deploy, it was necessary to fill empty manning slots with non-airborne-qualified soldiers, effectively making these units of the division airborne in name only. In mid-1968, the army created a second airmobile division (the other being the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]]) by reorganizing the 101st and its subordinate elements, to include the battalions of the [[327th Infantry]]. The division has remained a helicopter-deployed unit to the present day.\n\n== Post-war reorganization ==\nDuring the early 1980s the army adopted a battalion rotation program that paired combat battalions based in the continental United States with those stationed overseas. As part of this program, the lineage of the former Company C, 327AIR was redesignated on 21 January 1983 as [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company|HHC]], 3d Battalion, 327th Infantry, and assigned to the [[1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (United States)|1st Brigade]], [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault). This was accomplished by reflagging the existing 2nd Battalion, [[502nd Infantry]]. In Alaska the existing infantry battalions of the 172nd Infantry Brigade were reflagged as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, [[327th Infantry]], with the three \"C\" companies' back on airborne status, thus reactivating the lineages of the former companies D, E, and F, 327AIR.  The rotational program was later abandoned and the [[Alaska]]-based battalions were reflagged again, leaving only the Fort Campbell-based battalions with 327th designations.\n\nWhen the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) was inactivated and replaced by the newly re-activated 6th Infantry Division (Light) in 1986; the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions, 327th Infantry were also inactivated and replaced by the 1st and 2nd Battalion, 17th Infantry (Fort Richardson, AK); and the 4th and 5th Battalion, 9th Infantry (Fort Wainwright, AK).\n\n=== Modularity ===\nWith the recent Army-wide reorganization adding one brigade to each division and eliminating one infantry or armor battalion from each brigade, 3-327th was inactivated and replaced by the 1st Squadron (RSTA), 32nd Cavalry Regiment.  The [[1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (United States)|1st Brigade Combat Team]], [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault) also includes the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry regiment; 2nd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment; the 426th Brigade Support Battalion; and the 326th Brigade Engineer Battalion.<ref>{{cite web|author=U.S. Army Center of Military History (CMH) |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/inf/0327in001bn.htm |title=1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment &#124; Lineage and Honors &#124; U.S. Army Center of Military History (CMH) |publisher=History.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/inf/0327in002bn.htm |title=2d Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment &#124; Lineage and Honors &#124; U.S. Army Center of Military History |publisher=History.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/inf/0327in003bn.htm |title=3d Battalion, 327th Infantry |publisher=History.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n== Operation Desert Storm ==\nIn 1990 the 1st BCT (including the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 327th) was deployed to [[Saudi Arabia]] during [[Operation Desert Shield]]. The 1st BCT established defensive positions north of Tap Line Road approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} south of the Iraq border.  On 17 January the 327th Infantry Regiment conducted a ground movement to Camp Eagle II in preparation for deployment into Iraq. Over the course of the next week the regiment regrouped and by C-130 and ground convey repositioned to RaFa in northern Saudi Arabia and further into TAA Campbell where it remained for approximately 30 days. With the commencement of ground operations, under the command of Colonel Tom Hill the 327th conducted the deepest and largest air assault operation in history establishing FOB Cobra approximately {{convert|85|mi|km}} inside Iraq. Subordinate elements were 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Battalion commanded by LTC Hancock, 2nd Battalion, 327th commanded by LTC Charles Garey Thomas, 3rd Battalion 327th commanded by LTC (P) Gary J. Bridges and 1st Battalion 502nd commanded by LTC Jim Donald. 2nd Battalion 320 FA artillery was commanded by LTC Lynn Hartsell. The 3rd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment conducted a second air assault operation to seize FOB White under the command of 2nd Brigade 101st Airborne Division for further seal the defeat of Iraqi forces. Not a single 101st Airborne Division soldier was lost.\n\n== Operation Iraqi Freedom ==\nIn early 2003 the entire 101st Airborne Division deployed to Kuwait in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] where the 1st Brigade Combat Team made up of the 327th Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel [[Ben Hodges]] and its support elements prepared for battle at Camp Pennsylvania. The majority of the 327th Infantry Regiment later shifted to Camp Udairi, Kuwait and from there, conducted a massive air assault into southern Iraq while other soldiers crossed the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border in a massive maneuver known as a GAC, or Ground Assault Convoy. Once in Iraq, the 327th encountered heavy to light resistance from both fleeing Iraqi soldiers as well as the Fedayeen Saddam and other less organized fighters. The 327th fought through [[An Najaf]], [[Al Kufa]], [[Karbala]], [[Baghdad]], and then headed north to conduct Stability and Security Operations in [[Qayyarah West]] and [[Mosul]] or Al Mawsil.\n\nThey returned to the U.S. in early 2004 and were re-deployed to Iraq again in the fall of 2005. During their second tour in Iraq, they were stationed in the [[Kirkuk]] province and under the command of LTC Marc Hutson and CSM David Allard. The majority of the 1st Brigade Combat Team were positioned on FOB Warrior at the Kirkuk Regional Air Base while 1st Battalion and other attachments were spread out amongst FOB McHenry outside of Hawijah, FOB Caldwell just south of Kirkuk, and FOB Bernstien southwest of Kirkuk.\n\nFor their third OIF deployment, the Bastogne Bulldogs were split up, with the 1st Battalion deployed near [[Baiji, Iraq]], and the 2nd Battalion deployed in the vicinity of [[Samarra]], Iraq. Both battalions served 15 month deployments beginning in September 2007, and ending in late November 2008.\n\n== War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132014) ==\n[[File:U.S. Army firefight in Kunar.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Soldiers with 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division return fire during a firefight with Taliban forces in Barawala Kalay Valley in Kunar province, Afghanistan, March 31, 2011]]\nThe 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division conducted a major combat operation in Barawala Kalay Valley, Kunar Province, Afghanistan in late March\u2013April 2011.

Indigenous ways of knowing, learning, instructing, teaching, and training have been viewed by many postmodern scholars as important for ensuring that students and teachers, whether Indigenous or non-Indigenous, are able to benefit from education in a culturally sensitive manner that draws upon, utilizes, promotes, and enhances awareness of Indigenous traditions, beyond the standard Western curriculum of reading, writing, and arithmetic. \nRobinson Akhenoba(2019)\n\n==Cultural context of Indigenous learning in the Americas==\n{{Further|Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\nA growing body of scientific literature has described Indigenous ways of learning, in different cultures and countries.

Between traditional Aboriginal education and the western system of education. A key factor for successful Indigenous education practices is the student-teacher relationship. Classrooms are socially constructed in a way that the teacher shares the control of the classroom with the students. Rather than taking an authoritative role, the teacher is viewed as a co-learner to the students, and they maintain a balance between personal warmth and demand for academic achievement.community in Mexico, teachers have been observed to let their students move freely about the classroom while working in order to consult with other students, as well as using their instructors for occasional guidance.\n\nTeachers in Indigenous classrooms in a community in Alaska rely on group work, encourage the students to watch each other as a way to learn, and avoid singling out students for praise, criticism, or recitation.<ref name=\"deyhle\"/> Praise, by Western standards, is minimal in Indigenous classrooms, and when it is given it is for effort, not for providing a correct answer to a question. Classroom discourse in Indigenous classrooms is an example of how the teacher shares control with the students. Observations in the Yup'ik and Mazahua communities show that Indigenous teachers are less likely to solicit an answer from an individual student, but rather encourage all of the students to participate in classroom discourse.<ref name=\"deyhle\"/><ref name=\"paradise\">{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=Ruth|author2=De Haan, Mari\u00ebtte|title=Responsibility and Reciprocity: Social Organization of Mazahua Learning Practices|journal=Anthropology & Education Quarterly|date=13 July 2009|volume=40|issue=2|pages=187\u2013204|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1492.2009.01035.x}}</ref>  In the Yup'ik classroom direct questions are posed to the group as whole, and the control of talk is not the sole responsibility of the teacher.

This study differs in that sense by studying educators who are all of Native American background and their interactions with students and families. These educators reported that their interactions with families stem from respect and understanding. There were three categories that surfaced when understanding and defining culture; (1) respect of children, families, and community, (2) building a sense of belonging and community through ritual, and (3) the importance of family values and beliefs.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n# ''Respect of children, families, and community''; educators approached interactions in a reflective and respectful way when talking with children, families, and the community. Educators accepted practices concerning death in individual families. Educators made it a point to be aware of curricular activities that may offend certain tribes. Lastly, educators spoke in a soft, quiet, and gentle way to the children.<ref name=\":15\" />\n# ''Building a sense of belongingness and community through ritual''; specific to the tribe on Flathead Reservation, [[Pow wow|powwows]] are a community ritual that bring together families and community. Educators worked with families and their children to make [[moccasin]]s, ribbon shirts and dresses, and shawls prior to the powwow, and included elements of a powwow into their classroom. For example, they keep a drum in the classroom to use for drumming, singing, and dancing.<ref name=\":15\" />\n# ''Importance of family values and beliefs''; educators give the opportunity to parent's to be involved in the day-to-day activities in and around the classroom. Such as, meal times, play time, holidays, and celebrations. Educators collaborate with parents regarding curriculum around holidays and cultural celebrations, reinforced importance of speaking their tribal languages, and clarified with parents what their home language is, and had respectful discussions around traditional values and beliefs that led to compromise, not isolation or separation.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe educators in this study worked on a daily basis to respect, plan, and learn about parent beliefs and values so they can create a community culture linked to school curriculum.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nSimilar to the previous study mentioned, Vaughn (2016) conducted a multiple case study of four Native American teachers and two European American teachers at Lakeland Elementary.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn|first=Margaret|date=2016-01-02|title=Re-Envisioning Literacy in a Teacher Inquiry Group in a Native American Context|journal=Literacy Research and Instruction|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=24\u201347|doi=10.1080/19388071.2015.1105888|issn=1938-8071}}</ref> The participants were asked to draw from influences, relationships, and resources of the local tribe, local and state practices, and knowledge of effective [[Pedagogy|pedagogies]] to co-construct knowledge.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt the time this study was conducted, Lakeland Elementary was failing to meet [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind's]] yearly progress in reading. State officials would come to observe teachers, unannounced, to make sure they were teaching the mandated literacy curriculum. This required the teachers to follow the literacy program, even though the curriculum seldom met the individual and specific linguistic and cultural needs of the majority of Native American students at the school.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nSo the researcher focused on two questions. The first one being, \u201cIn what ways did these teachers approach developing a curriculum to support their students\u2019 social, cultural, and linguistic needs?\u201d<ref name=\":16\" /> One theme that came up was \u201cpedagogical re-envisioning\u201d, which are pedagogies and understandings of culturally responsive teaching to address writing and understand that each student has individual needs. With understanding this, teachers are able to give students the opportunity to include oral storytelling so students have their own personal twist on their learning. The second question was \u201cWhat shifts in teachers\u2019 pedagogical practices resulted from this collaboration?\"<ref name=\":16\" /> Four themes came up; cultural resources, working with community, multimodal approaches, and integrating students\u2019 experiences and interests from their lives outside of school into the curriculum. By addressing these four themes, teachers were able to re-envision how curriculum can meet individual needs for many Native American students without leaving out their interests, culture, or resources.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Holistic approach to learning===\n{{Undue weight section|date=August 2019}}\n[[Holistic education]] focuses on the \"whole picture\" and how concepts and ideas are interrelated, then analyzes and makes meaning of certain ideas.  This form of education is beneficial for all students, especially Indigenous students.  Traditionally, Indigenous forms of learning were/are holistic in nature, focusing on interconnections with context (especially culture, nature, and experiences).<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nAccording to a study by Stevenson et al. (2014), challenges that arise with using technology consistently can stem from a weak relationship between spending time outdoors and environmental knowledge and behavior in middle school aged students in North Carolina.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Kathryn T.|last2=Peterson|first2=M.

Instead of children having a natural interaction with nature, outdoor activities are based on organized sport or technology.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nMiddle school aged Native American students reported higher levels of environmental behavior than Caucasian students, urging environmental education professionals to continue to close achievement gaps in classrooms.<ref name=\":17\" /> Environmental education professionals continue to ensure that the same factors creating inequity don't affect environmental knowledge. Along with creating a classroom that strives to include environmental knowledge, promoting outdoor activities, and direct interaction with nature gives a chance for Native American students to voice their knowledge to the teacher, and to their peers.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAnother form of holistic approach to learning includes parental and community advocacy. As reported by Pedro (2015), parents of students expressed concern that the high school their children attended neglected their children's voices, knowledge, and perspectives in the school.<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite journal|last=Pedro|first=Timothy San|date=2015-10-02|title=Silence as Weapons: Transformative Praxis among Native American Students in the Urban Southwest|journal=Equity & Excellence in Education|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=511\u2013528|doi=10.1080/10665684.2015.1083915|issn=1066-5684}}</ref> The school districts diversity specialist sought advice to construct a curriculum that would validate, teach, and support the perspective of Native American peoples of the Southwest United States. This team constructed a curriculum based on three ideas; (1) Native American students are harmed when their curriculum is void of knowledge that reflect their identity, culture, and heritage, (2) students who are not Native American are harmed as they learn about narrowed and historicized depictions of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] peoples of the United States, and (3) teaching knowledge from a variety of perspectives should be fundamental to any learning environment.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nPedro suggested, with the foundation of parents\u2019 values, that students are able to engage in conversation, in their mind, through critical dialogic listening in silence.<ref name=\":18\" /> Just because students weren't engaging verbally in the discussion, didn't mean students weren't receptive to the points being made by other students who were verbally engaged. Students can share their beliefs and identities through meta-conversations in connection with the voiced realities between other students. After hearing different sides of other students\u2019 stories, they were able to construct their own identities and understandings into the debate, silently.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nTo validate the silence, the teacher in this instance, writes down quotes and questions students had asked in small and whole group conversations. At the end of each unit, the teacher would use these quotes and questions to ask students to reflect upon their writings, using notes they took and readings/handouts given to them. Through this option, students were able to contribute their identities, knowledge, and understandings into the classroom space. This process was called Literacy Events, in which students were given the opportunity to absorb and make sense of different perspectives and ideas from verbal discussions in class and readings.<ref name=\":18\" /> Silence helped the students relate internally, and through writing, their perspectives became known. Essentially, in the end, their stories were in their minds and contributing to the conversation as they chose whose ideas to accept and reject or a combination of both. Parents advocated for their children, so next time a student chooses silence, it might not mean that they are disengaged or uninterested. Instead, give them another avenue to express their thoughts.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\n==Indigenous American ways of learning==\nIndigenous education involves oral traditions (such as listening, watching, imitating), group work, apprenticeship, and high levels of cultural context.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />  Additionally, knowledge to Indigenous people is sacred, centers on the idea that each student constructs knowledge individually, and is rooted in experience and culture.<ref name=\":9\" />  Learning is believed to be life-long and involves a unique sense of self-identity and passion, as well as focuses on the importance of community survival and contributions to life and community sustainability.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> The Indigenous ways of learning occur when diverse perspectives are interconnected through spiritual, holistic, experiential and transformative methods.<ref name=\":0\" />  The optimal learning environment for Indigenous students incorporates: the land (and traditional skills), Indigenous languages, traditions, cultures, people (self, family, elders, and community), and spirituality.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n===Active participation===\nIn many Indigenous communities of the Americas, children often begin to learn through their eagerness to be active participants in their communities.

Integration of younger and older children provides the opportunity for different levels of observation, listening, and participation to occur [Rogoff et al. (2010)]. Soon after or even during an activity, children are often seen to take it upon themselves to participate in the same previous social and cultural activities that they observed and participated in .<ref name=\":5\"/> By encouraging child immersion in activities rather than specifically asking for their participation, children have the freedom to construct their own knowledge with self-motivation to continue cultural practices alongside others .<ref name=\"Rogoff, B. 2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B | year = 2014 | title = Learning by Observing and Pitching In to Family and Community Endeavors: An Orientation | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 57 | issue = 2\u20133| pages = 69\u201381 | doi = 10.1159/000356757 }}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n \nChildren in many Indigenous cultures of the Americas actively participate and contribute to their community and family activities by observing and pitching in (link to LOPI page) while informally learning to socialize and gaining a sense of responsibility amongst other skills.

Josefina is one of the seven family members that pitches in towards the family food stand. Through observation and listening, she learned that the food stand was the family's main source of income.

Many children in Indigenous Yucatec families often attempt and are expected to help around their homes with household endeavors. It is common to see children offer their help of their own accord, such as Mari, an 18-month-old child from an Indigenous family who watched her mother clean the furniture with a designated cleaning leaf. Mari then took it upon herself to pick a leaf from a nearby bush and attempt to scrub the furniture as well.<ref name=\":4\">Gaskins, S. (1999).

For example, P'urepecha children whose mothers followed more traditional Indigenous ways of living demonstrated significantly more independent collaboration when playing Chinese checkers than middle-class children whose mothers had less involvement in Indigenous practices of the Americas.<ref name=\"Chavez\">{{cite journal | last1 =Correa-Ch\u00e1vez  | first1 = M. | last2 = Mangione| first2 = H.F.|last3=Mejia-Arauz|first3 = R.| year = 2016 | title = Collaboration patterns among Mexican children in an indigenous town and Mexican city.| url = | journal = Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 105\u2013113| doi = 10.1016/j.appdev.2016.04.003}}</ref> Similarly, when mothers from the Mayan community of San Pedro were instructed to construct a 3-D jigsaw puzzle with their children, mothers who practiced traditional Indigenous culture showed more cooperative engagements with their children than mothers with less traditional practices.<ref name=\":5\"/> These studies exemplify the idea that children from families that practice traditional Indigenous American cultures are likely to exhibit a motivation to collaborate without instruction. Therefore, being in an environment where collaboration is emphasized, serves as an example for children in Indigenous American communities to pitch in out of their own self-motivation and eagerness to contribute.\n\n===Assessment===\nIn many Indigenous communities of the Americas children rely on [[Educational assessment|assessment]] to master a task. Assessment can include the evaluation of oneself as well as evaluation from external influences like parents, family members, or community members. Assessment involves [[feedback]] given to learners from their support; this can be through acceptance, appreciation or correction. The purpose of assessment is to assist the learner as they actively participate in their activity. While contributing in the activity, children are constantly evaluating their learning progress based on the feedback of their support. With this feedback, children modify their behavior in mastering their task.\n<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/icp-overview-english | title=Learning by Observing and Pitching in Overview - Learning by Observing and Pitching in}}</ref>\n\nIn the Mexican Indigenous heritage community of Nocutzepo, there is available feedback to a learner by observing the results of their contribution and by observing if their support accepted or corrected them. For example, a 5-year-old girl shapes and cooks tortillas with her mother, when the girl would make irregular tortilla shapes her mother would focus her daughter's attention to an aspect of her own shaping. By doing this, the young girl would imitate her mother's movements and improve her own skills. Feedback given by the mother helped the young girl evaluate her own work and correct it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn traditional [[Chippewa]] culture, assessment and feedback are offered in variety of ways. Generally, Chippewa children are not given much praise for their contributions. On occasion, the parents offer assessment through rewards given to the child. These rewards are given as feedback for work well done, and come in the form of a toy carved out of wood, a doll of grass, or maple sugar. When children do not meet expectations, and fail in their contributions, Chippewa parents make sure not to use ridicule as a means of assessment. The Chippewa also recognize the harmful effects of excessive scolding to a child's learning process. Chippewa parents believes that scolding a child too much would \"make them worse\", and holds back the child's ability to learn. \n<ref>Hilger, Sister M. I. (1951). \"Chippewa child life and its cultural background\".

These values ultimately influence how children learn in this community. Parents from the Chillihuani community offer assessment of their children through praise, even if the child's contribution is not perfect. Additionally, feedback can come in the form of responsibility given for a difficult task, with less supervision. This responsibility is an important aspect of the learning process for children in Chillihuani because it allows them advance their skills. At only five years old, children are expected to herd [[sheep]], [[alpaca]] and [[llamas]] with the assistance of an older sibling or adult relative.  By age 8, children take on the responsibility of herding alone even in unfavorable weather conditions. Children are evaluated in terms of their ability to handle difficult tasks and then complemented on a job well done by their parents. This supports the learning development of the child's skills, and encourages their continued contributions.<ref>Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect: Childrearing in highland Peru.

One reason for this current awareness is the rapid spread of Western educational models throughout the world. Critics of the Western educational model believe that due to colonial histories and lingering cultural ethnocentrism, the Western model can not substitute for an Indigenous education. Throughout history, Indigenous Peoples have experienced, and continue many negative interactions Western society (for example, the Canadian [[Residential School System]]), which has led to the oppression and marginalization of Indigenous people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Colour of Democracy: Racism in Canadian Society|last=Henry, Tator|publisher=Nelson Education Ltd.|year=2010|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=103\u2013114}}</ref>  The film \"Schooling the World: The White Man's Last Burden\" addresses this issue of modern education and its destruction of unique, Indigenous cultures and individuals' identities. Shot in the Buddhist culture of Ladakh in the northern Indian Himalayas, the film fuses the voices of the Ladakhi people and commentary from an anthropologist/ethnobotanist, a National Geographical Explorer-in-Residence, and an architect of education programs. In essence, the film examines the definitions of wealth and poverty, in other words, knowledge and ignorance. Furthermore, it reveals the effects of trying to institute a global education system or central learning authority, which can ultimately demolish \"traditional sustainable agricultural and ecological knowledge, in the breakup of extended families and communities, and in the devaluation of ancient spiritual traditions.\"<ref>Schooling The World. \"The Film\". Last modified 2011, http://www.schoolingtheworld.org/film/. Retrieved 8 April 2012.</ref> Finally, the film promotes a deeper dialogue between cultures, suggesting that there is no single way to learn. No two human beings are alike because they develop under different circumstances, learning, and education.\n\nThe director and editor of the film Carol Black writes, \"One of the most profound changes that occurs when modern schooling is introduced into traditional societies around the world is a radical shift in the locus of power and control over learning from children, families, and communities to ever more centralized systems of authority.\"<ref name=carol>Carol Black, \"Occupy Your Brain: On Power, Knowledge, and the Re-occupation of Common Sense\", Schooling the World Blog, January 13, 2012, http://schoolingtheworld.org/blog/.</ref> Black continues by explaining that in many non-modernized societies, children learn in a variety of ways, including free play or interaction with multiple children, immersion in nature, and directly helping adults with work and communal activities.<ref name=\"carol\"/> \"They learn by experience, experimentation, trial and error, by independent observation of nature and human behavior, and through voluntary community sharing of information, story, song, and ritual.\"<ref name=\"carol\"/> Most importantly, local elders and traditional knowledge systems are autonomous in comparison to a strict Western education model. Adults have little control over children's \"moment-to-moment movements and choices.\"<ref name=\"carol\"/> Once learning is institutionalized, both the freedom of the individual and his/her respect for the elder's wisdom are ruined. \"Family and community are sidelined\u2026The teacher has control over the child, the school district has control over the teacher, the state has control over the district, and increasingly, systems of national standards and funding create national control over states.\"<ref name=\"carol\"/> When Indigenous knowledge is seen as inferior to a standard school curriculum, an emphasis is placed on an individual's success in a broader consumer culture instead of on an ability to survive in his/her own environment. Black concludes with a comment, \"We assume that this central authority, because it is associated with something that seems like an unequivocal good \u2013 'education' \u2013 must itself be fundamentally good, a sort of benevolent dictatorship of the intellect.\"<ref name=\"carol\"/> From a Western perspective, centralized control over learning is natural and consistent with the principles of freedom and democracy; and yet, it is this same centralized system or method of discipline that does not take into account the individual, which in the end stamps out local cultures.\n\n===Colonialism & Western methods of learning===\nThe education system in the Americas reinforces western cultures, prior knowledge and learning experiences which leads to the marginalization and oppression of various other cultures.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" />  Teaching students primarily through European perspectives results in non-European students believing that their cultures have not contributed to the knowledge of societies. Often, Indigenous students resist learning because they do not want to be oppressed or labeled as 'incapable of learning' due to neo-colonial knowledge and teaching.<ref name=\":9\" /> The act of [[Decolonization]] would greatly benefit Indigenous students and other marginalized students because it involves the deconstruction of engagement with the values, beliefs and habits of Europeans.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Pedagogical approaches to Indigenous education ==\nDecentralization requires a shift in education that steps away from Western practices. The following are pedagogical approaches aimed at empowering Indigenous students and Indigenous communities through education that does not rely on western culture.\n\n=== Culturally relevant pedagogy ===\nCulturally relevant pedagogy involves curriculum tailored to the cultural needs of students and participants involved. Culture is at the core of CRP and teachers and educators aim for all students to achieve academic success, develop cultural competence, and develop critical consciousness to challenge the current social structures of inequality that affect Indigenous communities in particular.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Leonel|date=2019|title=Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: Developing Principles of Description and Analysis.|url=|journal=Teaching and Teacher Education|volume=77|pages=43\u201352|doi=10.1016/j.tate.2018.09.011}}</ref> Culturally relevant pedagogy also extends to ''culturally sustaining and revitalizing pedagogy'' which actively works to challenge power relations and colonization by reclaiming, through education, what has been displaced by colonization and recognizing the importance of community engagement in such efforts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mccarty|first=Teresa|date=2014|title=Critical Culturally Sustaining/Revitalizing Pedagogy and Indigenous Education Sovereignty.|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=84|pages=101\u2013124|doi=10.17763/haer.84.1.q83746nl5pj34216}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical Indigenous pedagogy ===\nCritical Indigenous pedagogy focuses on resisting colonization and oppression through education practices that privilege Indigenous knowledge and promote Indigenous sovereignty.

This research follows two case studies at two different schools, one in Arizona and one in New Mexico. Tiffany Lee reports for Native American Community Academy (NACA) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The core values for the school include; respect, responsibility, community service, culture, perseverance, and reflection. These core values reflect tribal communities as well. NACA offers three languages; [[Navajo]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], and Tiwa, and the school also seeks outside resources to teach local languages.<ref name=\":19\" /> This study emphasizes that teaching language is culturally sustaining and revitalizing; which creates a sense of belonging and strengthens cultural identities, pride, and knowledge. At NACA, teachers know they possess inherent power as Indigenous education practitioners. They make a difference in revitalizing Native languages through culturally sustaining practices.<ref name=\":19\" /> The second case study was reported by Teresa McCarty at Puente de Hozho (PdH), that language has a different role for members of various cultural communities.

These language revitalization efforts often take place in schools, via language immersion programs. In Guatemala, teachers have had a sense of agency to teach students' the Indigenous language as well as about Indigenous culture in order to prevent language loss and maintain cultural identity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Milian|first=Madeline|last2=Walker|first2=Dana|date=2019-12-20|title=Bridges to bilingualism: Teachers\u2019 roles in promoting Indigenous languages in Guatemala|url=https://fire-ojs-ttu.tdl.org/fire/index.php/FIRE/article/view/138|journal=FIRE: Forum for International Research in Education|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|doi=10.32865/fire201953138|issn=2326-3873|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n=== Importance ===\nResearchers have brought up the importance of language revitalization efforts to preserve Native culture.

They examined evidence from prior research studies, examined descriptive documents from the study participants, conducted phone interviews and email exchanges with executive directors and school district administrators, and utilized other research on language-immersion models. In addition to qualitative evidence, they analyzed quantitative data such as school test scores and demographic.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThrough their comparison of test data, Aguilera and LeCompte found that there was an increase in performance on state benchmark exam scores by the Ayaprun- and Dine\u2019- immersion students. On the flip side, there was lower performance in these schools on the norm-referenced tests. However, the researchers note that these tests are often biased, negatively impacting Indigenous students.<ref name=\":10\" /> Ultimately, the researchers did not find that one immersion model had a higher academic achievement impact on Native students than the other studies. However, they \u201cagree with language experts that total immersion is a more effective approach to achieving proficiency in a Native language.\"<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThrough their study, Aguilera and LeCompte (2007) examined the language nest and two-way immersion models. Another researcher, Lee (2007), examined \u201ccompartmentalizing\u201d through both quantitative and qualitative measures.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Tiffany|date=2007|title=If they want Navajo to be learned, then they should require it in all schools\": Navajo teenagers' experiences, choices, and demands regarding Navajo language|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=22|issue=1|pages=7\u201333|jstor=30131300|doi=10.1353/wic.2007.0009}}</ref> Quantitatively, Lee examined language levels, language usage, and lifespan experiences of Navajo students. Qualitatively, Lee interviewed Navajo students to learn more about their feelings and opinions on learning the Navajo language. Below are descriptions of the three school models used in the studies by Aguilera, LeCompte, and Lee.\n\n* Language nest \u2013 This model is used by the Native Hawaiian Aha Punana Leo consortium and begins in preschools. \u201cIn the language nest preschools, the Indigenous language is considered the student\u2019s first language, and children converse and study in that language, every day and all day.\"<ref name=\":10\" /> These students are taught in English only after they are literate in their Indigenous language.\n* Two-Way Language-Immersion Model \u2013 In this model, maintenance of the Native language is promoted, while students also learn a second language. This model typically lasts from five to seven years. One form of a two-way language immersion model is the 50-50 model, in which students use English half of the class time and the target Native language the other half of the class time. The other model is a 90-10 model, in which students use the target Native language 90% of the time beginning in kindergarten. These students then increase the use of English \u201cby 10% annually until both languages are used equally\u2014a 50-50 split by fourth grade.\u201d<ref name=\":10\" />\n* Compartmentalizing\u2014 Schools that do not have full immersion programs often use compartmentalizing. Compartmentalizing refers to the Indigenous language being taught as a separate topic of study as opposed to having students instructed in the Native language for their academic content areas. According to Lee (2007), compartmentalizing is the most common approach for teaching Navajo language in schools today.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThrough her study, Lee (2007) concluded that \u201cNavajo-language use in the home was the strongest influence over the students\u2019 current Navajo-language level and Navajo-language use.\"<ref name=\":13\" /> She noted that \u201cschools need to become more proactive in language revitalization\u201d and shared that she found the compartmentalizing language-immersion programs in her study \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cthe language was mostly taught as though all the students were monolingual English speakers.\"<ref name=\":13\" /> Ultimately, the researcher asserts that in order for language-immersion programs to be done well, schools need to invest in more resources, improved teaching pedagogy, and the development of students\u2019 critical thinking and critical consciousness skills.\"<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Difficulties of Implementation ===\nDespite much interest in language revitalization efforts in Native communities, it can be challenging when it comes to program implementation. Research suggests several factors in the United States that make it difficult to implement language immersion programs in schools.\n\nAguilera and LeCompte (2007) found the following difficulties in their study:\n\n* An \u201coverwhelming pressure to teach English, especially due to the \u201crecent emphasis on high-stakes testing in English\"<ref name=\":10\" />\n* \u201cLack of importance given to cultural aspects of language by non-native educators and policymakers\u201d<ref name=\":10\" />\n* Lack of family participation, due to parents\u2019 fears that their children will not learn English or be successful if they participate in an immersion program<ref name=\":10\" />\n* Securing long term funding to sustain programs<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nOther studies found additional difficulties in implementation:\n\n* Hostile Policies: McCarty and Nicholas (2014) conducted qualitative research on language revitalization efforts for the Mohawk, Navajo, Hawaiian, and Hopi people and found one difficulty in implementation was hostile policies toward bi/multilingual education efforts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCarty|first=Teresa|last2=Nicholas|first2=Sheilah|date=2014|title=Reclaiming Indigenous languages: A reconsideration of the roles and responsibilities of schools|url=|journal=Review of Research in Education|volume=38|pages=106\u2013136|doi=10.3102/0091732X13507894|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n* Scarcity of Indigenous Staff and Resources: Mary Hermes opened Waadookodaading, a language immersion school centered around the Ojibwe language. The school is located near a reservation of about 3,000 enrolled members, but as of 2007, there were only approximately 10 fluent speakers.<ref name=\":14\" /> Because of massive language loss among Indigenous groups, it can be difficult to find fluent native speakers. It is necessary to have high language proficiency in order to teach in an immersion school.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> Not only do immersion teachers need to be fluent in the language, but they also need to be skilled in pedagogy which presents additional challenges. Requirements from the NCLB state that paraprofessionals need to have at least an associate degree, and those working in the primary grades to have early childhood education coursework. Oftentimes, the people who would serve in these positions in language immersion schools are elders, and they do not have these requirements.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> Additionally, a lack of materials in Indigenous languages results in a demand on educators to produce the materials along the way.<ref name=\":14\" />\n* Conflicting Perspectives: Ngai (2008) conducted qualitative research on Salish language revitalization efforts by speaking with 89 participants through 101 interviews in three different school districts on the Flathead Indian Reservation. His goal through his research was to produce a framework that could be used for Native language education in districts that had a mix of Native and non-Native students.<ref name=\":11\" /> Ngai found that, \u201cLanguage revitalization is particularly challenging in school districts with a mix of AI/AN and non-Native populations because of the co-existence of diverse and often conflicting perspectives.\"<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Helpful Factors in Implementation ===\nDespite the challenges of creating and maintaining immersion programs, there are many schools in existence today. Researchers suggest the following factors as helpful in leading to implementation of immersion models.\n\n* Leadership and community activism \u2013 Aguilera and LeCompte (2007) noted in their study that having Indigenous leaders who are invested in implementing these models is critical.<ref name=\":10\" /> In another study, Ngai (2008) notes that, \u201cIn public schools, the continuation of Salish language instruction since the 1970s can be attributed to the efforts of Salish-language teachers who are willing to step into a traditionally hostile setting in order to pass the language on to the young.\u201d<ref name=\":11\" />\n* School Autonomy \u2013 Many schools have applied for charter status in order to protect language-immersion schools from being closed by school members who object to the programs. Charter status also allows schools the flexibility to gain more funding.<ref name=\":10\" />\n* Partnerships with higher education systems\u2014In order to implement a language immersion model, schools must have trained teachers. Several of the communities where language immersion models have been successful are, \u201csituated in communities where there is access to higher education degree programs, and some of these postsecondary institutions offer Native language classes.\"<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Benefits==\nFor Indigenous learners and instructors, the inclusion of these methods into schools often enhances educational effectiveness by providing an education that adheres to an Indigenous person's own inherent perspectives, experiences, language, and customs, thereby making it easier for children to transition into the realm of adulthood.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> For non-Indigenous students and teachers, such an education often has the effect of raising awareness of individual and collective traditions surrounding Indigenous communities and peoples, thereby promoting greater respect for and appreciation of various cultural realities.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nIn terms of educational content, the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge within curricula, instructional materials, and textbooks has largely the same effect on preparing students for the greater world as other educational systems, such as the Western model.\n\nThere is value in including Indigenous knowledge and education in the public school system.  Students of all backgrounds can benefit from being exposed to Indigenous education, as it can contribute to reducing racism in the classroom and increase the sense of community in a diverse group of students.<ref>Wilson, Theresa.

Concerns about misappropriation of Indigenous ways of knowing without recognizing the plight of Indigenous Peoples and \"giving back\" to them are legitimate. Since most educators are non-Indigenous, and because Indigenous perspectives may offer solutions for current and future social and ecological problems, it is important to refer to Indigenous educators and agencies to develop curriculum and teaching strategies while at the same time encouraging activism on behalf of Indigenous Peoples. One way to bring authentic Indigenous experiences into the classroom is to work with community elders.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> They can help facilitate the incorporation of authentic knowledge and experiences into the classroom.<ref>BC Teacher's Federation.

However, some education systems and curricula lack knowledge about Indigenous peoples ways of learning, causing an Educational Gap for Indigenous people. Factors for the Education Gap include lower school enrollments, poor school performance, low literacy rates, and higher dropout rates.<ref name=\"champagne\"/> Some schools teach Indigenous children to be \"socialized\" and to be a national asset to society by assimilating, \"Schooling has been explicitly and implicitly a site of rejection of Indigenous knowledge and language, it has been used as a means of assimilating and integrating Indigenous peoples into a 'national' society and identity at the cost of their Indigenous identity and social practices\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=May S. |author2=Aikman S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing current issues and developments, Comparative Education|year=2003|pages=139\u2013145}}</ref> [[Intercultural learning]] is an example of how to build a bridge for the educational gap.\n\nOther factors that contribute to the Education Gap in Indigenous cultures are socioeconomic disadvantage, which includes access to healthcare, employment, incarceration rates, and housing. According to the Australian Government Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in their 2015 Closing the Gap Report, the country is not on track to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for Indigenous students. The government reported that there had been no overall improvement in Indigenous reading and numeracy since 2008.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://theconversation.com/closing-the-gap-in-education-report-card-needs-improvement-37455 | title=Closing the Gap in education report card: Needs improvement}}</ref>\n\n==Importance==\nIndigenous knowledge is particularly important to modern environmental management in today's world. Environmental and land management strategies traditionally used by Indigenous peoples have continued relevance. Indigenous cultures usually live in a particular bioregion for many generations and have learned how to live there sustainably. In modern times, this ability often puts truly Indigenous cultures in a unique position of understanding the interrelationships, needs, resources, and dangers of their bioregion. This is not true of Indigenous cultures that have been eroded through colonialism or genocide or that have been displaced.\n\nThe promotion of Indigenous methods of education and the inclusion of traditional knowledge also enables those in Western and post-colonial societies to re-evaluate the inherent hierarchy of knowledge systems. Indigenous knowledge systems were historically denigrated by Western educators; however, there is a current shift towards recognizing the value of these traditions. The inclusion of aspects of Indigenous education requires us to acknowledge the existence of multiple forms of knowledge rather than one, standard, benchmark system.<ref>Hall, L.B., Sefa Deo, G.J., & Rosenberg, D.G. Indigenous Knowledges in Global Contexts: Multiple Readings of Our World (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000)</ref>\n\nA prime example of how Indigenous methods and content can be used to promote the above outcomes is demonstrated within higher education in Canada. Due to certain jurisdictions' focus on enhancing academic success for Aboriginal learners and promoting the values of multiculturalism in society, the inclusion of Indigenous methods and content in education is often seen as an important obligation and duty of both governmental and educational authorities.<ref>In the Canadian province of Manitoba for instance, collaborative efforts between the government and post-secondary institutions (both universities and colleges) has resulted in the implementation of 13 Access Programs (spanning several disciplines and program focus areas). These Access programs often place emphasis on indigenous methods and content in the delivery of post-secondary education and training, while also providing students with a variety of other culturally sensitive supports (such as elders and mentors) in order to enhance their success in higher education. Advocates of such programs will often highlight the fact that, between 2001/02 and 2005/06 (most recent available data) a total of 800 students successfully graduated from these programs with post-secondary credentials, while an average of 70.8 per cent of all students enrolled during these same years were Aboriginal.Statistics cited according to pp. 141\u2013143 of the [http://www.copse.mb.ca/en/documents/compendium2007/chapter_5.pdf Manitoba Council on Post-Secondary Education Statistical Compendium For the Academic Years Ending in 2006] According to these advocates, the inclusion of indigenous models of education in those Access Programs that are intended for Aboriginal learners, is an important factor contributing to the completion of post-secondary education for the estimated 566 Aboriginal students who would not otherwise have been likely to achieve this same level of success.</ref>\n\nMany scholars in the field assert that Indigenous education and knowledge has a \"transformative power\" for Indigenous communities that can be used to foster \"empowerment and justice.\"<ref name=semali>Semali, L.M. & Kincheloe, J.L. What is Indigenous Knowledge? (New York: Falmer Press, 1999)</ref> The shift to recognizing Indigenous models of education as legitimate forms is therefore important in the ongoing effort for Indigenous rights, on a global scale.<ref name=\"semali\"/>\n\n==Implications for teachers==\nEducators need to foster a respectful learning environment that promotes confidence and openness as well as an authentic dialogue to help students come to understand content through spirituality and cultural infusion.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is also important for educators to realize that time is crucial for students to connect intellect, spirituality and their understanding of the physical world.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many educators have stated that educational programs do not prepare them with enough support and materials for effectively teaching Indigenous students.<ref name=\":6\" /> Therefore, it is important for educators to seek out ongoing teach development programs directed toward improving teaching so that marginalized groups do not suffer.\n\n==Challenges (as seen with the Na)==\nThere are numerous practical challenges to the implementation of Indigenous education. Incorporating Indigenous knowledge into formal Western education models can prove difficult. However, the discourse surrounding Indigenous education and knowledge suggests that integrating Indigenous methods into traditional modes of schooling is an \"ongoing process of 'cultural negotiation.'\"<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\nIndigenous education often takes different forms than a typical Western model, as the practices of the Na ethnic group of southwest China illustrate. Because Na children learn through example, traditional Na education is less formal than the standard Western model. In contrast to structured hours and a classroom setting, learning takes places throughout the day, both in the home and in adults' workplaces. Based on the belief that children are \"fragile, soulless beings\", Na education focuses on nurturing children rather than on punishing them.<ref name=tami>Tami Blumenfield, \"Na Education in the Face of Modernity\", ''Landscapes of Diversity: Indigenous Knowledge, Sustainable Livelihoods and Resource Governance in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia'' (2002): 487-94.</ref> Children develop an understanding of cultural values, such as speech taboos and the \"reflection\" of individual actions \"on the entire household.\"<ref name=\"tami\"/> Playing games teaches children about their natural surroundings and builds physical and mental acuity. Forms of Indigenous knowledge, including weaving, hunting, carpentry, and the use of medicinal plants, are passed on from adult to child in the workplace, where children assist their relatives or serve as apprentices for several years.<ref name=\"tami\"/>\n\nHowever, increasing modernity is a challenge to such modes of instruction. Some types of Indigenous knowledge are dying out because of decreased need for them and a lack of interest from youth, who increasingly leave the village for jobs in the cities. Furthermore, formal Chinese state schooling \"interferes with informal traditional learning.\"<ref name=\"tami\"/> Children must travel a distance from their villages to attend state schools, removing them from traditional learning opportunities in the home and workplace. The curriculum in state schools is standardized across China and holds little relevance to the lives of the Na. Na children are required to learn Mandarin Chinese, Chinese and global history, and Han values, as opposed to their native language, local history, and Indigenous values. Methods of instruction rely on rote learning rather than experiential learning, as employed in Na villages.<ref name=\"tami\"/>\n\nSeveral individuals and organizations pay for children's school fees and build new schools in an attempt to increase village children's access to education. Yet such well-intended actions do not affect the schools' curriculum, which means there is no improvement in the sustainability of the children's native cultures.<ref name=\"tami\"/> As a result, such actions may actually \"be contributing to the demise of the very culture\" they are trying to preserve.<ref name=\"tami\"/>\n\n==Associated organizations==\nMany organizations work to promote Indigenous methods of education. The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples makes particular reference to the educational rights of Indigenous peoples in Article 14.<ref>\"United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\". United Nations. Retrieved 8 April 2012.</ref> It emphasizes the responsibility of states to adequately provide access to education for Indigenous people, particularly children, and when possible, for education to take place within their own culture and to be delivered in their own language.\n\nIndigenous peoples have founded and actively run several of these organizations. On a global scale, many of these organizations engage in active knowledge transfer in an effort to protect and promote Indigenous knowledge and education modes. One such organization, the Indigenous Education Institute (IEI), aims to apply Indigenous knowledge and tradition to a contemporary context, with a particular focus on astronomy and other science disciplines.<ref>Indigenous Education Institute. \"About IEI.\" Last modified 2012. http://www.indigenouseducation.org/ Retrieved 8 April 2012.</ref> Another such organization is the World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium (WINHEC), which was launched during the World Indigenous Peoples Conference on Education (WIPCE) at Delta Lodge, Kananakis Calgary in Alberta, Canada in August 2002.<ref>World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium. \"About WINHEC.\" Last modified 2005. http://www.win-hec.org/ Retrieved 8 April 2012.</ref> The founding members were Australia, Hawai'i, Alaska, the American Indian Higher Education Consortium of the United States, Canada, the W\u00e4nanga of Aotearoa (New Zealand), and Saamiland (North Norway).<ref>World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium. \"Summary of Major Events Which Created WINHEC.\" Last modified 2005. http://www.win-hec.org/ Retrieved 8 April 2012.</ref> The stated aims of WINHEC include the provision of an international forum for Indigenous peoples to pursue common goals through higher education.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Contemporary Native American issues in the United States#Education]]\n*[[Alternative education]]\n* [[Bilingual education]]\n* [[Traditional knowledge]]\n* [[Indigenous language]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples]]\n* [[Traditional ecological knowledge]]\n* [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]\n* [[Traditional knowledge]]\n* [[Indigenous rights]]\n* [[Critical pedagogy of place]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indigenous Education}}\n[[Category:Indigenous education| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{Intro-rewrite|reason=Largely copied and pasted from pages 32-33 of [http://www.eajournals.org/wp-content/uploads/Curriculum-and-Indigenous-Education-for-Technological-Advancement.pdf]|date=December 2019}}\n'''Indigenous education''' specifically focuses on teaching Indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal or non-formal educational systems.

There are many different educational systems throughout the world, some that are more predominant and widely accepted. However, members of Indigenous communities celebrate diversity in learning and see this global support for teaching traditional forms of knowledge as a success. Indigenous ways of knowing, learning, instructing, teaching, and training have been viewed by many postmodern scholars as important for ensuring that students and teachers, whether Indigenous or non-Indigenous, are able to benefit from education in a culturally sensitive manner that draws upon, utilizes, promotes, and enhances awareness of Indigenous traditions, beyond the standard Western curriculum of reading, writing, and arithmetic. \nRobinson Akhenoba(2019)\n\n==Cultural context of Indigenous learning in the Americas==\n{{Further|Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\nA growing body of scientific literature has described Indigenous ways of learning, in different cultures and countries.

Between traditional Aboriginal education and the western system of education. A key factor for successful Indigenous education practices is the student-teacher relationship. Classrooms are socially constructed in a way that the teacher shares the control of the classroom with the students. Rather than taking an authoritative role, the teacher is viewed as a co-learner to the students, and they maintain a balance between personal warmth and demand for academic achievement.community in Mexico, teachers have been observed to let their students move freely about the classroom while working in order to consult with other students, as well as using their instructors for occasional guidance.\n\nTeachers in Indigenous classrooms in a community in Alaska rely on group work, encourage the students to watch each other as a way to learn, and avoid singling out students for praise, criticism, or recitation.<ref name=\"deyhle\"/> Praise, by Western standards, is minimal in Indigenous classrooms, and when it is given it is for effort, not for providing a correct answer to a question. Classroom discourse in Indigenous classrooms is an example of how the teacher shares control with the students. Observations in the Yup'ik and Mazahua communities show that Indigenous teachers are less likely to solicit an answer from an individual student, but rather encourage all of the students to participate in classroom discourse.<ref name=\"deyhle\"/><ref name=\"paradise\">{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=Ruth|author2=De Haan, Mari\u00ebtte|title=Responsibility and Reciprocity: Social Organization of Mazahua Learning Practices|journal=Anthropology & Education Quarterly|date=13 July 2009|volume=40|issue=2|pages=187\u2013204|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1492.2009.01035.x}}</ref>  In the Yup'ik classroom direct questions are posed to the group as whole, and the control of talk is not the sole responsibility of the teacher.

With understanding this, teachers are able to give students the opportunity to include oral storytelling so students have their own personal twist on their learning. The second question was \u201cWhat shifts in teachers\u2019 pedagogical practices resulted from this collaboration?\"<ref name=\":16\" /> Four themes came up; cultural resources, working with community, multimodal approaches, and integrating students\u2019 experiences and interests from their lives outside of school into the curriculum. By addressing these four themes, teachers were able to re-envision how curriculum can meet individual needs for many Native American students without leaving out their interests, culture, or resources.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Holistic approach to learning===\n{{Undue weight section|date=August 2019}}\n[[Holistic education]] focuses on the \"whole picture\" and how concepts and ideas are interrelated, then analyzes and makes meaning of certain ideas.  This form of education is beneficial for all students, especially Indigenous students.  Traditionally, Indigenous forms of learning were/are holistic in nature, focusing on interconnections with context (especially culture, nature, and experiences).<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nAccording to a study by Stevenson et al. (2014), challenges that arise with using technology consistently can stem from a weak relationship between spending time outdoors and environmental knowledge and behavior in middle school aged students in North Carolina.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Kathryn T.|last2=Peterson|first2=M.

Instead of children having a natural interaction with nature, outdoor activities are based on organized sport or technology.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nMiddle school aged Native American students reported higher levels of environmental behavior than Caucasian students, urging environmental education professionals to continue to close achievement gaps in classrooms.<ref name=\":17\" /> Environmental education professionals continue to ensure that the same factors creating inequity don't affect environmental knowledge. Along with creating a classroom that strives to include environmental knowledge, promoting outdoor activities, and direct interaction with nature gives a chance for Native American students to voice their knowledge to the teacher, and to their peers.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAnother form of holistic approach to learning includes parental and community advocacy. As reported by Pedro (2015), parents of students expressed concern that the high school their children attended neglected their children's voices, knowledge, and perspectives in the school.<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite journal|last=Pedro|first=Timothy San|date=2015-10-02|title=Silence as Weapons: Transformative Praxis among Native American Students in the Urban Southwest|journal=Equity & Excellence in Education|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=511\u2013528|doi=10.1080/10665684.2015.1083915|issn=1066-5684}}</ref> The school districts diversity specialist sought advice to construct a curriculum that would validate, teach, and support the perspective of Native American peoples of the Southwest United States. This team constructed a curriculum based on three ideas; (1) Native American students are harmed when their curriculum is void of knowledge that reflect their identity, culture, and heritage, (2) students who are not Native American are harmed as they learn about narrowed and historicized depictions of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] peoples of the United States, and (3) teaching knowledge from a variety of perspectives should be fundamental to any learning environment.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nPedro suggested, with the foundation of parents\u2019 values, that students are able to engage in conversation, in their mind, through critical dialogic listening in silence.<ref name=\":18\" /> Just because students weren't engaging verbally in the discussion, didn't mean students weren't receptive to the points being made by other students who were verbally engaged. Students can share their beliefs and identities through meta-conversations in connection with the voiced realities between other students. After hearing different sides of other students\u2019 stories, they were able to construct their own identities and understandings into the debate, silently.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\nTo validate the silence, the teacher in this instance, writes down quotes and questions students had asked in small and whole group conversations. At the end of each unit, the teacher would use these quotes and questions to ask students to reflect upon their writings, using notes they took and readings/handouts given to them. Through this option, students were able to contribute their identities, knowledge, and understandings into the classroom space. This process was called Literacy Events, in which students were given the opportunity to absorb and make sense of different perspectives and ideas from verbal discussions in class and readings.<ref name=\":18\" /> Silence helped the students relate internally, and through writing, their perspectives became known. Essentially, in the end, their stories were in their minds and contributing to the conversation as they chose whose ideas to accept and reject or a combination of both. Parents advocated for their children, so next time a student chooses silence, it might not mean that they are disengaged or uninterested. Instead, give them another avenue to express their thoughts.<ref name=\":18\" />\n\n==Indigenous American ways of learning==\nIndigenous education involves oral traditions (such as listening, watching, imitating), group work, apprenticeship, and high levels of cultural context.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />  Additionally, knowledge to Indigenous people is sacred, centers on the idea that each students constructs knowledge individually, and is rooted in experience and culture.<ref name=\":9\" />  Learning is believed to be life-long and involves a unique sense of self identity and passion, as well as focuses on the importance of community survival and contributions to life and community sustainability.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> The Indigenous ways of learning occur when diverse perspectives are interconnected though spiritual, holistic, experiential and transformative methods.<ref name=\":0\" />  The optimal learning environment for Indigenous students incorporates: the land (and traditional skills), Indigenous languages, traditions, cultures, people (self, family, elders, and community), and spirituality.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n===Active participation===\nIn many Indigenous communities of the Americas, children often begin to learn through their eagerness to be active participants in their communities.

In this kind of environment, children learn not only how to participate alongside others, but are also likely to demonstrate an eagerness to contribute as a part of their community. Integration of younger and older children provides the opportunity for different levels of observation, listening, and participation to occur [Rogoff et al. (2010)]. Soon after or even during an activity, children are often seen to take it upon themselves to participate in the same previous social and cultural activities that they observed and participated in .<ref name=\":5\"/> By encouraging child immersion in activities rather than specifically asking for their participation, children have the freedom to construct their own knowledge with self-motivation to continue cultural practices alongside others .<ref name=\"Rogoff, B. 2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B | year = 2014 | title = Learning by Observing and Pitching In to Family and Community Endeavors: An Orientation | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 57 | issue = 2\u20133| pages = 69\u201381 | doi = 10.1159/000356757 }}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n \nChildren in many Indigenous cultures of the Americas actively participate and contribute to their community and family activities by observing and pitching in (link to LOPI page) while informally learning to socialize and gaining a sense of responsibility amongst other skills.

This includes everyone from the grandmother who tends to the fire for cooking to 5-year-old Julia who contributes by carrying the pieces of firewood. Josefina is one of the seven family members that pitches in towards the family food stand. Through observation and listening, she learned that the food stand was the family's main source of income. Overtime, Josefina took it upon herself to pitch in and take over the food stand, thus learning responsibility, cooperation, and commitment. Nobody instructed or demanded her to help with the family business, but she learned the community's expectations and way of living.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Urrieta | first1 = Jr. | year = 2013 | title = Familia and comunidad-based saberes: Learning in an indigenous heritage community | url = | journal = Anthropology & Education Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 320\u2013335 | doi = 10.1111/aeq.12028 }}</ref> The inclusive and welcoming environment of the marketplace setting encourages children to participate in everyday social practices and take initiative to learn about their culture, facilitating communal collaboration.\n\n===Motivation===\nIn Indigenous American communities, the inclusion of children in [[communal]] activities [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|motivates]] them to engage with their social world, helping them to develop a sense of belonging.<ref>Cajete, Gregory.

Their contributions emphasized collaboration and mutual responsibility within the community.<ref name=\":5\"/> A study was conducted with children who had immigrated from Indigenous communities in rural Mexico. The children were less likely to view activities that Westernized culture regarded as \"chores\" to be a type of work. These children felt that activities such as taking care of siblings, cooking, and assisting in cleaning were activities that help the family.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Responsibilities of children in Latino immigrant homes|last = Orellana|first = Marjorie|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> When asked how they viewed participation in household work, children from two Mexican cities reported they contribute because it is a shared responsibility of everyone in the family.

Many children in Indigenous Yucatec families often attempt and are expected to help around their homes with household endeavors. It is common to see children offer their help of their own accord, such as Mari, an 18-month-old child from an Indigenous family who watched her mother clean the furniture with a designated cleaning leaf. Mari then took it upon herself to pick a leaf from a nearby bush and attempt to scrub the furniture as well.<ref name=\":4\">Gaskins, S. (1999).

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Although Mari was not using the proper type of leaf, by attempting to assist in cleaning the furniture, she demonstrated that she wanted to help in a household activity. Mari's mother supported and encouraged Mari's participation by creating an environment where she is able to pitch in, even if not in a completely accurate manner. Parents often offer guidance and support in Indigenous American cultures when the child needs it\u2014as they believe this encourages children to be self-motivated and responsible.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nChildren from Indigenous communities of the Americas are likely to pitch in and collaborate freely without being asked or instructed to do so. For example, P'urepecha children whose mothers followed more traditional Indigenous ways of living demonstrated significantly more independent collaboration when playing Chinese checkers than middle-class children whose mothers had less involvement in Indigenous practices of the Americas.<ref name=\"Chavez\">{{cite journal | last1 =Correa-Ch\u00e1vez  | first1 = M. | last2 = Mangione| first2 = H.F.|last3=Mejia-Arauz|first3 = R.| year = 2016 | title = Collaboration patterns among Mexican children in an indigenous town and Mexican city.| url = | journal = Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 105\u2013113| doi = 10.1016/j.appdev.2016.04.003}}</ref> Similarly, when mothers from the Mayan community of San Pedro were instructed to construct a 3-D jigsaw puzzle with their children, mothers who practiced traditional Indigenous culture showed more cooperative engagements with their children than mothers with less traditional practices.<ref name=\":5\"/> These studies exemplify the idea that children from families that practice traditional Indigenous American cultures are likely to exhibit a motivation to collaborate without instruction. Therefore, being in an environment where collaboration is emphasized, serves as an example for children in Indigenous American communities to pitch in out of their own self-motivation and eagerness to contribute.\n\n===Assessment===\nIn many Indigenous communities of the Americas children rely on [[Educational assessment|assessment]] to master a task. Assessment can include the evaluation of oneself as well as evaluation from external influences like parents, family members, or community members. Assessment involves [[feedback]] given to learners from their support; this can be through acceptance, appreciation or correction. The purpose of assessment is to assist the learner as they actively participate in their activity. While contributing in the activity, children are constantly evaluating their learning progress based on the feedback of their support. With this feedback, children modify their behavior in mastering their task.\n<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/icp-overview-english | title=Learning by Observing and Pitching in Overview - Learning by Observing and Pitching in}}</ref>\n\nIn the Mexican Indigenous heritage community of Nocutzepo, there is available feedback to a learner by observing the results of their contribution and by observing if their support accepted or corrected them. For example, a 5-year-old girl shapes and cooks tortillas with her mother, when the girl would make irregular tortilla shapes her mother would focus her daughter's attention to an aspect of her own shaping. By doing this, the young girl would imitate her mother's movements and improve her own skills. Feedback given by the mother helped the young girl evaluate her own work and correct it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn traditional [[Chippewa]] culture, assessment and feedback are offered in variety of ways. Generally, Chippewa children are not given much praise for their contributions. On occasion, the parents offer assessment through rewards given to the child. These rewards are given as feedback for work well done, and come in the form of a toy carved out of wood, a doll of grass, or maple sugar. When children do not meet expectations, and fail in their contributions, Chippewa parents make sure not to use ridicule as a means of assessment. The Chippewa also recognize the harmful effects of excessive scolding to a child's learning process. Chippewa parents believes that scolding a child too much would \"make them worse\", and holds back the child's ability to learn. \n<ref>Hilger, Sister M. I.

These values ultimately influence how children learn in this community. Parents from the Chillihuani community offer assessment of their children through praise, even if the child's contribution is not perfect. Additionally, feedback can come in the form of responsibility given for a difficult task, with less supervision. This responsibility is an important aspect of the learning process for children in Chillihuani because it allows them advance their skills. At only five years old, children are expected to herd [[sheep]], [[alpaca]] and [[llamas]] with the assistance of an older sibling or adult relative.  By age 8, children take on the responsibility of herding alone even in unfavorable weather conditions. Children are evaluated in terms of their ability to handle difficult tasks and then complemented on a job well done by their parents. This supports the learning development of the child's skills, and encourages their continued contributions.<ref>Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect: Childrearing in highland Peru.

One reason for this current awareness is the rapid spread of Western educational models throughout the world. Critics of the Western educational model believe that due to colonial histories and lingering cultural ethnocentrism, the Western model can not substitute for an Indigenous education. Throughout history, Indigenous Peoples have experienced, and continue many negative interactions Western society (for example, the Canadian [[Residential School System]]), which has led to the oppression and marginalization of Indigenous people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Colour of Democracy: Racism in Canadian Society|last=Henry, Tator|publisher=Nelson Education Ltd.|year=2010|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=103\u2013114}}</ref>  The film \"Schooling the World: The White Man's Last Burden\" addresses this issue of modern education and its destruction of unique, Indigenous cultures and individuals' identities. Shot in the Buddhist culture of Ladakh in the northern Indian Himalayas, the film fuses the voices of the Ladakhi people and commentary from an anthropologist/ethnobotanist, a National Geographical Explorer-in-Residence, and an architect of education programs. In essence, the film examines the definitions of wealth and poverty, in other words, knowledge and ignorance. Furthermore, it reveals the effects of trying to institute a global education system or central learning authority, which can ultimately demolish \"traditional sustainable agricultural and ecological knowledge, in the breakup of extended families and communities, and in the devaluation of ancient spiritual traditions.\"<ref>Schooling The World. \"The Film\". Last modified 2011, http://www.schoolingtheworld.org/film/. Retrieved 8 April 2012.</ref> Finally, the film promotes a deeper dialogue between cultures, suggesting that there is no single way to learn. No two human beings are alike because they develop under different circumstances, learning, and education.\n\nThe director and editor of the film Carol Black writes, \"One of the most profound changes that occurs when modern schooling is introduced into traditional societies around the world is a radical shift in the locus of power and control over learning from children, families, and communities to ever more centralized systems of authority.\"<ref name=carol>Carol Black, \"Occupy Your Brain: On Power, Knowledge, and the Re-occupation of Common Sense\", Schooling the World Blog, January 13, 2012, http://schoolingtheworld.org/blog/.</ref> Black continues by explaining that in many non-modernized societies, children learn in a variety of ways, including free play or interaction with multiple children, immersion in nature, and directly helping adults with work and communal activities.<ref name=\"carol\"/> \"They learn by experience, experimentation, trial and error, by independent observation of nature and human behavior, and through voluntary community sharing of information, story, song, and ritual.\"<ref name=\"carol\"/> Most importantly, local elders and traditional knowledge systems are autonomous in comparison to a strict Western education model. Adults have little control over children's \"moment-to-moment movements and choices.\"<ref name=\"carol\"/> Once learning is institutionalized, both the freedom of the individual and his/her respect for the elder's wisdom are ruined. \"Family and community are sidelined\u2026The teacher has control over the child, the school district has control over the teacher, the state has control over the district, and increasingly, systems of national standards and funding create national control over states.\"<ref name=\"carol\"/> When Indigenous knowledge is seen as inferior to a standard school curriculum, an emphasis is placed on an individual's success in a broader consumer culture instead of on an ability to survive in his/her own environment. Black concludes with a comment, \"We assume that this central authority, because it is associated with something that seems like an unequivocal good \u2013 'education' \u2013 must itself be fundamentally good, a sort of benevolent dictatorship of the intellect.\"<ref name=\"carol\"/> From a Western perspective, centralized control over learning is natural and consistent with the principles of freedom and democracy; and yet, it is this same centralized system or method of discipline that does not take into account the individual, which in the end stamps out local cultures.\n\n===Colonialism & Western methods of learning===\nThe education system in the Americas reinforces western cultures, prior knowledge and learning experiences which leads to the marginalization and oppression of various other cultures.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" />  Teaching students primarily through European perspectives results in non-European students believing that their cultures have not contributed to the knowledge of societies. Often, Indigenous students resist learning because they do not want to be oppressed or labeled as 'incapable of learning' due to neo-colonial knowledge and teaching.<ref name=\":9\" /> The act of [[Decolonization]] would greatly benefit Indigenous students and other marginalized students because it involves the deconstruction of engagement with the values, beliefs and habits of Europeans.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Pedagogical approaches to Indigenous education ==\nDecentralization requires a shift in education that steps away from Western practices.

They examined evidence from prior research studies, examined descriptive documents from the study participants, conducted phone interviews and email exchanges with executive directors and school district administrators, and utilized other research on language-immersion models. In addition to qualitative evidence, they analyzed quantitative data such as school test scores and demographic.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThrough their comparison of test data, Aguilera and LeCompte found that there was an increase in performance on state benchmark exam scores by the Ayaprun- and Dine\u2019- immersion students. On the flip side, there was lower performance in these schools on the norm-referenced tests. However, the researchers note that these tests are often biased, negatively impacting Indigenous students.<ref name=\":10\" /> Ultimately, the researchers did not find that one immersion model had a higher academic achievement impact on Native students than the other studies. However, they \u201cagree with language experts that total immersion is a more effective approach to achieving proficiency in a Native language.\"<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThrough their study, Aguilera and LeCompte (2007) examined the language nest and two-way immersion models. Another researcher, Lee (2007), examined \u201ccompartmentalizing\u201d through both quantitative and qualitative measures.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Tiffany|date=2007|title=If they want Navajo to be learned, then they should require it in all schools\": Navajo teenagers' experiences, choices, and demands regarding Navajo language|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=22|issue=1|pages=7\u201333|jstor=30131300|doi=10.1353/wic.2007.0009}}</ref> Quantitatively, Lee examined language levels, language usage, and lifespan experiences of Navajo students. Qualitatively, Lee interviewed Navajo students to learn more about their feelings and opinions on learning the Navajo language. Below are descriptions of the three school models used in the studies by Aguilera, LeCompte, and Lee.\n\n* Language nest \u2013 This model is used by the Native Hawaiian Aha Punana Leo consortium and begins in preschools. \u201cIn the language nest preschools, the Indigenous language is considered the student\u2019s first language, and children converse and study in that language, every day and all day.\"<ref name=\":10\" /> These students are taught in English only after they are literate in their Indigenous language.\n* Two-Way Language-Immersion Model \u2013 In this model, maintenance of the Native language is promoted, while students also learn a second language. This model typically lasts from five to seven years. One form of a two-way language immersion model is the 50-50 model, in which students use English half of the class time and the target Native language the other half of the class time. The other model is a 90-10 model, in which students use the target Native language 90% of the time beginning in kindergarten. These students then increase the use of English \u201cby 10% annually until both languages are used equally\u2014a 50-50 split by fourth grade.\u201d<ref name=\":10\" />\n* Compartmentalizing\u2014 Schools that do not have full immersion programs often use compartmentalizing. Compartmentalizing refers to the Indigenous language being taught as a separate topic of study as opposed to having students instructed in the Native language for their academic content areas. According to Lee (2007), compartmentalizing is the most common approach for teaching Navajo language in schools today.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThrough her study, Lee (2007) concluded that \u201cNavajo-language use in the home was the strongest influence over the students\u2019 current Navajo-language level and Navajo-language use.\"<ref name=\":13\" /> She noted that \u201cschools need to become more proactive in language revitalization\u201d and shared that she found the compartmentalizing language-immersion programs in her study \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cthe language was mostly taught as though all the students were monolingual English speakers.\"<ref name=\":13\" /> Ultimately, the researcher asserts that in order for language-immersion programs to be done well, schools need to invest in more resources, improved teaching pedagogy, and the development of students\u2019 critical thinking and critical consciousness skills.\"<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Difficulties of Implementation ===\nDespite much interest in language revitalization efforts in Native communities, it can be challenging when it comes to program implementation. Research suggests several factors in the United States that make it difficult to implement language immersion programs in schools.\n\nAguilera and LeCompte (2007) found the following difficulties in their study:\n\n* An \u201coverwhelming pressure to teach English, especially due to the \u201crecent emphasis on high-stakes testing in English\"<ref name=\":10\" />\n* \u201cLack of importance given to cultural aspects of language by non-native educators and policymakers\u201d<ref name=\":10\" />\n* Lack of family participation, due to parents\u2019 fears that their children will not learn English or be successful if they participate in an immersion program<ref name=\":10\" />\n* Securing long term funding to sustain programs<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nOther studies found additional difficulties in implementation:\n\n* Hostile Policies: McCarty and Nicholas (2014) conducted qualitative research on language revitalization efforts for the Mohawk, Navajo, Hawaiian, and Hopi people and found one difficulty in implementation was hostile policies toward bi/multilingual education efforts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCarty|first=Teresa|last2=Nicholas|first2=Sheilah|date=2014|title=Reclaiming Indigenous languages: A reconsideration of the roles and responsibilities of schools|url=|journal=Review of Research in Education|volume=38|pages=106\u2013136|doi=10.3102/0091732X13507894|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n* Scarcity of Indigenous Staff and Resources: Mary Hermes opened Waadookodaading, a language immersion school centered around the Ojibwe language. The school is located near a reservation of about 3,000 enrolled members, but as of 2007, there were only approximately 10 fluent speakers.<ref name=\":14\" /> Because of massive language loss among Indigenous groups, it can be difficult to find fluent native speakers. It is necessary to have high language proficiency in order to teach in an immersion school.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> Not only do immersion teachers need to be fluent in the language, but they also need to be skilled in pedagogy which presents additional challenges. Requirements from the NCLB state that paraprofessionals need to have at least an associate degree, and those working in the primary grades to have early childhood education coursework. Oftentimes, the people who would serve in these positions in language immersion schools are elders, and they do not have these requirements.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> Additionally, a lack of materials in Indigenous languages results in a demand on educators to produce the materials along the way.<ref name=\":14\" />\n* Conflicting Perspectives: Ngai (2008) conducted qualitative research on Salish language revitalization efforts by speaking with 89 participants through 101 interviews in three different school districts on the Flathead Indian Reservation. His goal through his research was to produce a framework that could be used for Native language education in districts that had a mix of Native and non-Native students.<ref name=\":11\" /> Ngai found that, \u201cLanguage revitalization is particularly challenging in school districts with a mix of AI/AN and non-Native populations because of the co-existence of diverse and often conflicting perspectives.\"<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Helpful Factors in Implementation ===\nDespite the challenges of creating and maintaining immersion programs, there are many schools in existence today. Researchers suggest the following factors as helpful in leading to implementation of immersion models.\n\n* Leadership and community activism \u2013 Aguilera and LeCompte (2007) noted in their study that having Indigenous leaders who are invested in implementing these models is critical.<ref name=\":10\" /> In another study, Ngai (2008) notes that, \u201cIn public schools, the continuation of Salish language instruction since the 1970s can be attributed to the efforts of Salish-language teachers who are willing to step into a traditionally hostile setting in order to pass the language on to the young.\u201d<ref name=\":11\" />\n* School Autonomy \u2013 Many schools have applied for charter status in order to protect language-immersion schools from being closed by school members who object to the programs. Charter status also allows schools the flexibility to gain more funding.<ref name=\":10\" />\n* Partnerships with higher education systems\u2014In order to implement a language immersion model, schools must have trained teachers. Several of the communities where language immersion models have been successful are, \u201csituated in communities where there is access to higher education degree programs, and some of these postsecondary institutions offer Native language classes.\"<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Benefits==\nFor Indigenous learners and instructors, the inclusion of these methods into schools often enhances educational effectiveness by providing an education that adheres to an Indigenous person's own inherent perspectives, experiences, language, and customs, thereby making it easier for children to transition into the realm of adulthood.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> For non-Indigenous students and teachers, such an education often has the effect of raising awareness of individual and collective traditions surrounding Indigenous communities and peoples, thereby promoting greater respect for and appreciation of various cultural realities.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\nIn terms of educational content, the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge within curricula, instructional materials, and textbooks has largely the same effect on preparing students for the greater world as other educational systems, such as the Western model.\n\nThere is value in including Indigenous knowledge and education in the public school system.  Students of all backgrounds can benefit from being exposed to Indigenous education, as it can contribute to reducing racism in the classroom and increase the sense of community in a diverse group of students.<ref>Wilson, Theresa.

Concerns about misappropriation of Indigenous ways of knowing without recognizing the plight of Indigenous Peoples and \"giving back\" to them are legitimate. Since most educators are non-Indigenous, and because Indigenous perspectives may offer solutions for current and future social and ecological problems, it is important to refer to Indigenous educators and agencies to develop curriculum and teaching strategies while at the same time encouraging activism on behalf of Indigenous Peoples. One way to bring authentic Indigenous experiences into the classroom is to work with community elders.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> They can help facilitate the incorporation of authentic knowledge and experiences into the classroom.<ref>BC Teacher's Federation.

Individuals are recommended to reflect regularly on their teaching practice to become aware of areas of instruction in need of Indigenous perspectives.\n\n===21st century skills===\nIncorporating Indigenous ways of learning into educational practices has potential to benefit both Indigenous and non-Indigenous learners.  The [[21st century skills]] needed in modern curriculum include: collaboration, creativity, innovation, problem-solving, inquiry, multicultural literacy, etc.<ref name=\":9\" /> Indigenous ways of learning incorporate all these skills through experiential and holistic methods.  Additionally, aboriginal education styles align with 21st century skills though involving teachers and students as co-constructors of education, and by valuing the interconectidness of content and context.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Educational gap==\nSome Indigenous people view education as an important tool to improve their situation by pursuing economic, social and cultural development; it provides them with individual empowerment and self-determination.<ref name=\"champagne\">{{cite book|last=Champagne|first=Duane|title=Contemporary Education|year=2009|publisher=State of the world's indigenous peoples|location=New York: United Nations|pages=130\u2013154}}</ref> Education is also a means for employment; it's a way for socially marginalized people to raise themselves out of poverty. However, some education systems and curricula lack knowledge about Indigenous peoples ways of learning, causing an Educational Gap for Indigenous people. Factors for the Education Gap include lower school enrollments, poor school performance, low literacy rates, and higher dropout rates.<ref name=\"champagne\"/> Some schools teach Indigenous children to be \"socialized\" and to be a national asset to society by assimilating, \"Schooling has been explicitly and implicitly a site of rejection of Indigenous knowledge and language, it has been used as a means of assimilating and integrating Indigenous peoples into a 'national' society and identity at the cost of their Indigenous identity and social practices\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=May S. |author2=Aikman S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing current issues and developments, Comparative Education|year=2003|pages=139\u2013145}}</ref> [[Intercultural learning]] is an example of how to build a bridge for the educational gap.\n\nOther factors that contribute to the Education Gap in Indigenous cultures are socioeconomic disadvantage, which includes access to healthcare, employment, incarceration rates, and housing. According to the Australian Government Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in their 2015 Closing the Gap Report, the country is not on track to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for Indigenous students. The government reported that there had been no overall improvement in Indigenous reading and numeracy since 2008.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://theconversation.com/closing-the-gap-in-education-report-card-needs-improvement-37455 | title=Closing the Gap in education report card: Needs improvement}}</ref>\n\n==Importance==\nIndigenous knowledge is particularly important to modern environmental management in today's world. Environmental and land management strategies traditionally used by Indigenous peoples have continued relevance. Indigenous cultures usually live in a particular bioregion for many generations and have learned how to live there sustainably. In modern times, this ability often puts truly Indigenous cultures in a unique position of understanding the interrelationships, needs, resources, and dangers of their bioregion. This is not true of Indigenous cultures that have been eroded through colonialism or genocide or that have been displaced.\n\nThe promotion of Indigenous methods of education and the inclusion of traditional knowledge also enables those in Western and post-colonial societies to re-evaluate the inherent hierarchy of knowledge systems. Indigenous knowledge systems were historically denigrated by Western educators; however, there is a current shift towards recognizing the value of these traditions. The inclusion of aspects of Indigenous education requires us to acknowledge the existence of multiple forms of knowledge rather than one, standard, benchmark system.<ref>Hall, L.B., Sefa Deo, G.J., & Rosenberg, D.G. Indigenous Knowledges in Global Contexts: Multiple Readings of Our World (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000)</ref>\n\nA prime example of how Indigenous methods and content can be used to promote the above outcomes is demonstrated within higher education in Canada. Due to certain jurisdictions' focus on enhancing academic success for Aboriginal learners and promoting the values of multiculturalism in society, the inclusion of Indigenous methods and content in education is often seen as an important obligation and duty of both governmental and educational authorities.<ref>In the Canadian province of Manitoba for instance, collaborative efforts between the government and post-secondary institutions (both universities and colleges) has resulted in the implementation of 13 Access Programs (spanning several disciplines and program focus areas). These Access programs often place emphasis on indigenous methods and content in the delivery of post-secondary education and training, while also providing students with a variety of other culturally sensitive supports (such as elders and mentors) in order to enhance their success in higher education. Advocates of such programs will often highlight the fact that, between 2001/02 and 2005/06 (most recent available data) a total of 800 students successfully graduated from these programs with post-secondary credentials, while an average of 70.8 per cent of all students enrolled during these same years were Aboriginal.Statistics cited according to pp. 141\u2013143 of the [http://www.copse.mb.ca/en/documents/compendium2007/chapter_5.pdf Manitoba Council on Post-Secondary Education Statistical Compendium For the Academic Years Ending in 2006] According to these advocates, the inclusion of indigenous models of education in those Access Programs that are intended for Aboriginal learners, is an important factor contributing to the completion of post-secondary education for the estimated 566 Aboriginal students who would not otherwise have been likely to achieve this same level of success.</ref>\n\nMany scholars in the field assert that Indigenous education and knowledge has a \"transformative power\" for Indigenous communities that can be used to foster \"empowerment and justice.\"<ref name=semali>Semali, L.M. & Kincheloe, J.L. What is Indigenous Knowledge? (New York: Falmer Press, 1999)</ref> The shift to recognizing Indigenous models of education as legitimate forms is therefore important in the ongoing effort for Indigenous rights, on a global scale.<ref name=\"semali\"/>\n\n==Implications for teachers==\nEducators need to foster a respectful learning environment that promotes confidence and openness as well as an authentic dialogue to help students come to understand content through spirituality and cultural infusion.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is also important for educators to realize that time is crucial for students to connect intellect, spirituality and their understanding of the physical world.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many educators have stated that educational programs do not prepare them with enough support and materials for effectively teaching Indigenous students.<ref name=\":6\" /> Therefore, it is important for educators to seek out ongoing teach development programs directed toward improving teaching so that marginalized groups do not suffer.\n\n==Challenges (as seen with the Na)==\nThere are numerous practical challenges to the implementation of Indigenous education. Incorporating Indigenous knowledge into formal Western education models can prove difficult. However, the discourse surrounding Indigenous education and knowledge suggests that integrating Indigenous methods into traditional modes of schooling is an \"ongoing process of 'cultural negotiation.'\"<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\nIndigenous education often takes different forms than a typical Western model, as the practices of the Na ethnic group of southwest China illustrate. Because Na children learn through example, traditional Na education is less formal than the standard Western model. In contrast to structured hours and a classroom setting, learning takes places throughout the day, both in the home and in adults' workplaces. Based on the belief that children are \"fragile, soulless beings\", Na education focuses on nurturing children rather than on punishing them.<ref name=tami>Tami Blumenfield, \"Na Education in the Face of Modernity\", ''Landscapes of Diversity: Indigenous Knowledge, Sustainable Livelihoods and Resource Governance in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia'' (2002): 487-94.</ref> Children develop an understanding of cultural values, such as speech taboos and the \"reflection\" of individual actions \"on the entire household.\"<ref name=\"tami\"/> Playing games teaches children about their natural surroundings and builds physical and mental acuity. Forms of Indigenous knowledge, including weaving, hunting, carpentry, and the use of medicinal plants, are passed on from adult to child in the workplace, where children assist their relatives or serve as apprentices for several years.<ref name=\"tami\"/>\n\nHowever, increasing modernity is a challenge to such modes of instruction. Some types of Indigenous knowledge are dying out because of decreased need for them and a lack of interest from youth, who increasingly leave the village for jobs in the cities. Furthermore, formal Chinese state schooling \"interferes with informal traditional learning.\"<ref name=\"tami\"/> Children must travel a distance from their villages to attend state schools, removing them from traditional learning opportunities in the home and workplace. The curriculum in state schools is standardized across China and holds little relevance to the lives of the Na. Na children are required to learn Mandarin Chinese, Chinese and global history, and Han values, as opposed to their native language, local history, and Indigenous values. Methods of instruction rely on rote learning rather than experiential learning, as employed in Na villages.<ref name=\"tami\"/>\n\nSeveral individuals and organizations pay for children's school fees and build new schools in an attempt to increase village children's access to education. Yet such well-intended actions do not affect the schools' curriculum, which means there is no improvement in the sustainability of the children's native cultures.<ref name=\"tami\"/> As a result, such actions may actually \"be contributing to the demise of the very culture\" they are trying to preserve.<ref name=\"tami\"/>\n\n==Associated organizations==\nMany organizations work to promote Indigenous methods of education. The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples makes particular reference to the educational rights of Indigenous peoples in Article 14.<ref>\"United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\". United Nations.

He has now spent twelve successive seasons ranked inside the top 32. He reached his first ranking final and won his first ranking title at the [[2012 Australian Goldfields Open]].\n\nHawkins has played in the televised stages of every World Championship since he made his Crucible Theatre debut in [[2006 World Snooker Championship|2006]]. He lost in the first round on his first five appearances, but reached the second round in [[2011 World Snooker Championship|2011]] and [[2012 World Snooker Championship|2012]].

He turned professional in 1996, but only rose to prominence in the [[Snooker season 2004/2005|2004/2005 snooker season]], when he reached the last 16 of the [[2004 UK Championship (snooker)|2004 UK Championship]], the quarter-finals of the [[2004 British Open (snooker)|2004 British Open]], and the semi-finals of the [[2005 Welsh Open (snooker)|2005 Welsh Open]]. He has now spent twelve successive seasons ranked inside the top 32. He reached his first ranking final and won his first ranking title at the [[2012 Australian Goldfields Open]].\n\nHawkins has played in the televised stages of every World Championship since he made his Crucible Theatre debut in [[2006 World Snooker Championship|2006]]. He lost in the first round on his first five appearances, but reached the second round in [[2011 World Snooker Championship|2011]] and [[2012 World Snooker Championship|2012]]. Rated an 80\u20131 outsider for the [[2013 World Snooker Championship]] before the tournament began, he surprised many by defeating opponents including world number{{nbsp}}1 [[Mark Selby]] and top Chinese player [[Ding Junhui]] to reach the final, which he lost to defending champion [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/22421611 | title = Ronnie O'Sullivan beats Barry Hawkins to retain World title | first = Ben |last = Dirs | accessdate = 6 May 2013|date = 6 May 2013 |work = BBC Sport }}</ref> Hawkins has since reached the semi-finals of the World Championship in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018, and reached the final of the [[2016 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] in 2016.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\n{{expand section|date=May 2013}}\n\nBefore taking up snooker professionally he was an office clerk.<ref name=\"hawk\">[http://www.worldsnooker.com/player_list-8265.htm World Snooker: Barry Hawkins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013172041/http://www.worldsnooker.com/player_list-8265.htm |date=13 October 2009 }}- Official World Snooker profile.</ref> He reached the Top 32 in [[Snooker world rankings 2004/2005|the rankings in 2004/2005]], having reached the semi-finals of 2005's [[Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]], as well as the last sixteen of three other tournaments.\n\n===2005/2006===\n[[Snooker season 2005/2006|In 2005/2006]], he reached the semi-finals of the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snooker.org/trn/0506/gp2005_res.shtml |title=WWW Snooker: Grand Prix 2005 |publisher=Snooker.org |accessdate=2013-05-06}}</ref> and the Welsh Open again, and also beat the high-ranked [[Ding Junhui]] to qualify for the [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] for the first time.<ref>[http://superengland.com/sport/content/view/287/38/ Article on Super England] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513062344/http://superengland.com/sport/content/view/287/38/ |date=13 May 2008 }}</ref> This cemented Hawkins' place in the Top 16 of the [[Snooker world rankings 2006/2007|rankings for the 2006/2007 season]].\n\nAt the World Championship in [[Sheffield]], however, Hawkins faced former Champion [[Ken Doherty]] in the first round, and in the intimidating [[Crucible Theatre]] lost 10\u20131.

He also reached the last 16 at the [[Grand Prix 2007 (snooker)|Grand Prix]], [[2007 UK Snooker Championship|UK Championship]] and [[China Open 2008 (snooker)|China Open]].\n\nHe started the [[Snooker season 2008/2009|2008/2009 season]] with a quarter-final appearance at the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy]], by beating [[Jimmy White]] 5\u20133, [[Marco Fu]] 5\u20132 and [[Ryan Day (snooker player)|Ryan Day]] 5\u20133 where he played [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]], losing 5\u20134 after producing a brave fightback from 4\u20131 to level at 4\u20134. He then won at least his opening match in the next four ranking events, reaching the provisional top 16. He did not qualify for the events in Wales and China, but made it to the World Championship by beating [[Daniel Wells (snooker player)|Daniel Wells]] 10\u20139,<ref name=\"Legend Davis through to Crucible\">[http://www.worldsnooker.com/ws_championship_qualifiers_second_news-24360.htm?tid=122 Legend Davis through to Crucible]</ref> but lost in the first round, finishing one place short of a return to the top 16.\n\nFrom 2006\u20132010, Hawkins's record at the World Championship was unsuccessful, with a win\u2013loss record of 0\u20135. As well as the aforementioned one-sided defeat by Doherty, Hawkins narrowly lost in the first round the following two years as well, to [[Fergal O'Brien]] and [[Ali Carter]] respectively. Coincidentally, on both occasions Hawkins lost by very close 10\u20139 defeats, having recovered from 9\u20136 behind each time. In 2009 Hawkins missed out on a chance to take his match with former champion [[Graeme Dott]] to a deciding frame, and lost 10\u20138.

He was known by the nicknames of \"the Hard Man\" and \"the Stoke Potter\" (conflating his home city's [[pottery]] industry and his profession of potting snooker balls). He was also the first player on the television circuit to sport a plaster on his chin as a guide for his cue,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} which is a practice now adopted by Graeme Dott. As an amateur he played as David Harold, but since turning professional in 1991 he was registered as Dave Harold. He has three children and is separated from his wife.<ref>http://www.worldsnooker.com/news_editorial-19475.htm{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n \nHe won one ranking title, reached two further finals and several semi-finals, and spent four seasons ranked among the top 16. Harold was renowned for both his very strong defensive play and his unusual cue-action, with which he is able to unleash a great deal of power on a shot without using backswing on the cue.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Despite safety play ultimately being considered his strong point, he compiled 143 century breaks, putting him 22nd on the all-time list.<ref name=\"Chris Turners TOP CENTURY MAKERS\">{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Centuries.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210111241/http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Centuries.htm|archivedate=10 February 2013 \n| title = Chris Turner's Snooker Archive \u2013 Top Century Makers\n| publisher =\n| year = 2008\n| accessdate = 30 August 2008\n}}</ref> [[Steve Davis]] has commented that he is not the most naturally gifted player, but makes up for this with strong tactical play.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/world_champs_2002/player_profiles/1919235.stm | work=BBC News | title=15. Dave Harold | date=11 April 2002 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> For his technique and grinding play he has been compared to [[Cliff Thorburn]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\n\nSoon after turning professional, Harold won the [[1993 Asian Open]], beating [[Darren Morgan]] 9\u20133 in the final. Ranked 93rd in the world at the time, he became the lowest-ranked player ever to win a ranking tournament.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} He never repeated this achievement, although he reached his second ranking final in the 1994 [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], losing 6\u20139 to [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]].\n\n===Top 16 (1996\u20132002)===\n\nAfter 1994 Harold did not reach a third ranking final until 2008, although he has career reached a total of ten semi-finals in ranking tournaments to date, and was a Top-16 player for four seasons between [[Snooker world rankings 1995/1996|1995/1996]] and [[Snooker world rankings 2001/2002|2001/2002]], reaching a career-best position of no. 11 in the [[Snooker world rankings 1996/1997|world rankings in the 1996/97 season]]. In the 1996 Welsh Open, he lost in the semi-finals, 1\u20136, to eventual winner [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]].\n\nHe contended in his first and only [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] quarter-final in [[World Snooker Championship 1996|the 1996 event]], where he lost 7\u201313 to [[Nigel Bond]]. He also lost 5\u20136 to Bond in his 1996 British Open semi-final less than two weeks earlier.\n\nIn the 1998 [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], he knocked out [[Stephen Hendry]] and [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] en route to the semi-finals, but lost narrowly to eventual champion [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]]. 1998 also saw him reach his first semi-final in the UK Championship, where he was defeated 9\u20137 by [[Matthew Stevens]].\n\nIn the 1999 [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] Harold led Mark Williams 5\u20133 in the semi-finals but lost 5\u20136. This was Harold's last ranking semi-final until 2008, although he also reached the semis in the non-ranking 2001 [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]], defeating [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] and [[John Parrott]], but losing his semi-final 5\u20136 to eventual runner-up [[Fergal O'Brien]] after having led 5\u20131.\n\n===2003\u20132015===\nFollowing a poor season in 2001\u20132002, Harold dropped out of the Top 16, down to number 29 in the World Rankings. A broken wrist sustained on New Year's Eve 2003 saw him drop further down the rankings,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} out of the top 32, although he had a better [[Snooker world rankings 2005/2006|2005/2006 season]]. Another consistent season in [[Snooker world rankings 2006/2007|2006/2007]] helped Harold back up to No. 30 in the [[Snooker world rankings 2007/2008|world rankings for 2007/2008]].\n\n2007/2008 started with a quarter-final appearance in the [[Shanghai Masters (snooker)|Shanghai Masters]], losing to eventual winner [[Dominic Dale]]. Harold did not get past the round robin phase of the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], finishing fifth in his group of six players; but in the 2007 [[UK Championship]], Harold eliminated World Number 2 [[Graeme Dott]] 9\u20137 in the first round to achieve a place in the last 16 of the tournament for the first time since 1999. However, he lost 2\u20139 in the second round to [[Mark Selby]]. He qualified for the final stages of the World Championship with a 10\u20134 win over [[Mike Dunn (snooker player)|Mike Dunn]], but lost 10\u20133 at the Crucible in the first round proper to [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]].\n\nDuring a preliminary round match against local wildcard [[Jin Long (snooker player)|Jin Long]] in the [[China Open 2008 (snooker)|2008 China Open]], Harold was locked at 4\u20134. He took time out before the deciding frame to leave the playing arena and consume a couple of bananas, returning replenished to finish the job with a clearance on the colours. This gave rise to the affectionate nickname \"[[Bananaman]]\" on the [[Betfair]] snooker forum,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} referring to a children's TV character who gained superhuman powers. Harold also put up a battle against [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]] in the next round, but eventually lost 5\u20133; the last frame set a record at the time for being the longest ever in snooker history (93 minutes and 12 seconds).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nHarold retained his Top 32 ranking, and started the [[2008\u201309 snooker season|2008\u201309]] season ranked at [[Snooker world rankings 2008/2009|#28]], his highest ranking since 2003. In the first ranking event of the new season, the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy]], he beat [[Ricky Walden]] 5\u20132, [[Graeme Dott]] 5\u20133, [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]] 5\u20134 and defending champion [[Stephen Maguire]] to reach the semi-finals, his first appearance at that stage of a ranking event for five years. He then moved into a 5\u20131 lead against [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] and won 6\u20134, to reach his first final since 1994, which he lost 9\u20133 to [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]].<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/7591068.stm Classy O'Sullivan wins NI Trophy]\", BBC Sport, 31 August 2008. Retrieved on 1 September 2008.</ref> Harold's performance in this tournament moved him up to 14th in the provisional world rankings. Harold remarked after the final that, aside from claiming the World Championship, his one other remaining ambition in the game is to score a victory over O'Sullivan, who he has never beaten in a ranking tournament. The [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy]] marked his tenth consecutive failure to do so.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2006/04/19/local_tv_archive_snooker_champs_dave_harold_ronnie_osullivan_feature.shtml</ref>\n\nHarold subsequently qualified for the [[2008 Shanghai Masters]] and [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]]. In the former, he defeated home favourite [[Ding Junhui]] in the last 32, before losing 4\u20135 (from 3\u20130 and 4\u20131 up) against [[Steve Davis]]; however, in the latter he was eliminated in the first round by [[Ali Carter]]. A less successful run of results in the second half of the season saw him fall out of the Top 16 in the provisional rankings, largely due to his failure to qualify for the 2009 World Championship, although he started the 2009/2010 season ranked at No. 19, an improvement of nine places on the previous season.\n\nHarold appeared in the Welsh Open in January 2010 but lost in the first round 5\u20131 to Stephen Hendry. In September he beat Shaun Murphy 3\u20130 in the newly formed World Open in Glasgow but subsequently lost in the next round to Jamie Cope 3\u20132.\n\n[[File:Dave Harold at Snooker German Masters (DerHexer) 2013-01-31 02.jpg|thumb|Dave Harold at [[2013 German Masters]].]]\nThe [[2012\u201313 snooker season|2012\u201313]] season saw Harold win 2 qualifying matches to reach the main stages of the [[2012 Wuxi Classic]], however, he lost his wildcard match to Chinese player [[Rouzi Maimaiti]]. Harold subsequently failed to qualify for the next four ranking events, losing to players such as [[Ali Carter]], [[Barry Hawkins]], and [[Cao Yupeng]]. He did, however, qualify for the [[2013 German Masters|German Masters]], beating [[Craig Steadman]] 5\u20133 and [[Ryan Day (snooker player)|Ryan Day]] 5\u20134 to qualify for the Last 32 of the event, where he lost 3\u20135 to former world champion [[Graeme Dott]]. He only won 1 more match in ranking event qualifiers for the rest of the season, culminating with a 9\u201310 defeat the [[Alfie Burden]] in qualifying for the [[2013 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]]. Harold played in many of the [[Players Tour Championship 2012/2013|Players Tour Championship]] event throughout the season, his best results being three Last 16 appearances, and a further two Last 32 results, finishing 39th on the Order of Merit, outside of the Top 26 that qualified for the [[Players Tour Championship 2012/2013 \u2013 Finals|Finals]].\n\nHarold started the [[2013\u201314 snooker season|2013\u201314]] season ranked 50th in the [[Snooker world rankings 2013/2014|world rankings]]. He retired in May 2015 after suffering from eyesight problems.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dave Harold quits snooker due to poor sight|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Dave-Harold-quits-snooker-poor-sight/story-26434893-detail/story.html|accessdate=3 May 2015|work=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]|date=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nHarold was born in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and still lives there to this day.

\"Dave\" Harold''' (born 9 December 1966) is an English former professional [[snooker]] player from [[Stoke-on-Trent]]. He was known by the nicknames of \"the Hard Man\" and \"the Stoke Potter\" (conflating his home city's [[pottery]] industry and his profession of potting snooker balls). He was also the first player on the television circuit to sport a plaster on his chin as a guide for his cue,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} which is a practice now adopted by Graeme Dott. As an amateur he played as David Harold, but since turning professional in 1991 he was registered as Dave Harold. He has three children and is separated from his wife.<ref>http://www.worldsnooker.com/news_editorial-19475.htm{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n \nHe won one ranking title, reached two further finals and several semi-finals, and spent four seasons ranked among the top 16. Harold was renowned for both his very strong defensive play and his unusual cue-action, with which he is able to unleash a great deal of power on a shot without using backswing on the cue.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Despite safety play ultimately being considered his strong point, he compiled 143 century breaks, putting him 22nd on the all-time list.<ref name=\"Chris Turners TOP CENTURY MAKERS\">{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Centuries.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210111241/http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Centuries.htm|archivedate=10 February 2013 \n| title = Chris Turner's Snooker Archive \u2013 Top Century Makers\n| publisher =\n| year = 2008\n| accessdate = 30 August 2008\n}}</ref> [[Steve Davis]] has commented that he is not the most naturally gifted player, but makes up for this with strong tactical play.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/world_champs_2002/player_profiles/1919235.stm | work=BBC News | title=15. Dave Harold | date=11 April 2002 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> For his technique and grinding play he has been compared to [[Cliff Thorburn]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\n\nSoon after turning professional, Harold won the [[1993 Asian Open]], beating [[Darren Morgan]] 9\u20133 in the final. Ranked 93rd in the world at the time, he became the lowest-ranked player ever to win a ranking tournament.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} He never repeated this achievement, although he reached his second ranking final in the 1994 [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], losing 6\u20139 to [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]].\n\n===Top 16 (1996\u20132002)===\n\nAfter 1994 Harold did not reach a third ranking final until 2008, although he has career reached a total of ten semi-finals in ranking tournaments to date, and was a Top-16 player for four seasons between [[Snooker world rankings 1995/1996|1995/1996]] and [[Snooker world rankings 2001/2002|2001/2002]], reaching a career-best position of no. 11 in the [[Snooker world rankings 1996/1997|world rankings in the 1996/97 season]]. In the 1996 Welsh Open, he lost in the semi-finals, 1\u20136, to eventual winner [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]].\n\nHe contended in his first and only [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] quarter-final in [[World Snooker Championship 1996|the 1996 event]], where he lost 7\u201313 to [[Nigel Bond]]. He also lost 5\u20136 to Bond in his 1996 British Open semi-final less than two weeks earlier.\n\nIn the 1998 [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], he knocked out [[Stephen Hendry]] and [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] en route to the semi-finals, but lost narrowly to eventual champion [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]]. 1998 also saw him reach his first semi-final in the UK Championship, where he was defeated 9\u20137 by [[Matthew Stevens]].\n\nIn the 1999 [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] Harold led Mark Williams 5\u20133 in the semi-finals but lost 5\u20136. This was Harold's last ranking semi-final until 2008, although he also reached the semis in the non-ranking 2001 [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]], defeating [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] and [[John Parrott]], but losing his semi-final 5\u20136 to eventual runner-up [[Fergal O'Brien]] after having led 5\u20131.\n\n===2003\u20132015===\nFollowing a poor season in 2001\u20132002, Harold dropped out of the Top 16, down to number 29 in the World Rankings. A broken wrist sustained on New Year's Eve 2003 saw him drop further down the rankings,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} out of the top 32, although he had a better [[Snooker world rankings 2005/2006|2005/2006 season]]. Another consistent season in [[Snooker world rankings 2006/2007|2006/2007]] helped Harold back up to No. 30 in the [[Snooker world rankings 2007/2008|world rankings for 2007/2008]].\n\n2007/2008 started with a quarter-final appearance in the [[Shanghai Masters (snooker)|Shanghai Masters]], losing to eventual winner [[Dominic Dale]]. Harold did not get past the round robin phase of the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]], finishing fifth in his group of six players; but in the 2007 [[UK Championship]], Harold eliminated World Number 2 [[Graeme Dott]] 9\u20137 in the first round to achieve a place in the last 16 of the tournament for the first time since 1999. However, he lost 2\u20139 in the second round to [[Mark Selby]]. He qualified for the final stages of the World Championship with a 10\u20134 win over [[Mike Dunn (snooker player)|Mike Dunn]], but lost 10\u20133 at the Crucible in the first round proper to [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]].\n\nDuring a preliminary round match against local wildcard [[Jin Long (snooker player)|Jin Long]] in the [[China Open 2008 (snooker)|2008 China Open]], Harold was locked at 4\u20134. He took time out before the deciding frame to leave the playing arena and consume a couple of bananas, returning replenished to finish the job with a clearance on the colours. This gave rise to the affectionate nickname \"[[Bananaman]]\" on the [[Betfair]] snooker forum,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} referring to a children's TV character who gained superhuman powers. Harold also put up a battle against [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]] in the next round, but eventually lost 5\u20133; the last frame set a record at the time for being the longest ever in snooker history (93 minutes and 12 seconds).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nHarold retained his Top 32 ranking, and started the [[Snooker season 2008/2009|2008/2009]] season ranked at [[Snooker world rankings 2008/2009|#28]], his highest ranking since 2003. In the first ranking event of the new season, the [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy]], he beat [[Ricky Walden]] 5\u20132, [[Graeme Dott]] 5\u20133, [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]] 5\u20134 and defending champion [[Stephen Maguire]] to reach the semi-finals, his first appearance at that stage of a ranking event for five years. He then moved into a 5\u20131 lead against [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] and won 6\u20134, to reach his first final since 1994, which he lost 9\u20133 to [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]].<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/7591068.stm Classy O'Sullivan wins NI Trophy]\", BBC Sport, 31 August 2008. Retrieved on 1 September 2008.</ref> Harold's performance in this tournament moved him up to 14th in the provisional world rankings. Harold remarked after the final that, aside from claiming the World Championship, his one other remaining ambition in the game is to score a victory over O'Sullivan, who he has never beaten in a ranking tournament. The [[2008 Northern Ireland Trophy]] marked his tenth consecutive failure to do so.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/content/articles/2006/04/19/local_tv_archive_snooker_champs_dave_harold_ronnie_osullivan_feature.shtml</ref>\n\nHarold subsequently qualified for the [[2008 Shanghai Masters]] and [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]]. In the former, he defeated home favourite [[Ding Junhui]] in the last 32, before losing 4\u20135 (from 3\u20130 and 4\u20131 up) against [[Steve Davis]]; however, in the latter he was eliminated in the first round by [[Ali Carter]]. A less successful run of results in the second half of the season saw him fall out of the Top 16 in the provisional rankings, largely due to his failure to qualify for the 2009 World Championship, although he started the 2009/2010 season ranked at No. 19, an improvement of nine places on the previous season.\n\nHarold appeared in the Welsh Open in January 2010 but lost in the first round 5\u20131 to Stephen Hendry. In September he beat Shaun Murphy 3\u20130 in the newly formed World Open in Glasgow but subsequently lost in the next round to Jamie Cope 3\u20132.\n\n[[File:Dave Harold at Snooker German Masters (DerHexer) 2013-01-31 02.jpg|thumb|Dave Harold at [[2013 German Masters]].]]\nThe [[Snooker season 2012/2013|2012/2013]] season saw Harold win 2 qualifying matches to reach the main stages of the [[2012 Wuxi Classic]], however, he lost his wildcard match to Chinese player [[Rouzi Maimaiti]]. Harold subsequently failed to qualify for the next four ranking events, losing to players such as [[Ali Carter]], [[Barry Hawkins]], and [[Cao Yupeng]]. He did, however, qualify for the [[2013 German Masters|German Masters]], beating [[Craig Steadman]] 5\u20133 and [[Ryan Day (snooker player)|Ryan Day]] 5\u20134 to qualify for the Last 32 of the event, where he lost 3\u20135 to former world champion [[Graeme Dott]]. He only won 1 more match in ranking event qualifiers for the rest of the season, culminating with a 9\u201310 defeat the [[Alfie Burden]] in qualifying for the [[2013 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]]. Harold played in many of the [[Players Tour Championship 2012/2013|Players Tour Championship]] event throughout the season, his best results being three Last 16 appearances, and a further two Last 32 results, finishing 39th on the Order of Merit, outside of the Top 26 that qualified for the [[Players Tour Championship 2012/2013 \u2013 Finals|Finals]].\n\nHarold started the [[Snooker season 2013/2014|2013/2014]] season ranked 50th in the [[Snooker world rankings 2013/2014|world rankings]]. He retired in May 2015 after suffering from eyesight problems.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dave Harold quits snooker due to poor sight|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Dave-Harold-quits-snooker-poor-sight/story-26434893-detail/story.html|accessdate=3 May 2015|work=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]|date=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nHarold was born in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and still lives there to this day.
