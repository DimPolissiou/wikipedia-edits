The debut solo single released by British singer [[Dusty Springfield]] under her long-time producer [[Johnny Franz]], \"I Only Want to Be with You\" peaked at number 4 on the [[UK Singles chart]] in January 1964. Three remakes of the song have been UK chart hits, the first two by the [[Bay City Rollers]] (1976) and [[the Tourists]] (1979) matching the number 4 peak of the Dusty Springfield original, while the 1989 remake by [[Samantha Fox]] peaked at number 16. In the US on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, \"I Only Want to Be with You\" has been a [[Top 40]] hit three times, with both the Dusty Springfield original and the Bay City Rollers' remake peaking at number 12 while the Samantha Fox remake peaked at number 31. \"I Only Want to Be with You\" has also been recorded by a wide range of artists, several of whom sing the song with lyrics translated from the original English.\n\n==Dusty Springfield version==\n\n=== Background ===\nAccording to Jean Ryder, the ex-wife of songwriter Mike Hawker, \"I Only Want to Be With You\" was written soon after she and Hawker married on 1 December 1961, being inspired by Hawker's intense romantic feelings for his new bride. Ryder, who would later be a member of [[the Breakaways]], had been a member of a vocal chorale, [[the Vernons Girls]]. Reportedly, she and Hawker had intended that she herself would record \"I Only Want to Be With You\". However, no formal arrangement for this eventuality had apparently been made by the autumn of 1963, when Hawker received a phone call from Philips A&R director [[Johnny Franz]]. Ryder paraphrases Franz as saying \"Look we need something which is going to put this girl into the charts, because everybody is knocking her, everybody is saying she'll never make it [solo] - have you got a song that's a guaranteed hit?\" Springfield had already recorded nine solo tracks, none of which was deemed the right vehicle to launch her solo career. With Ryder's permission, Hawker submitted \"I Only Want to Be With You\" to Franz, having made a [[demo (music)|demo]] featuring Ryder singing while keeping the beat by tapping on a biscuit tin lid. Franz, and then Springfield, approved the song, which Springfield recorded in a 25 October 1963 session at [[Olympic Studios]], arranged and conducted by Ivor Raymonde, and recorded by engineer Keith Grant. Jean Ryder was included in the vocal chorale on the session. For unknown reasons, a version with (Dusty's) unadulterated vocals was rejected.<ref>{{cite book| first=Karen| last=Bartlett| title=Dusty: an intimate portrait of a musical legend| year=2015| publisher=The Robson Press| location=London| ISBN=9781849548762}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| first=Paul| last=Howes| title=The Complete Dusty Springfield| year=2007| publisher=Titan Books| location=London| isbn=978-0857681409}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/659117/Revealed-Secret-Dusty-Springfield-hit |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413025745/http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/659117/Revealed-Secret-Dusty-Springfield-hit |archive-date=2016-04-13 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nReleased in November 1963, three weeks after the Springfields' final concert, \"I Only Want to Be With You\" was a global success, reaching number 4 UK, number 12 US, number 6 Australia, and number 21 Canada.  In the US, Dusty Springfield was the second artist of the [[British Invasion]], after the [[Beatles]], to have a hit, entering the Billboard chart at number 77 in the last week of January 1964 (the Beatles having \"[[She Loves You]]\" at number 69 and \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\" at number 3).\n\nRaymonde's arrangement is unmistakable, with its relentless \"ticker-ticker\" beat and cascading drum rolls, full-on choirs and \"Tower of Power\" horn section pitched against soaring rock strings. It set the production standard for Springfield's later hits, such as \"Stay Awhile\" and \"Little by Little\". Springfield also recorded the song with an almost identical arrangement in German, with the title \"Auf dich nur wart' ich immerzu\".\n\nThe song was performed by Springfield on the first-ever edition of the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', on 1 January 1964.\n\nSpringfield's version was re-released in 1988, coinciding with its use in a soft-drink commercial, as a 7\" & 12\" single (see cover in infobox), peaking at number 83 in the UK.\n\nSpringfield's \"I Only Want to Be with You\" served as theme song for the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Arliss]]'', from 1997 to 2002 (replacing \"[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]\" by the [[Four Tops]] which was the series' theme in its inaugural 1996 season).\n\n===Chart performance===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1964)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|[[ARIA Charts|Australian ARIA Charts]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|[[Canadian Singles Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|7|song=I Only Want to Be with You|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}\n|-\n|[[Recorded Music NZ|New Zealand Charts]]<ref>[http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20lever&qartistid=37#n_view_location Dusty Springfield - Flavour of New Zealand].

''Dedication'' was the first Bay City Rollers recorded under the auspices of [[Arista Records]], and it was Arista president [[Clive Davis]] who suggested that the group remake \"I Only Want to Be with You.\" Jimmy Ienner was chosen by Davis to produce the Bay City Rollers on the basis of Ienner's work with the [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]].\n\nIn the US \"I Only Want to Be with You\" was issued as advance single from ''Dedication'' in August 1976: that October the track reached a [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] peak of number 12, besting the number 28 peak of the precedent Bay City Rollers' single \"[[Rock and Roll Love Letter (song)|Rock and Roll Love Letter]]\" while failing to match the Top Ten success the group had enjoyed in 1975\u20131976 with \"[[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|Saturday Night]]\" and in 1976 with \"[[Money Honey (Bay City Rollers song)|Money Honey]]\". \"I Only Want to Be with You\" appeared to wrap up the group's burst of North American stardom as their next three US single releases were Top 40 shortfalls: however the group's fourth US single release subsequent to \"I Only Want to Be With You\": \"[[You Made Me Believe in Magic]]\", did afford the group a final Top Ten hit.\n\nIssued in the UK as a non-album single on 3 September 1976, \"I Only Wanna Be with You\" \u2013 so entitled \u2013 reached number 4 UK, affording the Bay City Rollers' a tenth and final Top Ten hit.\n\nIt's noteworthy that the US and UK chart peaks of the Bay City Rollers' 1976 remake of \"I Only Want to Be with You\" exactly match the US and UK chart peaks achieved in 1964 by the Dusty Springfield original. However the Springfield original version had had a significantly stronger UK chart run holding at number 4 for 4 weeks \u2013 as opposed to the Bay City Rollers remake's one week chart peak \u2013 with the original's Top 50 tenure of 18 weeks being twice as long as the remake's. Conversely in the US the Bay City Rollers' remake had a ''Billboard'' Hot 100 tenure of 15 weeks while the Springfield original had maintained a Hot 100 presence for 10 weeks in total.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Joel |last1=Whitman |title=Top Pop Singles 1955\u20132002 |publisher=Record Research |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-89820-155-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/294 294] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/294 }}</ref> (Comparisons between the chart impact of singles issued in distinct time periods should be considered imprecise, the methodology behind both the UK and US chart rankings having been frequently revised.)\n\n===Chart performance===\n{{col-begin|width=65%}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Weekly charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|[[ARIA Charts|Australia]]<ref>[http://www.austchartbook.com.au/ David Kent's \"Australian Chart Book 1970-1992\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305064644/http://www.austchartbook.com.au/ |date=March 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|[[Austrian Singles Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|[[Belgian Singles Chart]] (Flanders)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|-\n|Canada [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'' Top Singles]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|Canada ''RPM'' Adult Contemporary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5121&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5121.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5121 |title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1976-10-06 |accessdate=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n|-\n|[[Dutch Singles Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n|[[Media Control Charts|German Singles Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n|[[Irish Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.irishcharts.ie |title=The Irish Charts - All there is to know |website=Irishcharts.ie |date=1962-10-01 |access-date=2016-09-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126040745/http://www.irishcharts.ie/ |archive-date=2010-01-26 |df= }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|[[Italian Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/indici/per_interprete/ab.htm |title=Hit Parade Italia - Indice per Interprete: B |website=Hitparadeitalia.it |date= |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n| Japan (Oricon)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|[[New Zealand Singles Chart]]<ref>[https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=Bay+City+Rollers&titel=I+Only+Wanna+Be+With+You&cat=s NZ Top 40 Singles, December 17, 1976]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17062/bay-city-rollers/ UK Official Charts, 11 November 1976]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]]<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |year= 1993 |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961\u20131993 |publisher= Record Research |page=24}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|27\n|-\n|US ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' Top 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19761023.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092327/http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19761023.html |archive-date=2015-05-18 |df= }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Rea]] cited \"[[Dusty Springfield]]'s 60's gem 'I Only Want to Be with You'\" as one of several tracks which \"Nicolette sings in an awkward warble, devoid of any emotional range\":<ref>''High Fidelity'' September 1982 \"Backbeat - Reviews\" by Steven X.

Larson's label [[Warner Records|WB Records]], electing not to issue a second single from ''All Dressed Up and No Place to Go'', were motivated by the underperformance of that album and its one single to end Larson's label tenure.

The debut solo single released by British singer [[Dusty Springfield]] under her long-time producer [[Johnny Franz]], \"I Only Want to Be with You\" peaked at number 4 on the [[UK Singles chart]] in January 1964. Three remakes of the song have been UK chart hits, the first two by the [[Bay City Rollers]] (1976) and [[the Tourists]] (1979) matching the number 4 peak of the Dusty Springfield original, while the 1989 remake by [[Samantha Fox]] peaked at number 16. In the US on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, \"I Only Want to Be with You\" has been a [[Top 40]] hit three times, with both the Dusty Springfield original and the Bay City Rollers' remake peaking at number 12 while the Samantha Fox remake peaked at number 31. \"I Only Want to Be with You\" has also been recorded by a wide range of artists, several of whom sing the song with lyrics translated from the original English.\n\n==Dusty Springfield version==\n\n=== Background ===\nAccording to Jean Ryder, the ex-wife of songwriter Mike Hawker, \"I Only Want to Be With You\" was written soon after she and Hawker married on 1 December 1961, being inspired by Hawker's intense romantic feelings for his new bride. Ryder, who would later be a member of [[the Breakaways]], had been a member of a vocal chorale, [[the Vernons Girls]]. Reportedly, she and Hawker had intended that she herself would record \"I Only Want to Be With You\". However, no formal arrangement for this eventuality had apparently been made by the autumn of 1963, when Hawker received a phone call from Philips A&R director [[Johnny Franz]]. Ryder paraphrases Franz as saying \"Look we need something which is going to put this girl into the charts, because everybody is knocking her, everybody is saying she'll never make it [solo] - have you got a song that's a guaranteed hit?\" Springfield had already recorded nine solo tracks, none of which was deemed the right vehicle to launch her solo career. With Ryder's permission, Hawker submitted \"I Only Want to Be With You\" to Franz, having made a [[demo (music)|demo]] featuring Ryder singing while keeping the beat by tapping on a biscuit tin lid. Franz, and then Springfield, approved the song, which Springfield recorded in a 25 October 1963 session at [[Olympic Studios]], arranged and conducted by Ivor Raymonde, and recorded by engineer Keith Grant. Jean Ryder was included in the vocal chorale on the session. For unknown reasons, a version with (Dusty's) unadulterated vocals was rejected.<ref>{{cite book| first=Karen| last=Bartlett| title=Dusty: an intimate portrait of a musical legend| year=2015| publisher=The Robson Press| location=London| ISBN=9781849548762}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| first=Paul| last=Howes| title=The Complete Dusty Springfield| year=2007| publisher=Titan Books| location=London| isbn=978-0857681409}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/659117/Revealed-Secret-Dusty-Springfield-hit |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413025745/http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/659117/Revealed-Secret-Dusty-Springfield-hit |archive-date=2016-04-13 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nReleased in November 1963, three weeks after the Springfields' final concert, \"I Only Want to Be With You\" was a global success, reaching number 4 UK, number 12 US, number 6 Australia, and number 21 Canada.  In the US, Dusty Springfield was the second artist of the [[British Invasion]], after the [[Beatles]], to have a hit, entering the Billboard chart at number 77 in the last week of January 1964 (the Beatles having \"[[She Loves You]]\" at number 69 and \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\" at number 3).\n\nRaymonde's arrangement is unmistakable, with its relentless \"ticker-ticker\" beat and cascading drum rolls, full-on choirs and \"Tower of Power\" horn section pitched against soaring rock strings. It set the production standard for Springfield's later hits, such as \"Stay Awhile\" and \"Little by Little\". Springfield also recorded the song with an almost identical arrangement in German, with the title \"Auf dich nur wart' ich immerzu\".\n\nThe song was performed by Springfield on the first-ever edition of the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', on 1 January 1964.\n\nSpringfield's version was re-released in 1988, coinciding with its use in a soft-drink commercial, as a 7\" & 12\" single (see cover in infobox), peaking at number 83 in the UK.\n\nSpringfield's \"I Only Want to Be with You\" served as theme song for the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Arliss]]'', from 1997 to 2002 (replacing \"[[I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)]]\" by the [[Four Tops]] which was the series' theme in its inaugural 1996 season).\n\n===Chart performance===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1964)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|[[ARIA Charts|Australian ARIA Charts]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|[[Canadian Singles Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|7|song=I Only Want to Be with You|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}\n|-\n|[[Recorded Music NZ|New Zealand Charts]]<ref>[http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20lever&qartistid=37#n_view_location Dusty Springfield - Flavour of New Zealand].

''Dedication'' was the first Bay City Rollers recorded under the auspices of [[Arista Records]], and it was Arista president [[Clive Davis]] who suggested that the group remake \"I Only Want to Be with You.\" Jimmy Ienner was chosen by Davis to produce the Bay City Rollers on the basis of Ienner's work with the [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]].\n\nIn the US \"I Only Want to Be with You\" was issued as advance single from ''Dedication'' in August 1976: that October the track reached a [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] peak of number 12, besting the number 28 peak of the precedent Bay City Rollers' single \"[[Rock and Roll Love Letter (song)|Rock and Roll Love Letter]]\" while failing to match the Top Ten success the group had enjoyed in 1975\u20131976 with \"[[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|Saturday Night]]\" and in 1976 with \"[[Money Honey (Bay City Rollers song)|Money Honey]]\". \"I Only Want to Be with You\" appeared to wrap up the group's burst of North American stardom as their next three US single releases were Top 40 shortfalls: however the group's fourth US single release subsequent to \"I Only Want to Be With You\": \"[[You Made Me Believe in Magic]]\", did afford the group a final Top Ten hit.\n\nIssued in the UK as a non-album single on 3 September 1976, \"I Only Wanna Be with You\" \u2013 so entitled \u2013 reached number 4 UK, affording the Bay City Rollers' a tenth and final Top Ten hit.\n\nIt's noteworthy that the US and UK chart peaks of the Bay City Rollers' 1976 remake of \"I Only Want to Be with You\" exactly match the US and UK chart peaks achieved in 1964 by the Dusty Springfield original. However the Springfield original version had had a significantly stronger UK chart run holding at number 4 for 4 weeks \u2013 as opposed to the Bay City Rollers remake's one week chart peak \u2013 with the original's Top 50 tenure of 18 weeks being twice as long as the remake's. Conversely in the US the Bay City Rollers' remake had a ''Billboard'' Hot 100 tenure of 15 weeks while the Springfield original had maintained a Hot 100 presence for 10 weeks in total.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Joel |last1=Whitman |title=Top Pop Singles 1955\u20132002 |publisher=Record Research |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-89820-155-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/294 294] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/294 }}</ref> (Comparisons between the chart impact of singles issued in distinct time periods should be considered imprecise, the methodology behind both the UK and US chart rankings having been frequently revised.)\n\n===Chart performance===\n{{col-begin|width=65%}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Weekly charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|[[ARIA Charts|Australia]]<ref>[http://www.austchartbook.com.au/ David Kent's \"Australian Chart Book 1970-1992\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305064644/http://www.austchartbook.com.au/ |date=March 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|[[Austrian Singles Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|[[Belgian Singles Chart]] (Flanders)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|-\n|Canada [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'' Top Singles]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|Canada ''RPM'' Adult Contemporary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5121&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5121.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5121 |title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1976-10-06 |accessdate=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n|-\n|[[Dutch Singles Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n|[[Media Control Charts|German Singles Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n|[[Irish Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.irishcharts.ie |title=The Irish Charts - All there is to know |website=Irishcharts.ie |date=1962-10-01 |access-date=2016-09-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126040745/http://www.irishcharts.ie/ |archive-date=2010-01-26 |df= }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|[[Italian Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/indici/per_interprete/ab.htm |title=Hit Parade Italia - Indice per Interprete: B |website=Hitparadeitalia.it |date= |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n| Japan\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|[[New Zealand Singles Chart]]<ref>[https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=Bay+City+Rollers&titel=I+Only+Wanna+Be+With+You&cat=s NZ Top 40 Singles, December 17, 1976]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17062/bay-city-rollers/ UK Official Charts, 11 November 1976]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]]<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |year= 1993 |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961\u20131993 |publisher= Record Research |page=24}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|27\n|-\n|US ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' Top 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19761023.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092327/http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19761023.html |archive-date=2015-05-18 |df= }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Released as a single in July 1982 - parallel with the album's release - Larson's version featured as [[A-side and B-side#B-side|B-side]] \"How Can We Go On\", a track from Larson's 1981 album ''[[Radioland (album)|Radioland]]'' which had been an unsuccessful 1981 [[A-side and B-side#A-side|A-side]] release.\n\nReviewing ''All Dressed Up and No Place to Go'', ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]'' critic [[Steven Rea|Steven X. Rea]] cited \"[[Dusty Springfield]]'s 60's gem 'I Only Want to Be with You'\" as one of several tracks which \"Nicolette sings in an awkward warble, devoid of any emotional range\":<ref>''High Fidelity'' September 1982 \"Backbeat - Reviews\" by Steven X. Rea p.76-77</ref> Larson's \"I Only Want to Be with You\" drew similarly dismissive reaction from Tom Long of the ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'', who rated the original 1963 hit a \"swell oldie [that's an] ingratiating piece of fluff\" and Larson's remake \"awful [although] despite uninspired vocals and sheet musicianship [it] sounds good on the radio simply because the song itself sounds good and tickles forotten memory synapses\",<ref>''Santa Cruz Sentinel'' 27 August 1982 \"Records\" by Tom Long p.24</ref> and also Bill Provick of the ''Ottawa Citizen'' who opined Larson gave \"a rather lacklustre reading of [a] normally effervescent pop-rock classic.\"<ref>''Ottawa Citizen'' 10 September 1982 \"Revolutions\" by Bill Provick p71.</ref> Tim Gebhart of the ''Rapid City Journal'' was more positive: \"Larson['s] version remains true to the original but also contains her own special touch in the vocals.\"<ref>''Rapid City Journal'' 20 August 1982 \"Sounds '82\" by Tim Gebhart p.V-5</ref>\n\nDespite becoming Larson's fourth single to rank on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine - and her first Hot 100 entry since 1980 - \"I Only Want to Be with You\" would prove a [[Top 40]] shortfall stalling at #53 in September 1983. Larson's label [[Warner Records|WB Records]], electing not to issue a second single from ''All Dressed Up and No Place to Go'', were motivated by the underperformance of that album and its one single to end Larson's label tenure. Larson would have one subsequent major label affiliation, having two [[country music|C&W]]-focused albums released by [[MCA Records]] in 1985-86.\n\n==Samantha Fox version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = I Only Wanna Be with You\n| cover      = I Only Wanna Be With You single cover - Samantha Fox.jpg\n| alt        =\n| border     = yes\n| caption    = 12-inch single cover\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Samantha Fox]]\n| album      = [[I Wanna Have Some Fun]]\n| B-side     = Confession\n| released   = January 1989\n| format     =\n* [[7-inch single|7-inch]]\n* [[12-inch single|12-inch]]\n* [[CD single|CD]]\n* [[Mini CD single|mini CD]]\n| recorded   = \n| studio     = PWL, The Borough, London\n| genre      = [[Pop music|Pop]]<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r7692}}</ref>\n| length     = 2:45\n| label      = [[Jive Records|Jive]]\n| writer     =\n* Mike Hawker\n* [[Ivor Raymonde]]\n| producer   = [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]\n| chronology = Samantha Fox\n| prev_title = [[I Wanna Have Some Fun (song)|I Wanna Have Some Fun]]\n| prev_year  = 1988\n| next_title = (Hurt Me, Hurt Me) But the Pants Stay On\n| next_year  = 1991\n| misc       = {{External music video|{{YouTube|EYFXLL09_9w|\"I Only Want to Be with You\"}}}}\n}}\n\nIn 1988, English singer [[Samantha Fox]] covered the song as \"I Only Wanna Be with You\" for her third studio album, ''[[I Wanna Have Some Fun]]'' (1988).\n\nFox would recall the song as being the first song she ever learned to sing, the Dusty Springfield original version being among a stack of singles her mother handed down to Fox when Fox was aged ten.<ref>''Honolulu Star-Bulletin'' 8 June 1989 \"Music Fans Have Pick of Sweet Sounds: three artists serve up pop & soulful fare in three venues\" by John Berger p.E-1</ref>\n\nReleased as the follow-up single to the [[I Wanna Have Some Fun (song)|album's title cut]], \"I Only Wanna Be With You\" was promoted with a music video which included scenes of Fox hunting through trash cans, dancing, fireworks, and the singer in bed with her bespectacled lover.<ref>{{YouTube|rvNn0srhdIQ}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> Fox also promoted the song via televised performances, including those on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1989 and ''Viva el espect\u00e1culo'' on [[TVE1]] in 1990.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0741670/ \"Viva el espect\u00e1culo\" Episode #1.15 (TV episode 1990) - IMDb<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0VwQCpC-8A |title=Samantha Fox - I Only Wanna Be With You (TOTP '89) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref>\n\n\"I Only Wanna Be with You\" essentially earned Fox her final global hit single.

{"title_page": "List of presidents of France", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}\n{{Politics of France}}\nBelow is a list of presidents of France. The first [[President of the French Republic]] is considered to be [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] (later Napoleon III), who was elected in the [[1848 French presidential election|1848 election]], under the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]]. The current officeholder has been [[Emmanuel Macron]] since 14 May 2017. He was elected in the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 election]].\n\n[[Jean Casimir-Perier]] spent the shortest time in office, resigning in 1895, six months and 20 days after taking office. Five other presidents of France resigned before the end of their term: [[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta|Patrice de MacMahon]] in 1879, [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]] in 1887, [[Alexandre Millerand]] in 1924, [[Ren\u00e9 Coty]] in 1959 and [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1969. [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] served the longest, nearly fourteen years from 1981 to 1995. Of the individuals elected as President of the French Republic, two died in office of natural causes ([[F\u00e9lix Faure]] and [[Georges Pompidou]]) and two were assassinated ([[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] and [[Paul Doumer]]).\n\n==French First Republic==\n{{detail|List of Presidents of the National Convention}}\nAfter the establishment of the [[French First Republic]] in 1792, the [[Separation of powers|three powers of the State]] were entrusted to the [[National Convention]], the unicameral parliament. The National Convention was led by a presidency, which rotated fortnightly. From 1793 the National Convention was dominated by its sub-committee, [[Committee of Public Safety]], in which the leading figures were [[Georges Danton]] and then [[Maximilien Robespierre]].\n\nAfter the [[9th Thermidor]], Robespierre and his followers were arrested and executed, and the National Convention was replaced by a \"[[Corps l\u00e9gislatif|Legislative Body]]\" divided in [[Council of Five Hundred]] (lower house) and [[Council of Ancients]] (upper house), while the executive power was taken by a [[French Directory|Directory]]. The Directory was officially led by a president, as stipulated by Article 141 of the [[Constitution of the Year III]]. An entirely ceremonial post, the first president was [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell]] who was chosen by lot on 2 November 1795. The directors conducted their elections privately, with the presidency rotating every three months.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/france/directory_1795_99/ |title=France: Presidents of the Executive Directory: 1795-1799 |author=Cheynet, Pierre-Dominique |year=2013 |publisher=Archontology.org |accessdate=16 November 2013 }}</ref> The last president was Gohier.<ref name=LS199>Lefebvre & Soboul, p. 199.</ref> The leading figure of the Directory was [[Paul Barras]], the only director to serve throughout the Directory.\n\nIn 1799, the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] deposed the Directory in favor to General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The parliamentarian [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s]] was a proponent of a new system of government for the Republic; the coup initially seemed certain to bring his system into force.

The first [[President of the French Republic]] is considered to be [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] (later Napoleon III), who was elected in the [[1848 French presidential election|1848 election]], under the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]]. The current officeholder has been [[Emmanuel Macron]] since 14 May 2017. He was elected in the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 election]].\n\n[[Jean Casimir-Perier]] spent the shortest time in office, resigning in 1895, six months and 20 days after taking office. Five other presidents of France resigned before the end of their term: [[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta|Patrice de MacMahon]] in 1879, [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]] in 1887, [[Alexandre Millerand]] in 1924, [[Ren\u00e9 Coty]] in 1959 and [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1969. [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] served the longest, nearly fourteen years from 1981 to 1995. Of the individuals elected as President of the French Republic, two died in office of natural causes ([[F\u00e9lix Faure]] and [[Georges Pompidou]]) and two were assassinated ([[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] and [[Paul Doumer]]).\n\n==French First Republic==\n{{detail|List of Presidents of the National Convention}}\nAfter the establishment of the [[French First Republic]] in 1792, the [[Separation of powers|three powers of the State]] were entrusted to the [[National Convention]], the unicameral parliament. The National Convention was led by a presidency, which rotated fortnightly. From 1793 the National Convention was dominated by its sub-committee, [[Committee of Public Safety]], in which the leading figures were [[Georges Danton]] and then [[Maximilien Robespierre]].\n\nAfter the [[9th Thermidor]], Robespierre and his followers were arrested and executed, and the National Convention was replaced by a \"[[Corps l\u00e9gislatif|Legislative Body]]\" divided in [[Council of Five Hundred]] (lower house) and [[Council of Ancients]] (upper house), while the executive power was taken by a [[French Directory|Directory]]. The Directory was officially led by a president, as stipulated by Article 141 of the [[Constitution of the Year III]]. An entirely ceremonial post, the first president was [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell]] who was chosen by lot on 2 November 1795. The directors conducted their elections privately, with the presidency rotating every three months.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/france/directory_1795_99/ |title=France: Presidents of the Executive Directory: 1795-1799 |author=Cheynet, Pierre-Dominique |year=2013 |publisher=Archontology.org |accessdate=16 November 2013 }}</ref> The last president was Gohier.<ref name=LS199>Lefebvre & Soboul, p. 199.</ref> The leading figure of the Directory was [[Paul Barras]], the only director to serve throughout the Directory.\n\nIn 1799, the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] deposed the Directory in favor to General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The parliamentarian [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s]] was a proponent of a new system of government for the Republic; the coup initially seemed certain to bring his system into force. The [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] establish a new government called [[French Consulate|Consulate]], composed by Bonaparte, [[Jean Jacques R\u00e9gis de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s|R\u00e9gis de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s]] and [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun, duc de Plaisance|Lebrun]] as first, second and third consuls, respectively.

We shall therefore not be contradicted if we class the Malay race among the Mongoloid nations. Yet their linguistic characters entitle them to a separate place.\" When Peschel said that the linguistic characters of Malays \"entitle them to a separate place\", Peschel did not mean make Malays not Mongoloid.

Nearly one-third of Native American genes come from an early West Eurasian people linked to the ancestors of Middle Easterners and Europeans, with the remaining two thirds deriving from early East Asian populations, rather than entirely from East Asians as previously thought, according to a newly sequenced genome. Based on the arm bone of a 24,000-year-old Siberian youth, the research could uncover new origins for America's indigenous peoples, as well as stir up fresh debate on Native American identities, experts say.

In the [[Caucasian race|CAUCASIAN RACE]], the head is of the most symmetrical shape, almost round; the forehead of moderate extent; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] rather narrow, without any projection, but having a direction downwards from the [[Zygomatic process|malar process]] of the frontal bone; the [[Alveolar ridge|alveolar edge]] well rounded; the front teeth of both jaws placed perpendicularly. The face is of an oval shape, and straight; the features moderately prominent; the forehead arched; nose narrow, and slightly arched, or at least with the bridge somewhat convex; cheek-bones not projecting; mouth small, with the lips slightly turned out, particularly the lower one; chin full and round. The Caucasians are of [[Human skin color|all complexions]], from the [[Hindus|Hindoos]] and [[Arabs]], some of whom are as [[dark skin|black]] as African [[negro]]es, to the [[Danes]] and [[Swedes]], and [[Norsemen]], who are [[light skin|fair]], with [[blond|flaxen hair]] and light [[Eye color#blue|blue eyes]]. In this class are comprised the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Europe]] (except the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] and [[Finns]]), the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Western Asia]], as far as the [[Ob River|Oby]], the Belurtagh, and the [[Ganges]], such as the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Babylon|Bablyonians]], [[Medes]] and [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Jews]], [[Arabs]], and [[Syrians]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[Tatars]] properly so called, the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|tribes of Caucasus]], the [[Armenians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]], and [[Hindus|Hindoos]]; the [[North Africans|Africans who live on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea]], and throughout the [[Sahara]], the [[Egyptians]] and [[Copts]], the [[Habesha peoples|Abyssinians]], and the [[Guanches]], or ancient people of the [[Canary Islands]]. To these we need hardly add the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists who have settled in America]] and other parts of the world. The complexion of this class of people seems to depend very much upon climate and the degree of solar heat to which they are exposed; for they are all, without exception, born with [[light skin|light complexions]], and become dark only as they grow up, and are more [[Sun tanning|exposed to the sun]]. Their colour is found to deepen by regular gradation from the furthest north, where the people of this race are very fair, through the [[Olive (color)|olive-coloured]] people of the [[Southern France|south of France]], and of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the swarthy [[Moors]], till the gradation ends with the [[Black people|deep-black natives]] of the [[African desert|African]] and [[Arabian Desert|Arabian deserts]], and of [[wikt:intertropical|intertropical]] [[India]]. White seems to be the characteristic of the race, but it is everywhere subject to the influence of climate. The Caucasians are therefore properly enough called the [[White people|WHITE RACE]], though some of them are perfectly black. Their hair, whether [[wikt:melanic|melanic]] or [[wikt:xanthous|xanthous]], is always long and lank, and never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]] like that of the [[negro]]es.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|II.  &nbsp;&nbsp;The Mongolian Class\n|-\n|<p>II. The MONGOLIAN CLASS has the head almost square; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] projecting; the nose flat; the [[nasal bone]]s and the space between the eyebrows nearly on the same horizontal plane with the cheek-bones; the arches of the eyebrows scarcely to be perceived; the nostrils narrow; the chin slightly prominent. The face is broad and flat, with the parts imperfectly distinguished; the space between the eyes flat and very broad; nose flat; cheeks projecting, round, and narrow; the linear opening of the eyelids extending towards the temples; the [[Epicanthic fold|inner corner]] of the eye sunk towards the nose, and the upper eyelid at that part continued into the lower by a rounded sweep. The complexion is generally [[Olive (color)|olive]], which is sometimes very slight, and approaching to yellow, or what is called [[wikt:sallow|sallow]]; and none of this class are known to be [[light skin|fair-complexioned]]. The iris of their eyes is black; their [[Black hair|hair black]], straight, and strong, but seldom curled, or in great abundance; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprised the numerous tribes that occupy the [[Central Asia|central]], [[Northeast Asia|north-east]], [[East Asia|east]] and [[Southeast Asia|south-east parts of Asia]]; the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]; the [[Tibetan people|people of Tibet]], [[Bhutan|Boutan]], and [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indo-china]]; the [[Finns|Fins]] and the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] of the [[Northern Europe|north of Europe]], and the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], who live along the shores of the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]], in [[Americas|America]] and [[Greenland]]. The colour of the class is influenced in a slight degree by climate; those of them, and those parts of the body most [[sun tanning|exposed to the sun]] and the air, being the darkest.<sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<sup>*</sup> Dr. Abel, physician to the last [[List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom#Asia|British embassy to China]], mentions in his volume of travels, that when any of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] boatmen cast off their clothes for the purpose of leaping into the water to push along the boats, they appeared to be dressed in light-coloured trowsers, though quite naked.\n\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|III. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Negroid|Ethiopic]] or [[Black people|Black Race]]\n|-\n|<p>III.

The face is narrow, with the lower part projecting; eyes prominent; nose spread, and almost confounded with the cheeks; the lips, particularly the upper one, very thick; the jaws prominent, and the chin retracted. The skin of this class, and the iris of the eye, are deep black; the [[Black hair|hair black]] and [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]; characteristics that vary less in the [[negro]]es than in the two former classes, for this very obvious reason, that the [[Negroid|Ethiopic race]] are to be found native mostly in [[tropical climate]]s, where there is little variety of temperature; and not like the Mongolian and [[Caucasian race]]s who are spread over all climates, from the [[equator]] to the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]]. In this class are comprised all the natives of [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Africa to the south of the Sahara]] and [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]; also the [[Aboriginal Australians|natives of New Holland]], [[Van Diemen's Land]] or [[Tasmania]], [[New Guinea|Papua, or New Guinea]], [[New Britain]], the [[Solomon Islands|Solomon Isles]], [[New Georgia]], the [[New Hebrides]], [[New Caledonia]], the [[Fiji|Feejee Islands]], and also various tribes throughout the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indian archipelago]].</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Class]]\n|-\n|<p>IV. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|AMERICAN CLASS]] approaches the Mongolian. The [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] are prominent, but more arched and rounded than in the [[Mongols|Mongol]], without being so angular, or projecting at the sides; the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] almost always deep; the shape of the forehead and the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] often [[Artificial cranial deformation|artificially modified]]; the skull generally light. The face is broad, without being flat; the features, viewed in profile, are prominent, and deeply marked; the forehead low, eyes deep-seated, nose rather flat, but prominent. The [[redskin|skin is red]], more or less [[dark skin|dark]], or [[Copper (color)|copper-coloured]], and approaching to [[dark skin|black]], according to climate and other circumstances. The hair is like that of the Mongolian class; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprehended all the [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|native American tribes and nations]], excepting, of course, the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], and the descendants of [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] and [[African diaspora in the Americas|African]] colonists.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|V. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Malay race|Malay Class]]\n|-\n|<p>V.

The face is less narrow than that of the [[negro]], somewhat advancing in the lower part, when seen in profile; the features generally more prominent than those of the negro, the nose full, broad, and thick towards the point, or what is called a [[wikt:bottle-nose|bottle-nose]].

Africa]] (including [[Madagascar]]), between the [[Sahara]] and the region of the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]]. He is of fair [[Human height|stature]]; his body and limbs are well made; his [[dark skin|skin is black]], with shades of brown; his eyes, [[Brown eye|brown]] or black; his [[black hair|hair is black]], short, and crisp; his [[beard]] and [[body hair|body-hair]] scanty. He is [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], the cranial index being often only seventy-three. His forehead is [[neoteny in humans|childlike]] and [[Femininity|feminine]]. The ''norma occipitalis'' is often [[wikt:pentagonal|pentagonal]]. Like the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]], there is generally [[prognathism]] (protruding jaws). The [[nasal bone]]s are depressed, giving a characteristic flat nose. The lips are coarse and projecting. The [[San people|Bushmen]] of the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]] area are a special type, marked by low [[Human height|stature]], the males not much exceeding 4 feet in height; both [[sex]]es, however, are well made. The skin is yellowish brown, the eyes and [[black hair|hair black]], the latter [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]. The [[wikt:anteroposterior|antero-posterior]] [[diameter]] of female [[pelvis]] is of great relative length. The [[steatopygia|accumulation of fat on the buttocks]], and the large [[Labia minora|nymphae]] of females, are also characteristic. [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] are said to be a cross between [[San people|Bushmen]] and [[Negro]]es. Another modification, the [[Negrito]]s, occurs in the [[Andaman Islands|Andamans]], [[Malacca]], [[Philippines]], [[Tasmania]], and the islands parallel to the [[Coastline of Australia|Australian coast]], from [[Wallace Line|Wallace's Line]] to [[New Caledonia]]. The [[Andamanese|Andamans]] have a cranial index of eighty; all the rest are doliocephalic, though some in the [[South|S.]] and [[East|E.]] approach the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]] in large [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]] and otherwise (''[[exempli gratia|e.g.]]'', [[Tasmania]], [[New Caledonia]], [[New Guinea]], and [[Torres Strait]]s). There is perhaps a cross with [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] in [[New Guinea]]; more probably a cross with [[Polynesians]] in the [[Fiji|Feejees]].</p><!--This quote is in the right column of page 585.-->\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Caucasian race|Xanthochroic Type]]\n|-\n|<p>(3) [[Nordic race|Xanthochroic]], or fair [[white people|whites]], found in the greater part of the population of [[Central Europe]].

They are sometimes very [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]], without prominent [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]], nose flat and small, eyes oblique. The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays proper]] and the [[Filipinos|indigenes of the Philippines]], who are not [[Negrito]]s, probably belong to this group. The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]], on the other hand, are distinguished chiefly by being [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]]; this characteristic occurs also in the ancient [[Ainu people|Ainos]] (found, for example, in [[Hokkaido|Yesso]]), who are further remarkable for the development of [[beard|hair on face]] and [[body hair|body]], and the dull-red earthy skin. The [[Dayak people|Dyaks]] of [[Borneo]], the [[Batak|Battaks]] of [[Sumatra]], the [[Alfur people|Alfures]] of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], are all [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], and seem to pass through the people of the [[Palau|Pelew Islands]] and of the [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] and [[Mariana Islands|Ladrone]] [[Archipelago]]s into the [[Polynesians]], in whom the straight hair and oblique eye have disappeared, the skull being long and coming back to the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid type]]. The [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type is best seen in the [[M\u0101ori people|Maoris]] of [[New Zealand]]; [[cephalic index|brachycephaly]] occurs in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich]] and [[Samoan Islands]]. [[Polynesian languages|Language]] shows that [[Polynesia]] was peopled from the west, and it is thought that the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type may be a cross between the [[Dayak people|Dyak]]-[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and the [[Negrito]] elements in [[Indonesia|Indo-nesia]]. In [[Northeast Asia|N.E. Asia]] the [[Chukchi people|Tchuktchi]] are said to be the same as the [[Eskimo]]s and [[Greenlandic Inuit|Greenlanders]] of [[North America|N. America]]; with Mongoloid hair and skin they have very long skulls. [[cephalic index|Doliocephaly]] also distinguishes the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aborigines of both Americas]] from the [[Asian people|Asiatic]] Mongoloid; only the [[Tehuelche people|Patagonians]] and the ancient [[Mound Builders|mound-builders]] are [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]].

Of these the [[Negroid|Ethiopian]] is secondarily divided into the African [[Negro]]es, the [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] and [[San people|Bushmen]], the [[wikt:oceanic|Oceanic]] [[Negro]]es or [[Melanesians]], and the [[Negrito]]s as represented by the inhabitants of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and other [[list of islands in the Pacific Ocean|Pacific islands]]. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Australians]], whom [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] takes as the type of a separate race, he considers to be a mixed people, as they combine the [[Negro]] type of face and skeleton, with hair of a different type. His second race is the Mongolian, represented in an exaggerated form by the [[Eskimo]], in its typical condition by most of the natives of [[North Asia|northern]] and [[East Asia|eastern Asia]], and in a modified type by the [[Malay race|Malays]]. Excluding the [[Eskimo]], the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Americans]] form one group, whose closest affinity is with the Mongolian, yet which has so many special features that it might be viewed as a fourth primary division.

Coon et al. said that Mongoloids have \"''reduced''\" brow ridges to decrease the size of the air spaces inside of their brow ridges known as the [[frontal sinus]]es which are \"''vulnerable''\" to the cold.<!--The source text stated that the sinuses were \"vulnerable\", but it did not explicitly state that they were \"vulnerable\" to the cold. However, the context of the paragraph which was about Mongoloid faces being cold adapted indicated that the word \"vulnerable\" referred to the cold. The source text implied that smaller brow ridges contain smaller frontal sinuses, but it did not explicitly state this in the source text's sentence \"Brow ridges, with their vulnerable sinuses, are reduced\".--> Coon et al. said that Mongoloid facial features reduce the surface area of the nose by having nasal bones that are flat against the face and having enlarged cheekbones that project forward which effectively reduce the external projection of the nose.<!--This information comes from the last paragraph of page 132 that starts with \"The bony orbit of the mongoloid\". Note that this paragraph has \"(1950:69)\" at the very end of it, and note that it is written in a smaller font than the other text. The reason for this difference is that the whole paragraph is a quote from Coon et al. (1950) as explained in the previous paragraph.

Typically, the nose is not very prominent on the face of a Mongoloid. Their frontal sinus is also reduced in order to allow more room for padding to protect from their cold environment. Regardless of the environment that the Mongoloid is in, their nose helps reduce the stress of the environment on their body by moistening the air inspired to cool the body off instead of doing a straight up heat exchange.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Human Biology |last1=Harrison |last2=Weiner |last3=Tanner |last4=Barnicot |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1977 |isbn= |location=Oxford |page=437}}</ref>\n\nThe Asian [[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|mt-DNA Haplogroup D]] has been shown in a small Japanese study<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 4169230|year = 2014|last1 = Nishimura|first1 = T.|title = Relationship between mitochondrial haplogroup and seasonal changes of physiological responses to cold|journal = Journal of Physiological Anthropology|volume = 33|issue = 1|page = 27|last2 = Watanuki|first2 = S.|pmid= 25183371|doi = 10.1186/1880-6805-33-27}}</ref> to provide greater heat production upon exposure to cold than other haplogroups prevalent in the area.\n\n=== Mongolian spot ===\n{{Main|Mongolian spot}}\nA Mongolian spot, also known as Mongolian blue spot, congenital dermal melanocytosis,<ref name=\"Bolognia\" /> and dermal melanocytosis<ref name=\"Bolognia\">{{cite book |author1=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |page=1720 |isbn=978-1-4160-2999-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> is a [[benign]], flat, [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] [[birthmark]] with wavy borders and irregular shape.

Forbes, professor of Native American Studies and Anthropology at the [[University of California, Davis]], said that the racial type of the indigenous people of the Americas does not fall into the Mongoloid racial category.<ref name=\"Forbes\" /> Forbes said that due to the various physical traits indigenous Americans exhibit, some with \"head shapes which seem hardly distinct from many Europeans\", indigenous Americans must have either been formed from a mixture of Mongoloid and Caucasoid races or they descend from the ancestral, common type of both Mongoloid and Caucasoid races.<ref name=\"Forbes\">Forbes, J.D. (1998). KENNEWICK MAN:A LEGAL HISTORICAL ANALYSIS. American Indian Review.</ref> According to the National geographic, Native Americans also have partial West Eurasian origins. Nearly one-third of Native American genes come from an early West Eurasian people linked to the ancestors of Middle Easterners and Europeans, with the remaining two thirds deriving from early East Asian populations, rather than entirely from East Asians as previously thought, according to a newly sequenced genome. Based on the arm bone of a 24,000-year-old Siberian youth, the research could uncover new origins for America's indigenous peoples, as well as stir up fresh debate on Native American identities, experts say.

In the [[Caucasian race|CAUCASIAN RACE]], the head is of the most symmetrical shape, almost round; the forehead of moderate extent; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] rather narrow, without any projection, but having a direction downwards from the [[Zygomatic process|malar process]] of the frontal bone; the [[Alveolar ridge|alveolar edge]] well rounded; the front teeth of both jaws placed perpendicularly. The face is of an oval shape, and straight; the features moderately prominent; the forehead arched; nose narrow, and slightly arched, or at least with the bridge somewhat convex; cheek-bones not projecting; mouth small, with the lips slightly turned out, particularly the lower one; chin full and round. The Caucasians are of [[Human skin color|all complexions]], from the [[Hindus|Hindoos]] and [[Arabs]], some of whom are as [[dark skin|black]] as African [[negro]]es, to the [[Danes]] and [[Swedes]], and [[Norsemen]], who are [[light skin|fair]], with [[blond|flaxen hair]] and light [[Eye color#blue|blue eyes]]. In this class are comprised the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Europe]] (except the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] and [[Finns]]), the ancient and modern inhabitants of [[Western Asia]], as far as the [[Ob River|Oby]], the Belurtagh, and the [[Ganges]], such as the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Babylon|Bablyonians]], [[Medes]] and [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Jews]], [[Arabs]], and [[Syrians]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[Tatars]] properly so called, the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|tribes of Caucasus]], the [[Armenians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]], and [[Hindus|Hindoos]]; the [[North Africans|Africans who live on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea]], and throughout the [[Sahara]], the [[Egyptians]] and [[Copts]], the [[Habesha peoples|Abyssinians]], and the [[Guanches]], or ancient people of the [[Canary Islands]]. To these we need hardly add the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists who have settled in America]] and other parts of the world. The complexion of this class of people seems to depend very much upon climate and the degree of solar heat to which they are exposed; for they are all, without exception, born with [[light skin|light complexions]], and become dark only as they grow up, and are more [[Sun tanning|exposed to the sun]]. Their colour is found to deepen by regular gradation from the furthest north, where the people of this race are very fair, through the [[Olive (color)|olive-coloured]] people of the [[Southern France|south of France]], and of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the swarthy [[Moors]], till the gradation ends with the [[Black people|deep-black natives]] of the [[African desert|African]] and [[Arabian Desert|Arabian deserts]], and of [[wikt:intertropical|intertropical]] [[India]]. White seems to be the characteristic of the race, but it is everywhere subject to the influence of climate. The Caucasians are therefore properly enough called the [[White people|WHITE RACE]], though some of them are perfectly black. Their hair, whether [[wikt:melanic|melanic]] or [[wikt:xanthous|xanthous]], is always long and lank, and never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]] like that of the [[negro]]es.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|II.  &nbsp;&nbsp;The Mongolian Class\n|-\n|<p>II. The MONGOLIAN CLASS has the head almost square; the [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] projecting; the nose flat; the [[nasal bone]]s and the space between the eyebrows nearly on the same horizontal plane with the cheek-bones; the arches of the eyebrows scarcely to be perceived; the nostrils narrow; the chin slightly prominent. The face is broad and flat, with the parts imperfectly distinguished; the space between the eyes flat and very broad; nose flat; cheeks projecting, round, and narrow; the linear opening of the eyelids extending towards the temples; the [[Epicanthic fold|inner corner]] of the eye sunk towards the nose, and the upper eyelid at that part continued into the lower by a rounded sweep. The complexion is generally [[Olive (color)|olive]], which is sometimes very slight, and approaching to yellow, or what is called [[wikt:sallow|sallow]]; and none of this class are known to be [[light skin|fair-complexioned]]. The iris of their eyes is black; their [[Black hair|hair black]], straight, and strong, but seldom curled, or in great abundance; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprised the numerous tribes that occupy the [[Central Asia|central]], [[Northeast Asia|north-east]], [[East Asia|east]] and [[Southeast Asia|south-east parts of Asia]]; the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]]; the [[Tibetan people|people of Tibet]], [[Bhutan|Boutan]], and [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indo-china]]; the [[Finns|Fins]] and the [[S\u00e1mi people|Laplanders]] of the [[Northern Europe|north of Europe]], and the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], who live along the shores of the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]], in [[Americas|America]] and [[Greenland]]. The colour of the class is influenced in a slight degree by climate; those of them, and those parts of the body most [[sun tanning|exposed to the sun]] and the air, being the darkest.<sup>*</sup></p>\n\n<sup>*</sup> Dr. Abel, physician to the last [[List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom#Asia|British embassy to China]], mentions in his volume of travels, that when any of the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] boatmen cast off their clothes for the purpose of leaping into the water to push along the boats, they appeared to be dressed in light-coloured trowsers, though quite naked.\n\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|III. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Negroid|Ethiopic]] or [[Black people|Black Race]]\n|-\n|<p>III.

The face is narrow, with the lower part projecting; eyes prominent; nose spread, and almost confounded with the cheeks; the lips, particularly the upper one, very thick; the jaws prominent, and the chin retracted. The skin of this class, and the iris of the eye, are deep black; the [[Black hair|hair black]] and [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]; characteristics that vary less in the [[negro]]es than in the two former classes, for this very obvious reason, that the [[Negroid|Ethiopic race]] are to be found native mostly in [[tropical climate]]s, where there is little variety of temperature; and not like the Mongolian and [[Caucasian race]]s who are spread over all climates, from the [[equator]] to the [[Arctic Ocean|Polar Sea]]. In this class are comprised all the natives of [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Africa to the south of the Sahara]] and [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]; also the [[Aboriginal Australians|natives of New Holland]], [[Van Diemen's Land]] or [[Tasmania]], [[New Guinea|Papua, or New Guinea]], [[New Britain]], the [[Solomon Islands|Solomon Isles]], [[New Georgia]], the [[New Hebrides]], [[New Caledonia]], the [[Fiji|Feejee Islands]], and also various tribes throughout the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indian archipelago]].</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Class]]\n|-\n|<p>IV. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|AMERICAN CLASS]] approaches the Mongolian. The [[Zygomatic bone|cheek-bones]] are prominent, but more arched and rounded than in the [[Mongols|Mongol]], without being so angular, or projecting at the sides; the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] almost always deep; the shape of the forehead and the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] often [[Artificial cranial deformation|artificially modified]]; the skull generally light. The face is broad, without being flat; the features, viewed in profile, are prominent, and deeply marked; the forehead low, eyes deep-seated, nose rather flat, but prominent. The [[redskin|skin is red]], more or less [[dark skin|dark]], or [[Copper (color)|copper-coloured]], and approaching to [[dark skin|black]], according to climate and other circumstances. The hair is like that of the Mongolian class; and they have little or no [[beard]]. In this class are comprehended all the [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|native American tribes and nations]], excepting, of course, the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]], and the descendants of [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] and [[African diaspora in the Americas|African]] colonists.</p>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|V. &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Malay race|Malay Class]]\n|-\n|<p>V.

The face is less narrow than that of the [[negro]], somewhat advancing in the lower part, when seen in profile; the features generally more prominent than those of the negro, the nose full, broad, and thick towards the point, or what is called a [[wikt:bottle-nose|bottle-nose]].

The males are of fair [[Human height|stature]], with well-developed torso and arms, but relatively and absolutely slender legs. The colour of the skin is some shade of chocolate brown, and the eyes very dark [[Brown eye|brown]] or black. Fine silky hair, usually [[wikt:raven-haired|raven black]], never [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]], but wavy and tolerably long. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Australians]] are [[Cephalic index|doliocephalic]] (long-skulled), the cranial index often not amounting to more than seventy-one or seventy-two. Nose broad rather than flat, jaws heavy, lips very coarse and flexible. ''Norma occipitalis'' sharply [[wikt:pentagonal|pentagonal]]. [[Brow ridge|Brow-ridges]] strong and prominent, teeth large, and [[Incisor|fangs]] strong. These marks are seen in the [[Dasa|Dasyu]] hill-tribes inhabiting the interior of the [[Deccan Plateau|Dekhan]]. The ordinary [[Coolie]] in an [[Indian people|East-Indiaman]] is nearly [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian]]. The [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], too, though changed by [[Ancient Egypt|civilisation]] and probably [[DNA history of Egypt|admixture]], has also the [[dark skin]], black silky wavy hair, long skull, fleshy lips, and broad [[Ala of nose|''alae'' of the nose]].</p><!--This quote is in the right column of page 585.-->\n|}\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#eaecf0;\"\n!colspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|(2)  &nbsp;&nbsp;The [[Negroid|Negroid Type]]\n|-\n|<p>(2) The [[Negroid|Negroid type]] is best represented by the [[negro]] of [[South Africa|S.

He is of fair [[Human height|stature]]; his body and limbs are well made; his [[dark skin|skin is black]], with shades of brown; his eyes, [[Brown eye|brown]] or black; his [[black hair|hair is black]], short, and crisp; his [[beard]] and [[body hair|body-hair]] scanty. He is [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], the cranial index being often only seventy-three. His forehead is [[neoteny in humans|childlike]] and [[Femininity|feminine]]. The ''norma occipitalis'' is often [[wikt:pentagonal|pentagonal]]. Like the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]], there is generally [[prognathism]] (protruding jaws). The [[nasal bone]]s are depressed, giving a characteristic flat nose. The lips are coarse and projecting. The [[San people|Bushmen]] of the [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]] area are a special type, marked by low [[Human height|stature]], the males not much exceeding 4 feet in height; both [[sex]]es, however, are well made. The skin is yellowish brown, the eyes and [[black hair|hair black]], the latter [[Afro-textured hair|woolly]]. The [[wikt:anteroposterior|antero-posterior]] [[diameter]] of female [[pelvis]] is of great relative length. The [[steatopygia|accumulation of fat on the buttocks]], and the large [[Labia minora|nymphae]] of females, are also characteristic. [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]] are said to be a cross between [[San people|Bushmen]] and [[Negro]]es. Another modification, the [[Negrito]]s, occurs in the [[Andaman Islands|Andamans]], [[Malacca]], [[Philippines]], [[Tasmania]], and the islands parallel to the [[Coastline of Australia|Australian coast]], from [[Wallace Line|Wallace's Line]] to [[New Caledonia]]. The [[Andamanese|Andamans]] have a cranial index of eighty; all the rest are doliocephalic, though some in the [[South|S.]] and [[East|E.]] approach the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid]] in large [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]] and otherwise (''[[exempli gratia|e.g.]]'', [[Tasmania]], [[New Caledonia]], [[New Guinea]], and [[Torres Strait]]s).

They are sometimes very [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]], without prominent [[brow ridge|brow-ridges]], nose flat and small, eyes oblique. The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays proper]] and the [[Filipinos|indigenes of the Philippines]], who are not [[Negrito]]s, probably belong to this group. The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]], on the other hand, are distinguished chiefly by being [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]]; this characteristic occurs also in the ancient [[Ainu people|Ainos]] (found, for example, in [[Hokkaido|Yesso]]), who are further remarkable for the development of [[beard|hair on face]] and [[body hair|body]], and the dull-red earthy skin. The [[Dayak people|Dyaks]] of [[Borneo]], the [[Batak|Battaks]] of [[Sumatra]], the [[Alfur people|Alfures]] of [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], are all [[cephalic index|doliocephalic]], and seem to pass through the people of the [[Palau|Pelew Islands]] and of the [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] and [[Mariana Islands|Ladrone]] [[Archipelago]]s into the [[Polynesians]], in whom the straight hair and oblique eye have disappeared, the skull being long and coming back to the [[Australo-Melanesian|Australioid type]]. The [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type is best seen in the [[M\u0101ori people|Maoris]] of [[New Zealand]]; [[cephalic index|brachycephaly]] occurs in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich]] and [[Samoan Islands]]. [[Polynesian languages|Language]] shows that [[Polynesia]] was peopled from the west, and it is thought that the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] type may be a cross between the [[Dayak people|Dyak]]-[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and the [[Negrito]] elements in [[Indonesia|Indo-nesia]]. In [[Northeast Asia|N.E. Asia]] the [[Chukchi people|Tchuktchi]] are said to be the same as the [[Eskimo]]s and [[Greenlandic Inuit|Greenlanders]] of [[North America|N. America]]; with Mongoloid hair and skin they have very long skulls. [[cephalic index|Doliocephaly]] also distinguishes the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aborigines of both Americas]] from the [[Asian people|Asiatic]] Mongoloid; only the [[Tehuelche people|Patagonians]] and the ancient [[Mound Builders|mound-builders]] are [[cephalic index|brachycephalic]].

The [[Aboriginal Australians|Australians]], whom [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] takes as the type of a separate race, he considers to be a mixed people, as they combine the [[Negro]] type of face and skeleton, with hair of a different type. His second race is the Mongolian, represented in an exaggerated form by the [[Eskimo]], in its typical condition by most of the natives of [[North Asia|northern]] and [[East Asia|eastern Asia]], and in a modified type by the [[Malay race|Malays]]. Excluding the [[Eskimo]], the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Americans]] form one group, whose closest affinity is with the Mongolian, yet which has so many special features that it might be viewed as a fourth primary division. His third or [[Caucasian race]] includes two [[wikt:subrace|sub-races]], \u2014 the [[Nordic race|Xanthochroic]] and [[Mediterranean race|Melanochroic]] of [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]].

We urge, therefore, that the expressions which imply a racial aspect of the condition be no longer used. Some of the undersigned are inclined to replace the term Mongolism by such designations as 'Langdon Down Anomaly', or 'Down's Syndrome or Anomaly', or 'Congenital Acromicria'.

Christensen.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|Artist's impression of [[Joseph Smith]] receiving the [[golden plates]] from the [[angel Moroni]].]]\n{{Book of Mormon}}\nThere are several theories as to the '''origin of the Book of Mormon'''. Most adherents to the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] view the book as a work of [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|inspired]] scripture. The most common belief of adherents is that promoted by [[Joseph Smith]], who said he [[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|translated]] ancient [[golden plates]] inscribed by [[List of Book of Mormon prophets|prophets]]. Smith claimed the [[angel Moroni]], a prophet in the Book of Mormon, directed him in the 1820s to [[Cumorah|a hill]] near his home in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]] where the plates were buried. Besides Smith himself, there were at least [[Book of Mormon witnesses|11 witnesses]] who said they saw the plates in 1829, and three also claiming to have been visited by an angel. Several other witnesses observed Smith dictating the text that eventually became the Book of Mormon.\n\nCritics have explored a number of issues, including (1) whether Joseph Smith actually had golden plates, or whether the text of the Book of Mormon originated in his mind or through inspiration; (2) whether it was Smith himself who composed the book's text or an associate of Smith's, such as [[Oliver Cowdery]] or [[Sidney Rigdon]]; and (3) whether the book was based on prior works, such as the ''[[View of the Hebrews]]'', the [[Spalding\u2013Rigdon theory of Book of Mormon authorship|Spalding Manuscript]], or the [[King James Version]] of the Bible.\n\n==Theories of authorship==\n\nThere are differing views on the origin of the Book of Mormon.\n# '''Miraculous origins theories''' generally accept Joseph Smith's own account, that he translated an ancient record<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation | title = Gospel Topics {{ndash}} Book of Mormon Translation | work = churchofjesuschrist.org | publisher = LDS Church  }}</ref> compiled and abridged by [[Mormon (Book of Mormon prophet)|Mormon]], a [[pre-Columbian]] resident of the Western Hemisphere.<br/>Variations of this theory only include that the text is a divinely inspired narrative, regardless of its [[Historical authenticity of the Book of \n===Miraculous origin theory===\n{{See also|Golden Plates|Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)}}\n[[File:JosephSmithTranslating.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Smith sitting on a wooden chair with his face in a hat|A depiction of Joseph Smith dictating the Book of Mormon by peering into a hat.]]\nAccording to the accounts of Joseph Smith and his associates, the original record was engraved on thin, malleable [[golden plates|sheets of metal]] (\"leaves\") with the appearance of [[gold]], and bound with three rings at one edge. The engraving was reportedly of considerable skill. According to the narrative of the book, the prophet-historian [[Mormon (Book of Mormon prophet)|Mormon]] abridged other records of the local civilizations from the preceding millennia.<ref>[[Words of Mormon]] [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1?lang=eng 1:3\u20136].</ref> Mormon then gave the record to his son, [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], who inscribed a few additional words of his own, and concealed the plates about AD 400.<ref name=\"churchofjesuschrist.org\">[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction/1?lang=eng Book of Mormon Introduction].</ref> Near the end of Moroni's life (approximately AD 421), he placed these plates along with several other items in a stone box in a hillside (now named [[Cumorah]]) near present-day [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]].\n\nBy Smith's account, on September 21, 1823, this same [[Angel Moroni|Moroni]], now an angel, appeared to Smith to instruct him about this ancient record and its destined translation into English.<ref name=\"churchofjesuschrist.org\"/> Smith was shown the location of the plates (and the other items in the box), but was not immediately allowed to take them. After four years of annually meeting with the angel, Smith was finally entrusted with the plates. Through the power of God and the [[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]] (ancient [[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seeing stones]] buried with the plates), he was able to translate the [[Reformed Egyptian]] inscriptions.<ref>According to {{lds|Mormon|morm|9|32|34}}</ref><ref>See [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng Joseph Smith\u2013History 1] for a complete record of Smith's account.</ref> Smith was commanded to show the plates to only certain people. Accounts by these individuals are recorded in the introduction of the Book of Mormon as \"The Testimony of the [[Three Witnesses]]\" and \"The Testimony of the [[Eight Witnesses]].\"\n\nSmith taught\u2014and most Mormons believe\u2014that the existence of the Book of Mormon was prophesied by Biblical scripture.<ref>Mormons believe that the following biblical passages prophesy or otherwise support the existence of the Book of Mormon:  Psalm 85:11; Ezekiel 37:15\u201320; John 10: 15\u201316; 2 Corinthians 13:1; Revelation 14:6\u20137.</ref>\n\n[[John Rigdon]], discussing an interview with his father [[Sidney Rigdon]] in 1865, states:\n\n<blockquote>My father, after I had finished saying what I have repeated above, looked at me a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: \"My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I have told you about the origin of [the Book of Mormon] is true. Your mother and sister, Mrs. Athalia Robinson, were present when that book was handed to me in Mentor, Ohio, and all I ever knew about the origin of [the Book of Mormon] was what Parley P. Pratt, Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith and the witnesses who claimed they saw the plates have told me, and in all of my intimacy with Joseph Smith he never told me but one story.<ref name=\"Spaulding 1996\"/></blockquote>\n\nOliver Cowdery's wife confirmed, after Cowdery's death, that he had never denied his testimony as one of the Three Witnesses:\n\n<blockquote>He always without one doubt or shudder of turning affirmed the divinity and truth of the Book of Mormon.<ref>Elizabeth Cowdery to David Whitmer, March 8, 1887, published in the religious periodical The Return 3, no. 5 (Dec. 1892): page 7.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDavid Whitmer was similarly adamant that none of the Three Witnesses ever denied their affidavit that they had seen the angel Moroni, who showed them the plates of gold, and that The Book of Mormon was of divine origin - even though each of the three separated from Joseph Smith and the church they had helped him found. Before his death, Whitmer wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Unto all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People, unto whom these presents shall come: ... I wish now, standing as it were, in the very sunset of life, and in the fear of God, once [and] for all to make this public statement: That I have never at any time denied that testimony [of the Book of Mormon] or any part thereof, which has so long since been published with that book, as one of the Three Witnesses. Those who know me best well know that I have always adhered to that testimony. And that no man may be misled or doubt my present views in regard to the same, I do again affirm the truth of all my statements as then made and published ... I submit this statement to the world; God in whom I trust being my judge as to the sincerity of my motives and the faith and hope that is in me of eternal life. My sincere desire is that the world may be benefited by this plain and simple statement of the truth.<ref>David Whitmer as published in the ''Conservator,'' Richmond, Missouri, March 25, 1881.</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I also testify to the world, that neither Oliver Cowdery or Martin Harris ever at any time denied their testimony. ...

Both Rigdon and Cowdery had more formal education than Smith.\n\n[[David Persuitte]] highlights a [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] of Smith's from March 1829, that apparently limited Smith's power to translation. Persuitte argues the wording of the revelations indicates at least one other secret collaborator, as \"if he had some partners who had imposed it upon him in order to prevent him from gathering too much power to himself.\"<ref>David Persuitte, ''Joseph Smith and the Origins of The Book of Mormon'', 2d ed., p. 18.</ref> In contrast, co-authors [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] argue the early text of the revelation merely demonstrates that \"Joseph Smith was not planning on doing any other work besides the Book of Mormon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/changingtherevelations.htm|title=Changing the Revelations, The Case Against Mormonism Chapter 6|website=www.utlm.org}}</ref>\n\n====Oliver Cowdery====\n[[File:Olivercowdery-sm.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Oliver Cowdery]]\n[[Oliver Cowdery]] was a third-cousin of [[Lucy Mack Smith]], Joseph Smith's mother. A pastor who lived near Cowdery, [[Ethan Smith (clergyman)|Ethan Smith]], had written ''[[View of the Hebrews]]'', another work that has been posited as a source for the Book of Mormon. Cowdery served as scribe during the transcription of the Book of Mormon, and was one of the [[Three Witnesses]] to the golden plates.  Cowdery later resigned and was excommunicated in 1838, then re-joined the LDS Church in 1848.\n\n====Sidney Rigdon====\n[[File:Rigdon.gif|thumb|125px|right|Sidney Rigdon]]\n[[Sidney Rigdon]] was a Baptist preacher, and one of the most prominent of Smith's earliest followers.

After Smith's death, Rigdon led [[Rigdonite|his own faction of Latter Day Saints]] and continued to announce revelations.\n\nPointing away from Rigdon's co-authorship, there is little or no extant evidence that Smith knew of or was in contact with Rigdon until after the Book of Mormon was published, although some witness accounts place Rigdon in upstate New York in 1825 and 1826.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Most histories state that Rigdon learned of the Book of Mormon from [[Parley P. Pratt]], a member of Rigdon's [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]] congregation, who had joined the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]] in September 1830. Upon Pratt's return to Ohio, Rigdon reportedly learned of Smith and the Book of Mormon and was baptized by Pratt. According to these histories, only after his own baptism did Rigdon travel to New York, first meeting Smith in December 1830, nine months after the Book of Mormon's publication.\n\n==Purported sources==\nCritics of the Book of Mormon cite a number of works that could have served as sources for the Book of Mormon.<ref>{{Citation|\ntitle=One Nation Under Gods: A History of the Mormon Church |\npublisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|\nyear=2003|\nisbn=1-56858-283-8 |\nfirst=Richard|last=Abanes|\npages=67\u201375\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Tanner 1987 84\u201385\">{{Citation|\ntitle=Mormonism - Shadow or Reality?|\nisbn=99930-74-43-8|\nfirst=Jerald and Sandra| last=Tanner|\npublisher=Utah Lighthouse Ministry |\nyear=1987|\npages=84\u201385\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Persuitte 2000 155\u2013172\">{{Citation|\ntitle=Joseph Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon (2nd Edition)|\nlast=Persuitte|first=David|\nyear=2000|\npublisher=McFarland & Company|\nisbn=0-7864-0826-X|\npages=155\u2013172\n}}</ref>\n\n===King James Version of the Bible===\n{{Main|The Book of Mormon and the King James Bible}}\nThe [[King James Bible]] (1611) may have been a source for the Book of Mormon.<ref>{{Citation|\ntitle=One Nation Under Gods: A History of the Mormon Church |\npublisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|\nyear=2003|\nisbn=1-56858-283-8 |\nfirst=Richard|last=Abanes|\npages=72\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Tanner 1987 73\u201380\">{{Citation|\ntitle=Mormonism - Shadow or Reality?|\nisbn=99930-74-43-8|\nfirst=Jerald and Sandra| last=Tanner|\npublisher=Utah Lighthouse Ministry |\nyear=1987|\npages=73\u201380\n}}</ref> In total, some 478 verses in the Book of Mormon are quoted in some form from the KJV [[Book of Isaiah]].<ref name=\"Tvedtnes 1984\">{{Harvnb|Tvedtnes|1984}}</ref> Segments of the Book of Mormon\u2014[[1 Nephi]] chapters 20\u201321 and [[2 Nephi]] chapters 7\u20138 and 12\u201324\u2014match nearly word-for-word Isaiah 48:1\u201352:2 and 2\u201314 (respectively).

The only known manuscript was discovered in 1884 and now resides at [[Oberlin College]] in Ohio.<ref name=\"Spaulding 1996\"/> Once the manuscript was available for study, most critics discarded this theory because the \"extensive parallels\" were only of a few minor details: intercontinental seafaring, the existence (and use) of a seer stone, and the discovery of records under a stone (Latin parchments vs. golden plates with \"[[reformed Egyptian]]\" inscriptions). Most other purported similarities, attested by various witness affidavits gathered by [[Doctor Philastus Hurlbut]], were nonexistent.

The parallels that Persuitte presents cover a broad range of topics, including religious ideas about the responsibility of the American people in convincing the Indians of their \"Israelite\" origins and converting them to Christianity. Persuitte quotes from ''View of the Hebrews'' Ethan Smith's theory about what happened to the ancient Israelites after they arrived in America. He argues that it essentially summarizes the basic narrative of the Book of Mormon, including the split into two factions (civilized and savage). Persuitte also quotes several similar descriptions of structures built by the civilized faction, the wars between the two factions, and other similarities.

Several other witnesses observed Smith dictating the text that eventually became the Book of Mormon.\n\nCritics have explored a number of issues, including (1) whether Joseph Smith actually had golden plates, or whether the text of the Book of Mormon originated in his mind or through inspiration; (2) whether it was Smith himself who composed the book's text or an associate of Smith's, such as [[Oliver Cowdery]] or [[Sidney Rigdon]]; and (3) whether the book was based on prior works, such as the ''[[View of the Hebrews]]'', the [[Spalding\u2013Rigdon theory of Book of Mormon authorship|Spalding Manuscript]], or the [[King James Version]] of the Bible.\n\n==Theories of authorship==\n\nThere are differing views on the origin of the Book of Mormon.\n# '''Miraculous origins theories''' generally accept Joseph Smith's own account, that he translated an ancient record<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation | title = Gospel Topics {{ndash}} Book of Mormon Translation | work = churchofjesuschrist.org | publisher = LDS Church  }}</ref> compiled and abridged by [[Mormon (Book of Mormon prophet)|Mormon]], a [[pre-Columbian]] resident of the Western Hemisphere.<br/>Variations of this theory only include that the text is a divinely inspired narrative, regardless of its [[Historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon|historicity]] (i.e., \"Inspired Fiction\"),<ref>{{Harvnb|Price|2002|p=68}}</ref> or an example of \"[[automatic writing]]\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Dunn|2002|pp=29, 33}} Dunn concludes, \"It is clear that Smith's translation experience fits comfortably within the larger world of scrying, channeling, and automatic writing.\"</ref>  \n# '''Joseph Smith as the sole author''', without intentional assistance, possibly reflecting Smith's own life events.<ref>{{Harvnb|Vogel|2004}}</ref>  \n# '''Theories of multiple authors''' posit collaboration with others to produce the Book of Mormon, generally citing Book of Mormon scribe Oliver Cowdrey or Sidney Rigdon as potential co-authors.\n\n===Miraculous origin theory===\n{{See also|Golden Plates|Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)}}\n[[File:JosephSmithTranslating.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Smith sitting on a wooden chair with his face in a hat|A depiction of Joseph Smith dictating the Book of Mormon by peering into a hat.]]\nAccording to the accounts of Joseph Smith and his associates, the original record was engraved on thin, malleable [[golden plates|sheets of metal]] (\"leaves\") with the appearance of [[gold]], and bound with three rings at one edge.

After Smith's death, Rigdon led [[Rigdonite|his own faction of Latter Day Saints]] and continued to announce revelations.\n\nPointing away from Rigdon's co-authorship, there is little or no extant evidence that Smith knew of or was in contact with Rigdon until after the Book of Mormon was published, although some witness accounts place Rigdon in upstate New York in 1825 and 1826.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Most histories state that Rigdon learned of the Book of Mormon from [[Parley P. Pratt]], a member of Rigdon's [[Kirtland, Ohio|Kirtland]] congregation, who had joined the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]] in September 1830. Upon Pratt's return to Ohio, Rigdon reportedly learned of Smith and the Book of Mormon and was baptized by Pratt.

Persuitte quotes from ''View of the Hebrews'' Ethan Smith's theory about what happened to the ancient Israelites after they arrived in America. He argues that it essentially summarizes the basic narrative of the Book of Mormon, including the split into two factions (civilized and savage). Persuitte also quotes several similar descriptions of structures built by the civilized faction, the wars between the two factions, and other similarities. According to Persuitte, these are sufficient to have \"inspired\" Joseph Smith to have written the Book of Mormon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Persuitte|2000}}</ref> Joseph Smith himself mentioned Ethan Smith and cited passages from ''View of the Hebrews'' in an article from the June 1842 publication of ''[[Times and Seasons]]''.<ref>Joseph Smith, ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''3''':15 (1 June 1842): 813\u201315.</ref>\n\n===''The Wonders of Nature''===\nCritics have claimed several passages and thematic material in the Book of Mormon are found in Josiah Priest's ''[[The Wonders of Nature]]'', published in 1825.<ref name=\"Tanner 1987 84\u201385\"/><ref name=\"Abanes 2003 68\"/>\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"40%\" style=\"background:#ffcd9c;\" |'''''The Wonders of Nature''''' '''by Josiah Priest (1825)'''\n|width=\"40%\" style=\"background:#ddffdd;\" |'''Book of Mormon (1830)'''\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|bgcolor=\"#ffefbe\"|\"a narrow neck of land is interposed betwixt two vast oceans\"  (p.&nbsp;598)\n|bgcolor=\"#eeffee\"|\"the narrow neck of land, by the place where the sea divides the land\" (Ether 10:20)\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|bgcolor=\"#ffefbe\" |\"From whence no traveller returns\" (p.&nbsp;469)\n|bgcolor=\"#eeffee\" |\"from whence no traveller can return\" (2 Nephi 1:14)\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|bgcolor=\"#ffefbe\" |\"Darkness which may be felt. ... vapours ... so thick as to prevent the rays of the sun from penetrating an extraordinary thick mist. ... no artificial light could be procured ... vapours would prevent lamps, etc. from burning. ...

It is also referred to as '''amaxophobia''' or '''vehophobia'''.  Amaxophobia is an intense, persistent fear of participating in car traffic (or in other vehicular transportation) that interferes with the patient\u2019s [[Lifestyle_(sociology)|lifestyle]] and [[quality of life]], including aspects such as inability to participate in the workforce due to the pathological and self-defeating avoidance of driving.[1][2][3]  The fear of driving may be triggered by specific driving situations, such as expressway driving or dense traffic.[4] Driving anxiety can range from a mild cautious concern to an irrational [[phobia]]. \n\n==Symptoms==\nThe fear of driving is associated with various physical and subjective emotional symptoms that somewhat vary from individual to individual.  For example, the physical symptoms might involve increased [[perspiration]] or [[tachycardia]] (pathologically accelerated heart rate), or [[hyperventilation]].  On the cognitive level, the patient may experience a loss of sense of reality, or thoughts of losing control while driving, even in situations that are reasonably safe.[5]  On behavioral level, the avoidance of driving tends to perpetuate the phobia.  Patients who developed their amaxophobia after a serious traffic accident frequently develop the [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) that may involve experiencing [[intrusive thoughts]] or anxious dreams of the original accident and/or other typical PTSD symptoms.[5] \nA noteworthy part of post-accident symptomatology is the '''phantom brake syndrome'''.  It is the passenger\u2019s partly involuntary or unintended pressing the foot on the floor of the car in a reflexive attempt \u201cto brake.\u201d  This unintended behavior usually occurs in skilled drivers when they are seated as a passenger next to a less competent person who drives the vehicle as a reflexive response to potentially dangerous traffic situations.  The phantom brake syndrome is particularly common in survivors of serious car accidents.\n\n===Associated conditions===\nSome patients who present with phobia of driving also describe features consistent with various other [[anxiety disorders]], including [[panic disorder]], [[agoraphobia]], [[specific phobia]], and [[social phobia]].[1]  The majority of survivors of serious car accidents tend to experience only the phobia of driving, but they often report generalized anxiety as a part of their post-traumatic adjustment disorder (see Gutierrez et al. [6]).  The amaxophobia tends to be perpetuated by persistent [[pain]] caused by the car accident, and by pain related [[insomnia]], and also by persistent [[Post-concussion_syndrome|post-conconcussion]] and [[Whiplash_(medicine)|whiplash]] symptoms caused by the accident.  The PTSD symptoms, e.g., in the forms of [[Flashback_(psychology)|flashbacks]] such as intrusive images of a bleeding person injured in the same car accident, may also contribute to amaxophobia.\n\n==Causes==\nThere are three major categories of driving phobia, distinguished by their onset.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMost common cause of a fear of driving are [[Traffic_collision|traffic accidents]]. Thus, the amaxophobia often develops as a reaction to a particularly traumatic vehicular collision. Beck and Coffey reported that 25\u201333% of people involved in a car collision associated with injuries and related evaluation in a hospital experience subsequent fear of driving.[5]  Hickling and Blanchard[7] and Kuch, Swinson, and Kirby[8] found higher rates of driving phobia, ranging from 42% to 77%. The majority of experienced drivers with fear of driving in the aftermath of their serious accidents rate themselves as safer drivers than average, though they feel physically and emotionally too uncomfortable.[1] For some patients, the fear escalates in very specific situations such as when near large vehicles (transport trucks, buses), but in others the fear may be triggered already just by getting seated in the car or even just by thinking about having to again travel in a car in the near future.  Several psychological questionnaires have been developed for clinicians to assess the situational intensity and facets of driving anxiety in novice drivers or also in experienced drivers traumatized by a recent car accident, see a review in [https://www.sryahwapublications.com/archives-of-psychiatry-and-behavioral-sciences/pdf/v3-i1/3.pdf Whetstone et al].[9]\nSome novice drivers and passengers who were never involved in a serious car accident also report symptoms of amaxophobia.[1]  The driving fear maybe, in some patients, an extension of [[agoraphobia]].[1] \n\n== Treatment ==\nThe most common treatment for both driving phobia and milder forms of driving anxiety is [[behavior therapy]][10] in the form of [[systematic desensitization]].[10,11,12]  An emerging treatment approach to treating amaxophobia is through the use of [[virtual reality therapy]].[13] With repeated exposure such as via devices similar to video games, the subjective distress is gradually reduced: the patient may subsequently be more willing to proceed to engaging in driving in real life situations, as the next stage of [[exposure therapy]]. \n== Psychological Assessment ==\n[edit]\nDriving is a potentially dangerous activity.  Almost every driver experiences some driving anxiety, in some situations, especially the new drivers.  Psychological assessment of novice drivers can proceed via questionnaires such as the '''[[doi: 10.1016/j.janxdis.2010.08.008|Driving Behavior Survey (DBS)]]'''[14] which consists of 20 items, each of which is rated on a scale from 1=never to 7=always, for example Item 4. \u201cI have trouble staying in the correct lane,\u201d  5. \u201cI drift into other lanes,\u201d  6. \u201cI forget to make appropriate adjustments in speed.\u201d  \nLack of experience with driving or lack of driving skills in novice drivers obviously constitutes a different source of anxiety than the sudden traumatic event that generated post-accident anxiety of drivers who were adequately self-confident in cars until the collision.  \nAnother assessment tool designed for phobic fear in novice drivers is the '''[[DOI: 10.1016/j.janxdis.2006.08.002|Driving Cognition Questionnaire (DCQ)]]'''.[15]  It also consists of 20 items.  These are rated on a scale from 0=never to 4=always.  Some items of this questionnaire assess related social anxieties and self-image issues, e.g., Item 8. \u201cPeople will think I am a bad driver,\u201d  15.  \u201cI will hold up traffic and people will be angry,\u201d  17.  \u201cPeople will laugh at me,\u201d and 20.  \u201cI will lose control of myself and act stupidly or dangerously.\u201d  Such [[self-image]] issues are relatively uncommon in patients with a post-accident amaxophobia some of whom drove without accidents and without emotional discomfort for decades.\nThe '''[http://DOI:%2010.1016/S0005-7967(03)00203-1 Driving and Riding Avoidance Scale (DRAS)]'''[16] also consists of 20 items.  These are scored from 0=\u201drarely or none of the time\u201d to 4=\u201dMost or all of the time.\u201d  Its 20 items describe various situations in which driving is avoided.  As discussed by Taylor and Sullman[17], the wording of DRAS items allows for responses that are not necessarily based on fear of driving, but could also involve economic or practical issues.   For instance, the travel via subway trains or streetcars within the center of some major North American or European cities is far more rapid than in cars and/or it saves both gasoline and parking fees. \n\nCanadian psychotherapist James Whetstone has developed his '''[https://www.sryahwapublications.com/archives-of-psychiatry-and-behavioral-sciences/pdf/v3-i1/3.pdf Vehicle Anxiety Questionnaire]''' [9] to assess the driving phobia of survivors of car accidents.   Whetstone\u2019s questionnaire is particularly suited for assessments of experienced but traumatized drivers and maps the driving phobia along 6 dimensions:   (1) Compensating driving behaviours (Items 1 to 6),  (2) Passenger anxieties (Items 7 to 10), (3) Physical manifestations of anxiety (Items 11 to 16),  (4) Limitations to mobility (Items 17 to 21), (5) Avoidance behaviours (Items 22 to 26), and (6) Challenges to personal and relationship stability (Items 27 to 31).\nThe answers to Whetstone items can be scored with 0 points for \u201cNot at All,\u201d 1 for \u201cMildly,\u201d 2 for \u201cFrequently,\u201d and with 3 points for \u201cConstantly.\u201d   In clinical use, as the last part of Whetstone questionnaire, the patients are also asked to provide ratings, on a scale from 1 to 10, of anxiety as a driver or as a passenger since their accident and then, also separately the rating of their driver and passenger anxiety over the years before the accident.\nIn the [[criterion validity|criterion validation]] study, responses to Whetstone\u2019s questionnaire of 53 survivors of car accidents were compared to those of 24 normal controls.  There was no overlap between the score distribution in the group of patients (lowest score was 23) and the control group (highest score was 19).  The patients\u2019 scores ranged from 23 to 93, with the average at 65.5 (SD=17.4) and those in a control group ranged from 0 to 19, with the average at 6.8 (SD=5.1).  The [[convergent validity]] was also very satisfactory: high correlations were found of Whetstone questionnaire to the Driving Anxiety Questionnaire (r=.80) and to the [https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/adult-sr/ptsd-checklist.asp PCL-5] measure of PTSD symptoms (r=.78).  Whetstone scores were found to be also highly correlated with the [[post-concussion syndrome]] (r=.63) and moderately with [[Whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] symptoms (r=.46), post-accident [[insomnia]] (r=.56), ratings of post-accident [[pain]] (rs ranging from .43 to .50), and ratings of depression (r=.40) and of generalized anxiety (r=.43).  Significant correlation was also found of Whetstone to Steiner\u2019s Automobile Anxiety Inventory (r=.45).  \nWhetstone\u2019s article[9] (see pages 26-27 and 29-30)also provides the full text of the '''Driving Anxiety Questionnaire (DAQ)''' that consists of a list of driving situations that are rated by the patient on a scale from \u201cNo Anxiety\u201d to \u201cSevere Anxiety.\u201d  This list consists of 14 situational items which the patient at first rates as a driver and then again separately as a passenger.  The DAQ  also includes 6 items describing behaviors indicative of anxiety as a driver and 7 items as a passenger.  The study by Whetstone et al.[9] reported also psychometric findings on the DAQ: its coefficients of [[convergent validity]] were satisfactory.  The DAQ is especially well suited for behavior therapists for designing an individualized [[exposure therapy]] for each particular patient.  \nA noteworthy part of this questionnaire is its measure of the '''phantom brake syndrome''' (the passenger\u2019s partly involuntary or unintended pressing the foot on the floor of the car in a reflexive attempt \u201cto brake\u201d; this reaction is common in skilled drivers who survived car accidents when travelling in the passenger seat).\nThe article by Whetstone et al.[9] (see page 28-29) also reviews the '''Automobile Anxiety Inventory (AAI)''' developed in Ontario by Leon Steiner.  The data calculated by Whetstone\u2019s team document satisfactory convergent validity of the Steiner\u2019s questionnaire.  Steiner\u2019s AAI is a 23 item questionnaire of which 18 such are scored on a dichotomous basis (1=Yes, 0=No).  Its [[convergent validity]] is satisfactory (see calculations in Whetstone et al. [9]).  Most of the AAI items compare the level of driving anxiety before the accident to the one after the accident.  The AAI is written in relatively simple English.  Steiner\u2019s AAI questionnaire is especially well suited for patients who read rarely or only reluctantly or for those with only elementary knowledge of written English.  Since each of these 3 questionnaires (i.e., Whetstone's, Steiner's, and the DAQ) has a slightly different focus, it is often of advantage to use all 3 jointly in clinical assessments, as long as enough time is available. \n\nAnother psychological evaluation tool is the '''[https://www.sryahwapublications.com/archives-of-psychiatry-and-behavioral-sciences/pdf/v2-i2/3.pdf Gutierrez questionnaire]''' developed by Jaime Gutierrez for assessments of patients after car accidents.[6]  A multifaceted assessment of driving anxiety is accomplished by using separately the items 54 to 65 of the Gutierrez questionnaire.  Its items evaluate physical reactions, since accident, while again in cars, related feelings, behaviors such as avoidance of car trips or the '''phantom brake syndrome''' of drivers when travelling as a passenger (reflexive pressing the foot on the floor in situations subjectively perceived as potentially dangerous).  \nThe Gutierrez questionnaire also includes items listing various driving situations: the patient is to check those associated with anxiety.  This provides useful data for [[systematic desensitization]] therapy[10] of driving anxiety.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[edit]\n\n1.\tTaylor JE, Deane FP, Podd JV.

It is also referred to as '''amaxophobia''' or '''vehophobia'''.  Amaxophobia is an intense, persistent fear of participating in car traffic (or in other vehicular transportation) that interferes with the patient\u2019s [[Lifestyle_(sociology)|lifestyle]] and [[quality of life]], including aspects such as inability to participate in the workforce due to the pathological and self-defeating avoidance of driving.[1][2][3]  The fear of driving may be triggered by specific driving situations, such as expressway driving or dense traffic.[4] Driving anxiety can range from a mild cautious concern to an irrational [[phobia]]. \n\n==Symptoms==\nThe fear of driving is associated with various physical and subjective emotional symptoms that somewhat vary from individual to individual.  For example, the physical symptoms might involve increased [[perspiration]] or [[tachycardia]] (pathologically accelerated heart rate), or [[hyperventilation]].  On the cognitive level, the patient may experience a loss of sense of reality, or thoughts of losing control while driving, even in situations that are reasonably safe.[5]  On behavioral level, the avoidance of driving tends to perpetuate the phobia.  Patients who developed their amaxophobia after a serious traffic accident frequently develop the [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) that may involve experiencing [[intrusive thoughts]] or anxious dreams of the original accident and/or other typical PTSD symptoms.[5] \nA noteworthy part of post-accident symptomatology is the '''phantom brake syndrome'''.  It is the passenger\u2019s partly involuntary or unintended pressing the foot on the floor of the car in a reflexive attempt \u201cto brake.\u201d  This unintended behavior usually occurs in skilled drivers when they are seated as a passenger next to a less competent person who drives the vehicle as a reflexive response to potentially dangerous traffic situations.  The phantom brake syndrome is particularly common in survivors of serious car accidents.\n\n===Associated conditions===\nSome patients who present with phobia of driving also describe features consistent with various other [[anxiety disorders]], including [[panic disorder]], [[agoraphobia]], [[specific phobia]], and [[social phobia]].[1]  The majority of survivors of serious car accidents tend to experience only the phobia of driving, but they often report generalized anxiety as a part of their post-traumatic adjustment disorder (see Gutierrez et al. [6]).  The amaxophobia tends to be perpetuated by persistent [[pain]] caused by the car accident, and by pain related [[insomnia]], and also by persistent [[Post-concussion_syndrome|post-conconcussion]] and [[Whiplash_(medicine)|whiplash]] symptoms caused by the accident.  The PTSD symptoms, e.g., in the forms of [[Flashback_(psychology)|flashbacks]] such as intrusive images of a bleeding person injured in the same car accident, may also contribute to amaxophobia.\n\n==Causes==\nThere are three major categories of driving phobia, distinguished by their onset.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMost common cause of a fear of driving are [[Traffic_collision|traffic accidents]]. Thus, the amaxophobia often develops as a reaction to a particularly traumatic vehicular collision. Beck and Coffey reported that 25\u201333% of people involved in a car collision associated with injuries and related evaluation in a hospital experience subsequent fear of driving.[5]  Hickling and Blanchard[7] and Kuch, Swinson, and Kirby[8] found higher rates of driving phobia, ranging from 42% to 77%. The majority of experienced drivers with fear of driving in the aftermath of their serious accidents rate themselves as safer drivers than average, though they feel physically and emotionally too uncomfortable.[1] For some patients, the fear escalates in very specific situations such as when near large vehicles (transport trucks, buses), but in others the fear may be triggered already just by getting seated in the car or even just by thinking about having to again travel in a car in the near future.  Several psychological questionnaires have been developed for clinicians to assess the situational intensity and facets of driving anxiety in novice drivers or also in experienced drivers traumatized by a recent car accident, see a review in [https://www.sryahwapublications.com/archives-of-psychiatry-and-behavioral-sciences/pdf/v3-i1/3.pdf Whetstone et al].[9]\nSome novice drivers and passengers who were never involved in a serious car accident also report symptoms of amaxophobia.[1]  The driving fear maybe, in some patients, an extension of [[agoraphobia]].[1] \n\n== Treatment ==\nThe most common treatment for both driving phobia and milder forms of driving anxiety is [[behavior therapy]][10] in the form of [[systematic desensitization]].[10,11,12]  An emerging treatment approach to treating amaxophobia is through the use of [[virtual reality therapy]].[13] With repeated exposure such as via devices similar to video games, the subjective distress is gradually reduced: the patient may subsequently be more willing to proceed to engaging in driving in real life situations, as the next stage of [[exposure therapy]]. \n== Psychological Assessment ==\n[edit]\nDriving is a potentially dangerous activity.  Almost every driver experiences some driving anxiety, in some situations, especially the new drivers.  Psychological assessment of novice drivers can proceed via questionnaires such as the '''[[doi: 10.1016/j.janxdis.2010.08.008|Driving Behavior Survey (DBS)]]'''[14] which consists of 20 items, each of which is rated on a scale from 1=never to 7=always, for example Item 4. \u201cI have trouble staying in the correct lane,\u201d  5. \u201cI drift into other lanes,\u201d  6. \u201cI forget to make appropriate adjustments in speed.\u201d  \nLack of experience with driving or lack of driving skills in novice drivers obviously constitutes a different source of anxiety than the sudden traumatic event that generated post-accident anxiety of drivers who were adequately self-confident in cars until the collision.  \nAnother assessment tool designed for phobic fear in novice drivers is the '''[[DOI: 10.1016/j.janxdis.2006.08.002|Driving Cognition Questionnaire (DCQ)]]'''.[15]  It also consists of 20 items.  These are rated on a scale from 0=never to 4=always.  Some items of this questionnaire assess related social anxieties and self-image issues, e.g., Item 8. \u201cPeople will think I am a bad driver,\u201d  15.  \u201cI will hold up traffic and people will be angry,\u201d  17.  \u201cPeople will laugh at me,\u201d and 20.  \u201cI will lose control of myself and act stupidly or dangerously.\u201d  Such [[self-image]] issues are relatively uncommon in patients with a post-accident amaxophobia some of whom drove without accidents and without emotional discomfort for decades.\nThe '''[http://DOI:%2010.1016/S0005-7967(03)00203-1 Driving and Riding Avoidance Scale (DRAS)]'''[16] also consists of 20 items.

It started as the small port town of Cavite Puerto that prospered during the early [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish colonial period]] when it became the main seaport of Manila hosting the [[Manila Galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleon trade]] and the port used for other heavy and larger sea-bound ships.

''Tangway'' simply means \"peninsula\". The second is ''Kawit'' or \"hook\", referring to the hook-shaped landform along the coast of [[Bacoor Bay]],<ref name=about/> and from which the [[Sinicization|Chinese]] ''Keit'' and [[Castilianization|Spanish]] ''Cavite'' are in turn derived.<ref name=keit/>\n\n===Pre-Hispanic era===\nThe early inhabitants of Cavite City were the [[Tagalogs]] ruled by the Kampilan and the bullhorn of a datu, the tribal form of government.  According to folklore, the earliest settlers came from [[Borneo]], led by Gat Hinigiw and his wife Dayang Kaliwanag who bore seven children. Archaeological evidences in the coastal areas show prehistoric settlements.\n\n===Spanish colonial period===\n[[File:Port of Cavite, detail from Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas (1734).jpg|left|thumb|Illustration of the Port of Cavite from the ''[[Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas]]'' (1734).]]\n[[File:Shipyards and Arsenal, Cavite, Philippines (1899).jpg|thumb|left|The Spanish shipyards and arsenal in Cavite (1899)]]\n[[File:Cavite City - Governor's Palace 1899.jpg|thumb|left|The Governor's Palace in the Navy Yard at the old Port City of Cavite (1899)]]\nOn May 16, 1571 the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] declared the region a royal encomienda, or royal [[land grant]].  Spanish colonizers settled in the most populated area of the place (present day [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]]), they called it [[Cavite]]. The old ''Tangway'' at the tip of the [[Cavite Peninsula]], across Bacoor Bay was referred to as ''Cavite la Punta'' meaning \"Point of Cavite\" or Cavite Point. Upon discovering that because of its deep waters, Cavite la Punta was a suitable place for the repair and construction of Spanish ships and [[galleon]], the Spanish moved their settlement there and called it ''Cavite Nuevo'' (New Cavite) or plainly ''Cavite'', while the first settlement was renamed \"Cavite Viejo\" (and in the early 20th century, regained its former name, Kawit).\n\nIn 1590, the Spaniards fortified ''Cavite Nuevo'' with a ''muralla'' (high thick [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain walls)]] on its western, northern and eastern side while the side fronting Baccor Bay remained open.  Fort Guadalupe on the easternmost tip was also built at the same time, and the town became the ''Puerto de Cavite'' (Port of Cavite) or ''Cavite Puerto''.  The Fort of San Felipe Neri and Porta Vaga gate were constructed in 1595 and completed in 1602. Puerta Vaga (corrupted to Porta Vaga) was the port city's [[barbican]]  western and only principal entrance from San Roque.  It was flanked by the western wall protected by two bastions at its north and southern end.  The wall and gate were also separated from the mainland by a moat, which also made the town like an island.<ref name=muog1/>\n\nCavite was officially founded as a town in 1614 with Tom\u00e1s Salazar as the earliest known ''gobernadorcillo'' recorded.<ref name=muog1/>  At the same time, the town became the capital of the new politico-military province of Cavite, established also in 1614.<ref>Census Office of the Philippine Islands (1920).

La Caridad, formerly known as La Estanzuela of San Roque, separated and was founded as town in 1868. The Spanish Governor General Jose de la Gardana granted the petition of the people led by Don Justo Miranda to make barrio La Estanzuela an independent town.\n\n====City of churches====\nAs the town was progressing, it also became a cosmopolitan town that attracted the different [[religious order]]s to set up churches, convents and hospitals within the limited confines of the fortified town. The [[Franciscan]] ''Hospital de San Jose'' (Saint Joseph Hospital) was built for sailors and soldiers in 1591, the San Diego de Alcala convent in 1608, the Porta Vaga (La Ermita), Our Lady of Loreto ([[Jesuit]]), San Juan de Dios ([[Order of St John of God|St. John of God]]), Santo Domingo ([[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]), Santa Monica ([[Recollects]]),  and San Pedro, the port's parish church. At the most, the fortified town enclosed eight churches, the Jesuit college of San Ildefonso, public buildings and residences, which served the needs of its population of natives, soldiers and workers at the port, transients and passengers on board the galleons.<ref name=muog1>Muog (2008-01-28).

Spanish galleons sailed every July to [[Acapulco]] (Mexico) while another ship sailed from Acapulco to Cavite.  Galleons and other heavy ocean-going ships were not able to enter the Port of Manila along [[Pasig River]] because of a sand bar that limits entrance to the river port only to light ships.

At the start of the American era, Cavite Puerto became the seat of the U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines. It was redesigned to make way for modern ships and armaments.  The ruinous historical structures like Fort Guadalupe were demolished, along with most of Fort San Felipe.<ref name=muog1/>\n\nLocal government administration was under the renamed ''Presidentes municipales'' with the direct supervision of the American Army Officers (the first being Colonel Meade). The first Filipino ''Presidentes municipales'' were appointed: Don Zacaria Fortich for Cavite Puerto, Don Francisco Basa for San Roque, and Don Pedro Raque\u00f1o Bautista for Caridad.\n\nIn 1900, the Cavite\u00f1os tasted their first election under the American regime. They elected in each pueblo or town, local officials called ''Presidente municipal'', ''Vice-Presidente municipal'' and a ''Consejo'' (council) composed of ''Consejales'' (councilors). They elected Don Gregorio Basa as ''Presidente Municipal'' of the town now known as Cavite City.\n\nIn 1901, the Philippine Commission approved a municipal code as the organic law of all local governments throughout the country. In its implementation in 1903, the three separate pueblos of Cavite Puerto, San Roque and La Caridad were merged into one [[municipality]], which was called the Municipality of Cavite. By virtue of a legislative act promulgated by the [[First Philippine Assembly]], Cavite was again made the capital of the province. Subsequently, its territory was enlarged to include the district of San Antonio and the island of [[Corregidor]]. The Municipality of Cavite functioned as a civil government whose officials consisted of a Presidente Municipal, a Vice-Presidente Municipal and ten Consejales duly elected by the qualified voters of the [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]].\n\nIn 1909, Executive Order No. 124, of Governor-General [[W. Cameron Forbes]], declared the Act No. 1748 annexing [[Corregidor]] and the islands of Caballo (Fort Hughes), La Monja, El Fraile (Fort Drum), Santa Amalia, Carabao (Fort Frank) and Limbones, as well as all waters and detached rocks surrounding them, to the Municipality of Cavite.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:stamonica ruins.jpg|thumb|left|The belfry ruins of the Santa Monica Church after the city was heavily bombarded in [[World War II]].]]\nOn December 10, 1941, two days after an attack that had destroyed American air defenses at [[Clark Field]] and three days after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], Japanese Imperial Forces destroyed Cavite Naval Base and bombed Cavite City.\n\nLater, after Japan seized the Philippines, Japanese leaders appointed at least two city mayors of Cavite City.\n\nThe island of [[Corregidor]] played an important role during the [[Japanese invasion of the Philippines]]. The island was the site of two costly [[siege]]s and pitched battles\u2014the first during the first months of 1942, and the second in January 1945\u2014between the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and the [[U.S. Army]], along with its smaller subsidiary force, the [[Philippine Army]].\n\nIn 1945 during the fight for the liberation of the country from Japanese hands, the US and Philippine Commonwealth military bombarded the Japanese forces stationed in the city, completely destroying the old historic port city of Cavite. The old walls and the Porta Vaga gate were damaged. Most of the structures were destroyed while some of the church towers remained.  The city was littered with bomb craters.<ref name=bomb>Tewell, John (2011-01-29).

Only the bell tower of the Santa Monica Church of the Recollects and the two [[bastion]]s of Fort San Felipe remain of the old city.\n\n===Cityhood===\nUnder the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]], Assemblyman Manuel S. Rojas, sponsored Commonwealth Act No. 547 elevating Cavite town to a chartered city. Upon approval into law on September 7, 1940, the executive function of the city was vested in a City Mayor appointed by the President of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]]. The legislative body of the City of Cavite was vested on a Municipal Board composed of three electives, two appointive and two ex-officio [[councilors]], the presiding officer of which is the City Mayor.\n\nThe city lost its status as capital in 1954 when [[Trece Martires]] was created in the central part of the province as a planned capital city. In 1972, city Mayor Manuel S. Rojas was assassinated in the nearby town of Bacoor, Cavite.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1981/feb1981/gr_41537_8_1981.html|title=THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES vs. JACINTO REYES y RAMIREZ and OSCAR SABATER,|website=Lawphil|access-date=April 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Cavite Boulevard sketch by Burnham.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cavite City and peninsula (lower left) in relation to the City of Manila (upper middle)]]\nThe City of Cavite occupies most of the hook-shaped [[Cavite Peninsula]] that juts into [[Manila Bay]]. The peninsula is bounded by [[Bacoor Bay]] to the southeast.  The peninsula ends at two tips \u2013 Sangley Point and Cavite Point. [[Ca\u00f1acao Bay]] is the body of water formed between Sangley Point and Cavite Point.  The latter was the location of the old historic Port of Cavite.  Both Bacoor and Ca\u00f1acao Bays are inland bays of the larger Manila Bay.

The virgin is depicted as a lady in mourning. Mary, garbed in black and white attire, seems to be on her knees as she contemplates the passion of her son. Before her are the crown of thorns and the nails instrument of Christ's passion.  An inscription was found at the back of the painting \u2013 ''A doze de Abril 1692 a\u00f1os Juan Oliba puso esta Stma. Ymagen Haqui'', which means,\"The sacred image was placed here by Juan Oliba on April 12, 1692\". This particular icon was used to bless the galleon plying between Cavite and Acapulco (Mexico) during formal sending off ceremonies. Thus, she was also called the Patroness of the Galleons.\n\nThe image was originally enshrined at the ''Ermita de Porta Vaga'', a small church located adjacent to the Porta Vaga gate of Cavite Puerto and was destroyed during the last world war.  The image is presently enshrined at the San Roque Parish Church, one of the three parishes in the City.\n\n===Languages===\n[[Chabacano]] is a Spanish-influenced [[creole language]] formerly spoken by majority of the people living in the city of Cavite. Chabacano emerged sometime after the arrival of the first Spaniards and Mexicans in the late 16th century. During this period, the people that lived near the military arsenal in Cavite City put themselves in contact with the Spaniards and Mexicans and began to incorporate in their own dialect many Spanish words, which then gave birth to the creole. Majority of residents today speak [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].\n\nToday, Chabacano is generally considered to be dying with only a fraction of the people, mostly elderly, able to speak the language. According to the Philippine professor, Alfredo B. German who wrote a thesis on the grammar in Chabacano dialect, the present conditions no longer favor the disenrolment of the same one. There are many probable reasons for the diminishing of Chabacano, among these being the massive arrival of [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking migrants to the city of [[Cavite]], and intermarriage.\n\nOne of the poets and Philippine writers, Jesus Balmori expressed himself in Chabacano. He was a great admirer of the dialect and wrote several verses in it. Another admirer of this dialect was Don Jaime de Veyra, the illustrious writer and famous Philippine historian, who feared more than all the probable extinction of the Chabacano when he wrote the following prophetic lines, \"I am afraid that the inevitable absorption of the \"Tagalog invasion\" on one side and the invasion of the English on the other hand, will wipe out or extinguish this inherited Castilian language in existence with his last representatives in the following generation.\" Professor Gervacio Miranda who also wrote a book in Chabacano said in his preface the following thing, \"My only objective to write this book is to possibly conserve in written form the Chabacano of [[Cavite]] for posterity,\" fearing the extinction of the dialect.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Festivals and events ===\nThe city is home to the Annual Cavite City Water Festival or Regada, held every 17th and 24th day of June.

Retrieved on 2014-10-19.</ref> the southern districts of Santa Cruz and Dalahican, and the outlying islands of the province, including the historic [[Corregidor Island]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nThe city has been known by at least two [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] names, the first being ''Tangway'', which was the name given to the area by [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] settlers. ''Tangway'' simply means \"peninsula\". The second is ''Kawit'' or \"hook\", referring to the hook-shaped landform along the coast of [[Bacoor Bay]],<ref name=about/> and from which the [[Sinicization|Chinese]] ''Keit'' and [[Castilianization|Spanish]] ''Cavite'' are in turn derived.<ref name=keit/>\n\n===Pre-Hispanic era===\nThe early inhabitants of Cavite City were the [[Tagalogs]] ruled by the Kampilan and the bullhorn of a datu, the tribal form of government.  According to folklore, the earliest settlers came from [[Borneo]], led by Gat Hinigiw and his wife Dayang Kaliwanag who bore seven children. Archaeological evidences in the coastal areas show prehistoric settlements.\n\n===Spanish colonial period===\n[[File:Port of Cavite, detail from Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas (1734).jpg|left|thumb|Illustration of the Port of Cavite from the ''[[Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas]]'' (1734).]]\n[[File:Shipyards and Arsenal, Cavite, Philippines (1899).jpg|thumb|left|The Spanish shipyards and arsenal in Cavite (1899)]]\n[[File:Cavite City - Governor's Palace 1899.jpg|thumb|left|The Governor's Palace in the Navy Yard at the old Port City of Cavite (1899)]]\nOn May 16, 1571 the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] declared the region a royal encomienda, or royal [[land grant]].  Spanish colonizers settled in the most populated area of the place (present day [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]]), they called it [[Cavite]]. The old ''Tangway'' at the tip of the [[Cavite Peninsula]], across Bacoor Bay was referred to as ''Cavite la Punta'' meaning \"Point of Cavite\" or Cavite Point. Upon discovering that because of its deep waters, Cavite la Punta was a suitable place for the repair and construction of Spanish ships and [[galleon]], the Spanish moved their settlement there and called it ''Cavite Nuevo'' (New Cavite) or plainly ''Cavite'', while the first settlement was renamed \"Cavite Viejo\" (and in the early 20th century, regained its former name, Kawit).\n\nIn 1590, the Spaniards fortified ''Cavite Nuevo'' with a ''muralla'' (high thick [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain walls)]] on its western, northern and eastern side while the side fronting Baccor Bay remained open.  Fort Guadalupe on the easternmost tip was also built at the same time, and the town became the ''Puerto de Cavite'' (Port of Cavite) or ''Cavite Puerto''.  The Fort of San Felipe Neri and Porta Vaga gate were constructed in 1595 and completed in 1602. Puerta Vaga (corrupted to Porta Vaga) was the port city's [[barbican]]  western and only principal entrance from San Roque.  It was flanked by the western wall protected by two bastions at its north and southern end.  The wall and gate were also separated from the mainland by a moat, which also made the town like an island.<ref name=muog1/>\n\nCavite was officially founded as a town in 1614 with Tom\u00e1s Salazar as the earliest known ''gobernadorcillo'' recorded.<ref name=muog1/>  At the same time, the town became the capital of the new politico-military province of Cavite, established also in 1614.<ref>Census Office of the Philippine Islands (1920).

La Caridad, formerly known as La Estanzuela of San Roque, separated and was founded as town in 1868. The Spanish Governor General Jose de la Gardana granted the petition of the people led by Don Justo Miranda to make barrio La Estanzuela an independent town.\n\n====City of churches====\nAs the town was progressing, it also became a cosmopolitan town that attracted the different [[religious order]]s to set up churches, convents and hospitals within the limited confines of the fortified town. The [[Franciscan]] ''Hospital de San Jose'' (Saint Joseph Hospital) was built for sailors and soldiers in 1591, the San Diego de Alcala convent in 1608, the Porta Vaga (La Ermita), Our Lady of Loreto ([[Jesuit]]), San Juan de Dios ([[Order of St John of God|St. John of God]]), Santo Domingo ([[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]), Santa Monica ([[Recollects]]),  and San Pedro, the port's parish church. At the most, the fortified town enclosed eight churches, the Jesuit college of San Ildefonso, public buildings and residences, which served the needs of its population of natives, soldiers and workers at the port, transients and passengers on board the galleons.<ref name=muog1>Muog (2008-01-28).

Spanish galleons sailed every July to [[Acapulco]] (Mexico) while another ship sailed from Acapulco to Cavite.  Galleons and other heavy ocean-going ships were not able to enter the Port of Manila along [[Pasig River]] because of a sand bar that limits entrance to the river port only to light ships.

At the start of the American era, Cavite Puerto became the seat of the U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines. It was redesigned to make way for modern ships and armaments.  The ruinous historical structures like Fort Guadalupe were demolished, along with most of Fort San Felipe.<ref name=muog1/>\n\nLocal government administration was under the renamed ''Presidentes municipales'' with the direct supervision of the American Army Officers (the first being Colonel Meade). The first Filipino ''Presidentes municipales'' were appointed: Don Zacaria Fortich for Cavite Puerto, Don Francisco Basa for San Roque, and Don Pedro Raque\u00f1o Bautista for Caridad.\n\nIn 1900, the Cavite\u00f1os tasted their first election under the American regime. They elected in each pueblo or town, local officials called ''Presidente municipal'', ''Vice-Presidente municipal'' and a ''Consejo'' (council) composed of ''Consejales'' (councilors). They elected Don Gregorio Basa as ''Presidente Municipal'' of the town now known as Cavite City.\n\nIn 1901, the Philippine Commission approved a municipal code as the organic law of all local governments throughout the country. In its implementation in 1903, the three separate pueblos of Cavite Puerto, San Roque and La Caridad were merged into one [[municipality]], which was called the Municipality of Cavite. By virtue of a legislative act promulgated by the [[First Philippine Assembly]], Cavite was again made the capital of the province. Subsequently, its territory was enlarged to include the district of San Antonio and the island of [[Corregidor]]. The Municipality of Cavite functioned as a civil government whose officials consisted of a Presidente Municipal, a Vice-Presidente Municipal and ten Consejales duly elected by the qualified voters of the [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]].\n\nIn 1909, Executive Order No. 124, of Governor-General [[W. Cameron Forbes]], declared the Act No. 1748 annexing [[Corregidor]] and the islands of Caballo (Fort Hughes), La Monja, El Fraile (Fort Drum), Santa Amalia, Carabao (Fort Frank) and Limbones, as well as all waters and detached rocks surrounding them, to the Municipality of Cavite.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:stamonica ruins.jpg|thumb|left|The belfry ruins of the Santa Monica Church after the city was heavily bombarded in [[World War II]].]]\nOn December 10, 1941, two days after an attack that had destroyed American air defenses at [[Clark Field]] and three days after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], Japanese Imperial Forces destroyed Cavite Naval Base and bombed Cavite City.\n\nLater, after Japan seized the Philippines, Japanese leaders appointed at least two city mayors of Cavite City.\n\nThe island of [[Corregidor]] played an important role during the [[Japanese invasion of the Philippines]]. The island was the site of two costly [[siege]]s and pitched battles\u2014the first during the first months of 1942, and the second in January 1945\u2014between the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and the [[U.S. Army]], along with its smaller subsidiary force, the [[Philippine Army]].\n\nIn 1945 during the fight for the liberation of the country from Japanese hands, the US and Philippine Commonwealth military bombarded the Japanese forces stationed in the city, completely destroying the old historic port city of Cavite. The old walls and the Porta Vaga gate were damaged. Most of the structures were destroyed while some of the church towers remained.  The city was littered with bomb craters.<ref name=bomb>Tewell, John (2011-01-29).

Only the bell tower of the Santa Monica Church of the Recollects and the two [[bastion]]s of Fort San Felipe remain of the old city.\n\n===Cityhood===\nUnder the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]], Assemblyman Manuel S. Rojas, sponsored Commonwealth Act No. 547 elevating Cavite town to a chartered city. Upon approval into law on September 7, 1940, the executive function of the city was vested in a City Mayor appointed by the President of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]]. The legislative body of the City of Cavite was vested on a Municipal Board composed of three electives, two appointive and two ex-officio [[councilors]], the presiding officer of which is the City Mayor.\n\nThe city lost its status as capital in 1954 when [[Trece Martires]] was created in the central part of the province as a planned capital city. In 1972, city Mayor Manuel S. Rojas was assassinated in the nearby town of Bacoor, Cavite.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1981/feb1981/gr_41537_8_1981.html|title=THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES vs. JACINTO REYES y RAMIREZ and OSCAR SABATER,|website=Lawphil|access-date=April 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Cavite Boulevard sketch by Burnham.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cavite City and peninsula (lower left) in relation to the City of Manila (upper middle)]]\nThe City of Cavite occupies most of the hook-shaped [[Cavite Peninsula]] that juts into [[Manila Bay]]. The peninsula is bounded by [[Bacoor Bay]] to the southeast.  The peninsula ends at two tips \u2013 Sangley Point and Cavite Point. [[Ca\u00f1acao Bay]] is the body of water formed between Sangley Point and Cavite Point.  The latter was the location of the old historic Port of Cavite.  Both Bacoor and Ca\u00f1acao Bays are inland bays of the larger Manila Bay.  The city's only land border is the Municipality of [[Noveleta, Cavite|Noveleta]] to the south.\n\nThe city is the northernmost settlement in the Province of Cavite, which lies southwest from [[Manila]] with a direct distance of about {{convert|11|km}} but about {{convert|35|km}} by road.  Sangley Point, the former location of the [[United States]] [[Sangley Point Naval Base]], is the northernmost part of the city, peninsula and province. The former American military naval base has since been converted into a [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippine military]] base.\n\nThe historic island of [[Corregidor Island|Corregidor]], the adjacent islands and detached rocks of [[Caballo Island|Caballo]], [[Fort Frank|Carabao]], [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|El Fraile]] and [[La Monja Island|La Monja]] found at the mouth of Manila Bay are part of the city's territorial jurisdiction.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box\n| location = Cavite City ([[Danilo Atienza Air Base]]) 1981\u20132010, extremes 1974\u20132012\n| metric first = yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 34.8\n| Feb record high C = 35.2\n| Mar record high C = 36.6\n| Apr record high C = 37.8\n| May record high C = 38.5\n| Jun record high C = 38.4\n| Jul record high C = 36.3\n| Aug record high C = 36.5\n| Sep record high C = 35.6\n| Oct record high C = 35.8\n| Nov record high C = 36.4\n| Dec record high C = 34.0\n|year record high C = 38.5\n| Jan high C = 30.0\n| Feb high C = 30.8\n| Mar high C = 32.7\n| Apr high C = 34.4\n| May high C = 34.1\n| Jun high C = 32.8\n| Jul high C = 31.7\n| Aug high C = 31.3\n| Sep high C = 31.4\n| Oct high C = 31.4\n| Nov high C = 31.1\n| Dec high C = 30.0\n|year high C = 31.8\n| Jan mean C = 26.6\n| Feb mean C = 27.2\n| Mar mean C = 28.6\n| Apr mean C = 30.1\n| May mean C = 30.1\n| Jun mean C = 29.3\n| Jul mean C = 28.5\n| Aug mean C = 28.3\n| Sep mean C = 28.3\n| Oct mean C = 28.4\n| Nov mean C = 28.1\n| Dec mean C = 27.0\n|year mean C = 28.4\n| Jan low C = 23.3\n| Feb low C = 23.6\n| Mar low C = 24.6\n| Apr low C = 25.9\n| May low C = 26.1\n| Jun low C = 25.8\n| Jul low C = 25.3\n| Aug low C = 25.2\n| Sep low C = 25.2\n| Oct low C = 25.3\n| Nov low C = 25.0\n| Dec low C = 23.9\n|year low C = 24.9\n| Jan record low C = 19.0\n| Feb record low C = 18.0\n| Mar record low C = 19.1\n| Apr record low C = 21.5\n| May record low C = 22.0\n| Jun record low C = 22.0\n| Jul record low C = 21.2\n| Aug record low C = 22.0\n| Sep record low C = 21.0\n| Oct record low C = 21.0\n| Nov record low C = 21.5\n| Dec record low C = 20.0\n|year record low C = 18.0\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 16.9\n| Feb rain mm = 11.1\n| Mar rain mm = 9.4\n| Apr rain mm = 18.5\n| May rain mm = 139.1\n| Jun rain mm = 264.5\n| Jul rain mm = 422.4\n| Aug rain mm = 457.2\n| Sep rain mm = 341.8\n| Oct rain mm = 224.3\n| Nov rain mm = 110.5\n| Dec rain mm = 62.7\n|year rain mm = 2078.4\n| unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 4\n| Feb rain days = 2\n| Mar rain days = 2\n| Apr rain days = 2\n| May rain days = 9\n| Jun rain days = 15\n| Jul rain days = 20\n| Aug rain days = 21\n| Sep rain days = 19\n| Oct rain days = 15\n| Nov rain days = 11\n| Dec rain days = 7\n|year rain days = 127\n| Jan humidity = 79\n| Feb humidity = 76\n| Mar humidity = 74\n| Apr humidity = 71\n| May humidity = 74\n| Jun humidity = 78\n| Jul humidity = 81\n| Aug humidity = 83\n| Sep humidity = 82\n| Oct humidity = 81\n| Nov humidity = 80\n| Dec humidity = 79\n|year humidity = 78\n| source 1 = [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name=PAGASAnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181018190624/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasanormvalsangleyptcav1981-2010.csv\n| archivedate = 18 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-normal-values/resource/96b59c49-9fb1-4225-b481-0635be1dbeda\n| title = Sangley Point Cavite Climatological Normal Values\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 18 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=PAGASAextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181018190705/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaclimextrsangleyptcavite.csv\n| archivedate = 18 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-extremes/resource/023ed86e-c97f-4f09-9c6b-8b7a12836f7a\n| title = Sangley Point Cavite Climatological Extremes\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 18 October 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Subdivisions===\nThe city proper is divided into five districts: Dalahican, Santa Cruz, Caridad, San Antonio, and San Roque.

The virgin is depicted as a lady in mourning. Mary, garbed in black and white attire, seems to be on her knees as she contemplates the passion of her son. Before her are the crown of thorns and the nails instrument of Christ's passion.  An inscription was found at the back of the painting \u2013 ''A doze de Abril 1692 a\u00f1os Juan Oliba puso esta Stma. Ymagen Haqui'', which means,\"The sacred image was placed here by Juan Oliba on April 12, 1692\". This particular icon was used to bless the galleon plying between Cavite and Acapulco (Mexico) during formal sending off ceremonies. Thus, she was also called the Patroness of the Galleons.\n\nThe image was originally enshrined at the ''Ermita de Porta Vaga'', a small church located adjacent to the Porta Vaga gate of Cavite Puerto and was destroyed during the last world war.  The image is presently enshrined at the San Roque Parish Church, one of the three parishes in the City.\n\n===Languages===\n[[Chabacano]] is a Spanish-influenced [[creole language]] formerly spoken by majority of the people living in the city of Cavite. Chabacano emerged sometime after the arrival of the first Spaniards and Mexicans in the late 16th century. During this period, the people that lived near the military arsenal in Cavite City put themselves in contact with the Spaniards and Mexicans and began to incorporate in their own dialect many Spanish words, which then gave birth to the creole. Majority of residents today speak [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].\n\nToday, Chabacano is generally considered to be dying with only a fraction of the people, mostly elderly, able to speak the language. According to the Philippine professor, Alfredo B. German who wrote a thesis on the grammar in Chabacano dialect, the present conditions no longer favor the disenrolment of the same one. There are many probable reasons for the diminishing of Chabacano, among these being the massive arrival of [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking migrants to the city of [[Cavite]], and intermarriage.\n\nOne of the poets and Philippine writers, Jesus Balmori expressed himself in Chabacano. He was a great admirer of the dialect and wrote several verses in it. Another admirer of this dialect was Don Jaime de Veyra, the illustrious writer and famous Philippine historian, who feared more than all the probable extinction of the Chabacano when he wrote the following prophetic lines, \"I am afraid that the inevitable absorption of the \"Tagalog invasion\" on one side and the invasion of the English on the other hand, will wipe out or extinguish this inherited Castilian language in existence with his last representatives in the following generation.\" Professor Gervacio Miranda who also wrote a book in Chabacano said in his preface the following thing, \"My only objective to write this book is to possibly conserve in written form the Chabacano of [[Cavite]] for posterity,\" fearing the extinction of the dialect.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Festivals and events ===\nThe city is home to the Annual Cavite City Water Festival or Regada, held every 17th and 24th day of June.
