The tankers were simply too big to fit through the [[Panama Canal]] and would have to take a longer route that traversed the [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[South Africa]].<ref name=\"jstor.org\" />\n\nThe final obstacle to the exportation of oil was a diplomatic one. Since about 60 percent of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports were going to the United States, Chinese officials were worried that by buying more oil that they would become involved in the disputes between Chavez\u2019s anti-US regime and the [[Presidency of George W.

A \"USSD gateway\" service is also called a \"USSD center\".  \n\n'''USSD Gateway''' is based upon the ability of the delivery agent or the source to send and receive USSD messages. A USSD is a session-based protocol. USSD messages travel over GSM signaling channels and are used to query information and trigger services. Unlike similar services ([[SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]]), which are '''[[store and forward]]''' based, USSD establishes a real time session between mobile handset and application handling the service\n\n===Difference between USSD and other Gateways===\nThe difference between USSD Gateways and other messaging gateways is that USSD gateways maintain a single interactive session once the connection is established.  [[SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] store and forward messages independently of the user session, similar to the way email is sent over the internet.\n\n==Modular Operation==\n\n# Session Module : As per directions from the [[Signalling_System_No._7|SS7]]  (Signaling System 7) protocol stack\u2019s [[Mobile Application Part|MAP]] (Mobile Application Part), it receives and sends out session IDs from the session ID pool, and maintains and destroys the sessions.\n# MAP layer: [[Mobile Application Part]] is present both on the server and on the MS. \n# Gateway: A Gateway will wait for messages from the MAP layer and work to route these messages into [[Short Message Peer-to-Peer|SMPP]] protocol which is then delivered to the server applications. This is the most important operation, and this is the reason why USSDs are primarily used, as it helps to directly connect users to applications like bill checking and others.\n# Locator: This tries to find out the current [[cell site|cell]] and relays it to the Gateway. Then the messages are routed using Routing Numbers.\n# [[Home Location Register]]: This is the home zone where the given cell phone\u2019s number is registered in the database. This is different from the [[Visitor Location Register]] which is where the user is [[roaming]].\n#The reason why USSD is commonly used is because it enhances the WCDMA signalling and multiplexes the coherent signals.\n\nTypes of Applications:\n\n* Balance Check: The user can send a Process Supplementary Service request (PSSR) to the home zone which will forward this, under guidance from the Gateway, to the correct application. Then, the application sends an acknowledgement via USSD Gateway, HLR etc. known as PSSR response back to the user. Balance Notification at the end of charged call can also be given using Unstructured Supplementary Service Notify (USSN) message.\n* Voice Chat: Using the same process as above, one can use voice chat. This is highly useful when [[VoIP]] enabled phones are not available.\n* Advertising: The application can advertise their product using USSD which is less invasive than [[telemarketing]].\n* Roaming: This has huge advantages while roaming. This is because USSD services are well available in roaming networks and all the USSD messages are directed towards the subscriber's Home Network itself, thus, same set of services that are available in home network can be given in visited network too, giving subscribers a Virtual Home Environment (VHE).\n\nApart from PSSR and USSN, there is another method called Unstructured Supplementary Service Request (USSR) message that initiates a session by USSD Gateway to a Mobile User.

{"title_page": "SMS banking", "text_new": "[[Image:SMS Banking mobile phone screenshot.jpg|top|right|frame|Screenshot of a typical SMS Banking message on a [[mobile phone|mobile]] screen]]\n\n''SMS banking''' is a form of [[mobile banking]]. It is a facility used by some [[bank]]s or other [[financial institutions]] to send messages (also called notifications or alerts) to customers' [[mobile phone]]s using [[SMS (messaging)|SMS messaging]], or a service provided by them which enables customers to perform some [[financial transaction]]s using SMS.\n\n==Push and pull messages==\nSMS banking services may use either [[push and pull]] messages. Push messages are those that a bank sends out to a customer's mobile phone, without the customer initiating a request for the information. Typically, a push message could be a [[mobile marketing]] message or an alert of an event which happens in the customer's bank account, such as a large withdrawal of funds from an [[automatic teller machine|ATM]] or a large payment involving the customer's [[credit card]], etc. It may also be an alert that some payment is due, or that an e-statement is ready to be downloaded.\n\nAnother type of push message is [[one-time password]] (OTPs). OTPs are the latest tool used by financial institutions to combat [[cyber fraud]]. Instead of relying on traditional memorized passwords, OTPs are sent to a customer's mobile phone via SMS, who are required to repeat the OTP to complete transactions using online or mobile banking. The OTP is valid for a relatively short period and expires once it has been used.\n\nBank customers can select the type of activities for which they wish to receive an alert. The selection can be done either using [[online banking|internet banking]] or by phone.\n\nPull messages are initiated by the customer, using a mobile phone, for obtaining information or performing a transaction in the bank account. Examples of pull messages include an account balance enquiry, or requests for current information like currency [[exchange rates]] and deposit [[interest rates]], as published and updated by the bank.\n\n==Typical push and pull services offered==\nDepending on the selected extent of SMS banking transactions offered by the bank, a customer can be authorized to carry out either non-financial transactions, or both and financial and non-financial transactions. SMS banking solutions offer customers a range of functionality, classified by push and pull services as outlined below.\n\nTypical push services would include:\n\n* periodic account balance reporting (say at the end of month);\n* reporting of salary and other credits to the bank account;\n* successful or un-successful execution of a [[standing order (banking)|standing order]];\n* successful payment of a [[cheque]] issued on the account;\n* [[insufficient funds]];\n* large value withdrawals on an account;\n* large value withdrawals on the ATM or [[EFTPOS]] on a [[debit card]];\n* large value payment on a [[credit card]] or out of country activity on a credit card.\n* [[one-time password]] and authentication\n* an alert that some payment is due\n* an alert that an e-statement is ready to be downloaded.\n\nTypical pull services would include:\n\n*Account balance enquiry;\n*Mini statement request;\n*[[Electronic bill payment]];\n*Transfers between customer's own accounts, like moving money from a savings account to a current account to fund a cheque;\n*Stop payment instruction on a cheque;\n*Requesting for an [[ATM card]] or [[credit card]] to be suspended;\n*De-activating a credit or debit card when it is lost or the [[Personal identification number|PIN]] is known to be compromised;\n*Foreign currency exchange rates enquiry;\n*Fixed deposit interest rates enquiry.<ref>Peevers, G., Douglas, G., & Jack, M. A. (2008). A usability comparison of three alternative message formats for an SMS banking service. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 66(2).</ref>\n\n==Concerns and skepticism==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\nThere is a very real possibility for fraud when SMS banking is involved, as SMS uses insecure encryption and is easily spoofable (see the [[SMS]] page for details). Supporters of SMS banking claim that while SMS banking is not as secure as other conventional banking channels, like the ATM and internet banking, the SMS banking channel is not intended to be used for very high-risk transactions.<ref>Key Pousttchi, Martin Schurig, \"Assessment of Today's Mobile Banking Applications from the View of Customer Requirements\", hicss, vol. 7, pp.70184a, Proceedings of the 37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'04) - Track 7, 2004, p. 5-6.</ref>\n\n==Quality of service==\nDue to the concerns made explicit above, it is extremely important that [[SMS gateway]] providers can provide a decent quality of service for banks and financial institutions in regards to SMS services. Therefore, the provision of [[Service Level Agreement]] (SLA) is a requirement for this industry; it is necessary to give the bank customer delivery guarantees of all messages, as well as measurements on the speed of delivery, throughput, etc. SLAs give the service parameters in which a messaging solution is guaranteed to perform.\n\n==The convenience factor==\nThe convenience of executing simple transactions and sending out information or alerting a customer on the mobile phone is often the overriding factor that dominates over the skeptics who tend to be overly bitten by [[Information security|security]] concerns.\n\nAs a personalized end-user communication instrument, today mobile phones are perhaps the easiest channel on which customers can be reached on the spot, as they carry the mobile phone all the time no matter where they are. Besides, the operation of SMS banking functionality over phone key instructions makes its use very simple. This is quite different from internet banking which can offer broader functionality, but has the limitation of use only when the customer has access to a computer and the Internet. Also, urgent warning messages, such as SMS alerts, are received by the customer instantaneously; unlike other channels such as the post, email, Internet, [[telephone banking]], etc. on which a bank's notifications to the customer involves the risk of delayed delivery and response.\n\nThe SMS banking channel also acts as the bank's means of alerting its customers, especially in an emergency situation; e.g. when there is an ATM fraud happening in the region, the bank can push a mass alert (although not subscribed by all customers) or automatically alert on an individual basis when a predefined \u2018abnormal\u2019 transaction happens on a customer's account using the ATM or credit card. This capability mitigates the risk of fraud going unnoticed for a long time and increases customer confidence in the bank's [[information systems]].<ref>Barnes, S.J. and Corbitt, B. (2003) Mobile banking: Concept and Potential. International Journal of Mobile Communications. Vol. 1 (3).</ref>\n\n==Compensating controls for lack of encryption==\nThe lack of [[encryption]] on SMS messages is an area of concern that is often discussed. This concern sometimes arises within the group of the bank's technology personnel, due to their familiarity and past experience with encryption on the ATM and other payment channels. The lack of encryption is inherent to the SMS banking channel and several banks that use it have overcome their fears by introducing compensating controls and limiting the scope of the SMS banking application to where it offers an advantage over other channels.\n\nSuppliers of SMS banking software solutions have found reliable means by which the security concerns can be addressed. Typically the methods employed are by pre-registration and using security tokens where the transaction risk is perceived to be high. Sometimes ATM type [[Personal identification number|PINs]] are also employed, but the usage of PINs in SMS banking makes the customer's task more cumbersome.\n\n==Technologies==\nSMS banking usually integrates with a bank's computer and communications systems. As most banks have multiple [[Front and back ends|backend]] hosts, the more advanced SMS banking systems are built to be able to work in a multi-host banking environment; and to have open interfaces which allow for messaging between existing banking host systems using industry or de facto standards.\n\nWell developed and mature SMS banking software normally provide a robust control environment and a flexible and scalable operating environment. These solutions are able to connect seamlessly to multiple [[short message service center|SMSC]] operators in the country of operation. Depending on the volume of messages that are required to be pushed, means to connect to the SMSC could be different, such as using simple [[modems]] or connecting over [[leased line]] using low level [[communication protocols]] (like [[Short Message Peer-to-Peer|SMPP]], [[Universal Computer Protocol|UCP]] etc.) Advanced SMS banking solutions also cater to providing [[failover]] mechanisms and least-cost routing options.\n\nMost online banking platforms are owned and developed by the banks using them. There is only one open source online banking platform supporting mobile banking and SMS payments called [[Cyclos]], which is developed to stimulate and empower local banks in development countries.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Banks}}\n* [[Mobile banking]]\n* [[Short message service|SMS messaging]]\n* [[online banking|Internet banking]]\n* [[Short Message service center|Short Message Service Centre]]\n* [[One-time password]]\n* [[Cyclos]]\n* [[Barclays Pingit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:GSM standard]]\n[[Category:Mobile payments]]\n[[Category:Text messaging]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:SMS Banking mobile phone screenshot.jpg|top|right|frame|Screenshot of a typical SMS Banking message on a [[mobile phone|mobile]] screen]]\n\n''SMS banking''' is a form of [[mobile banking]].

In Romania, in the village of [[Dude\u0219tii Vechi]] prevailed Paulician ethnonym, while in [[Vinga]] the Bulgarian ethnonym because in the latter was a mixture of Bulgarian communities from different regions. Until the mid-20th century was developed idea of Bulgarian ethnic nationalism and according to it prevailed Bulgarian ethnonym, with the intermediate decision being \"Bulgarians Paulicians\".

On the other part, in Serbia the community was not in touch with such political influence and was accepted Paulician ethnonym, and only since 1990s became more in contact with other Bulgarian communities and institutions.

{"title_page": "GSM services", "text_new": "{{Short description|standard collection of mobile phone applications and features}}\n{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{distinguish | GSM}}\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n\n'''[[GSM|Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)]] services''' are a standard collection of applications and features available to [[mobile phone]] subscribers all over the world. The [[GSM]] standards are defined by the [[3GPP]] collaboration and implemented in hardware and software by equipment manufacturers and [[mobile phone operator]]s. The common standard makes it possible to use the same phones with different companies' services, or even [[roaming|roam]] into different countries. [[GSM]] is the world's most dominant mobile phone standard.\n\nThe design of the service is moderately complex because it must be able to locate a moving phone anywhere in the world, and accommodate the relatively small battery capacity, limited input/output capabilities, and weak radio transmitters on mobile devices.\n\n==Accessing a GSM network==\nIn order to gain access to GSM services, a user needs three things:\n* A billing relationship with a [[mobile phone operator]]. This is usually either where services are paid for in advance of them being consumed ([[prepaid mobile phone|prepaid]]), or where bills are issued and settled after the service has been consumed ([[postpaid mobile phone|postpaid]]).\n* A [[mobile phone]] that is [[GSM]] compliant and operates at the [[GSM frequency ranges|same frequency]] as the operator. Most phone companies sell phones from third-party manufacturers.\n* A [[SIM card|subscriber identity module (SIM card)]], which is activated by the operator once the billing relationship is established. After activation the card is then programmed with the subscriber's [[MSISDN|Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number (MSISDN)]] (the telephone number). Personal information such as contact numbers of friends and family can also be stored on the SIM by the subscriber.\n\nAfter subscribers sign up, information about their identity (telephone number) and what services they are allowed to access are stored in a \"SIM record\" in the [[Network Switching Subsystem|Home Location Register]] (HLR).\n\nOnce the SIM card is loaded into the phone and the phone is powered on, it will search for the nearest mobile phone mast (also called a [[Base Transceiver Station|Base Transceiver Station/BTS]]) with the strongest signal in the operator's [[GSM frequency bands|frequency band]]. If a mast can be successfully contacted, then there is said to be [[Coverage (telecommunication)|coverage]] in the area. The phone then identifies itself to the network through the control channel. Once this is successfully completed, the phone is said to be attached to the network.\n\nThe key feature of a mobile phone is the ability to receive and make calls in any area where coverage is available. This is generally called roaming from a customer perspective, but also called visiting when describing the underlying technical process. Each geographic area has a database called the [[Network switching subsystem#Visitor location register|Visitor Location Register]] (VLR), which contains details of all the mobiles currently in that area. Whenever a phone attaches, or visits, a new area, the ''Visitor'' Location Register must contact the ''Home'' Location Register to obtain the details for that phone. The current cellular location of the phone (i.e., which BTS it is at) is entered into the VLR record and will be used during a process called [[Mobility management#TMSI|paging]] when the GSM network wishes to locate the [[mobile phone]].\n\nEvery SIM card contains a secret key, called the Ki, which is used to provide authentication and encryption services. This is useful to prevent theft of service, and also to prevent \"over the air\" snooping of a user's activity. The network does this by utilising the [[Authentication Center]] and is accomplished without transmitting the key directly.\n\nEvery GSM phone contains a unique identifier (different from the phone number), called the [[International Mobile Equipment Identity]] (IMEI). This can be found by dialing *#06#. When a phone contacts the network, its IMEI may be checked against the [[Network switching subsystem|Equipment Identity Register]] to locate stolen phones and facilitate monitoring.\n\n==Voice all calls==\n\n===All Outgoing===\nOnce a [[mobile phone]] has successfully attached to a GSM network as described above, calls may be made from the phone to any other phone on the global [[Public Switched Telephone Network]].\n\nThe user dials the [[telephone number]], presses the ''send'' or ''talk'' key, and the [[mobile phone]] sends a call setup request message to the [[Network Switching Subsystem|mobile phone network]] via the nearest mobile phone base transceiver station (BTS).\n\nThe call setup request message is handled next by the [[Network switching subsystem#Mobile_switching_center_.28MSC.29|Mobile Switching Center]], which checks the subscriber's record held in the [[Visitor Location Register]] to see if the outgoing call is allowed. If so, the MSC then routes the call in the same way that a [[telephone exchange]] does in a fixed network.\n\nIf the subscriber is on a prepaid tariff (sometimes known as ''Pay As You Go'' (PAYG) or ''Pay & Go''), then an additional check is made to see if the subscriber has enough credit to proceed. If not, the call is rejected. If the call is allowed to continue, then it is continually monitored and the appropriate amount is decremented from the subscriber's account. When the credit reaches zero, the call is cut off by the network. The systems that monitor and provide the prepaid services are not part of the [[GSM]] standard services, but instead an example of [[intelligent network]] services that a [[mobile phone operator]] may decide to implement in addition to the standard GSM ones.\n\n===Incoming calls===\n\n====Gateway MSC contact====\nWhen someone places a call to a [[mobile phone]], they dial the [[telephone number]] (also called a [[MSISDN]]) associated with the phone user and the call is routed to the [[mobile phone operator]]'s Gateway Mobile Switching Centre. The [[GMSC|Gateway MSC]], as the name suggests, acts as the \"entrance\" from exterior portions of the [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] onto the provider's network.\n\nAs noted above, the phone is free to roam anywhere in the operator's network or on the networks of roaming partners, including in other countries. So the first job of the Gateway MSC is to determine the current location of the [[mobile phone]] in order to connect the call. It does this by consulting the [[Home Location Register]] (HLR), which, as described above, knows which [[Visitor Location Register]] (VLR) the phone is associated with, if any.\n\n====Routing the call====\nWhen the HLR receives this query message, it determines whether the call should be routed to another number (called a divert), or if it is to be routed directly to the mobile.\n\n* If the owner of the phone has previously requested that all incoming calls be diverted to another number, known as the Call Forward Unconditional (CFU) Number, then this number is stored in the Home Location Register. If that is the case, then the CFU number is returned to the Gateway MSC for immediate routing to that destination.\n* If the [[mobile phone]] is not currently associated with a Visited Location Register (because the phone has been turned off) then the Home Location Register returns a number known as the Call Forward Not Reachable (CFNRc) number to the Gateway MSC, and the call is forwarded there. Many operators may set this value automatically to the phone's [[voice mail]] number, so that callers may leave a message. The mobile phone may sometimes override the default setting.\n* Finally, if the Home Location Register knows that the phone is roaming in a particular VLR area, then it will request a temporary number (called an [[MSRN]]) from that VLR (using the [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]] as the reference number). This number is relayed back to the Gateway MSC, and then used to route the call to the MSC where the called phone is roaming.\n\n==== Locating and ringing the phone ====\n\nWhen the call arrives at the Visited MSC, the MSRN is used to determine which of the phones in this area is being called, that is the MSRN maps back to the [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]] of the original phone number dialled. The MSC [[mobility management|pages]] all the [[Base Station Subsystem|mobile phone masts]] in the area that the IMSI is registered in order to inform the phone that there is an incoming call for it. If the subscriber answers, a speech path is created through the Visiting MSC and Gateway MSC back to the network of the person making the call, and a normal [[telephone]] call follows.\n\nIt is also possible that the phone call is not answered. If the subscriber is busy on another call (and [[call waiting]] is not being used) the Visited MSC routes the call to a pre-determined Call Forward Busy (CFB) number. Similarly, if the subscriber does not answer the call after a period of time (typically 30 seconds) then the Visited MSC routes the call to a pre-determined Call Forward No Reply (CFNRy) number. Once again, the operator may decide to set this value by default to the [[voice mail]] of the mobile so that callers can leave a message.\n\nIf the subscriber does not respond to the paging request, either due to being out of coverage, or their battery has gone flat/removed, then the Visited MSC routes the call to a pre-determined Call Forward Not Reachable (CFNRc) number. Once again, the operator may decide to set this value by default to the [[voice mail]] of the mobile so that callers can leave a message.\n\nA roaming user may want to avoid these forwarding services in the visited network as roaming charges will apply.\n\n===Voice charges===\n{{see also|Mobile telephony#Tariff models}}\nIn the United States and Canada, callers pay the cost of connecting to the Gateway MSC of the subscriber's phone company, regardless of the actual location of the phone. As mobile numbers are given standard geographic numbers according to the [[North American Numbering Plan]], callers pay the same to reach fixed phones and mobile phones in a given geographic area. Mobile subscribers pay for the connection time (typically using in-plan or prepaid minutes) for both incoming and outgoing calls. For outgoing calls, any long distance charges are billed as if they originate at the GMSC, even though it is the visiting MSC that completes the connection to the PSTN. Plans that include nationwide long distance and/or nationwide roaming at no additional charge over \"local\" outgoing calls are popular.\n\nMobile networks in Europe, Asia (except Hong Kong, Macau (Macao) and Singapore), Australia, and Argentina only charge their subscribers for outgoing calls. Incoming calls are free to the mobile subscriber with the exception of receiving a call while the subscriber is roaming as described below. However, callers typically pay a higher rate when calling mobile phones. Special prefixes are used to designate mobile numbers so that callers are aware they are calling a mobile phone and therefore will be charged a higher rate.\n\nFrom the caller's point of view, it does not matter where the mobile subscriber is, as the technical process of connecting the call is the same. If a subscriber is [[roaming]] on a different company's network, the subscriber, instead of the caller, [[Roaming#Tariffs|may pay a surcharge]] for the connection time. International roaming calls are often quite expensive, and as a result some companies require subscribers to grant explicit permission to receive calls while roaming to certain countries.\n\n===Speech encoding===\nDuring a GSM call, speech is converted from [[analog signal|analogue]] sound waves to [[Digital data|digital]] data by the phone itself, and transmitted through the mobile phone network by digital means. (Though older parts of the fixed [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] may use analog transmission.)\n\nThe digital algorithm used to encode speech signals is called a [[codec]]. The speech codecs used in [[GSM]] are called [[Half Rate|Half-Rate (HR)]], [[Full Rate|Full-Rate (FR)]], [[Enhanced Full Rate|Enhanced Full-Rate (EFR)]], [[Adaptive Multi-Rate|Adaptive Multirate (AMR)]] and Wideband AMR also known as HD voice. All codecs except AMR operate with a fixed data rate and error correction level.\n\n== Data transmission ==\n\nThe GSM standard also provides separate facilities for transmitting digital data. This allows a mobile phone to act like any other computer on the [[Internet]], sending and receiving data via the [[Internet Protocol]].\n\nThe mobile may also be connected to a desktop computer, [[laptop]], or [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]], for use as a network interface (just like a [[modem]] or [[Ethernet]] card, but using one of the GSM data protocols described below instead of a PSTN-compatible audio channel or an Ethernet link to transmit data). Some GSM phones can also be controlled by a standardised [[Hayes AT command set]] through a serial cable or a wireless link (using [[Infrared Data Association|IRDA]] or [[Bluetooth]]). The AT commands can control anything from ring tones to data compression algorithms.\n\nIn addition to general Internet access, other special services may be provided by the [[mobile phone operator]], such as [[Short message service|SMS]].\n\n===Circuit-switched data protocols===\nA [[circuit-switched]] data connection reserves a certain amount of bandwidth between two points for the life of a connection, just as a traditional phone call allocates an audio channel of a certain quality between two phones for the duration of the call.\n\nTwo circuit-switched data protocols are defined in the GSM standard: [[Circuit Switched Data]] (CSD) and [[High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data]] (HSCSD). These types of connections are typically charged on a per-second basis, regardless of the amount of data sent over the link. This is because a certain amount of bandwidth is dedicated to the connection regardless of whether or not it is needed.\n\nCircuit-switched connections do have the advantage of providing a constant, guaranteed [[quality of service]], which is useful for real-time applications like video conferencing.\n\n===General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)===\n{{main article | General Packet Radio Service}}\n\nThe [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS) is a [[packet-switched]] data transmission protocol, which was incorporated into the GSM standard in 1997. It is backwards-compatible with systems that use pre-1997 versions of the standard. GPRS does this by sending packets to the local mobile phone mast ([[Base Transceiver Station|BTS]]) on channels not being used by circuit-switched voice calls or data connections. Multiple GPRS users can share a single unused channel because each of them uses it only for occasional short bursts.\n\nThe advantage of packet-switched connections is that bandwidth is only used when there is actually data to transmit. This type of connection is thus generally billed by the kilobyte instead of by the second, and is usually a cheaper alternative for applications that only need to send and receive data sporadically, like [[instant messaging]].\n\n[[GPRS]] is usually described as a ''[[2.5G]]'' technology; see the main article for more information.\n\n===Short Message Service (SMS)===\n{{main|Short message service}}\n[[SMS|Short Message Service]] (more commonly known as [[text messaging]]) has become the most used data application on mobile phones, with 74% of all mobile phone users worldwide already as active users of SMS, or 2.4 billion people by the end of 2007.\n\nSMS text messages may be sent by mobile phone users to other mobile users or external services that accept SMS. The messages are usually sent from mobile devices via the [[Short message service centre|Short Message Service Centre]] using the [[Mobile application part|MAP]] protocol.\n\nThe SMSC is a central routing hubs for Short Messages. Many mobile service operators use their SMSCs as gateways to external systems, including the [[Internet]], incoming SMS news feeds, and other mobile operators (often using the [[de facto]] [[Short Message Peer-to-Peer|SMPP]] standard for SMS exchange).\n\nThe [[Short message service|SMS]] standard is also used outside of the [[GSM]] system; see the main article for details.\n\n== Supplementary Services ==\nSee also [[Unstructured Supplementary Service Data|GSM codes for supplementary services]].\n\n* '''[[Call forwarding]]'''.\n* '''Barring of Outgoing Calls'''.\n* '''Barring of Incoming Calls'''.\n* '''Advice of Charge (AoC)'''.

The [[GSM]] standards are defined by the [[3GPP]] collaboration and implemented in hardware and software by equipment manufacturers and [[mobile phone operator]]s. The common standard makes it possible to use the same phones with different companies' services, or even [[roaming|roam]] into different countries. [[GSM]] is the world's most dominant mobile phone standard.\n\nThe design of the service is moderately complex because it must be able to locate a moving phone anywhere in the world, and accommodate the relatively small battery capacity, limited input/output capabilities, and weak radio transmitters on mobile devices.\n\n==Accessing a GSM network==\nIn order to gain access to GSM services, a user needs three things:\n* A billing relationship with a [[mobile phone operator]]. This is usually either where services are paid for in advance of them being consumed ([[prepaid mobile phone|prepaid]]), or where bills are issued and settled after the service has been consumed ([[postpaid mobile phone|postpaid]]).\n* A [[mobile phone]] that is [[GSM]] compliant and operates at the [[GSM frequency ranges|same frequency]] as the operator. Most phone companies sell phones from third-party manufacturers.\n* A [[SIM card|subscriber identity module (SIM card)]], which is activated by the operator once the billing relationship is established. After activation the card is then programmed with the subscriber's [[MSISDN|Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number (MSISDN)]] (the telephone number). Personal information such as contact numbers of friends and family can also be stored on the SIM by the subscriber.\n\nAfter subscribers sign up, information about their identity (telephone number) and what services they are allowed to access are stored in a \"SIM record\" in the [[Network Switching Subsystem|Home Location Register]] (HLR).\n\nOnce the SIM card is loaded into the phone and the phone is powered on, it will search for the nearest mobile phone mast (also called a [[Base Transceiver Station|Base Transceiver Station/BTS]]) with the strongest signal in the operator's [[GSM frequency bands|frequency band]]. If a mast can be successfully contacted, then there is said to be [[Coverage (telecommunication)|coverage]] in the area. The phone then identifies itself to the network through the control channel. Once this is successfully completed, the phone is said to be attached to the network.\n\nThe key feature of a mobile phone is the ability to receive and make calls in any area where coverage is available. This is generally called roaming from a customer perspective, but also called visiting when describing the underlying technical process. Each geographic area has a database called the [[Network switching subsystem#Visitor location register|Visitor Location Register]] (VLR), which contains details of all the mobiles currently in that area. Whenever a phone attaches, or visits, a new area, the ''Visitor'' Location Register must contact the ''Home'' Location Register to obtain the details for that phone. The current cellular location of the phone (i.e., which BTS it is at) is entered into the VLR record and will be used during a process called [[Mobility management#TMSI|paging]] when the GSM network wishes to locate the [[mobile phone]].\n\nEvery SIM card contains a secret key, called the Ki, which is used to provide authentication and encryption services. This is useful to prevent theft of service, and also to prevent \"over the air\" snooping of a user's activity. The network does this by utilising the [[Authentication Center]] and is accomplished without transmitting the key directly.\n\nEvery GSM phone contains a unique identifier (different from the phone number), called the [[International Mobile Equipment Identity]] (IMEI). This can be found by dialing *#06#. When a phone contacts the network, its IMEI may be checked against the [[Network switching subsystem|Equipment Identity Register]] to locate stolen phones and facilitate monitoring.\n\n==Voice all calls==\n\n===All Outgoing===\nOnce a [[mobile phone]] has successfully attached to a GSM network as described above, calls may be made from the phone to any other phone on the global [[Public Switched Telephone Network]].\n\nThe user dials the [[telephone number]], presses the ''send'' or ''talk'' key, and the [[mobile phone]] sends a call setup request message to the [[Network Switching Subsystem|mobile phone network]] via the nearest mobile phone base transceiver station (BTS).\n\nThe call setup request message is handled next by the [[Network switching subsystem#Mobile_switching_center_.28MSC.29|Mobile Switching Center]], which checks the subscriber's record held in the [[Visitor Location Register]] to see if the outgoing call is allowed. If so, the MSC then routes the call in the same way that a [[telephone exchange]] does in a fixed network.\n\nIf the subscriber is on a prepaid tariff (sometimes known as ''Pay As You Go'' (PAYG) or ''Pay & Go''), then an additional check is made to see if the subscriber has enough credit to proceed. If not, the call is rejected. If the call is allowed to continue, then it is continually monitored and the appropriate amount is decremented from the subscriber's account. When the credit reaches zero, the call is cut off by the network. The systems that monitor and provide the prepaid services are not part of the [[GSM]] standard services, but instead an example of [[intelligent network]] services that a [[mobile phone operator]] may decide to implement in addition to the standard GSM ones.\n\n===Incoming calls===\n\n====Gateway MSC contact====\nWhen someone places a call to a [[mobile phone]], they dial the [[telephone number]] (also called a [[MSISDN]]) associated with the phone user and the call is routed to the [[mobile phone operator]]'s Gateway Mobile Switching Centre. The [[GMSC|Gateway MSC]], as the name suggests, acts as the \"entrance\" from exterior portions of the [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] onto the provider's network.\n\nAs noted above, the phone is free to roam anywhere in the operator's network or on the networks of roaming partners, including in other countries. So the first job of the Gateway MSC is to determine the current location of the [[mobile phone]] in order to connect the call. It does this by consulting the [[Home Location Register]] (HLR), which, as described above, knows which [[Visitor Location Register]] (VLR) the phone is associated with, if any.\n\n====Routing the call====\nWhen the HLR receives this query message, it determines whether the call should be routed to another number (called a divert), or if it is to be routed directly to the mobile.\n\n* If the owner of the phone has previously requested that all incoming calls be diverted to another number, known as the Call Forward Unconditional (CFU) Number, then this number is stored in the Home Location Register. If that is the case, then the CFU number is returned to the Gateway MSC for immediate routing to that destination.\n* If the [[mobile phone]] is not currently associated with a Visited Location Register (because the phone has been turned off) then the Home Location Register returns a number known as the Call Forward Not Reachable (CFNRc) number to the Gateway MSC, and the call is forwarded there. Many operators may set this value automatically to the phone's [[voice mail]] number, so that callers may leave a message. The mobile phone may sometimes override the default setting.\n* Finally, if the Home Location Register knows that the phone is roaming in a particular VLR area, then it will request a temporary number (called an [[MSRN]]) from that VLR (using the [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]] as the reference number). This number is relayed back to the Gateway MSC, and then used to route the call to the MSC where the called phone is roaming.\n\n==== Locating and ringing the phone ====\n\nWhen the call arrives at the Visited MSC, the MSRN is used to determine which of the phones in this area is being called, that is the MSRN maps back to the [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]] of the original phone number dialled. The MSC [[mobility management|pages]] all the [[Base Station Subsystem|mobile phone masts]] in the area that the IMSI is registered in order to inform the phone that there is an incoming call for it. If the subscriber answers, a speech path is created through the Visiting MSC and Gateway MSC back to the network of the person making the call, and a normal [[telephone]] call follows.\n\nIt is also possible that the phone call is not answered. If the subscriber is busy on another call (and [[call waiting]] is not being used) the Visited MSC routes the call to a pre-determined Call Forward Busy (CFB) number. Similarly, if the subscriber does not answer the call after a period of time (typically 30 seconds) then the Visited MSC routes the call to a pre-determined Call Forward No Reply (CFNRy) number. Once again, the operator may decide to set this value by default to the [[voice mail]] of the mobile so that callers can leave a message.\n\nIf the subscriber does not respond to the paging request, either due to being out of coverage, or their battery has gone flat/removed, then the Visited MSC routes the call to a pre-determined Call Forward Not Reachable (CFNRc) number. Once again, the operator may decide to set this value by default to the [[voice mail]] of the mobile so that callers can leave a message.\n\nA roaming user may want to avoid these forwarding services in the visited network as roaming charges will apply.\n\n===Voice charges===\n{{see also|Mobile telephony#Tariff models}}\nIn the United States and Canada, callers pay the cost of connecting to the Gateway MSC of the subscriber's phone company, regardless of the actual location of the phone. As mobile numbers are given standard geographic numbers according to the [[North American Numbering Plan]], callers pay the same to reach fixed phones and mobile phones in a given geographic area. Mobile subscribers pay for the connection time (typically using in-plan or prepaid minutes) for both incoming and outgoing calls. For outgoing calls, any long distance charges are billed as if they originate at the GMSC, even though it is the visiting MSC that completes the connection to the PSTN. Plans that include nationwide long distance and/or nationwide roaming at no additional charge over \"local\" outgoing calls are popular.\n\nMobile networks in Europe, Asia (except Hong Kong, Macau (Macao) and Singapore), Australia, and Argentina only charge their subscribers for outgoing calls.
