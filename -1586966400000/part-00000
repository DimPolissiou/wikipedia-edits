In part because of its success, the Yardbirds elected to move toward a pop-oriented sound, much to the annoyance of Clapton, who was devoted to the blues and not commercial success. He left the Yardbirds on the day that \"For Your Love\" went public, a move that left the band without its lead guitarist and most accomplished member.

In June, Clapton was invited to jam with [[Jimmy Page]], recording a number of tracks that would be retroactively credited to [[All-Stars (band)|The Immediate All-Stars]]. In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called the Glands, which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. In November 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. In March 1966, while still a member of the Bluesbreakers, Clapton briefly collaborated on a [[side project]] with [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Steve Winwood]] among others, recording only a few tracks under the name [[Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse]]. During his second Bluesbreakers stint, Clapton gained a reputation as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit. Although Clapton gained world fame for his playing on the influential album, ''[[Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton|Blues Breakers \u2013 John Mayall \u2013 With Eric Clapton]]'', this album was not released until he had left the band for the last time in July 1966.\n\nHaving swapped his [[Fender Telecaster]] and [[Vox AC30]] amplifier for a 1960 [[Gibson Les Paul|Gibson Les Paul Standard]] guitar and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall amplifier]], Clapton's sound and playing inspired the famous [[slogan]] \"[[Clapton is God]]\", spray-painted by an unknown admirer on a wall in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite news| first= Neil| last= McCormick| title= Just how good is Eric Clapton?| date= 24 July 2015| agency= The Telegraph| location= London| work= The Daily Telegraph| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11501274/Just-how-good-is-Eric-Clapton.html| access-date= 3 April 2018| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171124071909/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11501274/Just-how-good-is-Eric-Clapton.html| archive-date= 24 November 2017| url-status= live}}</ref> The [[graffiti]] was captured in a now-famous photograph, in which a dog is urinating on the wall.

''Disraeli Gears'' contained Clapton's searing guitar lines, Bruce's soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker's powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream's talents secured them as an influential [[power trio]]. Clapton's voice can be heard on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', on the tracks \"[[Are You Hung Up?]]\" and \"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\".\n\n[[File:The Fool guitar (replica).jpg|thumb|upright=.65|Clapton's [[The Fool (guitar)|The Fool guitar]] ''(replica shown)'', with its bright artwork and famous \"woman tone\", was symbolic of the 1960s psychedelic rock era.]]\n\nIn 28 months, Cream had become a commercial success, selling millions of records and playing throughout the US and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalist's role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions. Their US hit singles include \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\" (No. 5, 1968), \"[[White Room]]\" (No. 6, 1968) and \"[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]\" (No. 28, 1969) \u2013 a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Cross Road Blues\". Though Cream were hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream's demise. A strongly critical ''Rolling Stone'' review of a concert of the group's second headlining US tour was another significant factor in the trio's demise, and it affected Clapton profoundly.<ref>Welch, Chris: \"Cream\" (2000), page 131</ref> Clapton has also credited [[Music From Big Pink]], the debut album of [[The Band]], and its revolutionary [[Americana]] sound as influencing his decision to leave Cream.<ref>Runtagh, J.

It also spawned the studio single \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\", co-written by Clapton and [[George Harrison]]. Clapton met Harrison and became close friends with him after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]]. In 1968, Clapton played the lead guitar solo on Harrison's \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", from the Beatles' [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"). Harrison's debut solo album, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' (1968), became the first of many Harrison solo records to include Clapton on guitar. Clapton went largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison's albums due to contractual restraints, and Harrison was credited as \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" for his contributions to the song \"Badge\" on ''Goodbye''. The pair would often play live together as each other's guest. A year after Harrison's death in 2001, Clapton was musical director for the [[Concert for George]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3138096.stm|title=Ex-Beatles at Harrison film tribute|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=25 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1969, when the Beatles were recording and filming what became ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', tensions became so acute that Harrison quit the group for several days, prompting [[John Lennon]] to suggest they complete the project with Clapton if Harrison did not return.<ref>Elliot J.

When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Clapton and Duane Allman, with Allman's [[slide guitar]] as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami with [[Atlantic Records]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with Clapton on Cream's ''Disraeli Gears'', the band recorded a double album.\n\nThe album contained the hit love song \"[[Layla]]\", inspired by the classical poet of [[Persian literature]], [[Nizami Ganjavi]]'s ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'', a copy of which [[Ian Dallas]] had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful, unavailable woman and went crazy because he could not marry her.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William |last=McKeen |title=Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology |publisher=W.

A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd \u2013 who was also producing the Allmans \u2013 invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to \"[[Tell the Truth (Derek and the Dominos song)|Tell the Truth]]\" and \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\". In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded \"[[Key to the Highway]]\", \"[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]\" (a [[blues standard]] popularised by [[Freddie King]] and others) and \"Why Does Love Got to be So Sad?\" In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded \"I Looked Away\", \"[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]\" and \"Keep on Growing\". Allman returned to record \"I Am Yours\", \"[[Anyday (Derek and the Dominos song)|Anyday]]\" and \"It's Too Late\". On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\" and the title track. The following day, the final track, \"It's Too Late\", was recorded.<ref>\"[[The Layla Sessions]]\" CD liner notes.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric \"slowhand\" Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Clapton in [[Barcelona]], 1974]]\nTragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of \"Little Wing\" as a tribute. On {{nowrap|17 September}} 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[Fender Stratocaster]] that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, ''Layla'' received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amid a blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.</ref>\n\nRecording of a second Dominos studio album was underway when a clash of egos took place and Clapton walked out, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{nowrap|29 October}} 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the ''Layla'' sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the \"musical brother I'd never had but wished I did\".<ref>Clapton, ''The Autobiography'', 128.</ref> Although Radle remained Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it was not until 2003 that Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again; Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' show. Another tragic footnote to the Dominos story was the fate of drummer [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], who was an undiagnosed [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] and years later murdered his mother during a [[Psychosis|psychotic episode]].

Omnibus Press, 1995</ref> Still infatuated with Boyd and torn by his friendship with Harrison, he withdrew from recording and touring to isolation in his Surrey residence as the Dominos broke up. He nursed a [[Substance abuse|heroin addiction]], which resulted in a lengthy career hiatus interrupted only by performing at Harrison's [[Concert for Bangladesh]] benefit shows in New York in August 1971; there, he passed out on stage, was revived, and managed to finish his performance.<ref name=\"unuhsh\"/> In January 1973, [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] organised a comeback concert for Clapton at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], titled the \"[[Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert|Rainbow Concert]]\", to help Clapton kick his addiction.

His appearance in the film (performing \"Eyesight to the Blind\") is notable as he is clearly wearing a fake beard in some shots, the result of deciding to shave off his real beard after the initial takes in an attempt to force the director to remove his earlier scene from the film and leave the set.<ref name=\"nxfddy\"/>\n\n[[File:Clapton and Elliman.jpg|thumb|[[Yvonne Elliman]] with Clapton promoting ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' in 1974]]\nIn 1974, Clapton started living with Boyd (they would not marry until 1979) and was no longer using heroin (although he gradually began to drink heavily).

The 1975 album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'' continued this trend. The album's original title, ''The World's Greatest Guitar Player (There's One in Every Crowd)'', was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood.

The horn-driven \"Run\" echoed Collins' \"[[Sussudio]]\" and other work, while \"Tearing Us Apart\" (with [[Tina Turner]]) and \"Miss You\" continued Clapton's more angry sound.

In part because of its success, the Yardbirds elected to move toward a pop-oriented sound, much to the annoyance of Clapton, who was devoted to the blues and not commercial success. He left the Yardbirds on the day that \"For Your Love\" went public, a move that left the band without its lead guitarist and most accomplished member.

In June, Clapton was invited to jam with [[Jimmy Page]], recording a number of tracks that would be retroactively credited to [[All-Stars (band)|The Immediate All-Stars]]. In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called the Glands, which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. In November 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. In March 1966, while still a member of the Bluesbreakers, Clapton briefly collaborated on a [[side project]] with [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Steve Winwood]] among others, recording only a few tracks under the name [[Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse]]. During his second Bluesbreakers stint, Clapton gained a reputation as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit.

Cream's repertoire varied from hard rock (\"[[I Feel Free]]\") to lengthy blues-based instrumental jams (\"[[Spoonful]]\"). ''Disraeli Gears'' contained Clapton's searing guitar lines, Bruce's soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker's powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream's talents secured them as an influential [[power trio]]. Clapton's voice can be heard on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', on the tracks \"[[Are You Hung Up?]]\" and \"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\".\n\n[[File:The Fool guitar (replica).jpg|thumb|upright=.65|Clapton's [[The Fool (guitar)|The Fool guitar]] ''(replica shown)'', with its bright artwork and famous \"woman tone\", was symbolic of the 1960s psychedelic rock era.]]\n\nIn 28 months, Cream had become a commercial success, selling millions of records and playing throughout the US and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalist's role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions. Their US hit singles include \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\" (No. 5, 1968), \"[[White Room]]\" (No. 6, 1968) and \"[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]\" (No. 28, 1969) \u2013 a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Cross Road Blues\". Though Cream were hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar legend reached new heights, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream's demise. A strongly critical ''Rolling Stone'' review of a concert of the group's second headlining US tour was another significant factor in the trio's demise, and it affected Clapton profoundly.<ref>Welch, Chris: \"Cream\" (2000), page 131</ref>\n\nCream's farewell album, ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye]]'', comprising live performances recorded at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], Los Angeles, on {{nowrap|19 October}} 1968, was released shortly after Cream disbanded. It also spawned the studio single \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\", co-written by Clapton and [[George Harrison]]. Clapton met Harrison and became close friends with him after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]]. In 1968, Clapton played the lead guitar solo on Harrison's \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", from the Beatles' [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"). Harrison's debut solo album, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' (1968), became the first of many Harrison solo records to include Clapton on guitar. Clapton went largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison's albums due to contractual restraints, and Harrison was credited as \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" for his contributions to the song \"Badge\" on ''Goodbye''. The pair would often play live together as each other's guest. A year after Harrison's death in 2001, Clapton was musical director for the [[Concert for George]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3138096.stm|title=Ex-Beatles at Harrison film tribute|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=25 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1969, when the Beatles were recording and filming what became ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', tensions became so acute that Harrison quit the group for several days, prompting [[John Lennon]] to suggest they complete the project with Clapton if Harrison did not return.<ref>Elliot J.

When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Clapton and Duane Allman, with Allman's [[slide guitar]] as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami with [[Atlantic Records]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with Clapton on Cream's ''Disraeli Gears'', the band recorded a double album.\n\nThe album contained the hit love song \"[[Layla]]\", inspired by the classical poet of [[Persian literature]], [[Nizami Ganjavi]]'s ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'', a copy of which [[Ian Dallas]] had given to Clapton.

A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd \u2013 who was also producing the Allmans \u2013 invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to \"[[Tell the Truth (Derek and the Dominos song)|Tell the Truth]]\" and \"[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]\". In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded \"[[Key to the Highway]]\", \"[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]\" (a [[blues standard]] popularised by [[Freddie King]] and others) and \"Why Does Love Got to be So Sad?\" In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded \"I Looked Away\", \"[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]\" and \"Keep on Growing\". Allman returned to record \"I Am Yours\", \"[[Anyday (Derek and the Dominos song)|Anyday]]\" and \"It's Too Late\". On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix's \"[[Little Wing]]\" and the title track. The following day, the final track, \"It's Too Late\", was recorded.<ref>\"[[The Layla Sessions]]\" CD liner notes.</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric \"slowhand\" Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Clapton in [[Barcelona]], 1974]]\nTragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of \"Little Wing\" as a tribute. On {{nowrap|17 September}} 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[Fender Stratocaster]] that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, ''Layla'' received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a US tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amid a blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''.<ref>''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.</ref>\n\nRecording of a second Dominos studio album was underway when a clash of egos took place and Clapton walked out, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{nowrap|29 October}} 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the ''Layla'' sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the \"musical brother I'd never had but wished I did\".<ref>Clapton, ''The Autobiography'', 128.</ref> Although Radle remained Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it was not until 2003 that Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again; Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' show.

The 1975 album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'' continued this trend. The album's original title, ''The World's Greatest Guitar Player (There's One in Every Crowd)'', was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood.

A few months after his discharge, Clapton began working on his next album, against doctors' orders. Working with Tom Dowd, he produced what he thought as his \"most forced\" album to date, ''[[Money and Cigarettes]]''.

The horn-driven \"Run\" echoed Collins' \"[[Sussudio]]\" and other work, while \"Tearing Us Apart\" (with [[Tina Turner]]) and \"Miss You\" continued Clapton's more angry sound.

The development of the Foveon X3 technology is the subject of the 2005 book ''The Silicon Eye'' by [[George Gilder]].\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Absorption-X3.png|thumb|right|500px|Colour absorption in silicon and the Foveon X3 sensor. See text for explanation]]\n\nThe diagram to the right demonstrates how the Foveon X3 sensor works. Depicted on the left is the absorption of colours of the spectrum for each wavelength as they pass through the [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]]. On the right, a Foveon X3 layered sensor stack is shown depicting the colours it detects at each absorption level for each output pixel. The sensor colours shown are only examples. In practice, the colour attributes of each output pixel using this sensor result from the camera's [[image processing]] algorithms that employ a matrix process to construct a single RGB colour from all of the data sensed by the photodiode stack.<ref name=\"Rush and Hubel\"/>\nIn terms of colour accuracy (sometimes referred to as a [[Metamerism (color)|metamerism index]]), the Foveon X3 was state of the art at the time of its invention.<ref>Paul M.

However, because the collection depth of the deepest sensor layer (red) is comparable to collection depths in other silicon [[CMOS]] and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] sensors, some diffusion of electrons and loss of sharpness in the longer wavelengths occurs.<ref>{{cite thesis|author=Ji Soo Lee|url= http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~visor/pdf/JiSoo_Lee_PhD.pdf|title= Photoresponse of CMOS Image Sensors|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219083724/http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~visor/pdf/JiSoo_Lee_PhD.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-19|url-status=dead|type=Ph.D. dissertation|publisher=University of Waterloo|date=2003}}</ref>\n\n==Utilisation==\nThe first digital camera to use a Foveon X3 sensor was the [[Sigma SD9]], a [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital SLR]] launched in 2002.<ref>[http://www.dpreview.com/news/0202/02021104sigmads9.asp Digital Photography Review: 18 February 2002]</ref> This used a 2268x1512\u00d73 (3.54\u00d73 MP) iteration of the sensor, and was built on a Sigma-designed body using the [[Sigma SA mount]]. The camera was followed in 2003 by the improved but technically similar [[Sigma SD10]],<ref>[http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sigmasd10/ Digital Photography Review: Sigma SD10: March 2004]</ref> which was in turn superseded in 2006 by the [[Sigma SD14]], which used a higher-resolution, 2640\u00d71760\u00d73 sensor. The successor, the [[Sigma SD15]], was released June 2010<ref>[http://www.dpreview.com/news/1006/10061102sigmasd15available.asp Digital Photography Review: Sigma UK to start shipping SD15 digital camera: 11 June 2010]</ref> using the same 2640\u00d71760\u00d73 (4.7\u00d73 MP) sensor as the SD14, and the [[Sigma SD1]] was released in June 2011<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.photographyblog.com/news/sigma_sd1_price_availability_announced/ |title=Sigma SD1 Price & Availability Announced |accessdate=2011-05-24}}</ref> with a new 4800\u00d73200\u00d73 sensor aimed at the professional market.<ref>[http://www.dpreview.com/news/1009/10092129sigmasd1.asp Digital Photography Review: Sigma releases SD1 flagship digital SLR: 21 September 2010]</ref>\n\nIn 2004, [[Polaroid Corporation]] announced the Polaroid x530,<ref>[http://www.dpreview.com/news/0402/04020909polaroidx530.asp Digital Photography Review: Polaroid x530: 09 February 2004]</ref> a compact camera with a 1408\u00d71056\u00d73, 1/1.8\" sensor. The camera received a limited release in 2005 but was recalled later in the year for unspecified image quality problems.<ref>[http://www.imaging-resource.com/NEWS/1113577444.html Imaging Resource: 15 April 2005]</ref> Sigma announced a prototype of their Foveon-based compact camera in 2006, the [[Sigma DP1]], using the same 14 MP sensor as the SD14 DSLR. A revised version of the prototype was exhibited in 2007, and the camera was eventually launched in Spring 2008.<ref>[http://www.dpreview.com/news/0801/08013108sigmadp1.asp Digital Photography Review: Sigma announces DP1 to be available spring 2008: 13 January 2008]</ref> Unlike the Polaroid x530, the DP1 had an [[APS-C]]-sized sensor, with a 28mm equivalent [[prime lens]]. The camera was subsequently revised as the DP1s and the DP1x. In 2009, the company launched the [[Sigma DP2|DP2]],<ref>[http://www.dpreview.com/news/0905/09051401sigmadp2availability.asp Digital Photography Review: Sigma UK: DP2 now available: 14 May 2009]</ref> a compact camera using the same sensor and body as the DP1, but with a 41mm-equivalent f/2.8 lens.\n\nFoveon X3 sensors were also used in the Hanvision HVDUO-5M<ref>[http://www.alt-vision.com/hvduo5m.htm Hanvision: HVDUO-5M Digital Color Camera]</ref> and HVDUO-10M,<ref>[http://www.alt-vision.com/hvduo10m.htm Hanvision: HVDUO-10M Color Camera]</ref> a pair of digital cameras aimed at the scientific and industrial markets.\n\n==Comparison to Bayer filter sensors&nbsp;\u2013 operational differences==\nThe operation of the Foveon X3 sensor is quite different from that of the [[Bayer filter]] image sensor more commonly used in [[digital cameras]]. In the Bayer sensor, each photosite in the array consists of a single light sensor (either CMOS or CCD) that, as a result of filtration, is exposed to only one of the three primary colours, red, green, or blue. Constructing a full-colour image from a Bayer sensor requires [[demosaicing]], an [[Image scaling|interpolative process]] in which the output pixel associated with each photosite is assigned an [[RGB color model|RGB]] value based in part on the level of red, green, and blue reported by those photosites adjacent to it. The Foveon X3 sensor creates its RGB colour output for each photosite by combining the outputs of each of the stacked photodiodes at each of its photosites. This operational difference results in several significant consequences.\n\n===Colour artifacts===\nBecause demosaicing is not required for the Foveon X3 sensor to produce a full-colour image, the colour artifacts (\"coloured [[jaggies]]\") associated with that process are not seen.

This is because each of the colour filters overlaying each photosite of a mosaic sensor passes only one of the primary colours, absorbing the other two. The absorption of these colours reduces the total amount of light gathered by the sensor and destroys much of the information about the colour of the light impinging on each sensor element. Although the Foveon X3 has a greater light-gathering ability, the individual layers do not respond as sharply to the respective colours. Thus colour-indicating information in the sensor's raw data requires \"aggressive\" matrix (essentially, removal of common-mode signals) to produce colour data in a standard [[color space|colour space]], which can increase colour noise in low-light situations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auspiciousdragon.net/photowords/?p=880|title=Know raw?

This amounts to approximately 3.4 million three-colour pixels. However, it has been advertised as a 10.2 MP camera by taking account of the fact that each photosite contains stacked red, green, and blue colour sensing photodiodes, or [[active pixel sensor|pixel sensors]] (2268 \u00d7 1512 \u00d7 3). By comparison, the dimensions of the photosite array in the 10.2 MP Bayer sensor in the Nikon D200 camera are 3872 \u00d7 2592, but there is only one photodiode, or one-pixel sensor, at each site. The cameras have equal numbers of photodiodes and produce similar RAW data file sizes, but the [[Bayer filter]] camera produces a larger native file size via [[demosaicing]].\n\nHowever, the actual resolution produced by the Bayer sensor is more complicated than the count of its photosites, or its native file size might suggest. The reason has to do with both the demosaicing and the separate anti-aliasing filter commonly used to reduce the occurrence or severity of colour [[moir\u00e9 pattern]]s that the mosaic characteristic of the Bayer sensor produces. The effect of this filter is to blur the image output of the sensor, thus producing a lower resolution than the photosite count would seem to imply. This filter is largely unnecessary with the Foveon X3 sensor and is not used. The earliest camera with a Foveon X3 sensor, the [[Sigma SD9]], showed visible luminance moir\u00e9 patterns, but not colour moir\u00e9.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/SigmaSD9/page23.asp|title=Sigma SD9 Review|work=DPReview|author=Phil Askey|date=November 2002}}\n</ref>\n\nSubsequent X3-equipped cameras have less aliasing because they include micro-lenses, which provide an effective{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Anti-aliasing filter#Optical anti-aliasing filter|anti-aliasing filter]] by averaging the optical signal over an area commensurate with the sample density, which is not possible in any colour channel of a Bayer-type sensor.

In the Bayer sensor, each photosite in the array consists of a single light sensor (either CMOS or CCD) that, as a result of filtration, is exposed to only one of the three primary colors, red, green, or blue. Constructing a full-color image from a Bayer sensor requires [[demosaicing]], an [[Image scaling|interpolative process]] in which the output pixel associated with each photosite is assigned an [[RGB color model|RGB]] value based in part on the level of red, green, and blue reported by those photosites adjacent to it. The Foveon X3 sensor creates its RGB color output for each photosite by combining the outputs of each of the stacked photodiodes at each of its photosites. This operational difference results in several significant consequences.\n\n===Color artifacts===\nBecause demosaicing is not required for the Foveon X3 sensor to produce a full-color image, the color artifacts (\"colored [[jaggies]]\") associated with that process are not seen. The separate anti-aliasing filter<ref>See, ''Optical anti-aliasing filter'' section of [[anti-aliasing filter]]</ref> commonly used<ref group=\"n\">Though its use is almost universal with Bayer sensors in digital cameras, it is not absolutely necessary.

The earliest camera with a Foveon X3 sensor, the [[Sigma SD9]], showed visible luminance moir\u00e9 patterns, but not color moir\u00e9.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/SigmaSD9/page23.asp|title=Sigma SD9 Review|work=DPReview|author=Phil Askey|date=November 2002}}\n</ref>\n\nSubsequent X3-equipped cameras have less aliasing because they include micro-lenses, which provide an effective{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Anti-aliasing filter#Optical anti-aliasing filter|anti-aliasing filter]] by averaging the optical signal over an area commensurate with the sample density, which is not possible in any color channel of a Bayer-type sensor.

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak. Although much more powerful than Firestreak, both missiles remained in service until 1988 when the last of the [[English Electric Lightning]]s retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance.

It was decided to proceed with the development of the Lightning largely because it was already close to being complete. Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to arm this aircraft. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became Red Top.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to Blue Vesta, Red Top was a simpler design, more of a rationalised, upgraded version of the earlier Firestreak. Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be replaced, and these were enlarged to provide more maneuvering power. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer true all-aspect capability, but it offset this loss to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. The new \"Green Garland\" IR [[proximity fuse]] required only one row of \"windows\", further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nThese changes allowed the warhead to be moved to the forward fuselage from its former rear-mounted location. This allowed it to be enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb) and added an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267/> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles. Although not offering the true all-aspect capability planned for Blue Vesta, Violet Banner did allow head-on attacks against supersonic aircraft.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Into production===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been developed for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming it to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Into service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Jay Mk. II program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service in [[1964 in aviation|1964]], arming the [[English Electric Lightning]] and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It remained in limited service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in limited service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox weapon\n|is_missile=yes\n| image= Red Top missile.png\n| image_size = 250\n|caption= Red Top missile\n|name=Red Top\n|type=[[Air-to-air missile]]\n|origin=United Kingdom\n|era=Cold War\n|platform=aircraft\n|target=aircraft\n|manufacturer=Hawker Siddeley Dynamics\n|design_date=\n|production_date=\n|service=1964 - 1988\n|used_by= United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait\n|wars=\n|spec_type= homing missile\n|diameter= 0.23 m\n|wingspan=0.91 m\n|length=3.32 m\n|weight= 154 kg\n|speed=Mach 3.2\n|vehicle_range=7.5 miles (12 km)\n|ceiling=\n|filling=31 kg (68.3 lb) [[annular blast fragmentation]]\n|engine=''Linnet'' solid fuel motor\n|steering=control surfaces\n|guidance=[[infrared homing]], limited [[all-aspect]]\n|variants=?\n|number=\n|detonation=''Green Garland'' infrared proximity; secondary contact [[fuze]]\n}}\n\nThe '''[[Hawker Siddeley]]''' (later [[British Aerospace]]) '''Red Top''' was the third indigenous British [[air-to-air missile]] to enter service, following the [[de Havilland Firestreak]] and limited-service [[Fireflash]].

This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer true all-aspect capability, but it offset this loss to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. The new \"Green Garland\" IR [[proximity fuse]] required only one row of \"windows\", further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nThese changes allowed the warhead to be moved to the forward fuselage from its former rear-mounted location. This allowed it to be enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb) and added an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267/> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles. Although not offering the true all-aspect capability planned for Blue Vesta, Violet Banner did allow head-on attacks against supersonic aircraft.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Into production===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been developed for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming it to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Into service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Jay Mk. II program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service in [[1964 in aviation|1964]], arming the [[English Electric Lightning]] and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It remained in limited service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in limited service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-automatic radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Maury Markowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFurther upgrades", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Top_(missile)"}

Several technical approaches have been proposed, but there has been no legal framework to date that has required satellite operators to clean up the [[negative externality]] of their derelict satellites. New approaches offer the technical prospect of markedly reducing the cost of object capture and deorbit with the implementation of a one-up/one-down [[launch license]] regime to Earth orbits that would require satellite operators to remove one spacecraft for each one deployed.<ref name=aiaa20100902_p13 >{{cite web |last=Zegler |first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Exploration/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=2014-06-14 |author2=Bernard Kutter |date=2010-09-02 |pages=13\u201314 |quote=''for disposing of these obsolete or derelict spacecraft all [approaches] involve the expenditure of substantially more delta-V than what has been traditional.
