There are currently 69 circuits in the state, divided into 10 judicial administrative districts. Circuit court judges hear and decide both civil and criminal cases. Each of the 249 circuit court judges are elected and serve six-year terms.<ref name=\"bb2019\">{{cite report| url= https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lrb/blue_book/2019_2020 |title= Wisconsin Blue Book 2019-2020 |year= 2019|publisher= State of Wisconsin |location= [[Madison, Wisconsin]] |chapter= The Judiciary |pages= 268-271 |accessdate= January 1, 2020}}</ref>  \n\nOn March 6, 2020, Governor [[Tony Evers]] signed bipartisan legislation to create 12 new circuit court branches to be elected in spring 2021 and take office in fall 2021.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/tony-evers-signs-bill-adding-circuit-court-branches/article_f8fcfe31-c419-5ef3-8da2-29a1c7f84750.html|title= Tony Evers signs bill adding 12 circuit court branches  |newspaper= [[Wisconsin State Journal]] |first= Riley |last= Vetterkind |date= March 6, 2020 |accessdate= March 6, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Structure of the circuit courts==\nThe circuit court system is composed of 69 circuits, with 66 circuits serving a single county, and three circuits serving two counties each.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://wicourts.gov/courts/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit courts|website=wicourts.gov}}</ref> [[Buffalo County, Wisconsin|Buffalo]] and [[Pepin County, Wisconsin|Pepin]]<nowiki/> counties share a circuit, as do [[Florence County, Wisconsin|Florence]] and [[Forest County, Wisconsin|Forest]] counties, and [[Shawano County, Wisconsin|Shawano]] and [[Menominee County, Wisconsin|Menominee]] counties.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> 26 circuit courts are served by a single judge.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> For those circuits with more than one judge, each is elected to a particular seat, or \"branch\" within the court. The [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] Circuit Court has the greatest number of branches with 47.\n\nThe circuit courts are organized into 10 geographical administrative districts. Within each district the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] will appoint a chief judge, a deputy chief judge, and a professional district court administrator.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> With the exception of Milwaukee County, chief judges and their deputies continue to hear cases while serving. Chief judges assign judges to hear only a specific type of case (e.g. civil, criminal, juvenile), equalize the flow of cases, establish court policies and rules, and supervise the finances of the courts they administer. They also work closely with county boards on security, facility, and staffing issues. The chief judges and district court administration meet regularly with the director of state courts to discuss current issues and to advise the Supreme court and the director on matters of statewide concern.\n\nIn 2017, Wisconsin's Supreme Court created a new [[Business courts|Business Court]], the Commercial Docket Pilot Project,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/services/attorney/comcourtpilot.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Commercial Docket Pilot Project|website=www.wicourts.gov|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> located in the Waukesha County Circuit Court and the Eighth Judicial Administrative District.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=91&Issue=1&ArticleID=26094|title=Solutions The Need for Speed: Commercial Court Open for Business|website=WisBar|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> On April 1, 2019, the Supreme Court expanded the Commercial Docket's geographic jurisdiction to encompass the entire state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesscourtsblog.com/wisconsin-expands-the-commercial-docket-pilot-project-to-all-wisconsin-counties/|title=Wisconsin Expands the Commercial Docket Pilot Project to All Wisconsin Counties \u2013 Business Courts Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe Wisconsin circuit courts have original jurisdiction to hear all civil and criminal matters within the state. The court's jurisdiction is conferred by Article VII, Section 8 of the [[Wisconsin Constitution]] and is quite broad. Since the court's subject matter jurisdiction is constitutional rather than statutory, the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] cannot limit it by statute. By comparison, the [[United States Congress]] is empowered to limit the subject matter jurisdiction of federal [[United States district court|District Courts]] if it so chooses.\n\nThe geographic limitations of the circuit court's authority are referred to as \"[[personal jurisdiction]].\" In a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] case, the requirements for personal jurisdiction are governed by chapter 801.05 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Generally speaking, a defendant must either be present in the state, or have sufficient contacts with the state, and the pleadings must have been properly served on the defendant. Personal jurisdiction requirements in a civil case are driven by policy considerations, such as fairness to the defendant, [[comity]], and principals of [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]].\n\nThe circuit court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a criminal case if the defendant violates a Wisconsin law while physically present in Wisconsin. Wisconsin courts also have personal jurisdiction over a defendant who commits an act while out of state that contributes to a crime, the consequences of which occur in Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/forms1/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit court forms|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Limits on exercise of power to decide cases==\nThere are, however, limits on what cases the circuit courts will hear.  They will not hear a case if the parties lack standing, or if the case is moot or is not ripe. Additionally, the circuit court will not hear a case in which it lacks competency. State law distinguishes between the court's jurisdiction (power to hear a case) and its competency (ability to arrive at a valid judgment in a case). A court lacks competency if certain statutory requirements are not satisfied, for example, time limits for filing suit, or requirements as to which circuit should decide a case.\n\nIn addition, the courts are constrained from taking action that will encroach on the powers of the legislative or executive branches. Under the separation of powers doctrine, no branch of government may exercise a power of government assigned exclusively to another branch. The purpose of separating powers among the branches of government is to avoid concentration of governmental power in the hands of a new and to give the various branches the ability to check actions by the other branches.\n\nIn reviewing the validity of state laws, the courts are limited to determining whether the law violates any provision of the constitution. The courts may invalidate a law that violates individual rights, such as the right to equal protection or due process, or a law that is not enacted according to the process established in the constitution, for example, a bill that was not passed by a majority of the members of each house of the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]]. However, a court may not invalidate a law because the court finds that the legislature's method for addressing a problem was not the most efficient. Nor may the court substitute its determination of what is in the public interest for the determination of the legislature.\n\nWhile the separation of powers doctrine limits the ability of the courts to act, it also protects the courts from encroachment by the legislature of governor. The Wisconsin Supreme Court established its judicial power in the three-branch system soon after Wisconsin became a state by deciding Bashford v. Barstow (1856), an election case that resulted in the ouster of an incumbent governor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/|title=Wisconsin Court System -|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Commencing a civil case==\nCivil cases start the same way regardless of the issues or parties involved and regardless of whether the case ultimately goes to trial. A case begins with pleadings, in which the parties state basic claims and responses. The parties then have an opportunity to investigate the claims and gather evidence through a process called discovery. The court generally has little direct involvement in a case until shortly before trial, though the court is available to resolve preliminary matters and disputes.\n\n===Pleadings===\nThe [[plaintiff]] starts a civil case by filing a summons, and generally a complaint, with the clerk of circuit court and paying a filing fee. A summons provides the defendant notice that a suit has been filed against him or her and notifies the defendant that he or she must answer the complaint. The complaint sets forth the plaintiff's allegations against the defendant. It must contain a short and plain statement of the plaintiff's claim, identify the events out of which the claim arises, and demand relief to satisfy the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff must serve an authenticated copy of the summons and complaint on the defendant. The favored method for serving the defendant is to personally hand a copy of the summons to him or her. Alternatively, the server may hand the summons to another responsible adult at the defendant's residence or, in some cases, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to publish the summons in a newspaper and send it to the defendant's address. Any adult who is not a party to the lawsuit may serve the summons. The person who serves the summons must sign the summons at the time of service and note the date, time, place, and manner of service and upon whom the summons is served. The plaintiff then files proof of service with the court.\n\nA plaintiff must commence a suit by serving the defendant with a summons within a certain time period established by a statute of limitation, or lose the right to sue. Statutes of limitation differ according to the type of suit. For example, a suit for breach of a sales contract must be commenced within six years; a suit for medical malpractice must be commenced within three years of the injury or within one year of discovery of the injury; and a suit to collect child support must be commenced within 20 years after the youngest child for whom support is due turns 18.\n\nThe defendant responds to the plaintiff's allegations in a document called an answer, in which the defendant must admit or deny an allegation or state that he or she does not know if the allegation is true, in which case the allegation is taken as denied. The defendant may also raise affirmative defenses (defenses that defeat the plaintiff's claims even if the plaintiff's allegations are true), for example, that the time period for filing the suit has expired, that the service of the summons and complaint was invalid, or that the complaint has already been settled in previous litigation. The defendant may also file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a fellow defendant.\n\nThe complaint and the answer together constitute the \"pleadings\" in a case. The purpose of the pleadings is to provide notice of the claims and defenses. The issues of the case generally are not narrowed until later in the proceedings.\n\n===Discovery===\nAfter an action is commenced, the parties begin discovery, which is intended to provide the parties mutual knowledge of facts relevant to a case before trial so that the trial is limited to resolving disputed facts and issues. Discovery also allows the parties to formulate and narrow the issues for trial and obtain and preserve evidence. A recipient of a discovery request generally must provide the information or material requested unless it is readily available from another source or is privileged. The scope of permitted discovery in a civil case is quite broad. A party may use discovery to obtain material that will be inadmissible as evidence at trial as long as the material is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Methods of discovery include depositions (recorded interviews with witnesses under oath), interrogatories (written questions), requests for production of documents or things, medical examinations, and requests for admissions.\n\nIdeally and usually, discovery takes place without direct involvement by the court. Except for medical examinations and inspection of medical records, discovery requests need not be authorized by the court. The recipient of a discovery request may seek a protective order denying certain discovery or limiting its scope if the discovery requested will cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or will inquire into privileged or irrelevant matters, and the party requesting discovery may request that the court intervene and order compliance.\n\n===Pretrial activities in court===\nAfter the pleadings are filed, the court may hold a scheduling conference with the parties and issue a scheduling order to manage the progress of the case. The scheduling order generally assigns dates for filing motions, amending pleadings, completing discovery, pretrial conferences between the judge and parties, and for trial. Some judges also use the scheduling conference to advise the parties to attempt to settle the case without going to trial.\n\nIn civil cases, parties often file a variety of pretrial motions with the court seeking court orders affecting the trial. For example, a defendant may seek dismissal of a whole case or certain issues in the case because the plaintiff has not stated a valid claim. Or, a party may seek an order compelling the opposing party to comply with a discovery request or a ruling on admissibility of certain pieces of evidence at trial. If the court requires additional information before ruling on a motion, the court may hold a hearing and may direct the parties to submit briefs, written materials that state the facts and present each side's position.\n\nThe courts resolve motions by order, often directing the prevailing party to prepare the order and submit it to the judge for his or her signature. The resolution of pretrial motions often dictates the future of a case. If a party wins a pretrial motion for summary judgment, the case is dismissed. Sometimes a party who loses important pretrial motions is more likely to agree to a settlement. A settlement must be accepted by a judge. Judges usually accept settlement agreements in civil cases with minimal review, although they look more closely at settlement agreements in divorce cases. If the parties do not settle, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Commencing a criminal case==\nOnly the state may bring a criminal case. Generally a prosecutor starts a criminal case by filing a complaint. The court is directly involved in a criminal case from the beginning to protect the rights of the defendant. Parties have a right to discovery in a criminal case, but discovery is not as extensive in a criminal case as in a civil case because the state must have completed most of its investigation before bringing criminal charges.\n\n===The criminal complaint===\nMost criminal cases are started when a prosecutor, either a [[district attorney]] (who represents a [[County (United States)|county]]) or the [[attorney general]] (who represents the state), files a complaint with the court. The complaint states the crime charged, names the defendant, and gives the date, approximate time, and location of the crime. In a complaint, the district attorney also presents sufficient facts to show why the defendant is being charged, identifies the source of the information contained in the complaint, and provides reasons why the source should be believed.\n\nProsecution of most crimes must be commenced within a certain time period that is established by a statute of limitation. The state generally has six years to commence prosecution of a felony (a crime for which a person may be sentenced to one year or more in prison) and three years for a misdemeanor (a crime for which the maximum penalty is a year in jail). However, there is no time limit for the prosecution of homicide. The main purpose of time limits is to ensure that criminal cases are tried while the evidence is still available and witnesses' memories are fresh. A case is commenced when a warrant, summons, or indictment is issued or an information is filed.\n\n===Pretrial court appearances===\nThe defendant's first court date is called the initial appearance. The court informs the defendant of the charges filed against him or her and gives the defendant a copy of the complaint. The court also informs the defendant of his or her right to have an attorney and that if the defendant is indigent and requests counsel, the court will appoint an attorney. If the defendant is in custody, the court determines whether to release the defendant on [[bail]], and if the defendant is released, imposes conditions for bail. In a misdemeanor case, the court may set the trial date at the initial appearance. The next court action in a misdemeanor case is the arraignment. Further steps are required in a felony case. At the initial appearance, the court informs a felony defendant that he or she is entitled to a preliminary examination before the criminal case may go forward.\n\nThe purpose of a preliminary examination is to determine in a felony case whether the district attorney can show probable cause to believe that the defendant committed a felony. If not, the court must dismiss the felony complaint. At the preliminary examination the district attorney and defendant may call witnesses and present evidence. If the court determines that the district attorney has shown probable cause or if the defendant waives his or her right to a preliminary examination, the case goes forward. The prosecutor files a pleading called an \"information,\" which informs the court of the crime with which the defendant is charged and states the date and place of the crime.\n\nAn arraignment is held in both misdemeanor and felony cases. At the arraignment, the complaint or information is read out loud unless the defendant waives reading, and in a felony case the district attorney gives the defendant a copy of the information. The court then asks the defendant to submit a plea. The defendant may plead \"guilty\", \"no contest\", \"not guilty\", or \"not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect\". A plea of no contest has the same effect in a criminal case as a guilty plea, except it cannot be used as an admission of criminal action in a civil case. The defendant may not enter a plea of no contest without approval from the court. If the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, the court sentences the defendant or places the defendant on probation. If the defendant pleads not guilty or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Grand jury and John Doe proceedings==\nAlthough the vast majority of criminal cases in Wisconsin are begun by a district attorney filing a criminal complaint, some cases are commenced as the result of a [[grand jury]] or [[John Doe]] investigation. Grand jury and John Doe investigations are secret proceedings for which witnesses may be subpoenaed. Grand jury and John Doe proceedings are generally used when investigators need to take testimony under oath or compel a witness to testify in order to gather sufficient evidence to issue a criminal complaint.\n\nA judge, usually upon the request of a district attorney, may assemble a grand jury to investigate suspected criminal activity. A grand jury consists of 17 people selected for jury service. The grand jury may request that the prosecutor [[subpoena]] and examine witnesses. Upon completing an investigation, a grand jury may by the vote of at least 14 members return an indictment, which is a written accusation that a person committed a crime. If the grand jury returns an indictment, the court issues a summons or warrant for the defendant.\n\nA judge initiates a John Doe proceeding upon receiving a complaint about criminal activity from any person, including the district attorney. The judge must question the person who makes the complaint under oath and may subpoena and examine other witnesses (usually with the assistance of the district attorney). If the judge finds probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime, a written complaint is filed and the judge issues a warrant for the arrest of the defendant named in the complaint.\n\n===Discovery===\nDiscovery in a criminal case is generally less extensive than in a civil case. Discovery allows the parties to obtain certain information known by the opposing party. Upon request, the prosecution and defense must provide a list of witnesses it intends to call at trial, as well as statements of the witnesses, reports of expert witnesses, and any known criminal record of a witness. The parties must also disclose any physical evidence they intend to introduce at trial. A party may obtain a court order allowing scientific testing of evidence held by the opposing party. The prosecution must disclose statements made by the defendant that pertain to the crime or that the prosecution intends to introduce at trial. The prosecution is obligated to disclose exculpatory evidence (evidence that might weigh in the defendant's favor) to the defendant even if the defendant does not specifically request the information or material.\n\n===Pretrial motions and plea bargains===\nParties in a criminal case often file [[pretrial motion]]s. Common motions include motions to exclude physical evidence, a defendant's confession, or an [[eyewitness identification]] of the defendant. The court may require the attorneys to submit briefs on the motions, but briefing is less common on pretrial motions in criminal cases than civil cases.\n\nMost criminal cases do not go to trial. Instead the prosecution and defense negotiate a settlement. The parties may agree upon the crimes to which a defendant will plead guilty and a sentence recommendation, or may only agree on the plea. The judge must review the agreement on the plea before accepting it to ensure that there is sufficient reason to believe that the defendant is guilty of the crime. If the parties agree on a sentence recommendation, the judge must review it to determine if it is appropriate. The judge is not bound by the sentence agreement.\n\n==Trial of a civil or criminal case==\nThe proceedings in a trial of a civil or criminal case are similar. Both may be to a jury or judge. Both start with opening statements, proceed to presentation of evidence followed by closing statements, and culminate with a decision. Depending on the result of the trial, a civil case may end with the awarding of damages and a criminal trial may end with sentencing.

There are currently 69 circuits in the state, divided into 10 judicial administrative districts. Circuit court judges hear and decide both civil and criminal cases. Each of the 249 circuit court judges are elected and serve six-year terms.<ref name=\"bb2019\">{{cite report| url= https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lrb/blue_book/2019_2020 |title= Wisconsin Blue Book 2019-2020 |year= 2019|publisher= State of Wisconsin |location= [[Madison, Wisconsin]] |chapter= The Judiciary |pages= 268-271 |accessdate= January 1, 2020}}</ref>  \n\nOn March 6, 2020, Governor [[Tony Evers]] signed bipartisan legislation to create 12 new circuit court branches to be elected in spring 2021 and take office in fall 2021.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/tony-evers-signs-bill-adding-circuit-court-branches/article_f8fcfe31-c419-5ef3-8da2-29a1c7f84750.html|title= Tony Evers signs bill adding 12 circuit court branches  |newspaper= [[Wisconsin State Journal]] |first= Riley |last= Vetterkind |date= March 6, 2020 |accessdate= March 6, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Structure of the circuit courts==\nThe circuit court system is composed of 69 circuits, with 66 circuits serving a single county, and three circuits serving two counties each.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://wicourts.gov/courts/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit courts|website=wicourts.gov}}</ref> [[Buffalo County, Wisconsin|Buffalo]] and [[Pepin County, Wisconsin|Pepin]]<nowiki/> counties share a circuit, as do [[Florence County, Wisconsin|Florence]] and [[Forest County, Wisconsin|Forest]] counties, and [[Shawano County, Wisconsin|Shawano]] and [[Menominee County, Wisconsin|Menominee]] counties.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> 26 circuit courts are served by a single judge.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> For those circuits with more than one judge, each is elected to a particular seat, or \"branch\" within the court. The [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] Circuit Court has the greatest number of branches with 47.\n\nThe circuit courts are organized into 10 geographical administrative districts. Within each district the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] will appoint a chief judge, a deputy chief judge, and a professional district court administrator.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> With the exception of Milwaukee County, chief judges and their deputies continue to hear cases while serving. Chief judges assign judges to hear only a specific type of case (e.g. civil, criminal, juvenile), equalize the flow of cases, establish court policies and rules, and supervise the finances of the courts they administer. They also work closely with county boards on security, facility, and staffing issues. The chief judges and district court administration meet regularly with the director of state courts to discuss current issues and to advise the Supreme court and the director on matters of statewide concern.\n\nIn 2017, Wisconsin's Supreme Court created a new [[Business courts|Business Court]], the Commercial Docket Pilot Project,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/services/attorney/comcourtpilot.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Commercial Docket Pilot Project|website=www.wicourts.gov|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> located in the Waukesha County Circuit Court and the Eighth Judicial Administrative District.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=91&Issue=1&ArticleID=26094|title=Solutions The Need for Speed: Commercial Court Open for Business|website=WisBar|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> On April 1, 2019, the Supreme Court expanded the Commercial Docket's geographic jurisdiction to encompass the entire state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesscourtsblog.com/wisconsin-expands-the-commercial-docket-pilot-project-to-all-wisconsin-counties/|title=Wisconsin Expands the Commercial Docket Pilot Project to All Wisconsin Counties \u2013 Business Courts Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe Wisconsin circuit courts have original jurisdiction to hear all civil and criminal matters within the state. The court's jurisdiction is conferred by Article VII, Section 8 of the [[Wisconsin Constitution]] and is quite broad. Since the court's subject matter jurisdiction is constitutional rather than statutory, the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] cannot limit it by statute. By comparison, the [[United States Congress]] is empowered to limit the subject matter jurisdiction of federal [[United States district court|District Courts]] if it so chooses.\n\nThe geographic limitations of the circuit court's authority are referred to as \"[[personal jurisdiction]].\" In a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] case, the requirements for personal jurisdiction are governed by chapter 801.05 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Generally speaking, a defendant must either be present in the state, or have sufficient contacts with the state, and the pleadings must have been properly served on the defendant. Personal jurisdiction requirements in a civil case are driven by policy considerations, such as fairness to the defendant, [[comity]], and principals of [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]].\n\nThe circuit court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a criminal case if the defendant violates a Wisconsin law while physically present in Wisconsin. Wisconsin courts also have personal jurisdiction over a defendant who commits an act while out of state that contributes to a crime, the consequences of which occur in Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/forms1/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit court forms|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Limits on exercise of power to decide cases==\nThere are, however, limits on what cases the circuit courts will hear.  They will not hear a case if the parties lack standing, or if the case is moot or is not ripe. Additionally, the circuit court will not hear a case in which it lacks competency. State law distinguishes between the court's jurisdiction (power to hear a case) and its competency (ability to arrive at a valid judgment in a case). A court lacks competency if certain statutory requirements are not satisfied, for example, time limits for filing suit, or requirements as to which circuit should decide a case.\n\nIn addition, the courts are constrained from taking action that will encroach on the powers of the legislative or executive branches. Under the separation of powers doctrine, no branch of government may exercise a power of government assigned exclusively to another branch. The purpose of separating powers among the branches of government is to avoid concentration of governmental power in the hands of a new and to give the various branches the ability to check actions by the other branches.\n\nIn reviewing the validity of state laws, the courts are limited to determining whether the law violates any provision of the constitution. The courts may invalidate a law that violates individual rights, such as the right to equal protection or due process, or a law that is not enacted according to the process established in the constitution, for example, a bill that was not passed by a majority of the members of each house of the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]]. However, a court may not invalidate a law because the court finds that the legislature's method for addressing a problem was not the most efficient. Nor may the court substitute its determination of what is in the public interest for the determination of the legislature.\n\nWhile the separation of powers doctrine limits the ability of the courts to act, it also protects the courts from encroachment by the legislature of governor. The Wisconsin Supreme Court established its judicial power in the three-branch system soon after Wisconsin became a state by deciding Bashford v. Barstow (1856), an election case that resulted in the ouster of an incumbent governor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/|title=Wisconsin Court System -|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Commencing a civil case==\nCivil cases start the same way regardless of the issues or parties involved and regardless of whether the case ultimately goes to trial. A case begins with pleadings, in which the parties state basic claims and responses. The parties then have an opportunity to investigate the claims and gather evidence through a process called discovery. The court generally has little direct involvement in a case until shortly before trial, though the court is available to resolve preliminary matters and disputes.\n\n===Pleadings===\nThe [[plaintiff]] starts a civil case by filing a summons, and generally a complaint, with the clerk of circuit court and paying a filing fee. A summons provides the defendant notice that a suit has been filed against him or her and notifies the defendant that he or she must answer the complaint. The complaint sets forth the plaintiff's allegations against the defendant. It must contain a short and plain statement of the plaintiff's claim, identify the events out of which the claim arises, and demand relief to satisfy the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff must serve an authenticated copy of the summons and complaint on the defendant. The favored method for serving the defendant is to personally hand a copy of the summons to him or her. Alternatively, the server may hand the summons to another responsible adult at the defendant's residence or, in some cases, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to publish the summons in a newspaper and send it to the defendant's address. Any adult who is not a party to the lawsuit may serve the summons. The person who serves the summons must sign the summons at the time of service and note the date, time, place, and manner of service and upon whom the summons is served. The plaintiff then files proof of service with the court.\n\nA plaintiff must commence a suit by serving the defendant with a summons within a certain time period established by a statute of limitation, or lose the right to sue. Statutes of limitation differ according to the type of suit. For example, a suit for breach of a sales contract must be commenced within six years; a suit for medical malpractice must be commenced within three years of the injury or within one year of discovery of the injury; and a suit to collect child support must be commenced within 20 years after the youngest child for whom support is due turns 18.\n\nThe defendant responds to the plaintiff's allegations in a document called an answer, in which the defendant must admit or deny an allegation or state that he or she does not know if the allegation is true, in which case the allegation is taken as denied. The defendant may also raise affirmative defenses (defenses that defeat the plaintiff's claims even if the plaintiff's allegations are true), for example, that the time period for filing the suit has expired, that the service of the summons and complaint was invalid, or that the complaint has already been settled in previous litigation. The defendant may also file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a fellow defendant.\n\nThe complaint and the answer together constitute the \"pleadings\" in a case. The purpose of the pleadings is to provide notice of the claims and defenses. The issues of the case generally are not narrowed until later in the proceedings.\n\n===Discovery===\nAfter an action is commenced, the parties begin discovery, which is intended to provide the parties mutual knowledge of facts relevant to a case before trial so that the trial is limited to resolving disputed facts and issues. Discovery also allows the parties to formulate and narrow the issues for trial and obtain and preserve evidence. A recipient of a discovery request generally must provide the information or material requested unless it is readily available from another source or is privileged. The scope of permitted discovery in a civil case is quite broad. A party may use discovery to obtain material that will be inadmissible as evidence at trial as long as the material is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Methods of discovery include depositions (recorded interviews with witnesses under oath), interrogatories (written questions), requests for production of documents or things, medical examinations, and requests for admissions.\n\nIdeally and usually, discovery takes place without direct involvement by the court. Except for medical examinations and inspection of medical records, discovery requests need not be authorized by the court. The recipient of a discovery request may seek a protective order denying certain discovery or limiting its scope if the discovery requested will cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or will inquire into privileged or irrelevant matters, and the party requesting discovery may request that the court intervene and order compliance.\n\n===Pretrial activities in court===\nAfter the pleadings are filed, the court may hold a scheduling conference with the parties and issue a scheduling order to manage the progress of the case. The scheduling order generally assigns dates for filing motions, amending pleadings, completing discovery, pretrial conferences between the judge and parties, and for trial. Some judges also use the scheduling conference to advise the parties to attempt to settle the case without going to trial.\n\nIn civil cases, parties often file a variety of pretrial motions with the court seeking court orders affecting the trial. For example, a defendant may seek dismissal of a whole case or certain issues in the case because the plaintiff has not stated a valid claim. Or, a party may seek an order compelling the opposing party to comply with a discovery request or a ruling on admissibility of certain pieces of evidence at trial. If the court requires additional information before ruling on a motion, the court may hold a hearing and may direct the parties to submit briefs, written materials that state the facts and present each side's position.\n\nThe courts resolve motions by order, often directing the prevailing party to prepare the order and submit it to the judge for his or her signature. The resolution of pretrial motions often dictates the future of a case. If a party wins a pretrial motion for summary judgment, the case is dismissed. Sometimes a party who loses important pretrial motions is more likely to agree to a settlement. A settlement must be accepted by a judge. Judges usually accept settlement agreements in civil cases with minimal review, although they look more closely at settlement agreements in divorce cases. If the parties do not settle, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Commencing a criminal case==\nOnly the state may bring a criminal case. Generally a prosecutor starts a criminal case by filing a complaint. The court is directly involved in a criminal case from the beginning to protect the rights of the defendant. Parties have a right to discovery in a criminal case, but discovery is not as extensive in a criminal case as in a civil case because the state must have completed most of its investigation before bringing criminal charges.\n\n===The criminal complaint===\nMost criminal cases are started when a prosecutor, either a [[district attorney]] (who represents a [[County (United States)|county]]) or the [[attorney general]] (who represents the state), files a complaint with the court. The complaint states the crime charged, names the defendant, and gives the date, approximate time, and location of the crime. In a complaint, the district attorney also presents sufficient facts to show why the defendant is being charged, identifies the source of the information contained in the complaint, and provides reasons why the source should be believed.\n\nProsecution of most crimes must be commenced within a certain time period that is established by a statute of limitation. The state generally has six years to commence prosecution of a felony (a crime for which a person may be sentenced to one year or more in prison) and three years for a misdemeanor (a crime for which the maximum penalty is a year in jail). However, there is no time limit for the prosecution of homicide. The main purpose of time limits is to ensure that criminal cases are tried while the evidence is still available and witnesses' memories are fresh. A case is commenced when a warrant, summons, or indictment is issued or an information is filed.\n\n===Pretrial court appearances===\nThe defendant's first court date is called the initial appearance. The court informs the defendant of the charges filed against him or her and gives the defendant a copy of the complaint. The court also informs the defendant of his or her right to have an attorney and that if the defendant is indigent and requests counsel, the court will appoint an attorney. If the defendant is in custody, the court determines whether to release the defendant on [[bail]], and if the defendant is released, imposes conditions for bail. In a misdemeanor case, the court may set the trial date at the initial appearance. The next court action in a misdemeanor case is the arraignment. Further steps are required in a felony case. At the initial appearance, the court informs a felony defendant that he or she is entitled to a preliminary examination before the criminal case may go forward.\n\nThe purpose of a preliminary examination is to determine in a felony case whether the district attorney can show probable cause to believe that the defendant committed a felony. If not, the court must dismiss the felony complaint. At the preliminary examination the district attorney and defendant may call witnesses and present evidence. If the court determines that the district attorney has shown probable cause or if the defendant waives his or her right to a preliminary examination, the case goes forward. The prosecutor files a pleading called an \"information,\" which informs the court of the crime with which the defendant is charged and states the date and place of the crime.\n\nAn arraignment is held in both misdemeanor and felony cases. At the arraignment, the complaint or information is read out loud unless the defendant waives reading, and in a felony case the district attorney gives the defendant a copy of the information. The court then asks the defendant to submit a plea. The defendant may plead \"guilty\", \"no contest\", \"not guilty\", or \"not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect\". A plea of no contest has the same effect in a criminal case as a guilty plea, except it cannot be used as an admission of criminal action in a civil case. The defendant may not enter a plea of no contest without approval from the court. If the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, the court sentences the defendant or places the defendant on probation. If the defendant pleads not guilty or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Grand jury and John Doe proceedings==\nAlthough the vast majority of criminal cases in Wisconsin are begun by a district attorney filing a criminal complaint, some cases are commenced as the result of a [[grand jury]] or [[John Doe]] investigation. Grand jury and John Doe investigations are secret proceedings for which witnesses may be subpoenaed. Grand jury and John Doe proceedings are generally used when investigators need to take testimony under oath or compel a witness to testify in order to gather sufficient evidence to issue a criminal complaint.\n\nA judge, usually upon the request of a district attorney, may assemble a grand jury to investigate suspected criminal activity. A grand jury consists of 17 people selected for jury service. The grand jury may request that the prosecutor [[subpoena]] and examine witnesses. Upon completing an investigation, a grand jury may by the vote of at least 14 members return an indictment, which is a written accusation that a person committed a crime. If the grand jury returns an indictment, the court issues a summons or warrant for the defendant.\n\nA judge initiates a John Doe proceeding upon receiving a complaint about criminal activity from any person, including the district attorney. The judge must question the person who makes the complaint under oath and may subpoena and examine other witnesses (usually with the assistance of the district attorney). If the judge finds probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime, a written complaint is filed and the judge issues a warrant for the arrest of the defendant named in the complaint.\n\n===Discovery===\nDiscovery in a criminal case is generally less extensive than in a civil case. Discovery allows the parties to obtain certain information known by the opposing party. Upon request, the prosecution and defense must provide a list of witnesses it intends to call at trial, as well as statements of the witnesses, reports of expert witnesses, and any known criminal record of a witness. The parties must also disclose any physical evidence they intend to introduce at trial. A party may obtain a court order allowing scientific testing of evidence held by the opposing party. The prosecution must disclose statements made by the defendant that pertain to the crime or that the prosecution intends to introduce at trial. The prosecution is obligated to disclose exculpatory evidence (evidence that might weigh in the defendant's favor) to the defendant even if the defendant does not specifically request the information or material.\n\n===Pretrial motions and plea bargains===\nParties in a criminal case often file [[pretrial motion]]s. Common motions include motions to exclude physical evidence, a defendant's confession, or an [[eyewitness identification]] of the defendant. The court may require the attorneys to submit briefs on the motions, but briefing is less common on pretrial motions in criminal cases than civil cases.\n\nMost criminal cases do not go to trial. Instead the prosecution and defense negotiate a settlement. The parties may agree upon the crimes to which a defendant will plead guilty and a sentence recommendation, or may only agree on the plea. The judge must review the agreement on the plea before accepting it to ensure that there is sufficient reason to believe that the defendant is guilty of the crime. If the parties agree on a sentence recommendation, the judge must review it to determine if it is appropriate. The judge is not bound by the sentence agreement.\n\n==Trial of a civil or criminal case==\nThe proceedings in a trial of a civil or criminal case are similar. Both may be to a jury or judge. Both start with opening statements, proceed to presentation of evidence followed by closing statements, and culminate with a decision. Depending on the result of the trial, a civil case may end with the awarding of damages and a criminal trial may end with sentencing. During the trial, the role of the judge is similar \u2013 determining the admissibility of evidence, guiding the jury, if there is one, and refereeing the actions of the attorneys.\n\n==Current Judges==\n\nCircuit judges are elected to a six year term in the spring non-partisan election, currently Wisconsin holds a non-partisan primary election in February and a general election in April.  New judicial terms start on the first day of August in the year of the election.\n\nIn the event of a vacancy, the Governor can appoint an interim judge to hold office until the next spring election.\n\n===District 1===\n\n*'''Counties:''' [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]\n*'''Court:''' [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]\n*'''Chief Judge:''' Mary Triggiano \n*'''Court Administrator:''' Holly Szablewski<ref name=\"bb2019\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Circuit\n!Branch\n!Judge\n!Entered office\n!Next election\n!Notes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"47\"| [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]\n| 1\n| Jack D\u00e1vila\n| align=\"center\" | 2020\n| align=\"center\" | 2021\n| ''Appointed by [[Tony Evers]]''<ref name=\"evers\">{{cite news| url= https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/09/jack-davila-named-circuit-judge-milwaukee-county/5126764002/ |title= Gov.

Moses explains that on the afternoon of August 4 he was at home: \"As the \u201cman of the house\u201d that day, I had promised to keep an eye out for any trouble, and I was doing just that. I remember where Woody sat in the TV room, and I can picture where Dylan and Satchel were. Not that everybody stayed glued to the same spot, but I deliberately made sure to note everyone's coming and going. I do remember that Woody would leave the room on occasion, but never with Dylan. He would wander into another room to make a phone call, read the paper, use the bathroom, or step outside to get some air and walk around the large pond on the property.\"<ref name=\"MosesFarrowMay2018\" /> Moses also indicates that the memory that his sister keeps from having suffered abuse while focusing her attention on an electric train set is not possible: \"It\u2019s a precise and compelling narrative, but there\u2019s a major problem: there ''was'' no electric train set in that attic. There was, in fact, no way for kids to play up there, even if we had wanted to. It was an unfinished crawl space, under a steeply-angled gabled roof, with exposed nails and floorboards, billows of fiberglass insulation, filled with mousetraps and droppings and stinking of mothballs, and crammed with trunks full of hand-me-down clothes and my mother\u2019s old wardrobes.

He explains that, unlike other cases of sexual abuse or harassment that could have been ignored without being taken seriously or adequately investigated, Mia Farrow's accusation against him was taken with the utmost seriousness and was immediately and thoroughly investigated by two groups of different experts.\n\nOn the one hand, the police and the prosecution hired the most prestigious experts in the country: the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, whom the police used to look into such matters and who concluded that the evidence conclusively proved that there was not sexual abuse, that Dylan\u00b4s statements had \"a rehearsed quality\" and were likely \"coached or influenced by her mother. \" Regarding the criticism against Yale New haven for having destroyed the original notes at the time of incorporating them into the report, Allen reveals that in the course of the trial it turned out that it was the usual procedure of both Yale New Haven and the FBI to preserve privacy\n\nOn the other hand, the New York State Child Welfare scrupulously investigated the case for 14 months and concluded that there was no credible evidence of abuse and that the allegation was unfounded.\n\nAllen recounts a session of the Yale-New Haven investigation during which Mia Farrow explained to experts how Dylan was so disturbed by the sexual abuse that she immediately rushed to her sister Lark's room for comfort. Farrow described how Dylan hugged Lark and how Lark comforted her. When Allen noted that Lark was in New York on the day the abuse was alleged to have happened and there was no way Dylan would have come to her, hugged her, and Lark comfort her, Mia Farrow changed her account and said that \"\" Lark was in New York at the time, but Dylan hugged her spiritually. \" Allen concluded that while Mia Farrow's story may have had some impact on the judges, it did not mislead investigators.\n\nRegarding the investigation conducted by Connecticut prosecutor Frank Maco, Allen indicates that from the moment the experts the prosecution had hired totally rejected the possibility of sexual abuse, the prosecution's investigation should have been closed. That it was kept open without any justification and that this fact was in favor of Farrow during the custody trial, that the statement at the prosecutor's press conference saying that there was probable cause was totally unfounded once the prosecution experts had already completely ruled out the possibility of sexual abuse. Allen points out that it is absurd to think that the prosecutor did not initiate prosecution becouse he did not want to hurt Dylanl when he had police question Dylan for months without caring at all about Dylan's well-being. Allen also indicates that a nanny and a housekeeper who worked at Mia Farrow's house stated that on multiple occasions the prosecutor \u00a0showed up by the house and he and Mia Farrow went out to luch. Allen \u00a0regrets that this does not seem the most appropriate way conducting an impartial investigation.\n\nAllan also says that in the custody trial, the Court Clerk drove Mia Farrow to her home from the courthose many nigths and thinks it was a \u00a0\u201cunfair conduit to the judge\u201d, recalls the testimony by Moses Farrow, who said he witnessed how Mia Farrow coached Dylan to say that she had been abused, collects the testimony of a babysitter to whom Dylan said \"Mummy want me to lie.\" Allen says that long before the allegation of abuse emerged Mia Farrow took Dylan to a child therapist because the girl had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. The girl who under normal conditions had trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy was at the exclusive care of her mother during a strong and confusing emotional crisis Farrow suggested the child that she had been abused, which ended up leading to Dylan sincerely believed it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allen, Woody.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1147948052|title=Apropos of Nothing|isbn=978-1-951627-34-8|oclc=1147948052}}</ref>\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|26em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite news|last1=Hoban|first1=Phoebe|title=Woody and Mia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=September 21, 1992|pages=32\u201342}}\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statements], The New York Times, May 4, 1993\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-02/news/mn-952_1_woody-allen Nanny Casts Doubt on Farrow Charges : Custody: She tells Allen's lawyers the actress pressured her to support molestation accusations against him.

He explains that, unlike other cases of sexual abuse or harassment that could have been ignored without being taken seriously or adequately investigated, Mia Farrow's accusation against him was taken with the utmost seriousness and was immediately and thoroughly investigated by two groups of different experts.\n\nOn the one hand, the police and the prosecution hired the most prestigious experts in the country: the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, whom the police used to look into such matters and who concluded that the evidence conclusively proved that there was not sexual abuse, that Dylan\u00b4s statements had \"a rehearsed quality\" and were likely \"coached or influenced by her mother. \" Regarding the criticism against Yale New haven for having destroyed the original notes at the time of incorporating them into the report, Allen reveals that in the course of the trial it turned out that it was the usual procedure of both Yale New Haven and the FBI to preserve privacy\n\nOn the other hand, the New York State Child Welfare scrupulously investigated the case for 14 months and concluded that there was no credible evidence of abuse and that the allegation was unfounded.\n\nAllen recounts a session of the Yale-New Haven investigation during which Mia Farrow explained to experts how Dylan was so disturbed by the sexual abuse that she immediately rushed to her sister Lark's room for comfort. Farrow described how Dylan hugged Lark and how Lark comforted her. When Allen noted that Lark was in New York on the day the abuse was alleged to have happened and there was no way Dylan would have come to her, hugged her, and Lark comfort her, Mia Farrow changed her account and said that \"\" Lark was in New York at the time, but Dylan hugged her spiritually. \" Allen concluded that while Mia Farrow's story may have had some impact on the judges, it did not mislead investigators.\n\nRegarding the investigation conducted by Connecticut prosecutor Frank Maco, Allen indicates that from the moment the experts the prosecution had hired totally rejected the possibility of sexual abuse, the prosecution's investigation should have been closed. That it was kept open without any justification and that this fact was in favor of Farrow during the custody trial, that the statement at the prosecutor's press conference saying that there was probable cause was totally unfounded once the prosecution experts had already completely ruled out the possibility of sexual abuse. Allen points out that it is absurd to think that the prosecutor did not initiate prosecution becouse he did not want to hurt Dylanl when he had police question Dylan for months without caring at all about Dylan's well-being. Allen also indicates that a nanny and a housekeeper who worked at Mia Farrow's house stated that on multiple occasions the prosecutor \u00a0showed up by the house and he and Mia Farrow went out to luch. Allen \u00a0regrets that this does not seem the most appropriate way conducting an impartial investigation.\n\nAllan also says that in the custody trial, the Court Clerk drove Mia Farrow to her home from the courthose many nigths and thinks it was a \u00a0\u201cunfair conduit to the judge\u201d, recalls the testimony by Moses Farrow, who said he witnessed how Mia Farrow coached Dylan to say that she had been abused, collects the testimony of a babysitter to whom Dylan said \"Mummy want me to lie.\" Allen says that long before the allegation of abuse emerged Mia Farrow took Dylan to a child therapist because the girl had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. The girl who under normal conditions had trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy was at the exclusive care of her mother during a strong and confusing emotional crisis Farrow suggested the child that she had been abused, which ended up leading to Dylan sincerely believed it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allen, Woody.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1147948052|title=Apropos of Nothing|isbn=978-1-951627-34-8|oclc=1147948052}}</ref>\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|26em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite news|last1=Hoban|first1=Phoebe|title=Woody and Mia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA40|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=September 21, 1992|pages=32\u201342}}\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html Doctor Cites Inconsistencies In Dylan Farrow's Statements], The New York Times, May 4, 1993\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-02/news/mn-952_1_woody-allen Nanny Casts Doubt on Farrow Charges : Custody: She tells Allen's lawyers the actress pressured her to support molestation accusations against him.

English folklore encompasses the traditional [[Robin Hood]] tales, the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]-inspired [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]], and the more contemporary [[urban legend]]s and monsters such as the [[Beast of Bodmin Moor]]. English folklore takes a heavy influence from [[Pagan]] tradition, with a number of figures, ledgends, and creatures being adapted from the pre-Christian traditions of the region. This Pagan influence means that English folklore generally differs between regions in the country, however some myths pervade most of the country.\n\n==Folklore found throughout much of England==\n* [[Black dog (ghost)|Black dog]] \u2013 Often said to be associated with the Devil, and its appearance was regarded as a portent of death. It is generally supposed to be larger than a normal dog, and often has large, glowing eyes. It is a common feature of British Isles and Northern European folklore.\n* [[Boggart]] \u2013 A boggart is, depending on local or regional tradition, either a household spirit or a malevolent ''[[genius loci]]'' inhabiting fields, marshes or other topographical features. The household boggart causes things to disappear, milk to sour, and dogs to go lame. Always malevolent, the boggart will follow its family wherever they flee. In Northern England, at least, there was the belief that the boggart should never be named, for when the boggart was given a name, it would not be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive.\n* [[Brownie (elf)|Brownie]] \u2013 In folklore, a brownie is a type of hob, similar to a hobgoblin. Brownies are said to inhabit houses and aid in tasks around the house. However, they do not like to be seen and will only work at night, traditionally in exchange for small gifts or food. Among food, they especially enjoy porridge and honey. They usually abandon the house if their gifts are called payments, or if the owners of the house misuse them. Brownies make their homes in an unused part of the house.\n* [[Chime hours]] \u2013 According to English folklore, those born at certain hours could see ghosts.\n* [[Countless stones]] \u2013 Associated with megalithic monuments\n* [[Corn dolly]] \u2013 Corn dollies are a form of straw work made as part of harvest customs of Europe before mechanization. Before Christianization, in traditional pagan European culture it was believed that the spirit of the corn lived amongst the crop, and that the harvest made it effectively homeless.\n* [[Crop circles]]\n* [[Cunning folk]] \u2013 The term \"cunning man\" or \"cunning woman\" was most widely used in southern England and the Midlands, as well as in Wales. Such people were also frequently known across England as \"wizards\", \"wise men\".\n* [[Dragons]]- Giant winged reptiles that breathe fire or poison. There are many dragon legends in England. Somerset and the North East being very rich.\n* [[Drake's Drum]] \u2013 Shortly before he died, Drake ordered the drum to be taken to Buckland Abbey, where it still is today, and vowed that if England was ever in danger someone was to beat the drum and he would return to defend the country. According to legend it can be heard to beat at times when England is at war or significant national events take place.\n* [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarfs]]- a dwarf is a human-shaped entity that dwells in mountains and in the earth, and is variously associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and crafting.\n* [[Elves]]\n* [[Bogle|Ettin]]\n* [[English Country Dance]] \u2013 English Country Dance is a form of folk dance.

English folklore encompasses the traditional [[Robin Hood]] tales, the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]-inspired [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]], and the more contemporary [[urban legend]]s and monsters such as the [[Beast of Bodmin Moor]]. English folklore takes a heavy influence from [[Pagan]] tradition, with a number of figures, ledgends, and creatures being adapted from the pre-Christian traditions of the region. This Pagan influence means that English folklore generally differs between regions in the country, however some myths pervade most of the country.\n\n==Folklore found throughout much of England==\n* [[Black dog (ghost)|Black dog]] \u2013 Often said to be associated with the Devil, and its appearance was regarded as a portent of death. It is generally supposed to be larger than a normal dog, and often has large, glowing eyes. It is a common feature of British Isles and Northern European folklore.\n* [[Boggart]] \u2013 A boggart is, depending on local or regional tradition, either a household spirit or a malevolent ''[[genius loci]]'' inhabiting fields, marshes or other topographical features. The household boggart causes things to disappear, milk to sour, and dogs to go lame. Always malevolent, the boggart will follow its family wherever they flee. In Northern England, at least, there was the belief that the boggart should never be named, for when the boggart was given a name, it would not be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive.\n* [[Brownie (elf)|Brownie]] \u2013 In folklore, a brownie is a type of hob, similar to a hobgoblin. Brownies are said to inhabit houses and aid in tasks around the house. However, they do not like to be seen and will only work at night, traditionally in exchange for small gifts or food. Among food, they especially enjoy porridge and honey. They usually abandon the house if their gifts are called payments, or if the owners of the house misuse them. Brownies make their homes in an unused part of the house.\n* [[Chime hours]] \u2013 According to English folklore, those born at certain hours could see ghosts.\n* [[Countless stones]] \u2013 Associated with megalithic monuments\n* [[Corn dolly]] \u2013 Corn dollies are a form of straw work made as part of harvest customs of Europe before mechanization. Before Christianization, in traditional pagan European culture it was believed that the spirit of the corn lived amongst the crop, and that the harvest made it effectively homeless.\n* [[Crop circles]]\n* [[Cunning folk]] \u2013 The term \"cunning man\" or \"cunning woman\" was most widely used in southern England and the Midlands, as well as in Wales. Such people were also frequently known across England as \"wizards\", \"wise men\".\n* [[Dragons]]- Giant winged reptiles that breathe fire or poison. There are many dragon legends in England. Somerset and the North East being very rich.\n* [[Drake's Drum]] \u2013 Shortly before he died, Drake ordered the drum to be taken to Buckland Abbey, where it still is today, and vowed that if England was ever in danger someone was to beat the drum and he would return to defend the country. According to legend it can be heard to beat at times when England is at war or significant national events take place.\n* [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarfs]]- a dwarf is a human-shaped entity that dwells in mountains and in the earth, and is variously associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and crafting.\n* [[Elves]]\n* [[Bogle|Ettin]]\n* [[English Country Dance]] \u2013 English Country Dance is a form of folk dance. It is a social dance form, which has earliest documented instances in the late 16th century.\n* [[Father Time]]\n* [[Flibbertigibbet]]\n* Four Winds \u2013 Shown on old maps they are usually shown as faces blowing out wind from their mouths.

Such stones have been discovered by archaeologists in both Britain and Egypt.\n* [[Havelok the Dane]]\n*[[King Arthur]] Legendary king of the Britons, the Once and Future King and True Born King of England.\n* [[Legend of the Mistletoe Bough]] \u2013 The Legend of the Mistletoe Bough is a ghost story which has been associated with many mansions and stately homes in England.\n\n:The tale tells how a new bride, playing a game of hide-and-seek during her wedding breakfast, hid in a chest in an attic and was unable to escape.

The location was previously known as \"Stonequarry\". The [[Duke of Wellington]] described Picton as a \"rough foul-mouthed devil as ever lived\" but very capable. He was \"respected for his courage and feared for his irrascible temperament\". He was chiefly remembered for his exploits under Wellington in the Iberinan Peninsular War displaying great barvery and persistence. He was killed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and was the most senior officer to die there. He was buried in the family vault at St. George's, [[Hanover Square, Westminster|Hanover Square]] in London. In 1859 Picton was re-interred in [[St. Paul's Cathedral, London]], lying close to the body of the Duke of Wellington.<ref name=nswshr-1484-1242>Wheeldon, 2015, 3.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n===Victoria Bridge===\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nTimber [[Truss bridge#Allan Truss|Allan trusses]] were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next thirty years.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nPercy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the NSW Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1484/> Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Victoria Bridge is an Allan-type timber truss road bridge. It has three timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|27.4|m|ft|0}}. There are no approach spans. The overall length of the bridge is {{convert|83.4|m|ft|0}}. The super structure is supported by timber trestles which carry a single-lane carriageway with a minimum width of {{convert|3.7|m}} and a footpath. A timber post and rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge and an Armco barrier protects pedestrians from vehicular traffic.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 15 June 2005, fair and intact.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 15 June 2005, completed in 1897, the Victoria bridge is an early example of an Allan type timber truss road bridge, and in 1998 was in fair condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were twenty per cent cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50 per cent more load, and were easier to maintain. Having the tallest timber trestle supporting piers of any timber truss bridge, the Victoria bridge has an imposing appearance, and is both technically and aesthetically significant as a result.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nIn 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nbridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nThe Victoria bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nVictoria Bridge over Stonequarry Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance. Having the tallest timber trestle supporting piers of any timber truss bridge, the Victoria bridge has an imposing appearance, and is both technically and aesthetically significant as a result.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW.

The location was previously known as \"Stonequarry\". The [[Duke of Wellington]] described Picton as a \"rough foul-mouthed devil as ever lived\" but very capable. He was \"respected for his courage and feared for his irrascible temperament\". He was chiefly remembered for his exploits under Wellington in the Iberinan Peninsular War displaying great barvery and persistence. He was killed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and was the most senior officer to die there. He was buried in the family vault at St. George's, [[Hanover Square, Westminster|Hanover Square]] in London. In 1859 Picton was re-interred in [[St. Paul's Cathedral, London]], lying close to the body of the Duke of Wellington.<ref name=nswshr-1484-1242>Wheeldon, 2015, 3.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n===Victoria Bridge===\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n[[Timber truss#Allan Truss|Allan trusses]] were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next thirty years.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nPercy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the NSW Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1484/> Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Victoria Bridge is an Allan-type timber truss road bridge. It has three timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|27.4|m|ft|0}}. There are no approach spans. The overall length of the bridge is {{convert|83.4|m|ft|0}}. The super structure is supported by timber trestles which carry a single-lane carriageway with a minimum width of {{convert|3.7|m}} and a footpath. A timber post and rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge and an Armco barrier protects pedestrians from vehicular traffic.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 15 June 2005, fair and intact.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 15 June 2005, completed in 1897, the Victoria bridge is an early example of an Allan type timber truss road bridge, and in 1998 was in fair condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were twenty per cent cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50 per cent more load, and were easier to maintain. Having the tallest timber trestle supporting piers of any timber truss bridge, the Victoria bridge has an imposing appearance, and is both technically and aesthetically significant as a result.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nIn 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nbridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nThe Victoria bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\nVictoria Bridge over Stonequarry Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1484/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance.

[[Coalescent theory]] describes a stochastic model of how the ancestry of such [[genetic marker]]s maps to the history of a population.\n\nUnlike organisms, a gene is passed down from a generation of organisms to the next generation either as perfect replicas of itself or as slightly mutated ''descendant genes''. While organisms have ancestry graphs and progeny graphs via [[sexual reproduction]], a gene has a single chain of ancestors and a tree of descendants. An organism produced by sexual cross-fertilization ([[allogamy]]) has at least two ancestors (its immediate parents), but a gene always has one ancestor per generation.\n\n==Patrilineal and matrilineal MRCA==\n{{Main|Mitochondrial Eve|Y-chromosomal Adam}}\n[[File:MtDNA-MRCA-generations-Evolution.svg|thumb|left|200px|Through [[Genetic drift|random drift]] or selection, lineage will trace back to a single person.

Although an autosomal chromosome contains genes that are passed down from parents to children via [[independent assortment]] from only one of the two parents, [[genetic recombination]] ([[chromosomal crossover]]) mixes genes from non-sister [[chromatids]] from both parents during [[meiosis]], thus changing the genetic composition of the chromosome.\n\n== Time to MRCA estimates ==\nDifferent types of MRCAs are estimated to have lived at different times in the past. These ''time to MRCA'' (''TMRCA'') estimates are also computed differently depending on the type of MRCA being considered. Patrilineal and matrilineal MRCAs (Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam) are traced by single gene markers, thus their TMRCA are computed based on DNA test results and established mutation rates as practiced in genetic genealogy. Time to genealogical MRCA of all living humans is computed based on non-genetic, mathematical models and computer simulations.\n\nSince Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam are traced by single genes via a single ancestral parent line, the time to these genetic MRCAs will necessarily be greater than that for the genealogical MRCA. This is because single genes will coalesce more slowly than tracing of conventional human genealogy via both parents. The latter considers only individual humans, without taking into account whether any gene from the computed MRCA actually survives in every single person in the current population.<ref name=chang_1999>{{cite journal |doi=10.1239/aap/1029955256 |last=Chang |first=Joseph T. |title=Recent common ancestors of all present-day individuals |journal=Advances in Applied Probability |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=1002\u201326, discussion and author's reply, 1027\u201338 |year=1999 |url= http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/papers/Ancestors.pdf |accessdate=2008-01-29 |ref=harv |last2=Donnelly |first2=Peter |last3=Wiuf |first3=Carsten |last4=Hein |first4=Jotun |last5=Slatkin |first5=Montgomery |last6=Ewens |first6=W.

In this case, populations are defined by the accumulation of mutations on the mtDNA, and special trees are created for the mutations and the order in which they occurred in each population. The tree is formed through the testing of a large number of individuals all over the world for the presence or lack of a certain set of mutations. Once this is done it is possible to determine how many mutations separate one population from another. The number of mutations, together with estimated mutation rate of the mtDNA in the regions tested, allows scientists to determine the approximate time to MRCA (''TMRCA'') which indicates time passed since the populations last shared the same set of mutations or belonged to the same [[haplogroup]].\n\nIn the case of Y-Chromosomal DNA, TMRCA is arrived at in a different way. [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA haplogroups]] are defined by [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] in various regions of the Y-DNA. The time to MRCA within a haplogroup is defined by the accumulation of mutations in [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] sequences of the Y-Chromosome of that haplogroup only. Y-DNA network analysis of [[Y-STR]] [[haplotypes]] showing a non-star cluster indicates Y-STR variability due to multiple founding individuals. Analysis yielding a star cluster can be regarded as representing a population descended from a single ancestor. In this case the variability of the [[Y-STR]] sequence, also called the [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] variation, can be regarded as a measure of the time passed since the ancestor founded this particular population. The [[Descent from Genghis Khan|descendants of Genghis Khan]] or one of his ancestors represents a famous star cluster that can be dated back to the time of Genghis Khan.<ref>Tatiana Zerjal (2003), The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols, {{cite web|url= http://web.unife.it/progetti/genetica/Giorgio/PDFfiles/ajhg2003.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120710225619/http://web.unife.it/progetti/genetica/Giorgio/PDFfiles/ajhg2003.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-10 }}</ref>\n\nTMRCA calculations are considered critical evidence when attempting to determine migration dates of various populations as they spread around the world. For example, if a mutation is deemed to have occurred 30,000 years ago, then this mutation should be found amongst all populations that diverged after this date. If archeological evidence indicates cultural spread and formation of regionally isolated populations then this must be reflected in the isolation of subsequent genetic mutations in this region. If genetic divergence and regional divergence coincide it can be concluded that the observed divergence is due to migration as evidenced by the archaeological record. However, if the date of genetic divergence occurs at a different time than the archaeological record, then scientists will have to look at alternate archaeological evidence to explain the genetic divergence.

Chang, Douglas Rohde and Steve Olson calculated that the MRCA lived remarkably recently, possibly as recently as 300 BCE. This model took into account that people do not truly mate randomly, but that, particularly in the past, people almost always mated with people who lived nearby, and usually with people who lived in their own town or village. It would have been especially rare to mate with somebody who lived in another country. However, Chang et al. found that a rare person who mates with a person far away will in time connect the worldwide family tree, and that no population is truly completely isolated.{{efn|group=note|Rohde<ref name=\"Rohde_2004\" /> calculates an age of 3,000 to 7,000 years based on a non-genetic, mathematical model that assumes [[panmixia|random mating]], although it has taken into account important aspects of human population substructure such as [[assortative mating]] and historical geographical constraints on interbreeding.

European colonization of the Americas and Australia was found by Chang to be too recent to have had a substantial impact on the age of the MRCA.

While organisms have ancestry graphs and progeny graphs via [[sexual reproduction]], a gene has a single chain of ancestors and a tree of descendants. An organism produced by sexual cross-fertilization ([[allogamy]]) has at least two ancestors (its immediate parents), but a gene always has one ancestor per generation.\n\n==Patrilineal and matrilineal MRCA==\n{{Main|Mitochondrial Eve|Y-chromosomal Adam}}\n[[File:MtDNA-MRCA-generations-Evolution.svg|thumb|left|200px|Through [[Genetic drift|random drift]] or selection, lineage will trace back to a single person.

Although an autosomal chromosome contains genes that are passed down from parents to children via [[independent assortment]] from only one of the two parents, [[genetic recombination]] ([[chromosomal crossover]]) mixes genes from non-sister [[chromatids]] from both parents during [[meiosis]], thus changing the genetic composition of the chromosome.\n\n== Time to MRCA estimates ==\nDifferent types of MRCAs are estimated to have lived at different times in the past. These ''time to MRCA'' (''TMRCA'') estimates are also computed differently depending on the type of MRCA being considered. Patrilineal and matrilineal MRCAs (Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam) are traced by single gene markers, thus their TMRCA are computed based on DNA test results and established mutation rates as practiced in genetic genealogy. Time to genealogical MRCA of all living humans is computed based on non-genetic, mathematical models and computer simulations.\n\nSince Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam are traced by single genes via a single ancestral parent line, the time to these genetic MRCAs will necessarily be greater than that for the genealogical MRCA. This is because single genes will coalesce more slowly than tracing of conventional human genealogy via both parents. The latter considers only individual humans, without taking into account whether any gene from the computed MRCA actually survives in every single person in the current population.<ref name=chang_1999>{{cite journal |doi=10.1239/aap/1029955256 |last=Chang |first=Joseph T. |title=Recent common ancestors of all present-day individuals |journal=Advances in Applied Probability |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=1002\u201326, discussion and author's reply, 1027\u201338 |year=1999 |url= http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/papers/Ancestors.pdf |accessdate=2008-01-29 |ref=harv |last2=Donnelly |first2=Peter |last3=Wiuf |first3=Carsten |last4=Hein |first4=Jotun |last5=Slatkin |first5=Montgomery |last6=Ewens |first6=W.

In this case, populations are defined by the accumulation of mutations on the mtDNA, and special trees are created for the mutations and the order in which they occurred in each population. The tree is formed through the testing of a large number of individuals all over the world for the presence or lack of a certain set of mutations. Once this is done it is possible to determine how many mutations separate one population from another. The number of mutations, together with estimated mutation rate of the mtDNA in the regions tested, allows scientists to determine the approximate time to MRCA (''TMRCA'') which indicates time passed since the populations last shared the same set of mutations or belonged to the same [[haplogroup]].\n\nIn the case of Y-Chromosomal DNA, TMRCA is arrived at in a different way. [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA haplogroups]] are defined by [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] in various regions of the Y-DNA. The time to MRCA within a haplogroup is defined by the accumulation of mutations in [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] sequences of the Y-Chromosome of that haplogroup only. Y-DNA network analysis of [[Y-STR]] [[haplotypes]] showing a non-star cluster indicates Y-STR variability due to multiple founding individuals. Analysis yielding a star cluster can be regarded as representing a population descended from a single ancestor. In this case the variability of the [[Y-STR]] sequence, also called the [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] variation, can be regarded as a measure of the time passed since the ancestor founded this particular population. The [[Descent from Genghis Khan|descendants of Genghis Khan]] or one of his ancestors represents a famous star cluster that can be dated back to the time of Genghis Khan.<ref>Tatiana Zerjal (2003), The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols, {{cite web|url= http://web.unife.it/progetti/genetica/Giorgio/PDFfiles/ajhg2003.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120710225619/http://web.unife.it/progetti/genetica/Giorgio/PDFfiles/ajhg2003.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-10 }}</ref>\n\nTMRCA calculations are considered critical evidence when attempting to determine migration dates of various populations as they spread around the world. For example, if a mutation is deemed to have occurred 30,000 years ago, then this mutation should be found amongst all populations that diverged after this date. If archeological evidence indicates cultural spread and formation of regionally isolated populations then this must be reflected in the isolation of subsequent genetic mutations in this region. If genetic divergence and regional divergence coincide it can be concluded that the observed divergence is due to migration as evidenced by the archaeological record. However, if the date of genetic divergence occurs at a different time than the archaeological record, then scientists will have to look at alternate archaeological evidence to explain the genetic divergence.

Chang, Douglas Rohde and Steve Olson calculated that the MRCA lived remarkably recently, possibly as recently as 300 BCE. This model took into account that people do not truly mate randomly, but that, particularly in the past, people almost always mated with people who lived nearby, and usually with people who lived in their own town or village. It would have been especially rare to mate with somebody who lived in another country. However, Chang et al. found that a rare person who mates with a person far away will in time connect the worldwide family tree, and that no population is truly completely isolated.{{efn|group=note|Rohde<ref name=\"Rohde_2004\" /> calculates an age of 3,000 to 7,000 years based on a non-genetic, mathematical model that assumes [[panmixia|random mating]], although it has taken into account important aspects of human population substructure such as [[assortative mating]] and historical geographical constraints on interbreeding. This range is consistent with the age of 3,100 years calculated for the MRCA of the [[JC virus]], a ubiquitous human polyomavirus usually transmitted from parents to children.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=L.

Possible locations for the MRCA include places such as the Chuckchi and Kamchatka Peninsulas that are close to Alaska, places such as Indonesia and Malaysia that are close to Australia or a place such as Taiwan or Japan that is more intermediate to Australia and the Americas. European colonization of the Americas and Australia was found by Chang to be too recent to have had a substantial impact on the age of the MRCA. In fact, if the Americas and Australia had never been discovered by Europeans, the MRCA would only be about 2.3% further back in the past than it is.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/01/AR2006070100463.html |title = Roots of Human Family Tree Are Shallow|date = July 2006}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Papers/Rohde-MRCA-two.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230184319/http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Papers/Rohde-MRCA-two.pdf |archive-date=2018-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNote that the age of the MRCA of a population does not correspond to a [[population bottleneck]], let alone a \"first couple\".

Through [[sexual reproduction]], an ancestor passes half of his or her genes to each descendant in the next generation; after more than 32 generations the contribution of a single ancestor would be on the order of 2<sup>\u221232</sup>, a number proportional to less than a single basepair within the [[human genome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Zhaxybayeva, Olga |author2=Lapierre, Pascal |author3=Gogarten, J.

In contrast, long-term video-EEG monitoring may record non-cerebral signals from throughout the body such as biological and extra-physiological artifacts and thus makes the data logs susceptible to displaying false positives that can result in false seizure reports.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Van de Vel|first1=A|last2=Cuppens|first2=K|last3=Bonroy|first3=B|last4=Milosevic|first4=M|last5=Jansen|first5=K|last6=Van Huffel|first6=S|last7=Vanrumste|first7=B|last8=Lagae|first8=L|last9=Ceulemans|first9=B|title=Non-EEG seizure-detection systems and potential SUDEP prevention: state of the art.|date= 2013|doi=10.1016/j.seizure.2013.02.012|pmid=23506646|volume=22|issue=5|journal=Seizure|pages=345\u201355}}</ref> These false data reports may then impede the neurologist from distinguishing where an episode may begin and end, or if an episode occurred at all. The use of at-home devices also introduces obstacles such as daily visits by a professional to collect the data logs and to take care of the equipment, equipment hazards, and lighting issues for the video recording device.<ref name=\":1\" /> Having long-term video-EEG monitoring sessions in a clinical setting provides a controlled environment that allows the health professional to most efficiently collect data, monitor seizure inducing procedures, and keep the equipment functioning properly.\n\n== Research ==\n[[File:EEG recording.jpg|right|thumb|200px|EEG cap setup.]]Research involving the use of long-term video-EEG monitoring has mostly involved animal models which allows for neuronal activity to be better understood by using methods that may involve the use of psychoactive drugs or inducing states that would not be ethical to induce in humans experimentally. These models provide a relatively inexpensive and low risk scenario compared to humans, when testing their effects on the brain in response to events such as pre-clinical and clinical use of pharmaceutical drugs.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Drinkenburg|first1=Wilhelmus|last2=Ahnaou|first2=Abdallah|last3=Ruigt|first3=G\u00e9|title=Pharmaco-EEG Studies in Animals: A History-Based Introduction to Contemporary Translational Applications|journal=Neuropsychobiology|date=February 23, 2016|volume=72|issue=3\u20134|pages=139\u2013150|doi=10.1159/000443175|pmid=26901675|accessdate=}}</ref> The use of animal models also allows for variables, that are not as easily related to seizures in humans, to be taken into account such as how status epileptici affect their brain over an individual's life span, familial lineage, and development during maturation.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1= Puttachary|first1= S|last2= Sharma|first2= S|last3= Tse|first3= K|last4= Beamer|first4= E|last5= Sexton|first5= A|last6= Crutison|first6= J|last7= Thippeswamy|first7= T|title= Immediate Epileptogenesis after Kainate-Induced Status Epilepticus in C57BL/6J Mice: Evidence from Long Term Continuous Video-EEG Telemetry.|journal= PLoS ONE|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0131705|pmid= 26161754|pmc= 4498886|volume=10|issue= 7|year=2015|page=e0131705}}</ref> Thus the heritability, prevalence, and general development of seizures over many generations can be closely monitored and studied.\n\nCurrent research being performed using long-term video-EEG monitoring mostly focuses on the mouse model known as C57BL/6J which can be used to induce [[Convulsion|behavioral convulsive]] (CS) and [[Convulsion|electrographic-nonconvulsive]] (NCS) seizures. These seizures can then be monitored over a 4-18 week period, which is a much longer period than most humans are normally comfortable with. As these mice are monitored, factors such as the length of the episode, spike amplitude, interspike interval, and spike frequency can all be closely observed to see how CS and NCS develop over the trial.<ref name=\":3\" /> The stages of the status epileptici can then be distinguished by using scales, such as the [[Racine Stages]] and CSS indices, to determine the severity of the episode and how they may also change over a given cycle.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1137908-overview EEG video monitoring at Medscape Reference]\n* [http://memo.cgu.edu.tw/cgmj/3203/320309.pdf Long-term Video-EEG Monitoring for Paroxysmal Events]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long-Term Video-Eeg Monitoring}}\n[[Category:Electroencephalography]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_video-EEG_monitoring"}
