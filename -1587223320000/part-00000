Camacho's assistant [[Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n]] took over on temporary basis as Real's leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling [[Ben Thatcher]] in an England match against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next [[Yellow card (sports)|caution]], and had picked up an injury which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. [[The Football Association]] asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had \"made a mistake\" and apologised.<ref>{{cite news |title=FA wants explanation from Beckham |work=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/3735276.stm |accessdate=6 October 2005 |date=14 October 2004}}</ref> He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]].

However, the well-travelled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in second position. On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against [[Getafe CF]]. A day later Luxemburgo was sacked and was replaced by [[Juan Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Caro]].

Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach [[Fabio Capello]], Beckham started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes]] was normally preferred on the right wing. Of the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contractual negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season.

On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with [[Herbalife]] nutrition company worth US$20&nbsp;million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home stadium, the [[Dignity Health Sports Park|Home Depot Center]]).<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.44\">''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.44</ref> LA Galaxy owners [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) also reported an immediate spike in business.

He made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'', a few weeks earlier [[Adidas]] launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign \"F\u00fatbol meets Football\" starring Beckham and [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Reggie Bush]], and ''W'' magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]]. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air ''David Beckham: New Beginnings'' documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by [[Simon Fuller]], who in turn has a business relationship with the [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400&nbsp;million headquarters in [[Century City]] with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.67</ref> That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special ''[[Victoria Beckham: Coming to America]]'' aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, pp.69\u201370</ref>\n\n[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007 Direction.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Beckham during a LA Galaxy game in November 2007]]\nOn Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for [[Alan Gordon (soccer)|Alan Gordon]] in the 78th minute of a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the [[World Series of Soccer (MLS)|World Series of Soccer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|title=David Beckham's First Match in Major League Soccer Live on ESPN Saturday, 21&nbsp;July|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=14 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224213616/http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|archivedate=24 December 2008}}</ref> With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, [[Eva Longoria]], [[Governor of California]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Drew Carey]] among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Didier Drogba]], [[Michael Ballack]], and [[Frank Lampard]], the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by [[Steve Sidwell]] whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US \u2013 a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.66\"/> As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than [[2007 Open Championship|British Open]] golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the [[2007 IndyCar Series season|Indy Racing League]]'s [[2007 Honda 200|Honda 200]] motor race.<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.66\"/>\n\nThe day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event.

It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star [[King Edward Hotel (Toronto)|Le M\u00e9ridien King Edward]] in [[downtown Toronto]] (an expense paid for by the local [[Toronto]] promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.85\u201387</ref>\n[[File:Beckham LA Galaxy cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Beckham playing for LA Galaxy in March 2008]]\nTwo weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus [[D.C.

On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with [[Herbalife]] nutrition company worth US$20&nbsp;million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home stadium, the [[Dignity Health Sports Park|Home Depot Center]]).<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.44\">''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.44</ref> LA Galaxy owners [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) also reported an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]], where the company had been working aggressively for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. The company's CEO [[Tim Leiweke]] put it as follows: \"Suddenly, we're known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to play for, so our world changed\".<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.45</ref>\n\nIn the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an [[Expansion of Major League Soccer|MLS expansion]] franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25&nbsp;million whenever he stopped playing in the league<ref name=\"Kennedy\">{{cite news|url=http://www.socceramerica.com/article/51723/beckham-is-mls-expansion-story-du-jour.html|title=Beckham is MLS expansion story du jour|first=Paul|last=Kennedy|date=20 May 2013|work=Soccer Business Insider}}</ref> \u2013 an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract.<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.44\"/> The league had a [[salary cap]] in place, requiring the creation of the [[Designated Player Rule]] for Beckham to bypass the cap; the rule was later nicknamed in his honor. In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2&nbsp;million home on San Ysidro Drive in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.66\">''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.66</ref>\n\n[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Beckham (with a blue captain's armband) became LA Galaxy captain immediately upon joining the team]]\nBeckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.16</ref> Beckham chose to wear number 23.

He made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'', a few weeks earlier [[Adidas]] launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign \"F\u00fatbol meets Football\" starring Beckham and [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Reggie Bush]], and ''W'' magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]]. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air ''David Beckham: New Beginnings'' documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by [[Simon Fuller]], who in turn has a business relationship with the [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400&nbsp;million headquarters in [[Century City]] with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.67</ref> That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special ''[[Victoria Beckham: Coming to America]]'' aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, pp.69\u201370</ref>\n\n[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007 Direction.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Beckham during a LA Galaxy game in November 2007]]\nOn Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for [[Alan Gordon (soccer)|Alan Gordon]] in the 78th minute of a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the [[World Series of Soccer (MLS)|World Series of Soccer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|title=David Beckham's First Match in Major League Soccer Live on ESPN Saturday, 21&nbsp;July|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=14 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224213616/http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|archivedate=24 December 2008}}</ref> With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, [[Eva Longoria]], [[Governor of California]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Drew Carey]] among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Didier Drogba]], [[Michael Ballack]], and [[Frank Lampard]], the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by [[Steve Sidwell]] whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US \u2013 a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.66\"/> As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than [[2007 Open Championship|British Open]] golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the [[2007 IndyCar Series season|Indy Racing League]]'s [[2007 Honda 200|Honda 200]] motor race.<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.66\"/>\n\nThe day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood [[A-list]]ers, the lavish bash was big news in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[Access Hollywood]]''.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.68\u201370</ref>\n\nBeckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches \u2013 three in the [[North American SuperLiga]] and an MLS game away at [[Toronto FC]] though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star [[King Edward Hotel (Toronto)|Le M\u00e9ridien King Edward]] in [[downtown Toronto]] (an expense paid for by the local [[Toronto]] promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.85\u201387</ref>\n[[File:Beckham LA Galaxy cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Beckham playing for LA Galaxy in March 2008]]\nTwo weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus [[D.C. United]] in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]], coming on for [[Quavas Kirk]] in the 71st minute.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/2007-08-09-beckham-debut_N.htm |title=Beckham makes MLS debut but Galaxy stumbles in D.C. |work=USA Today |accessdate=15 August 2007 |first=Beau |last=Dure |date=12 August 2007 }}</ref> Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that [[Carlos Pav\u00f3n]] failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into [[Landon Donovan]]'s path that United's keeper [[Troy Perkins]] managed to break up in the last moment \u2013 the Galaxy lost 1\u20130. The next match on the road trip was at [[New England Revolution]] and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the [[Gillette Stadium]]'s artificial surface.\n\nBeckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing D.C. United, in the [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]] semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=453684&root=mls&cc=5901|title=Beckham takes captain's armband to great effect|publisher=ESPN |date=16 August 2007}}</ref> He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2\u20130 victory, and a place in the [[2007 North American SuperLiga|North American SuperLiga]] final versus [[C.F. Pachuca|Pachuca]] on 29 August.\n\nDuring the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan revealing that he had sprained his [[medial collateral ligament]] and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1\u20130 loss to the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league).\n\n====2008====\nBeckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 2008 for three weeks until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7171836.stm |title=Beckham begins Arsenal training |work=BBC Sport |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2009}}</ref> Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] in the ninth minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=237757&cc=5901 |title=Beckham, Donovan propel L.A. past Quakes |publisher=ESPN |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=4 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408050045/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=237757&cc=5901 |archivedate=8 April 2008 }}</ref> On 24 May 2008, the Galaxy defeated the [[Sporting Kansas City|Kansas City Wizards]] 3\u20131, giving the Galaxy their first winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70&nbsp;yards out.

Bolas were most famously used by the [[gauchos]] (South American cowboys), but have been found in excavations of [[Pre-Columbian]] settlements, especially in [[Patagonia]], where indigenous peoples (particularly the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]]) used them to catch 200-pound ''[[guanaco]]'' (llama-like mammals) and [[Rhea (bird)|''\u00f1and\u00fa'']] (birds). The [[Mapuche]] and the [[Inca army#Weapons|Inca army]] used them in battle. Researchers have also found bolas in [[North America]] at the [[Calico Early Man Site]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Toortse Rio de la Plata.png|thumb|right|[[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] with ''Bolas'' (Hendrick Ottsen, 1603)]]\n''Gauchos'' used ''boleadoras'' to capture running [[cattle]] or game. Depending on the exact design, the thrower grasps the ''boleadora'' by one of the weights or by the nexus of the cords. The thrower gives the balls momentum by swinging them and then releases the ''boleadora''. The weapon is usually used to entangle the animal's legs, but when thrown with enough force might even inflict damage (e.g. breaking a bone).\n\nTraditionally, [[Inuit]] have used bolas to hunt birds, fouling the birds in air with the lines of the bola. ''People of a Feather'' showed [[Belcher Island]] Inuit using bolas to hunt eider ducks on the wing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1929346/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|title=People of a Feather (2011)|author=Tracy Allard|date=8 November 2013|work=IMDb|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Boleadoras.gif|thumb|right|150px|''Boleadoras'']]\nThere is no uniform design; most ''bolas'' have two or three balls, but there are versions of up to eight or nine. Some ''bolas'' have balls of equal weight, others vary the knot and cord. ''Gauchos'' use ''bolas'' made of [[braid]]ed [[leather]] cords with [[wood]]en balls or small leather sacks full of stones at the ends of the cords.\n\n''Bolas'' can be named depending on the number of weights used:\n\n* ''Perdida'' (one weight)\n* ''Avestrucera'' or ''\u00f1anducera'' (two weights, for rheas)\n* ''Somai'' (two weights)<ref name=Blair>Blair, Claude and Tarassuk, Leonid, eds.

Bolas were most famously used by the [[gauchos]] (South American cowboys), but have been found in excavations of [[Pre-Columbian]] settlements, especially in [[Patagonia]], where indigenous peoples (particularly the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]]) used them to catch 200-pound ''[[guanaco]]'' (llama-like mammals) and [[Rhea (bird)|''\u00f1and\u00fa'']] (birds). The [[Mapuche]] and the [[Inca army#Weapons|Inca army]] used them in battle. Researchers have also found bolas in [[North America]] at the [[Calico Early Man Site]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Toortse Rio de la Plata.png|thumb|right|[[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] with ''Bolas'' (Hendrick Ottsen, 1603)]]\n''Gauchos'' used ''boleadoras'' to capture running [[cattle]] or game. Depending on the exact design, the thrower grasps the ''boleadora'' by one of the weights or by the nexus of the cords. The thrower gives the balls momentum by swinging them and then releases the ''boleadora''. The weapon is usually used to entangle the animal's legs, but when thrown with enough force might even inflict damage (e.g. breaking a bone).\n\nTraditionally, [[Inuit]] have used bolas to hunt birds, fouling the birds in air with the lines of the bola. ''People of a Feather'' showed [[Belcher Island]] Inuit using bolas to hunt eider ducks on the wing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1929346/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|title=People of a Feather (2011)|author=Tracy Allard|date=8 November 2013|work=IMDb|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Boleadoras.gif|thumb|right|150px|''Boleadoras'']]\nThere is no uniform design; most ''bolas'' have two or three balls, but there are versions of up to eight or nine.

''Gauchos'' use ''bolas'' made of [[braid]]ed [[leather]] cords with [[wood]]en balls or small leather sacks full of stones at the ends of the cords.\n\n''Bolas'' can be named depending on the number of weights used:\n\n* ''Perdida'' (one weight)\n* ''Avestrucera'' or ''\u00f1anducera'' (two weights, for rheas)\n* ''Somai'' (two weights)<ref name=Blair>Blair, Claude and Tarassuk, Leonid, eds.

His visit to [[Pakistan administered Kashmir]] during then became an embarrassment, where according to [[Hashim Qureshi]], he shared a platform with JKLF . Though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf of [[Indira Gandhi]] and his father, so that sentiments there could \"be known first hand\", few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed [[Khalistan movement|Khalistan]] terrorist groups to train in Jammu province, although those allegations were never proved. On 2 July 1984, [[Ghulam Mohammad Shah|G. M.

Islam is in danger). As a result, Kashmiri Hindus were targeted by the Kashmiri Muslims. Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus. During the Anantnag riot in February 1986, although no Hindu was killed, many houses and other properties belonging to Hindus were looted, burnt or damaged.<ref name=\"Tikoo\">{{cite book|author=Colonel Tej K Tikoo|title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&pg=PT397|publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC|isbn=978-1-935501-58-9|pages=397\u2013}}</ref> An investigation of Anantnag riots revealed that members of the 'secular parties' in the state, rather than the Islamists, had played a key role in organising the violence to gain political mileage through religious sentiments. Shah called in the army to curb the violence, but it had little effect. His government was dismissed on 12 March 1986, by the then Governor [[Jagmohan]] following communal riots in south Kashmir. This led Jagmohan to rule the state directly.

Many Hindu families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Hindus faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Hindus to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question.

His visit to [[Pakistan administered Kashmir]] during then became an embarrassment, where according to [[Hashim Qureshi]], he shared a platform with JKLF . Though Abdullah asserted that he went on behalf of [[Indira Gandhi]] and his father, so that sentiments there could \"be known first hand\", few people believed him. There were also allegations that he had allowed [[Khalistan movement|Khalistan]] terrorist groups to train in Jammu province, although those allegations were never proved. On 2 July 1984, [[Ghulam Mohammad Shah|G. M.

Islam is in danger). As a result, Kashmiri Hindus were targeted by the Kashmiri Muslims. Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus. During the Anantnag riot in February 1986, although no Hindu was killed, many houses and other properties belonging to Hindus were looted, burnt or damaged.<ref name=\"Tikoo\">{{cite book|author=Colonel Tej K Tikoo|title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuURFTHTU0EC&pg=PT397|publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC|isbn=978-1-935501-58-9|pages=397\u2013}}</ref> An investigation of Anantnag riots revealed that members of the 'secular parties' in the state, rather than the Islamists, had played a key role in organising the violence to gain political mileage through religious sentiments. Shah called in the army to curb the violence, but it had little effect. His government was dismissed on 12 March 1986, by the then Governor [[Jagmohan]] following communal riots in south Kashmir. This led Jagmohan to rule the state directly.

They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. Most of them lost their properties after the exodus and many are unable to go back and sell them. Their status as displaced people has adversely harmed them in the realm of education. Many Hindu families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Hindus faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Hindus to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question.

She was cast opposite the leading actor [[Rajkumar (actor)|Dr. Rajkumar]] in several Kannada films, including ''[[Mallammana Pavada]]'' (1969), ''[[Nyayave Devaru]]'' (1971), ''[[Sri Srinivasa Kalyana]]'' (1974), ''[[Babruvahana (film)|Babruvahana]]'' (1977) and ''[[Bhagyavantharu]]'' (1977).
