She received her doctorate from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1974, under the direction of [[Herbert Wilf]]. After working at [[Bell Laboratories]] and Bellcore for nineteen years, she joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania as the first female [[tenure]]d professor in mathematics. She serves on the editorial boards of more than a dozen international journals. Since 2003 she has been the editor-in-chief of ''Internet Mathematics''. She has been invited to give lectures at many conferences, including the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1994 and a plenary lecture on the mathematics of PageRank at the 2008 Annual meeting of the [[American Mathematical Society]].

Under the influence of her father, an engineer, she became interested in mathematics, especially in the area of [[combinatorics]] in high school in Kaohsiung. After high school, Chung entered the [[National Taiwan University]] (NTU) to start her career in mathematics formally. While Chung was an undergraduate, she was surrounded by many female mathematicians, and this helped encourage her to pursue and study mathematics.\n\nAfter graduating from NTU with a B.S. in mathematics, Chung went on to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to pursue a career in mathematics. There she obtained the highest score in the qualifying exam by a wide margin, catching the attention of [[Herbert Wilf]], who would eventually become her doctoral advisor. Wilf suggested [[Ramsey theory]] as a subject Chung could work on. During a single week studying material Chung had come up with new proofs for established results in the field. Wilf said: \"My eyes were bulging. I was very excited. I asked her to go to the blackboard and show me. What she wrote was incredible! In just one week, from a cold start, she had a major result in Ramsey theory. I told her she had just done two-thirds of a doctoral dissertation.\"<ref name=\"Chung biography\"/>\n\nChung was awarded a M.S. in 1972 and a Ph.D. two years later. By this time, she was married and had already given birth to her first child. The same year she received her Ph.D. and started working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at [[Bell Laboratories]] in Murray Hill, New Jersey. The position at [[Bell Laboratories]] was an opportunity to work with other excellent mathematicians, but also it contributed to her mathematical world powerfully. She published many impressive mathematical papers and published many joint papers with [[Ronald Graham (mathematician)|Ron Graham]].\n\nAfter twenty years of work at [[Bell Laboratories]] and [[Bellcore]], Chung decided to go back [[University of Pennsylvania]] to become a professor of mathematics. In 1998, she was named Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at [[University of California]], San Diego. To date, she has over 200 publications to her name. The two best known books are ''Spectral Graph Theory'' and ''Erd\u0151s on Graphs''. ''[[Spectral Graph Theory]]'' studies how the spectrum of the Laplacian of a graph is related to its combinatorial properties. ''Erd\u0151s on Graphs'', which was jointly written by Fan Chung and Ron Graham, studies many of [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] problems and conjectures in graph theory. Beyond her contributions to graph theory, Chung has used her knowledge to connect different fields of science. As she wrote in \"Graph Theory in the Information Age'',\n\n: \u201cIn the past decade, graph theory has gone through a remarkable shift and a profound transformation. The change is in large part due to the humongous amount of information that we are confronted with. A main way to sort through massive data sets is to build and examine the network formed by interrelations. For example, Google\u2019s successful Web search algorithms are based on the WWW graph, which contains all Web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges. There are all sorts of information networks, such as biological networks built from biological databases and social networks formed by email, phone calls, instant messaging, etc., as well as various types of physical networks. Of particular interest to mathematicians is the collaboration graph, which is based on the data from Mathematical Reviews. In the collaboration graph, every mathematician is a vertex, and two mathematicians who wrote a joint paper are connected.\u201d<ref>Chung, Fan ''Graph Theory in the Information Age'' January 2009, Washington D.C</ref>\n\nChung's life was profiled in the 2017 documentary film ''Girls who fell in love with Math''.<ref name=taiwanDocumentary>{{cite web | title=''Girls who fell in love with Math''|url=https://docs.tfi.org.tw/zh-hant/film/4904|publisher=Taiwan Film Institute| accessdate=2018-02-04}}</ref>\n\n===Bell Laboratories===\nIn 1974, Fan Chung graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and became a member of Technical Staff working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at [[Bell Laboratories]] in Murray Hill, New Jersey. She worked under [[Henry Pollak]]. During this time, Chung collaborated with many leading mathematicians who work for Bell Laboratories such as [[Ronald Graham|Ron Graham]].\n\nIn 1975, Chung published her first joint paper with Graham on ''Multicolor Ramsey Numbers for Complete Bipartite Graphs''  which was published in the ''Journal of Combinatorial Theory''.\n\nIn 1983 the Bell Telephone Company was split up. Since Pollak joined and became head of a research unit within a new company, he asked Chung to become Research Manager. Until 1990, she was one of the first to receive a fellowship to spend a sabbatical at a university. She supervised many mathematicians in the unit.\n\nAccording to Chung's words, although people respect her because of the power to make decisions with positions in management, she prefers to be respected because of her achievement in mathematics. Since then, she has returned to the academic world.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">J J O'Connor and E F Roberson, ''Fan Rong K Chung Graham'', web, [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung.html www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung.html].</ref>\n\n===Ron Graham===\nFan Chung's first marriage ended in divorce in 1982. However, when she worked at [[Bell Laboratories]], she met [[Ronald Graham]]. During that time, they became close friends and published many joint papers in graph theory, eventually marrying in 1983. In [[P Hoffman|Paul Hoffman]]'s book ''The Man Who Loved Only Numbers'', regarding her marriage with Graham, Chung said:\n\n:Many mathematicians would hate to marry someone in the profession. They fear their relationship would be too competitive. In our case, not only are we both mathematicians, we both do work in the same areas. So we can understand and appreciate what the other is working on, and we can work on things together and sometimes make good progress.<ref>Hoffman, P  ''The man who loved only numbers'' London, 1998.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Graham and Chung co-wrote the book ''Erd\u0151s on Graphs.''<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Research==\n===Spectral graph theory===\nAmong Fan Chung's publications, her contributions to [[spectral graph theory]] are important to this area of graph theory. From the first publications about undirected graphs to recent publications about the directed graphs, Fan Chung creates the solid base in the [[spectral graph theory]] to the future graph theorist.\n\nSpectral graph theory, as one of the most important theories in graph theory, combines the algebra and graph perfectly. Historically, algebraic methods treat many types of graphs efficiently. Her work initiated a geometric approach to spectral graph theory  with connections to differential geometry. According to the biography ''Fan Rong K Chung Graham'', \"[[Spectral graph theory]] studies how the spectrum of the [[Laplacian]] of a graph is related to its combinatorial properties.\". \n\nIn 1997, the [[American Mathematical Society]] published Chung's book ''Spectral graph theory''. This book became a standard textbook at many universities and is the key to study [[Spectral graph theory]] for many mathematics students who are interested in this area. Fan Chung's study in the [[spectral graph theory]] brings this \u201calgebraic connectivity\u201d of graphs into a new and higher level.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Network science===\nFan Chung's work in random graph models shed new lights on the field of [[network science]]. Many real-world large information networks (such as Internet Graphs, Call Graphs, and [[Collaboration graph|Collaboration Graphs,]] etc.) have been observed to be well approximated by a [[Power law|power law distribution]]. Fan Chung's work in the Chung-Lu model, pioneered the theory of treating random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions, including the power law graphs. Her work provides a solid framework for quantitative and rigorous analysis for modeling and analyzing large complex networks. It also often serves as a popular benchmark for comparing new graph models in network science. \n\nIn 2006, the [[American Mathematical Society|American Mathematics Society]] and the [[Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences]] co-published Fan Chung and Linyuan Lu's book ''Complex Graphs and Networks''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bookstore.ams.org/cbms-107/|title=Complex Graphs and Networks|website=bookstore.ams.org|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> The book gave a well-structured exposition for using combinatorial, probabilistic, spectral methods as well as other new and improved tools to analyze real-world large information networks.\n\n===Quasi-random graphs===\n\n{{Main|Chung\u2013Graham\u2013Wilson theorem}}\n\nFan Chung, together with [[Ronald Graham]] and [[R. M. Wilson|Richard Wilson]], introduced a strong notion of equivalence among graph properties through the control of error bounds and developed the theory of quasi-random graphs. In a series of research papers (with several coauthors), she showed that a large family of graph properties is equivalent in the sense that if a graph satisfies any one of the properties, it must satisfy all of them. The set of equivalent quasi-random properties includes a surprisingly diverse collection of properties, and therefore provides efficient methods for validating graph properties. Many (but not all)  random graph properties are quasi-random. The notion of quasi-randomness have been extended to many other combinatorial structures, such as sequences, tournaments, hypergraphs  and graph limits.  In general, the theory of quasi-randomness gives a rigorous approach to 'random-like' or 'pseudorandom' alternatives.\n\n===Extremal graph theory===\nA basic question in extremal graph theory is to find unavoidable patterns and structures in graphs with given density or distribution. A complementary problem is to find a smallest graph which contains every member of a given family of graphs as subgraphs. In a series of work with [[Paul Erd\u0151s]], Chung determined the sizes and structures of unavoidable graphs and hypergraphs. With several coauthors, she also derived many elegant and surprising results on universal graphs. Her fundamental contributions in these areas of extremal graph theory have many applications in parallel computations.\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\n* [[Carl B.

The notion of quasi-randomness have been extended to many other combinatorial structures, such as sequences, tournaments, hypergraphs  and graph limits.  In general, the theory of quasi-randomness gives a rigorous approach to 'random-like' or 'pseudorandom' alternatives.\n\n===Extremal graph theory===\nA basic question in extremal graph theory is to find unavoidable patterns and structures in graphs with given density or distribution. A complementary problem is to find a smallest graph which contains every member of a given family of graphs as subgraphs. In a series of work with [[Paul Erd\u0151s]], Chung determined the sizes and structures of unavoidable graphs and hypergraphs. With several coauthors, she also derived many elegant and surprising results on universal graphs. Her fundamental contributions in these areas of extremal graph theory have many applications in parallel computations.\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\n* [[Carl B.

Their ability to influence and participate in the external policies that may exercise [[jurisdiction]] over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and [[land rights]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the [[Ainu people#Litigation|Ainu people]] of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in law, stating that \"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\"<ref>Judgment of the Sapporo District Court, Civil Division No. 3, 27 March 1997, in (1999) 38 ILM, p. 419</ref>\n\nIn Russia, definition of \"indigenous peoples\" is contested largely referring to a number of population (less than 50 000 people), and neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and cultural institutions.<ref>IWGIA (2012).

These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the [[Aegean Sea]] before the subsequent migrations of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Herodotus]] give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \"foreigners\", termed \"[[barbarian]]s\" by the historical Greeks).\n\n[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] society flourished between 250&nbsp;BCE and 480&nbsp;CE and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of [[classical antiquity]] had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.<ref>Hall, Gillette, and Harry Anthony Patrinos. Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Human Development in Latin America. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, n.d. Google Scholar. Web. 11 Mar. 2013</ref>\n\nHowever, when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, and this expansion became a forerunner of what was to take the Americas, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific by storm in more recent times. Thus, the idea that expansionist societies may encounter peoples who possess cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power was not new to the [[Renaissance]] or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured [[Guanches|Guanche]] kings of [[Tenerife]] to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].]]\n\n===European expansion and colonialism===\n{{See also|Columbian exchange}}\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onward had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The [[Age of Discovery|exploratory]] and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\n\nEncounters between explorers and indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, [[smallpox]], [[measles]], malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America and Australia.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] had an indigenous population called the [[Guanches]] whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124301/http://ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html |date=13 October 2007 }}.

Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\n\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \"traditional\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.

The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\n\n===Africa===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of Africa}}[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|Starting fire by hand, [[San people]] in Botswana.]]\nIn the post-colonial period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] or [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\n\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\n\n===Americas===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\nThe impact of [[European colonization of the Americas]] on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\n\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population \u2014 in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as ''pueblos [[wikt:ind\u00edgena|ind\u00edgenas]]'', ''amerindios'', ''povos nativos'', ''povos ind\u00edgenas'', and, in Peru, ''Comunidades Nativas'' (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the [[Urarina]]<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> and [[Mats\u00e9s]].

These groups are often together spoken of as [[Indigenous Australians]].\n\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by [[Polynesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the [[Chamorros]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Marianas]], and the [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]] of the [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of [[Palau]] in Micronesia.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/12/fossils Pygmy human remains found on rock islands], Science | The Guardian</ref>\n\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Maori residents identifying solely as Maori. The Maori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Maori peoples were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Maori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\n\nA majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized out of a total population of 8 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title=Papua New Guinea country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country's Constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state. However, conflicts and disputes concerning land use and resource rights continue between indigenous groups, the government, and corporate entities.\n\n==Indigenous rights and other issues==\n{{Indigenous rights}}\n\n[[File:NZ delegation UN Forum on Indigenous Issues.jpg|thumb|left|alt=endorses Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, 2010|The New Zealand delegation, including [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] members, endorses the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] in 2010.]]\n\nIndigenous peoples confront a diverse range of concerns associated with their status and interaction with other cultural groups, as well as changes in their inhabited environment. Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.<ref>Bartholomew Dean and Jerome Levi (eds.) ''At the Risk of Being Heard: Indigenous Rights, Identity and Postcolonial States'' University of Michigan Press (2003)[https://web.archive.org/web/20060821225323/http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do;jsessionid=1ADB525E82D520F3CE8B1393F0EAA914?id=11605]</ref>  These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, [[land rights]], ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.\n\nThe interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed [[First contact (anthropology)|''first contact'']], the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\n\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia. In Australia, a landmark case, ''Mabo'' v ''Queensland'' (No 2),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/1991/23.pdf|title=Mabo v Queensland|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of {{Lang|la|terra nullius}}. This rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practised by the Meriam people.\n\nA 2009 United Nations publication says \"''Although indigenous peoples are often portrayed as a hindrance to development, their cultures and traditional knowledge are also increasingly seen as assets. It is argued that it is important for the human species as a whole to preserve as wide a range of [[cultural diversity]] as possible, and that the protection of indigenous cultures is vital to this enterprise.\"''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Human rights violations===\n\nThe Bangladesh Government has stated that there are \"no indigenous peoples in Bangladesh.\"<ref name=\"Shafiq\">[http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=198775&cid=3 No 'indigenous', reiterates Shafique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319055434/http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=198775&cid=3 |date=19 March 2012 }}. bdnews24.com (18 June 2011).

Some philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588-1679), considered indigenous people to be merely \"savages\". Others (especially literary figures in the 18th century) popularised the concept of \"[[noble savage]]s\". Those who were close to the Hobbesian view tended to believe themselves to have a duty to \"civilize\" and \"modernize\" the indigenous.

Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region.<ref name=\":1\" /> Not all indigenous peoples share this characteristic, as many have adopted substantial elements of a colonizing culture, such as dress, religion or language. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given region ([[Sedentism|sedentary]]) or exhibit a [[nomadic]] lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend.

Indigenous people also include people indigenous based on their descent from populations that inhabited the country when non-indigenous religions and cultures arrived\u2014or at the establishment of present state boundaries\u2014who retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions, but who may have been displaced from their traditional domains or who may have resettled outside their ancestral domains.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe status of the indigenous groups in the subjugated relationship can be characterized in most instances as an effectively marginalized or isolated in comparison to majority groups or the nation-state as a whole. Their ability to influence and participate in the external policies that may exercise [[jurisdiction]] over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and [[land rights]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the [[Ainu people#Litigation|Ainu people]] of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in law, stating that \"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\"<ref>Judgment of the Sapporo District Court, Civil Division No. 3, 27 March 1997, in (1999) 38 ILM, p. 419</ref>\n\nIn Russia, definition of \"indigenous peoples\" is contested largely referring to a number of population (less than 50 000 people), and neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and cultural institutions.<ref>IWGIA (2012).

These constraints can be observed even when the indigenous society is regulated largely by its own tradition and custom.

These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the [[Aegean Sea]] before the subsequent migrations of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Herodotus]] give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \"foreigners\", termed \"[[barbarian]]s\" by the historical Greeks).\n\n[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] society flourished between 250&nbsp;BCE and 480&nbsp;CE and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of [[classical antiquity]] had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.<ref>Hall, Gillette, and Harry Anthony Patrinos. Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Human Development in Latin America. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, n.d. Google Scholar. Web. 11 Mar. 2013</ref>\n\nHowever, when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, and this expansion became a forerunner of what was to take the Americas, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific by storm in more recent times. Thus, the idea that expansionist societies may encounter peoples who possess cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power was not new to the [[Renaissance]] or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured [[Guanches|Guanche]] kings of [[Tenerife]] to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].]]\n\n===European expansion and colonialism===\n{{See also|Columbian exchange}}\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onward had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The [[Age of Discovery|exploratory]] and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\n\nEncounters between explorers and indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, [[smallpox]], [[measles]], malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America and Australia.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] had an indigenous population called the [[Guanches]] whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124301/http://ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html |date=13 October 2007 }}.

The United Nations estimates that there are over 370 million indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf|title=Who are indigenous peoples?|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> This would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total [[world population]].

Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\n\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \"traditional\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.

The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\n\n===Africa===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of Africa}}[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|Starting fire by hand, [[San people]] in Botswana.]]\nIn the post-colonial period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] or [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\n\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\n\n===Americas===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\nThe impact of [[European colonization of the Americas]] on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\n\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population \u2014 in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as ''pueblos [[wikt:ind\u00edgena|ind\u00edgenas]]'', ''amerindios'', ''povos nativos'', ''povos ind\u00edgenas'', and, in Peru, ''Comunidades Nativas'' (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the [[Urarina]]<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> and [[Mats\u00e9s]].

These groups are often together spoken of as [[Indigenous Australians]].\n\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by [[Polynesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the [[Chamorros]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Marianas]], and the [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]] of the [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of [[Palau]] in Micronesia.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/12/fossils Pygmy human remains found on rock islands], Science | The Guardian</ref>\n\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Maori residents identifying solely as Maori. The Maori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Maori peoples were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Maori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\n\nA majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized out of a total population of 8 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title=Papua New Guinea country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country's Constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state.

Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.<ref>Bartholomew Dean and Jerome Levi (eds.) ''At the Risk of Being Heard: Indigenous Rights, Identity and Postcolonial States'' University of Michigan Press (2003)[https://web.archive.org/web/20060821225323/http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do;jsessionid=1ADB525E82D520F3CE8B1393F0EAA914?id=11605]</ref>  These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, [[land rights]], ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.\n\nThe interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed [[First contact (anthropology)|''first contact'']], the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\n\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia.

Kerala's style of architecture is unique in India, in its striking contrast to [[Dravidian architecture]] which is normally practiced in other parts of [[South India]]. The architecture of Kerala has been influenced by Dravidian and Indian Vedic architectural science ([[Vastu Shastra]]) over two millennia. The Tantrasamuchaya, Thachu-Shastra, [[Manushyalaya Chandrika|Manushyalaya-Chandrika]] and Silparatna are important architectural sciences, which have had a strong impact in Kerala Architecture style. The Manushyalaya-Chandrika, a work devoted to domestic architecture is one such science which has its strong roots in Kerala.\n\nThe architectural style has evolved from Kerala's peculiar climate and long history of influences of its major maritime trading partners like Chinese, Arabs and Europeans.\n[[File:British Residency in Kollam city, Mar 2017.jpg|thumb|right|[[British Residency]] in [[Kollam]] - It is a splendid two-storeyed Palace built by [[John Munro, 9th of Teaninich|Col. John Munro]] between 1811 and 1819. It is a blend of [[Europe]]an-[[India]]n-[[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] architectural styles]]\n\n== Origins ==\nThe characteristic regional expression of Kerala architecture results from the geographical, climatic and historic factors. Geographically Kerala is a narrow strip of land lying in between western seaboard of peninsular India and confined between the towering [[Western Ghats]] on its east and the vast [[Arabian sea]] on its west. Favoured by plentiful rains due to [[Monsoon]] and bright sunshines, this land is lush green with vegetation and rich in animal life. In the uneven terrain of this region human habitation is distributed thickly in the fertile low-lands and sparsely towards the hostile highlands. Heavy rains have brought in presence of large water bodies in form of lakes, rivers, [[Kerala backwaters|backwaters]] and lagoons. The climatic factors thus made its significant contributions in developing the architecture style, to counter wettest climatic conditions coupled with heavy humidity and harsh tropical summers.\n\nHistory also played its own contributions to the Kerala architecture. The towering Western Ghats on its east, has successfully prevented influences of neighboring [[Tamil people|Tamil]] countries into present day Kerala in later times. While Western Ghats isolated Kerala to a greater extent from Indian empires, the exposure of [[Arabian sea]] on its east brought in close contacts between the ancient people of Kerala with major maritime civilizations like [[China|Chinese]], Egyptians, [[History of Rome|Romans]], Arabs etc. The Kerala's rich spice cultivations brought it center of global maritime trade until modern periods, helping several international powers to actively engage with Kerala as a trading partners. This helped in bring in influences of these civilisations into Kerala architecture.<ref>https://nitc.academia.edu/BPhilip/Papers/374480/TRADITIONAL_KERALA_ARCHITECTURE</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-historic era ===\nThe locational feature of Kerala has influenced the social development and indirectly the style of construction. In the ancient times the Arabian sea and the Ghats formed impenetrable barriers helping the evolution of an isolated culture of Proto-Dravidians, contemporary to the [[Harappa|Harappan civilisation]]. The earliest vestiges of constructions in Kerala belong to this period dated between 3000 B.C. to 300 B.C. They can be grouped into two types \u2013 tomb cells and [[megalith]]s. The rock cut tomb cells are generally located in the laterite zones of central Kerala, for example at Porkalam, [[Thrissur district]]. The tombs are roughly oblong in plan with single or multiple bed chambers with a rectangular court in the east from where steps rise to the ground level. Another type of burial chamber is made of four slabs placed on edges and a fifth one covering them as a cap stone. One or more such dolmens are marked by a stone circle. Among the megaliths are the umbrella stones (\"kudakkal\"), resembling handless palm leaf umbrellas used for covering pits enclosing burial urns. Two other types of megaliths, hat stones (\"thoppikkal\") and menhirs (\"pulachikkal\") however have no burial appendages. They appear to be rather memorial stones.\n\nThe megaliths are not of much architectural significance, but they speak of the custom of the primitive tribes erecting memorials at sites of mortuary rites. These places later became the annual meeting grounds of the tribes and gave rise to occult temples of ancestral worship. While the custom of father worship can be seen in these cases, the protecting deities of the villages were always in female form, who were worshiped in open groves (\"kavu\"). These hypaethral temples had trees, stone symbols of Mother Goddesses or other naturalistic or animistic image as objects of worship. The continuity of this early culture is seen in the folk arts, cult rituals, worship of trees, serpents and mother images in kavus.\n\n=== Influence of Buddhism and early Tamilakam architecture ===\n[[File:Chottanikkara Temple.jpg|thumb|right|The Chuttuambalam Pavilion at [[Chottanikkara Temple]] built in classical style]]\n{{see also|Tamil Buddhism}}\nThe nature worship of the early inhabitants of Kerala has its parallel in serpent worship and Buddhism, in the tree worship owing to the association of Buddha's birth, revelation and preaching under a tree. This rose in parallel to the developments in the other areas of [[Tamilakam]] during the latter stages of the [[Sangam period]]. Although sculptural relics of Buddhist images have been recovered from a few places of southern Kerala, there are, however, no extant Buddhist monuments in this region. But literary references such as the 3rd century Tamil epic Manimekhalai and Mushika vamsa, a Sanskrit epic of the eleventh century suggest the fact that Kerala had important Buddhist shrines. The most renowned of these was the Sreemulavasa vihara with a magnificent image of Bodhisatwa Lokanatha. This shrine is believed to have been washed away by coastal erosion. In their design features some of the temples such as Siva temple at Thrissur and the Bhagavathi temple at Kodungallur are believed to be Buddhist viharas; but there is no irrefutable proof for such beliefs.\n\nThe Jain monuments are more numerous in [[Jainism in Kerala|Kerala]]. They include rock shelters at [[Chitral Jain cave]] near Nagercoil, a rock cut temple at Kallil near Perumbavoor, and remains of structural temples at Alathoor near Palakkad and at Sultanbathery. [[Jainimedu Jain temple]] is a 15th-century [[Jain temple]] located at Jainimedu, 3&nbsp;km from the centre of [[Palakkad]].<ref name=\"indiatimes1\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-05-12/india/39202799_1_temple-walls-temple-sources-diamond-merchants |title=15th-century Jain temple in Kerala to be reopened|work=The Times of India|date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref> Sculptured Kerala Jaina and Dravidian figures of Mahavira, Parswanatha and other thirthankaras have been recovered from these sites.

The circular temples basically follow the shapes of the Buddhist stupas, the dome shaped mounds. The apsidal temples are modelled in the pattern of chaitya halls, the assembly halls of Buddhist monks. The chaitya window seen repeated in the decorative moulding of the thorana around the temple shrine is clearly a Buddhist motif adopted in Hindu style, according to [[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]]. Basically thorana is a gateway provided in the palisade seen in the vertical and horizontal members of the vilakkumadam, which is a feature seen only in Kerala temples of the post-Buddhist period. In its most primitive form this construction is seen in the hypaethral temples enshrining trees and later on the outer walls of the shrines proper. With the stylistic development of the Hindu temple this form of palisade is removed from the shrine structure (srikovil) and taken as a separate edifice beyond the temple cloister (chuttambalam).\n[[File:Kottarakkara Temple(HighResoluion).jpg|thumb|right|The single-storeyed temple complex at [[Kottarakkara]] in [[Kollam]]]]\n\n=== Hindu Influence ===\n[[File:TVM aps temple.jpg|thumb|right|The ornate multi-storeyed [[Gopuram]] of the Dravidian Kovil of Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram]]\nHinduism was co-existent with the indigenous Dravidian cultural and social practices of Kerala. Early Tamil [[Sangam literature]] says that by the First century A.D. the Cheras all of present-day Kerala, parts of [[Tulunadu]] and Kodagu, and the Kongu lands (present Salem and Coimbatore region). It had multiple capitals simultaneously administered by different lineages of the Family, its main capital being Vanchi, identified with the Thiruvanchikulam near Kodungallur. At this time, the two extremities of the Kerala region were administered by two Velir families. The southernmost part administered by the [[Ay Kingdom|Ay]] chieftains of Thiruvananthapuram and the northernmost parts by the [[Mushika Kingdom|Nannans of Ezhilmalai]]. The Nannan line was a branch of the Ay originating in the Thiruvananthapuram area and both were representatives (or vassals) under the suzerainty of the Cheras (and sometimes the Pandyas or Cholas or Pallavas). Brahmanas appeared to have settled in Kerala and established [[Hinduism]]. The amalgamation of different cultures and religious philosophies helped to evolve the architectural styles of Kerala temples.  This was highly conducive of architectural development and renovation of a large number of temples. After the decline of the Cheras several small principalities developed all over Kerala. By fifteenth century, Kerala was broadly covered by the suzerainty of four principal chieftains \u2013 Venad rulers in the south, Kochi Maharajas in the centre, Zamorins of Kozhikode in the north and Kolathiri Rajas in the extreme north. They were rulers who patronised architectural activities. It was this period, Kerala Architecture started shaping its own distinctive style. A regional character in construction incorporating the Dravidian craft skills, unique forms of Buddhist buildings, design concepts of [[vedic]] times and canonical theories of [[Hindu]] [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] practices in locally available materials and suited to the climatic conditions was finally evolved in Kerala. The theory and practice of architectural construction were also compiled during this period.\n\nTheir compilations remain as classical texts of a living tradition to this day. Four important books in this area are;\n\n* '''Thantrasamuchayam''' (Chennas Narayanan Namboodiri) and '''Silpiratnam''' (Sreekumara), covering temple architecture\n* '''Vastuvidya''' (anon.) and '''Manushyalaya Chandrika''' (Thirumangalathu Sri Neelakandan), dealing with the domestic architecture. A number of minor works in Sanskrit, Manipravalam and refined Malayalam, all based on the above texts have found popularity in Kerala with the craftsmen and professionals related with the subject.\n\nKerala is referred as one of the border kingdoms of the Maurya empire. It is possible that Buddhists and Jainas were the first north Indian groups to cross the borders of Kerala and establish their monasteries. These religious groups were able to practise their faith and receive patronage from the local kings to build shrines and viharas. For nearly eight centuries Buddhism and Jainism seem to have co-existed in Kerala as an important faith, contributing in its own way to the social and architectural development of the region.\n\n== Composition and structure ==\n[[File:Kanakakkunnu Palace DSW.jpg|300px|thumb|A full view of [[Kanakakkunnu Palace]] at [[Thiruvananthapuram]]]]\nKerala architecture can be broadly divided into 2 distinctive areas based on their functionality, each guided by different set of principles;\n[[File:Padmanabhapuram Palace, roof works.jpg|thumb|right|The gabled roof and ceiling works are the prime feature of Kerala architectural style]]\n* '''Religious Architecture''', primarily patronised by [[temples of Kerala]] as well as several old churches, mosques etc.\n* '''Domestic Architecture''', primarily seen in most of the residential houses. There are distinctively styles in this area, as Palaces and large mansions of feudal lords different from houses of commoners and also marked difference exists between religious communities.\n[[File:VadakkumnathanTemple.JPG|thumb|right|The circular roofs of temples are direct legacy of Buddhist influences in Ancient Kerala Architectural styles]]\n\n=== Composition ===\n\nThe primary elements of all structures trends to remain same. The base model is normally circular, square or rectangular plain shapes with a ribbed roof evolved from functional consideration. The most distinctive visual form of Kerala architecture is the long, steep sloping roof built to protect the house's walls and to withstand the heavy monsoon, normally laid with tiles or thatched labyrinth of palm leaves, supported on a roof frame made of hard wood and timber. Structurally the roof frame was supported on the pillars on walls erected on a plinth raised from the ground for protection against dampness and insects in the tropical climate. Often the walls were also of timbers abundantly available in Kerala. Gable windows were evolved at the two ends to provide attic ventilation when ceiling was incorporated for the room spaces.\n[[File:Koothambalam at Kerala Kalamandalam.jpg|thumb|right|Most of Kerala buildings appears to low height visually, due to over-sloping of roofs, which are meant to protect walls from rains and direct sun shine]]\nThe belief system of [[Vastu]] plays a very important role in developing architecture styles. The basic underlying belief is that, every structure built on earth has its own life, with a soul and personality which is shaped by its surroundings. The most important science which has Kerala has developed purely indigenously is Thachu-Shastra (Science of Carpentry) as the easily availability of timber and its heavy use of it. The concept of Thachu underlines that as timber is derived from a living form, the wood, when used for construction, has its own life which must be synthesised in harmony with its surroundings and people whom dwell inside it.\n\n=== Materials ===\nThe natural building materials available for construction in Kerala are stones, timber, clay and palm leaves. Granite is a strong and durable building stone; however its availability is restricted mostly to the highlands and only marginally to other zones. Owing to this, the skill in quarrying, dressing and sculpturing of stone is scarce in Kerala. Laterite on the other hand is the most abundant stone found as outcrops in most zones. Soft laterite available at shallow depth can be easily cut, dressed and used as building blocks. It is a rare local stone which gets stronger and durable with exposure at atmospheric air. Laterite blocks may be bonded in mortars of shell lime, which have been the classic binding material used in traditional buildings. Lime mortar can be improved in strength and performance by admixtures of vegetable juices. Such enriched mortars were used for plastering or for serving as the base for mural painting and low relief work. Timber is the prime structural material abundantly available in many varieties in Kerala \u2013 from bamboo to teak. Perhaps the skilful choice of timber, accurate joinery, artful assembly and delicate carving of wood work for columns, walls and roofs frames are the unique characteristics of Kerala architecture. Clay was used in many forms \u2013 for walling, in filling the timber floors and making bricks and tiles after [[pug mill|pugging]] and tempering with admixtures. Palm leaves were used effectively for thatching the roofs and for making partition walls.\n[[File:Wood carvings on the ceiling and a hanging oillamp.jpg|thumb|The typical wood carvings made on ceilings of Sree Padmanabhapuram Palace]]\nFrom the limitations of the materials, a mixed mode of construction was evolved in Kerala architecture. The stone work was restricted to the plinth even in important buildings such as temples. Laterite was used for walls. The roof structure in timber was covered with palm leaf thatching for most buildings and rarely with tiles for palaces or temples. The exterior of the laterite walls were either left as such or plastered with lime mortar to serve as the base for mural painting. The sculpturing of the stone was mainly moulding in horizontal bands in the plinth portion (adhistans) whereas the carving of timber covered all elements _ pillars, beams, ceiling, rafters and the supporting brackets. The Kerala murals are paintings with vegetable dyes on wet walls in subdued shades of brown. The indigenous adoption of the available raw materials and their transformation as enduring media for architectural expression thus became the dominant feature of the Kerala style.\n\n== Structure ==\nStructure wise, there can be two major classifications having its own specialities.\n\n=== Religious architecture ===\n\n==== Temple architecture ====\n[[File:Madhurtemple.jpg|thumb|[[Madhur Temple]], [[Kasaragod]], Kerala]]\nThe variety of temples, numbering more than 2000 dotting the Kerala state has no match with any other regions of India. The temples of Kerala highly developed in strict accordance to two temple construction thesis, Thantra-Samuchayam and Sliparatnam. While the former deals in developing structures that regulates [[Energy (esotericism)|energy flows]] so that positive energy flows in, while negative energy do not trend to remain retarded within the structure; whereas the latter deals in developing stone and timber architecture in such manner that each carved structure imbibe a life and personality of its own.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.keralahistory.ac.in/keralaarchitecture.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082519/http://www.keralahistory.ac.in/keralaarchitecture.htm |archive-date=2011-07-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kerala temple layout.jpg|thumb|250px|The standard layout of Kerala temple.]]\n\n===== Elements and features of Kerala Temple =====\n\n* '''Sri-Kovil'''\n\n[[File:Tkm1.jpg|thumb|right|The circular Sreekovil style of Kerala temples]]\nThe inner sanctum sanctorum where the idol of presiding deity is installed and worshiped. It shall be an independent structure, detached from other buildings with no connections and having its own roof shared with none. The Sri-kovil does not have any windows and have only one large door opening mostly towards east (sometimes it happens towards west, whereas a few temples have north facing door as its specialty, while no temples will have a south facing door).\n\nThe Srikovil may be built in different plan shapes \u2013 square, rectangular, circular or apsidal. Of these the square plan shows an even distribution throughout Kerala state. The square shape is basically the form of the vedic fire altar and strongly suggest the vedic mooring. It is categorised as the nagara style of temple in the architecutural texts. The rectangular plan is favoured for the Ananthasai Vishnu (Lord Vishnu in reclining posture) and the Sapta matrikas (Seven Mother Goddesses). The circular plan and the apsidal plan are rare in other parts of India and unknown even in the civil architecture of Kerala, but they constitute an important group of temples. The circular plan shows a greater preponderance in the southern part of Kerala, in regions once under the influence of Buddhism. The apsidal plan is a combination of the semi-circle and the square and it is seen distributed sporadically all over the coastal region. The circular temples belong to the vasara category. A variation of circle-elipse is also seen as an exception in the Siva shrine at Vaikkom. Polygonal shapes belonging to the Dravida category are also adopted rarely in temple plans but they find use as a feature of shikhara. As per the Thantrasamuchayam, every Sreekovil should be built either neutral or even sided.\nFor the unitary temples, the overall height is taken as 13/7/ to 2 1/8 of the width of the shrine, and categorised into 5 classes as i.e.; ''santhika, purshtika, yayada, achudha and savakamika'' \u2013 with increasing height of the temple form. The total height is basically divided into two-halves. The lower half consists of the basement, the pillar or the wall (stambha or bhithi) and the entablature (prasthara) in the ratio 1:2:1, in height. Similarly the upper half is divided into the neck (griva), the roof tower (shikhara) and the fonial (Kalasham) in the same ratio. The adisthana or foundation is generally in granite but the superstructure is built in laterite. The roofings will be of normally taller than other temple structures.  The structural roof of the shrine is constructed as the corbelled dome of masonry; however in order to protect it from the vagaries of climate it was superposed by a functional roof, made of timber frame covered by planks and tiles. This sloping roof with its projecting caves gave the characteristic form to the Kerala temple. The fenial or Kalasham, made of copper, provided the crowning spire denoting the focus of the shrine wherein the idol was installed.\n[[File:Kotimaram.jpg|thumb|right|The flag post normally seen in all Kerala Temples]]\nNormally the Srikovil is on a raised platform and has a flight or 3 or 5 steps to be. The steps are called Sopanapadi and on sides of the Sopanapadi, two large statues known as Dwarapalakas (Door Guards) are craved to guard the deity. As per Kerala rituals style, only main priest (Thantri) and second priest (Melshanti) only allowed to enter into Sri-kovil.\n\n* '''Namaskara Mandapam'''\n\nThe namaskara mandapa is a square shaped pavilion with a raised platform, a set of pillars and a pyramidal roof. The size of the mandapa is decided by the width of the shrine cell. The pavilion in its simplest form has four corner pillars; but larger pavilions are provided with two sets of pillars; four inside and twelve outside. Pavilions of circular, elliptical and polygonal shapes are mentioned in the texts, but they are not seen in Kerala temples. The Mandapams are used to conducting Vedic-Thantric rites.\n\n* '''Nalambalam'''\n\n[[File:Peruvanam-temple-b.jpg|thumb|right|The outer grounds of Temple, called Chuttuambalam]]\nThe shrine and the mandapa building are enclosed in a rectangular structure called the nalambalam. Functionally the rear and side halls of the nalambalam serves for various activities related to the ritualistic worship. The front hall is pierced with the entry, dividing it into two parts. These two halls; Agrasalas which used for feeding Brahmans, performing yagas and while Koothuambalam are used for staging temple arts such as koothu and temple murals. In few cases, Koothuambalams are separated as an individual structure outside Nalambalam.\n\n* '''Balithara'''\n\n[[File:0507-Kodimaram2.jpg|thumb|right|The Dwajasthampam or flag post of temple, in Chuttuambalam]]\nAt the entrance of Nalambalam, a square shaped raised stone altar called as Balithara can be seen. This altar is used to make ritualistic offerings to demi-gods and other spirits. Inside the Nalambalam, several small stones, called Balikallukal can be seen, meant for same purpose.\n\n*  '''Chuttuambalam'''\n\n[[File:Varikkasseri Gopuram.jpg|thumb|right|The Goppuram or Gatehouse]]\nThe outer structure within the temple walls, is known as Chuttuambalam. Normally Chuttuambalam has main pavilion known as Mukha-Mandapam or Thala-mandapam. The Mukha-Mandapam will have the Dwajastambam (Sacred Flag-post) in center of it and has several pillars supporting mandapam. The temple is now fully enclosed in a massive wall (Kshetra-Madillukal) pierced with gate houses or gopurams. The gopuram is usually two-storeyed, which served two purposes. The ground floor was an open space generally used as a platform for temple dances such as kurathy dance or ottan thullal during festivals. The upper floor with wooden trails covering the sides functioned as a kottupura _ (a hall for drums beating). The Chuttuambalam will normally has 4 gates from outside to entrance at all sides. A stone paved walk-way will be seen around the Chuttuambalam to allow devotees circulate around the temple, which for some large temples are covered with roof supported with massive pillars on both sides. The Chuttuambalam will have Dwajavillakku or giant lamp-posts in several places, mostly in Mukha-mandapams.\n\n* '''Ambala-Kulam'''\n[[File:Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple.JPG|thumb|right|The temple pond or Ambala-Kulam at Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple]]\nEvery temple will have a sacred temple pond or water lake located within temple complex. As per Vastu-rules, water is considered as source of positive energy and synthesis balance of all energies. Hence a temple pond or Ambala Kulam will be made available within the temple complex. The temple pond is normally used only by priests as holy bath before start of rituals as well as for various sacred rituals within the temple. In few cases, a separate pond will be constructed to allow devotees to bath before entering in temple. Today several temples have Mani-Kenar or Holy Well within the Nalambalam complex to get sacred waters for purposes of Abisekham.\n\n* '''Thevarapura'''\n[[File:Koothambalam at Koodal Maanikka Temple.JPG|thumb|right|Koothuambalams are prime venues for conduct of temple dances and other art forms. The height of Koothuambalam's roof are much similar to Pyramids, makes it more majestic and gives a distant feeling from temple]]\nNormally within Nalambalam, a separate complex will be constructed for cooking foods meant to serve for the deity and distribution among devotees as holy prasadam. Such complexes are called Thevarapura, where the holy fire or [[Agni]] is invoked.\n\n===== Phases of evolution =====\nIn its stylistic development, the temple architecture can be divided into three phases.\n[[File:Paliam naalukettu.jpg|thumb|right|The Nalukettu complex]]\n[[File:Theyyam Kovil lighting lady.jpg| thumb|250px|right|A ''Madappura'' (stand alone Kovil) from North Kerala where [[Theyyam]] rituals are performed seasonally. Noted for its stand alone, singular, tile roofed structure. All the Muthappan Madappura's are structured in similar style. These structures are found mainly in [[North Malabar]] region of Kerala ]]\nThe first phase is that of rock-cut temples. This earliest form is contemporary to Buddhist cave temples. Rock-cut temples are mainly located in southern Kerala\u2014at Vizhinjam and Ayirurpara near Tiruvananthapuram, Kottukal near Kollam and Kaviyoor near Alappuzha. Of these the one at Kaviyoor is the best example. The Kaviyoor cave temple dedicated to Siva comprises a shrine room and a spacious [[ardhamandapa]] arranged axially facing the west. On the pillared facade as well as on the walls inside the ardhamandapa are sculptured reliefs of the donor, a bearded rishi, a seated four armed Ganesh and dwarapalas. The other cave temples also have this general pattern of a shrine and an ante-room and they are associated with Siva worship. In the north similar rock-cut temples of saiva cult are seen at Trikkur and Irunilamkode in Trissoor district. Historically the cave architecture in India begins with Buddhism and the technique of rock-cut architecture in Kerala seems to be a continuation of similar works in Tamil Nadu under the Pandyas. The rock-cut temples are all dated prior to the eighth century A.D.\n\nThe structural temples appear in the second phase spanning the eighth to tenth centuries, and patronised by the Chera, Ay and Mushika chieftains. The earliest temples had a unitary shrine or a srikovil. In rare cases a porch or ardhamandapa is seen attached to the shrine. A detached namaskara mandapa is generally built in front of the srikovil. A quadrangular building, nalambalam that encloses the srikovil, the namaskara mandapa, balikkal (altar stones) etc. became part of this basic plan composition of the Kerala temple started emerging in this phase.\n\nThe middle phase of the evolution of the temples is characterised by the emergence of the sandhara shrine. In the unitary shrine of the earlier type, Nirendhara (single level of srikovil), there is a cell with a single doorway to the cell. But in the sandhara shrine the cell has twin wells leaving a passage in between them. Also there are often four functional doors on all the four cardinal directions and pierced windows to provide subdued light in the passage. Sometimes the functional door on the sides and the rear are replaced by pseudo doors.\n\nThe concept of the storeyed temple is also seen in this phase. The tower of the shrine rises to the second storey with a separate upper roof forming a dwitala (two-storeyed) temple. There is a unique example of thrithala (three-storeyed temple) is at Shiva shrine at Peruvanam with lower two storeys of square plan and the third storey of octagonal form.\n\nIn the last phase, (1300\u20131800 A.D.) the stylistic development reached its apogee with greater complexity in the temple layout and elaboration of detail. The vilakkumadam, the palisade structure fixed with rows of oil lamps is added beyond the nalambalam as an outer ring. The Altar stone is also housed in a pillared structure, the Balikkal mandapam in front of the agrasala (valiyambalam). A deepastambham and dwajasthambham (the lamp post and flag mast) are added in front of the balikkal mandapam.\n\nWithin the prakara but beyond the vilakkumadam, stood the secondary shrines of parivara devathas (sub-gods) in their assigned positions. These were unitary cells, in general, though in a few cases each became a full-fledged shrine as in the case of Krishna shrine in the Siva temple at Tali, Kozhikode. The last phase culminated in the concept of the composite shrines. Herein two or three shrines of equal importance are seen cloistered inside a common nalambalam. The typical example of this is the Vadakkumnatha temple at Trissoor, where in three shrines dedicated to Siva, Rama and Sankaranarayana are located inside the nalambalam. The prakara may also contain temple tanks, vedapadhasalas and dining halls. Paradoxically some shrines have not a single secondary shrine, the unique example being the Bharatha shrine at Irinjalakuda.\n\nA significant feature of big temple complexes is the presence of a theatre hall known as Koothambalam, meant for dance, musical performance and religious recitals. This is a unique edifice of Kerala architecture, distinct from the natyasabha or natyamandir seen in north Indian temples of this period. Koothambalam is a large pillared hall with a high roof. Inside the hall is a stage structure called as Rangamandapam for the performances. The stage as well as the pillars are ornately decorated. Visual and acoustic considerations are incorporated in the layout of the pillars and construction details so that the performances can be enjoyed by the spectators without discomfort and distortion. The Koothambalam design seems to have been based on the canons given in the Natyasastra of Bharata Muni.\n\nIn the southernmost Kerala, the temple architecture was also influenced by the developments in Tamil Nadu. At Sucheendram and Tiruvananthapuram this influence is clearly seen. Herein lofty enclosures, sculptured corridors and ornate mandapas all in granite stone practically conceal the view of the original main shrine in typical Kerala style. The entrance tower, Gopuram also rises to lofty heights in a style distinct from that of the humble two-storeyed structure seen elsewhere.\n\nTechnically the most important feature of the temple architecture of Kerala is the construction technique using a dimensional standardisation. The nucleus of the temple plan is the shrine containing the garbhagrhiha cell. The width of this cell is the basic module of the dimensional system. In plan composition, the width of the shrine, the open space around it, the position and sizes of the surrounding structures, are all related to the standard module. In vertical composition, this dimensional co-ordination is carried right up to the minute construction details such as the size of the pillars, wall plates, rafters etc. The canonical rules of the proportionate system are given in the treatises and preserved by the skilled craftsmen. This proportionate system has ensured uniformity in architectural style irrespective of the geographical distribution and scale of construction.\n\nTemple architecture is a synthesis of engineering and decorative arts. The decorative elements of the Kerala temples are of three types \u2013 mouldings, sculptures and painting. The moulding is typically seen in the plinth where in horizontal hands of circular and rectangular projections and recesses in varying proportions help to emphasize the form of the adisthana. Occasionally this plinth is raised over a secondary platform \u2013 upapeedam \u2013 with similar treatment. Mouldings are also seen in the mandapam, the hand rails of the steps (sopanam) and even in the drain channel ([[pranala]]) or the shrine cell.\n\nThe sculptural work is of two types. One category is the low relief done on the outer walls of the shrine with masonry set in lime mortar and finished with plaster and painting. The second is the sculpturing of the timber elements \u2013 the rafter ends, the brackets, the timber columns and their capitals, door frames, wall plates and beams. Decorative sculptural work is seen best in the ceiling panels of the mandapas. Exquisite lacquer work in brick red and black colour was adopted for turned columns of timber. Metal craft was also used in sculpturing idols, motifs, cladding and finials. All sculptural works were done strictly according to the canons of proportions (ashtathala, navathala and dasathala system) applicable to different figures of men, gods and goddesses, prescribed in texts.\n\nThe painting was executed in organic pigments on walls when the plaster was still wet \u2013 in soft subdued colours, making them into a class designated as Kerala murals. The theme of these paintings is invariably mythological and the epic stories unfold as one [[circumambulation|circumambulates]] around the temple. The moulding, sculpture and painting are also taken in vertical compositions to emphasise the different storey heights, projecting dormer windows which break the sloping roof and the crowning finial. But in all cases the decoration is secondary to the structural form. The sculptured walls are protected by the projecting caves which keep them in shade in sharp contrast with the bright sunlit exterior. This helps to impart the overall perceptual experience of light and shade revealing details only gradually to a keen observer.\n\n==== Islamic architecture ====\n{{Split section|date=March 2020 |Kerala Islamic architecture}}\n[[File:Mithqalpalli Mosque - Kozhikode - Kerala 02.JPG|thumb|300px|right| The Mithqalpalli in Kozhikode is a classic example of Kerala's native Mosque style with gabled roofs, sloped wooden window panels and without minarets]]\n\nThe [[Arabian Peninsula]], the cradle of [[Islam]] also had direct trade contact with [[Kerala]] coast from very early times, as far as the time of [[Muhammad]] or even before. As local Muslim legends and tradition goes, a [[Chera dynasty|Chera King]] embraced [[Islam]] and made [[Hajj|a voyage to Mecca]]. In his return trip accompanied by many [[Sahabah|Islamic religious leaders]] including [[Malik ibn Dinar]], he fell sick and died. But he had given introductory letters for the party to proceed to [[Kodungallur]]. The visitors came to the port and handed over the letter to the reigning King who treated the guests with all respect and extended facilities to establish their faith in the land. The king arranged for the artisans to build the [[Cheraman Juma Masjid|first mosque at Kodungallur]] near the port and ear-marked the area around it for their settlement. The original mosque has undergone extensive repairs, but the traces of the original construction are seen in the plinth, the columns and the roof which are in the old traditional styles of [[Hindu temple]]s.\n[[File:ThazhathangadyJumaMasjid1.JPG|thumb|right|An example of traditional Kerala style of Mosque at Thazhathangady in Kottayam]]\nUndoubtedly Islam spread in [[Kerala]] through the migration of new groups from [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the gradual conversion of native population in the permissive and all accommodating Indian cultural ethos and social set up of Kerala. By twelfth century AD there were at least ten major settlements of Muslims distributed from [[Kollam]] in the south to [[Mangalore]] in the north each centered on the mosque. Also a branch of the ruling [[Ali Raja|kingdom at Arakkal]], [[Kannur]] was converted to Islam. The primacy in trade, the spread of the faith and the experience of the sea made [[Muslim]]s a prominent class and dear to the rulers, especially of the [[Zamorin|Kozhikode Zamorins]]. Consequently, by fifteenth century Islamic constructions reached considerable heights.\n[[File:Muchundi Mosque.JPG|thumb|right|Muchundi Mosque with classic Kerala styles]]\n\nThe mosque architecture of Kerala exhibits none of the features of the [[Islamic architecture|Arabic style]] nor those of the [[Indo-Islamic architecture]]s of the imperial or provincial school in north India. The reason for this is not far to seek. The work of mosque construction was done by the local Hindu artisans under instructions of the Muslim religious heads who wanted to erect the places of worship. The models for places of worship were only [[Hindu temple]]s or the theatre halls (\"koothambalam\") and these models are to be adapted for the new situations. The early mosques in Kerala consequently resemble the traditional building of the region. Arabic style of architecture was introduced to the Malabar area of present-day Kerala, during the period of occupation by Hyder Ali and later by Tipu Sultan during the eighteenth century. A large number of temples were converted to mosques during this period as evidenced by the traditional Kerala style of these structures.\n[[File:MiskalMosque.jpg|thumb|right|Miskal Mosque has three-storeyed gabled roofs with windows which offers an alternative to minarets in traditional Kerala style]]\n\nIn plan the mosque comprises a large [[Mosque#Prayer hall|prayer hall]] with a [[mihrab]] on the western wall (since [[Mecca]] is west to Kerala) and covered [[verandah]] all around. Generally it has a tall basement similar to the adhistana of the Brahmanical temple and often the columns are treated with square and octagonal section as in [[mandapa]] pillars. The walls are made of laterite blocks. The arch form is seen only in one exceptional case for the [[mosque at Ponnani]] and nowhere else in the early ten mosques of the land. Wood was used extensively in superstructure for the construction of ceiling and roof. The roof in many cases is covered with sheets of copper incorporating fenials in the ridge, completing the form of temple [[shikhara]] with the stupi. At [[Tanur, India|Tanur]] the Jama Masjid even has a gate built in the manner of temple gopuram, covered with copper sheeting. This mosque itself is a three-storeyed building with tiled roof crowned by five fenials.\n[[File:New cheraman masjid.jpg|thumb|right|The Cheraman Mosque, which is World's second and sub-continent's first mosque was originally built in Kerala style, which was renovated recently to give Arabic touch]]\nThe pulpit in the mosque present the best example of wood carvings associated with Islamic architecture of Kerala. The Jama Masjid at Beypore and Mithqal Mosque at Kozhikode have the pulpit (mimbar) built by the ship masters of the Arab vessels.\n[[File:Moulana Masjid, Kannur.jpg|thumb|right|The Kannur Mosque symbolises the slow transit from Kerala style to Persian style with additions of Minarets and other classical Persian features in traditional Kerala style]]\nAll other construction work was done by the same local craftsmen who were building the [[Hindu temple]]s and residences. The Arabic tradition of simplicity of plan had perhaps combined itself with the indigenous construction techniques giving rise to the unique style of mosque architecture, not found anywhere else in the world. In contrast the [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] drew its inspiration from the [[Ottoman architecture|Turkish]] and [[Iranian architecture|Persian tradition]]s and created highly ornamental style in the north India. The typical Kerala mosques are seen at Kollampalli, near [[Kollam]], Panthalayani near [[Koyilandy]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Tanur, India|Tanur]], [[Ponnani]] and [[Kasargode]] as well as in most old Muslim settlements. The austere architectural features of the old mosques are however in the process of being replaced in recent times by [[Islamic architecture]]. The use of [[Arch|arcuated]] [[Formwork|form]]s, [[dome]]s and [[minar]]-[[minaret]]s of the imperial school of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] are being projected as the visible symbols of [[Islamic culture]]. The [[Palayam Juma Masjid|Jama Masjid]] at [[Palayam, Thiruvananthapuram|Palayam]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]] is the classic example of this new trend. Similar structures are coming up all over [[Kerala]] in the modification of old mosques during the last decades.\n\nPerhaps the influence of [[Islamic architecture|Arabic style]] of Kerala construction is seen in a subtle manner in the secular architecture of Muslims. The bazar streets lined by buildings on both sides, the upper floor living rooms with view windows to the streets, the wooden screens used to provide privacy and shade in the [[verandah]]s (specially of upper floors) etc., are a few features superposed on the traditional construction. These built forms would have been modelled in the pattern of the houses in Arab countries (such as [[Egypt]], [[Basra]] (present day [[Iraq]]) and [[Iran]]) having contact with this region. This trend is most conspicuous in market towns such as [[Kozhikode]], [[Thalassery]], [[Kasaragode]] etc. But basically the Muslim domestic architectures at large follow the traditional Hindu styles. Both \"ekasalas\" and \"[[n\u0101lukettu]]s\" are seen adopted for this. These buildings with extensive alindams and [[verandah]]s are also seen generally surrounding the mosques in Muslim settlements.\n\n==== Church architecture ====\n{{Split section|date=March 2020 |Kerala church architecture}}\n[[File:Kadamattom St. George Church.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Kadamattom Malankara Syrian Church near Muvattupuzha, is one of the oldest churches in Kerala, built in pure Kerala style.]]\nThe evolution of the church architecture of Kerala springs from two sources \u2013 the first from the work of Apostle St. Thomas and the Syrian Christians and second from the missionary work of European settlers. The tradition has it that St. Thomas who landed in Muziris in 52 AD had seven churches built in Kerala at Kodungallur, Chayil, Palur, Paravur-Kottakkavu, Kollam, Niranom and Kothamangalam, but none of these Syrian churches are now extant. It is possible that some of the temples were adapted as Syrian churches for services by the population who got converted into Syriac Christianity by St. Thomas. For example, the present Palur Syrian church has preserved the abhisheka patra (the letter of intonation) and certain shaiva symbols as the relics of the old church which is said to have been a Hindu shrine adapted for Christian worship. \n[[File:Edathua Church sideView.jpg|thumb|right|A Syro-Malabar Church with a mixture of Portuguese and Kerala architecture.]]\nHistorical evidences suggest that the first wave of Christianity came from Edessa, Persia in the fourth century A.D. owing to the persecution of Syrian Christians in the Persian empire. According to the narration of Byzantine monk Cosmas, Kerala had many churches by sixth century A.D. According to the inscription of the times of Stanu Ravi by ninth century, Syrian Christian communities enjoyed many rights and privileges. They also played a vital role in trade and commerce. The domestic buildings of the Syrian Christians were akin to the native architecture.\n[[File:Chengannur 2.JPG|thumb|right|Syrian Christians have most their churches built in traditional Kerala style, resembling temples of Kerala. This Old Syrian church of Orthodox and Marthoma Syrian churches in Chengannur has been built in Kerala style with stone lamps, and is a testimony of assimilation of Kerala Christianity with native architecture.]]\nBut original Syrians who had migrated to Kerala had brought with them some of the West Asian conventions in church architecture. Consequently, churches with regular chancel and nave began to be built and there evolved a distinctive style of church architecture. The peculiar feature of this style was the ornamental gable facade at the nave end, surmounted by a cross. An entry porch (shala) in front of the nave was another feature of these early shrines. The baptistry was a small chamber inside the nave near the entrance. Belfries were built on one side of the nave, but in smaller churches the bell was hung in an opening in the nave gable.\n[[File:Kottakkavu St. Thomas Church, Paravur, Thrissur, Kerala, India.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Kottakkavu Mar Thoma Syro-Malabar Pilgrim Church, North Paravur|Kottakkavu Mar Thoma Syro-Malabar Roman Catholic Church, North Paravur]] is a mixture of Portuguese, Kerala and Dutch architecture]]\n\n===== Elements of Kerala church architecture =====\n[[File:Altar-Kanjoor Church.jpg|thumb|Altar-Kanjoor Church]]\nUnlike Kerala temples, there is no uniform or standard layout for all churches of Kerala. Rather most of churches have different set to architecture according to various sects and their traditions apart from experimentation of new designs. Still most of churches, particularly [[Saint Thomas Christian]] churches of Kerala, do share several common features.\n\nThe church had a gable roof extending to the chancel, the most sacred part of the church and the sacristy by its side. The tower over the chancel soared higher than the roof of the nave similar to the shikhara over the garbhagriha in a Hindu temple. The residence of the priest and the parish hall were located on one side of the church and the cemetery was on the other side.\n[[File:Archbishop's House, Changanassery, Kerala.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Syro-Malabar Archbishop's Palace at Changassery is built assimilating Dutch architecture with Kerala's native styles]]\nIn their external feature Syrian churches retained some of the indigenous features of the Hindu style. The church and the ancillary buildings were enclosed in a massive laterite wall.\n\nThere was an open cross in front of the main entrance on a granite basement in the model of balikkal, the altar stone. A church also had the flag mast, (the dwajastambha) in front. In the Orthodox Syrian church at Chengannur, Peter and Paul occupy the place of dwarapalas, the guarding deities of a Hindu shrine. Sometimes a gateway like the temple gopuram with a kottupura or music room on the upper storey was also provided. The Marth Mariam church at Kuravilangad, originally built in 345 A.D had undergone renovations several times. The church has a rich collection of old relics including an idol of Virgin Mary and a cross carved in granite. The Knanaya Valiapally of Kaduthuruthy is another old church with the biggest cross formed in a single granite piece. The Valiapally of Piravom is also another old church with old Persian writings.\n\nWood carving and mural paintings, the two decorative media of temples are seen to be adopted in ancient churches also. A famous piece of wooden carving is a large panel depicting the last supper in St. Thomas church, Mulanthuruthy. The All Saints church at Udayamperur has a beam resting on wooden mouldings of heads of elephants and rhinoceros. Floral figures, angels and apostles are the usual motifs of mural paintings. This form of decoration had continued in later churches as well. In St. Sebastian's church at Kanjoor a mural even depicts the fight between British and Tippu Sultan.\n[[File:Church Kerala white.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The assimilated Dutch style in Kerala architectural patterns]]\n\n===== Colonial influences in church architecture =====\n\nThe Portuguese were the first to introduce European styles in the church architecture of Kerala, followed by Dutch and British. The first church of this type in India was built by the Franciscan missionaries in 1510 A.D. at Fort Kochi. It is a small unpretentious building of the medieval Spanish type. When Vasco De Gama died in Kochi in 1524 his body was interned in this church and later removed to Lisbon in 1538. The church thus came to be known as Vasco De Gama's church. It was later seized by the Dutch and was used for reformed services. Later with British occupation of Kochi it became an Anglican church and presently it belongs to church of south India.\n\nThe Portuguese had introduced many innovations in the Kerala churches. For the first time, the dominating tower above the altar, which was the adaptation from temple architecture, was discarded. Inside the church, the granite images were not favoured owing to their association with the Hindu art; instead images of Saints made of wood were used to adorn the riches. Generally pulpits were erected and altar pieces were ornamented in an impressive manner. Ceilings and walls were painted with religious themes in the style of European masters. Pointed and rounded arches were introduced and stained glass windows were installed.\n\nThe subsequent development in church architecture in the British period also saw the introduction of a new church design. In place of the rectangular Basilican plan the cross shaped plan became increasingly popular especially in places where large congregation had to be accommodated. Apart from the obvious symbolism of the cross, this plan is more suited for better visibility of the altar from all points in the church. Further, sufficient space was now available at the transepts for additional altars for services by several priests on important occasions like Christmas.\n\nIn the external features the central tower or rather the Roman dome now comes at the centre of the transept imparting a classic form of European architecture. Also on either side of the main entrance in the front, rose towers to serve as belfries. In the treatment of the exterior, typical features of European church architecture were introduced \u2013 the Gothic arches, the pilasters and buttresses, the rounded openings, the classic mouldings and stained glass windows making the whole composition completely different from the native architecture. Depending on the period of construction, one can also distinguish between the churches done in the simplicity of Gothic style as in the Palayam church, Tiruvananthapuram, and the luxury of renaissance style as in the church of Our Lady of Dolorous at Trissoor.\n\n===== Modern trends in church architecture =====\n\nWhile the character of church architecture is generally identified with the form evolved in the medieval times, the modernistic trends in adapting new plan shapes and structural forms are visible in the Kerala scene as well. This circular plan shape with domical shell roof has been adopted in the Christ College church at Irinjalakkuda. The Cathedral church of Archbishop of Varapuzha at Ernakulam is a soaring hyperbolic paraboloid in reinforced concrete with a bold expression in sharp contrast with all traditional forms. Perhaps experimentation in religious architecture is mostly manifested in church architecture as compared to that in temples or mosques which more or less adhere to old evolved forms.\n\n==== Jewish architecture ====\nThe architectural scene of Kerala was influenced by many socio-cultural groups and religious thoughts from foreign lands. The sea board had promoted trade contacts with maritime nations such as Israel, Rome, Arabia and China even prior to the dawn of the Christian era. The trade contact would have paved the way of establishing settlements near the old port towns and gradually spreading in the interior. During the time of the second Chera Kingdom, the old port city of Makotai (Kodungallur) had different parts occupied by these groups. For example, the cultural contact of Jews with Kerala predates the time of Solomen and by fifteenth century there were Jewish settlements in Kodungallur, Kochi and other coastal towns. The most important Jewish settlement is seen at Kochi near the Mattancherry palace. Their residential buildings resemble the Kerala type in their external appearance; nevertheless they are of a different plan concept. The ground floor rooms are used as shops or warehouses and the living rooms are planned on the first floor. The frontage of the building about the streets and the sides are continuous with adjoining buildings in the pattern of the row houses. An important historic monument of the Jew town is the Synagogue. It is a simple tall structure with a sloping tile roof but it has a rich interior with hand painted tiles from Canton, China and ancient chandeliers from Europe. This religious structure built for worship according to Judaism stands in contrast with the temples of Hindus. Jewish community however did not influence the architecture of Kerala.\n\n=== Domestic architecture ===\n[[File:Chappamattam Tharavadu.jpg|thumb|right|Intricate wood carvings & chuttu verandah in Kerala architecture]]\n[[File:Padmanabhapuram Palace.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Sree Padmanabhapuram Palace represents the most classic Kerala domestic architecture. It is also the world's largest wooden palace made on sloping roofs, granite and rosewood-teak wood work combinations]]\nThe evolution of domestic architecture of Kerala followed closely the trend of development in temple architecture. The primitive models were huts made of bamboo frame thatched with leaves in circular, square or rectangular plain shapes. The rectangular shape with a hipped roof appears to have been finally evolved from functional consideration. Structurally the roof frame was supported on the pillars on walls erected on a plinth raised from the ground for protection against dampness and insects in the tropical climate. Often the walls were also of timbers abundantly available in the land. The roof frame consisted of the bressumer or wall plate which supported lower ends of the rafters, the upper ends being connected to the ridge. The weight of the rafters and the roof covering created a sage in the ridge when the ridge piece was made of flexible materials like bamboo. This sage however remained as the hall-mark of roof construction even when strong timber was used for the roof frame. Further gable windows were evolved at the two ends to provide attic ventilation when ceiling was incorporated for the room spaces. This ensured air circulation and thermal control for the roof. The lower ends of the rafters projected much beyond the walls to shade the walls from the sun and driving rain. The closed form of the Kerala houses was thus gradually evolved from technical considerations. One can see the striking similarity of this form with the temple structure. The plinth, the lower most part is still called adisthana, though it is plain or less ornate. The sthambas or pillars and bhithis or walls are again of simple shape with no projection or recesses. The main door faces only in one cardinal direction and the windows are small and are made like pierced screens of wood. The rectangular plan is usually divided into two or three activity rooms with access from a front passage. The projecting caves cover a verandah all round. By tenth century, the theory and practice of domestic architecture were codified in books such as Manushyalaya Chandrika and Vastu vidya. This attempt standardised the house construction suited to different socio-economic groups and strengthens the construction tradition among the craftsmen. The traditional craftsman, specially carpenters, preserved the knowledge by rigidly following the canonical rules of proportions of different elements as well as the construction details to this day.\n[[File:Padmanabhapuram palace ClockTower.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The classic roof decors made in Kerala Palaces]]\nBasically the domestic architecture of Kerala follows the style of detached building; row houses seen in other parts of India are neither mentioned in Kerala texts nor put up in practice except in settlements (sanketam) occupied by Tamil or Konkini Brahmans. In its most developed form the typical Kerala house is a courtyard type \u2013 nalukettu. The central courtyard is an outdoor living space which may house some object of cult worship such as a raised bed for tulssi or jasmine (mullathara). The four halls enclosing the courtyard, identical to the nalambalam of the temple, may be divided into several rooms for different activities such as cooking, dining, sleeping, studying, storage of grains etc. Depending on the size and importance of the household the building may have one or two upper storeys (malika) or further enclosed courtyard by repetition of the nalukettu to form ettukettu (eight halled building) or a cluster of such courtyards.\n\n==== Nalukettu ====\n[[File:Krishnapuram palace2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A Classic Nalukettu of Kerala built in Kerala architecture]]\nN\u0101lukettu is the traditional homestead of [[Tharavadu]] where many generations of a matrilineal family lived. These types of buildings are typically found in the Indian state of Kerala. The traditional architecture is typically a rectangular structure where four blocks are joined together with a central courtyard open to the sky. The four halls on the sides are named Vadakkini (northern block), Padinjattini (western block), Kizhakkini (eastern block) and Thekkini (southern block). The architecture was especially catered to large families of the traditional tharavadu, to live under one roof and enjoy the commonly owned facilities of the marumakkathayam homestead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knol.google.com/k/kerala-architecture# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013011001/http://knol.google.com/k/kerala-architecture |archivedate=13 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===== Elements of Nalukettu =====\n\n* '''Padippura'''\n\nIt is a structure containing a door forming part of Compound wall for the house with a tiled roof on top. It is the formal entry to the compound with the house. At present the door is not there as car will have to enter the house through the entry. Still tiled roof is provided preferably with a traditional type lamp below the roof. Instead of door of entry, we now have the Gate\n\n* '''Poomukham'''\n\nIt is the prime [[portico]] soon after steps to the house. Traditionally it has a slope tiled roof with pillars supporting roof. Sides are open. In the earlier days, the head of the family called ''Karanavar'' used to sit here in a reclining chair with thuppal kolambi (Spittoon) by the side of chair. This chair will have long rails on either side where the Karanavar will keep his legs raised for comfortable rest\n\n* '''Chuttu verandah'''\n[[File:Krishnapuram durbar.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The wooden gabbled windows of Krishnapuram Palace]]\nFrom the Poomukham, a verandah to either side in front of the house through open passage called Chuttu Verandah. Chuttu verandah will have hanging lights in equal distance hanging from its slope roof.\n\n* '''Charupady'''\n[[File:Padamanabhapuram Palace varanda.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The typical wooden windows and charupady of Kerala]]\nBy the side of Chuttu verandah and Poomukham, wooden benches with carved decorative resting wooden pieces for resting the back are provided. This is called Charupady. Traditionally the family members or visitors used to sit on these charupady to talk\n\n* '''Ambal Kulam (Pond)'''\n[[File:\u0d24\u0d43\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d42\u0d23\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d41\u0d31 \u0d39\u0d3f\u0d7d \u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d32\u0d38\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d46 \u0d15\u0d41\u0d33\u0d02.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Almost every Nalukettu has its own Kulam or Pond for bathing of its members.]]\nAt the end of Chuttu verandah there used to be a small pond built with rubble on sides where lotus or Ambal used to be planted. The water bodies are maintained to synthesised energy flow inside.\n\n* '''Nadumuttom'''\n[[File:Kerala courtyard with planter.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A typical Nadumuttom of Kerala Nalukettu]]\nTraditionally Nadumuttom or central open courtyard is the prime center the Nalukettu. There is an open area usually square shaped in the exact middle of the house dividing the house in its four sides. Due to this four side division of the house by having a Nadumuttom. Similarly there was Ettu kettu and Pathinaru kettu which are quite rare with two and four Nadumuttom respectively\n[[File:Varikkasseri Nadumuttam.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A classic Nadumuttom with holy thulsi in center of it]]\nNadumuttom will be normally open to sky, allowing sunshine and rains to pour in. This is to allow natural energies to circulate within the house and allow positive vibrance within. A thulsi or tree will be normally planted in center of Nadumuttom, which is used to worship. Architecturally the logic is allow tree to act as a natural air purifier.\n\n* '''Pooja Room'''\n\nPooja room should preferably be in the North East corner of the house. Idols can be placed facing east or west and the person praying can face west or east respectively. At present, wooden panelling is done on Pooja room walls and there is a standard design for Pooja room which can be given to clients interested in having traditional Pooja room\n\n===== Key features =====\n[[File:Kanakakkunnu Palace.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The exterior of Kanakakkunnu Palace built in Kerala style with Dutch influences]]\nThe whole being protected with a compound wall or fence. An entrance structure (padippura) may also be constructed like the gopuram of a temple. This may contain one or two rooms for guests or occasional visitors who are not entertained in the main house. The position and sizes of various buildings, including the location of trees and paths within the compound wall were to be decided from the analysis of the site according to the prescriptions in the classic texts. This analysis involved the concept of vastupurusha mandala wherein the site (vastu) was divided into a number of grids (padam) occupied by different deities (devatha) and appropriate grids were chosen to house the suspicious structures. The site planning and building design was done by learned vishwakarma sthapathis (master builders) who synthesised the technical matters with astrological and mystical sciences.\n\nThere are numerous buildings of the nalukettu type in different parts of Kerala, though many of them are in a poor state of maintenance. Changing socio-economic conditions have split up the joint-family system centered on the large nalukettu. The Kailasa mandiram at Kottakkal belonging to the Arya Vaidyasala is a standing example of a three-storeyed nalukettu complex. Of the best preserved examples of this type are Mattancherry palace at Kochi and the taikottaram of the Padmanabhapuram palace near Kanyakumari.\n\nNalukettu type buildings are also seen in many villages and towns, occupied by prominent people. The humbler buildings of the population are however smaller and simpler in form but basically derived from the nalukettu. Nalukettu is a combination of four halls along four cardinal directions, centered on the courtyard or anganam one may build any one of the four halls (Ekasala), a combination of two (Dwisala) or a complex of three (Thrisala) depending on the needs. The most commonly found type in Kerala is the Ekasala facing east or north. Being located on the western and southern sides of the anganam they are referred as western hall (padinjattini) and southern hall (thekkini) respectively.\n\nThe core unit of Ekasala consists of generally three rooms connected to a front passage. The central room is used as prayer room and grain store and the two side rooms are used as living rooms. The core unit may be raised to an upper storey with a steep stair located in the front passage. The building may also be extended horizontally on all the four sides adding alindams or side rooms for activities such as cooking, dining, additional sleeping rooms, and a front hall for receiving guests. The Chappamattam Tharavadu at Chirakkadavu is a classical example of extended Ekasala. If needed Ekasala may also be provided with ancillary buildings for cattle keeping, barn, bathing rooms near tanks, outhouse for guests, gate house etc. By such extension the building may become much larger than a Nalukettu in space, but it is still categorised as Ekasala with reference to its core unit.\n\nVastuvidya texts prescribe the dimensions of different house types suitable for different classes. They also give the proportional system of measurements for different parts of the building all based on the perimeter (chuttu) of the core unit. The scientific basis of this dimensional system is yet to be enquired by modern studies; however the system appears to be well founded on traditional computational methods and rigidily adhered to all sizes of buildings. All over Kerala and specially in villages where the building activity is still carried out under the control of traditional stapathis, the system is still a living practice, though it has started disappearing under the impact of 'modern architecture'.\n\n===== Types of Nalukettu =====\n\nNalukettus can be differentiated based on structure kind as well as based on caste of its occupants.\n\n====== Based on structure ======\n[[File:Traditional Kerala house in Mattanur.jpg|thumb|right|Korean visitors looking at an Ettukettu Architecture in Mattanur]]\nNalukettus are primarily differentiated based on their structure. Traditionally Nalukettu has one courtyard with 4 blocks/halls constructed around it in cardinal directions. However some Nalukettus have 2 courtyards, which are known as Ettukettu (8 Blocked structure) as they have altogether 8 blocks in cardinal directions. Some super structures have 4 courtyards, which then are known as Patinarukettu (16 blocked structure).\n\nWhile Nalukettus and Ettukettus are more common, Pathinarukettu are extremely rare, due to its enormous size.\n\nLikewise Nalukettus can be differentiated based on their height and number of floors. Some Nalukettus are single-storeyed and made with wood completely. Other Nalukettus are two-storeyed or sometimes even three-storeyed and have laterite-and-clay mixture as walls.\n\n====== Based on caste ======\n\nThe actual term used for Nalukettus differ based on caste and social status of its occupants.\n\n* For [[Nairs]] and other Feudal lords, most of the Nalukettus are referred as '''[[Tharavadu]]\n* For Upper [[Ezhava]] and [[Thiyya]] classes, their Nalukettus are referred as '''Madom''', '''Meda''' and '''Tharavadu'''\n* For [[Samantha Kshatriya|Kshatriya]], their residences are referred as '''Kovilakoms''' and''' Kottarams'''\n* For [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christians]], their residences are referred as '''Medas and Veedus'''\n* For [[Nambudiri]] communities, their residences are referred as '''Illams'''\n\n=== Public structures architecture ===\n[[File:Kavannayil tharavaadu(ancestral home) Thelakkad.jpg|thumbnail|Kavannayil tharavaadu Thelakkad. Perinthalmanna, Malappuram Dt, Kerala, India.]]\nUnlike other parts of India as well as outside, most of the administrative functions under monarchical days were conducted within premises of palace complexes. Hence the concept of independent secular public structures and its architecture evolved towards later part of the 17th century, particularly due to the contributions made by colonial powers in Kerala.\n\nPortuguese were the first, to introduce independent office complexes which stand away from residential quarters. This was out of necessity to make warehouses and its related offices away from residential apart as safety precautions. The public architectural development in Kerala was highly influenced by the European style during seventeenth to nineteenth century. The influence of the Portuguese and Dutch was most predominant in the initial stages. A Portuguese architect Thomas Fernandez is credited with the construction of forts, warehouses and bungalows at Kochi, Kozhikode and Kannur. The projecting balconies, Gothic arches and cast-iron window grill work are a few of the features passed on to Kerala architecture by the Portuguese construction. Portuguese have commissioned more than 2000 office and warehouse complexes in [[Fort Cochin]] area, apart from several European styled castles and private residential villas.\n\nBy eighteenth century British style was being popularised in the land as a result of a large number of modern constructions directly carried out by the British rulers on the one hand and the fashion for things Western by the princely class and the rich on the other. The architectural work was guided by the officers and engineers whose knowledge of the architectural style was essentially restricted to the classic books on renaissance architects \u2013 Vitruvious, Alberti & Palladio and executed by indigenous knowledge of traditional masons and carpenters recruited for the work. In a sense it was a compromise of antique craft and neo-classical construction needs.\n\nA notable feature of the early European work in India was a tendency to demonstrate military, political and cultural superiority of the west. The Greek and Roman antiquity was considered as the richest heritage of the west and the same was emphasised in the classic orders of pillars with triangular pediments, arches and domes for public buildings, town halls, hospitals, railway stations, colleges etc. Expression of dominance was inbuilt in Doric and Ionian columns of large dimension. At the same time the purity of classic Western style gave way to the effect of style by mixing different types of columns in all sorts of buildings. For example, Corinthian columns were used mixed with Doric order in public buildings as well as residences.\n\nThis trend was however moderated very much in Kerala owing to the limitations of materials and climate.\n\nFor the masonry work the media of Indo-European work remained the laterite and lime plastering. The potentiality of exposed laterite was explored in many cases from railway quarters to government offices (e.g. old Huzur office \u2013 Collectorate, Kozhikode). Lime plastering and finishing was transferred from the interior walls of places to the exterior of buildings also to create the superwhite buildings of marble cult. The old pan tiles were replaced by Mangalore pattern tiles and flat tiles. The roof frame of traditional type was changed to trussed roof-using King post and Queen post trusses, making it possible to span large areas.\n\nPerhaps the adaptations of European style to the climatic needs and the synthesis with traditional style are best seen in the bungalow architecture. The comfort requirement in the hot humid climate prompted the European settlers to go in for buildings with large rooms with high ceiling with verandah all around. For upper floor rooms balconies were adopted as a necessary feature, originating from the Portuguese construction. The portico, the shaded spot for passage from one building to another was added. The solid wooden shutter of doors and windows underwent change to ribbed elements \u2013 Venetian blades \u2013 permitting air circulation and providing privacy simultaneously. By 1800 glazed panels came into vogue and semicircular fan light over doors and windows became fashionable features of domestic buildings. Brick arches, terracota pieces and exposed brick work in various bonding patterns became popular. With larger number and bigger size of windows, pediments or projections supported by ornamental brackets and column decoration for protecting the window opening from rain and sun also were introduced. Cast iron fences, stair balustrades and iron grills, made in England, were used to complete the bungalow architecture.\n\nExcellent examples of this synthesis are seen in the Napier museum at Tiruvananthapuram, and many government bungalows. In fact many of these features were smoothly adopted by the native builders to the extent that they are considered by most as traditional elements. The works of Public Works Departments have helped to spread this type of construction all over Kerala. Further the introduction of engineering education with emphasis to the western practice of construction have promoted this trend practically displacing traditional design methods.\n\n=== Environmentally friendly architecture ===\n\nBritish Architect [[Laurie Baker]] has contributed to the Modern Architecture era in Kerala by introducing a blend of British Brick-based and Vernacular Architecture style to influence the contemporary Architects. Kerala boasts of many beautiful buildings created by Architects like Laurie baker, and Architects, who were influenced by him. [[Banasura Hill Resort]] is another innovative Architectural design where the traditional cost effective principles of Indian Architecture were used in an exemplary way.\n\n== See also ==\n* Padippura\n* [[Padmanabhapuram Palace]]\n* [[Krishnapuram Palace]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Temple architecture in Kerala}}\n{{Commons category|Dravidian architecture}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Archhistory}}\n{{Architecture of India}}\n{{kerala|show=show}}\n{{Topics related to Kerala}}\n{(Church Architecture cf. www.indianchristianity.com)}\n\n[[Category:Arts of Kerala]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Kerala| ]]\n[[Category:Indian architecture by state or union territory|Kerala]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=July 2019}}\n{{peacock|date=March 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2015}}\n}}\n[[File:Kadamattom church pallimeda 2.jpg|thumb|250 px|[[St. George's Church, Kadamattom|Kadamattom Church]] [[Clergy house|Pallimeda]] built in Kerala Architectural style]]\n[[File:Poornathrayisa back side.JPG|thumb|right|The entrance of Poornathrayisa temple in [[Tripunithura]], redesigned in 1921 by Sri Eachara Warrier]]\n[[File:Hill Palace by GV-1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hill Palace, Tripunithura|Tripunithura Hill Palace]], which was the administrative office of Cochin Rajas.]]\n'''Kerala architecture'''  is a kind of architectural style that is mostly found in [[India]]n [[States of India|state]] of [[Kerala]]. Kerala's style of architecture is unique in India, in its striking contrast to [[Dravidian architecture]] which is normally practiced in other parts of [[South India]]. The architecture of Kerala has been influenced by Dravidian and Indian Vedic architectural science ([[Vastu Shastra]]) over two millennia. The Tantrasamuchaya, Thachu-Shastra, [[Manushyalaya Chandrika|Manushyalaya-Chandrika]] and Silparatna are important architectural sciences, which have had a strong impact in Kerala Architecture style. The Manushyalaya-Chandrika, a work devoted to domestic architecture is one such science which has its strong roots in Kerala.\n\nThe architectural style has evolved from Kerala's peculiar climate and long history of influences of its major maritime trading partners like Chinese, Arabs and Europeans.\n[[File:British Residency in Kollam city, Mar 2017.jpg|thumb|right|[[British Residency]] in [[Kollam]] - It is a splendid two-storeyed Palace built by [[John Munro, 9th of Teaninich|Col. John Munro]] between 1811 and 1819. It is a blend of [[Europe]]an-[[India]]n-[[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] architectural styles]]\n\n== Origins ==\nThe characteristic regional expression of Kerala architecture results from the geographical, climatic and historic factors. Geographically Kerala is a narrow strip of land lying in between western seaboard of peninsular India and confined between the towering [[Western Ghats]] on its east and the vast [[Arabian sea]] on its west. Favoured by plentiful rains due to [[Monsoon]] and bright sunshines, this land is lush green with vegetation and rich in animal life. In the uneven terrain of this region human habitation is distributed thickly in the fertile low-lands and sparsely towards the hostile highlands. Heavy rains have brought in presence of large water bodies in form of lakes, rivers, [[Kerala backwaters|backwaters]] and lagoons. The climatic factors thus made its significant contributions in developing the architecture style, to counter wettest climatic conditions coupled with heavy humidity and harsh tropical summers.\n\nHistory also played its own contributions to the Kerala architecture. The towering Western Ghats on its east, has successfully prevented influences of neighboring [[Tamil people|Tamil]] countries into present day Kerala in later times. While Western Ghats isolated Kerala to a greater extent from Indian empires, the exposure of [[Arabian sea]] on its east brought in close contacts between the ancient people of Kerala with major maritime civilizations like [[China|Chinese]], Egyptians, [[History of Rome|Romans]], Arabs etc. The Kerala's rich spice cultivations brought it center of global maritime trade until modern periods, helping several international powers to actively engage with Kerala as a trading partners. This helped in bring in influences of these civilisations into Kerala architecture.<ref>https://nitc.academia.edu/BPhilip/Papers/374480/TRADITIONAL_KERALA_ARCHITECTURE</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-historic era ===\nThe locational feature of Kerala has influenced the social development and indirectly the style of construction. In the ancient times the Arabian sea and the Ghats formed impenetrable barriers helping the evolution of an isolated culture of Proto-Dravidians, contemporary to the [[Harappa|Harappan civilisation]]. The earliest vestiges of constructions in Kerala belong to this period dated between 3000 B.C. to 300 B.C. They can be grouped into two types \u2013 tomb cells and [[megalith]]s. The rock cut tomb cells are generally located in the laterite zones of central Kerala, for example at Porkalam, [[Thrissur district]]. The tombs are roughly oblong in plan with single or multiple bed chambers with a rectangular court in the east from where steps rise to the ground level. Another type of burial chamber is made of four slabs placed on edges and a fifth one covering them as a cap stone. One or more such dolmens are marked by a stone circle. Among the megaliths are the umbrella stones (\"kudakkal\"), resembling handless palm leaf umbrellas used for covering pits enclosing burial urns. Two other types of megaliths, hat stones (\"thoppikkal\") and menhirs (\"pulachikkal\") however have no burial appendages. They appear to be rather memorial stones.\n\nThe megaliths are not of much architectural significance, but they speak of the custom of the primitive tribes erecting memorials at sites of mortuary rites. These places later became the annual meeting grounds of the tribes and gave rise to occult temples of ancestral worship. While the custom of father worship can be seen in these cases, the protecting deities of the villages were always in female form, who were worshiped in open groves (\"kavu\"). These hypaethral temples had trees, stone symbols of Mother Goddesses or other naturalistic or animistic image as objects of worship. The continuity of this early culture is seen in the folk arts, cult rituals, worship of trees, serpents and mother images in kavus.\n\n=== Influence of Buddhism and early Tamilakam architecture ===\n[[File:Chottanikkara Temple.jpg|thumb|right|The Chuttuambalam Pavilion at [[Chottanikkara Temple]] built in classical style]]\n{{see also|Tamil Buddhism}}\nThe nature worship of the early inhabitants of Kerala has its parallel in serpent worship and Buddhism, in the tree worship owing to the association of Buddha's birth, revelation and preaching under a tree. This rose in parallel to the developments in the other areas of [[Tamilakam]] during the latter stages of the [[Sangam period]]. Although sculptural relics of Buddhist images have been recovered from a few places of southern Kerala, there are, however, no extant Buddhist monuments in this region. But literary references such as the 3rd century Tamil epic Manimekhalai and Mushika vamsa, a Sanskrit epic of the eleventh century suggest the fact that Kerala had important Buddhist shrines. The most renowned of these was the Sreemulavasa vihara with a magnificent image of Bodhisatwa Lokanatha. This shrine is believed to have been washed away by coastal erosion. In their design features some of the temples such as Siva temple at Thrissur and the Bhagavathi temple at Kodungallur are believed to be Buddhist viharas; but there is no irrefutable proof for such beliefs.\n\nThe Jain monuments are more numerous in [[Jainism in Kerala|Kerala]]. They include rock shelters at [[Chitral Jain cave]] near Nagercoil, a rock cut temple at Kallil near Perumbavoor, and remains of structural temples at Alathoor near Palakkad and at Sultanbathery. [[Jainimedu Jain temple]] is a 15th-century [[Jain temple]] located at Jainimedu, 3&nbsp;km from the centre of [[Palakkad]].<ref name=\"indiatimes1\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-05-12/india/39202799_1_temple-walls-temple-sources-diamond-merchants |title=15th-century Jain temple in Kerala to be reopened|work=The Times of India|date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref> Sculptured Kerala Jaina and Dravidian figures of Mahavira, Parswanatha and other thirthankaras have been recovered from these sites.

Press.</ref> [[Sultanbathery]] also has the remains of a [[Jaina basti]], known as Ganapati vattam, being an example of a cloistered temple built entirely of granite.\n[[File:Vazhappallytemple.jpg|thumb|right|The grand gopurams of Kerala temples at Vazhappally]]\nIn spite of the absence of architectural monuments there is conclusive proof of the influence of the Buddhist school on Kerala architecture of later periods. The circular temples basically follow the shapes of the Buddhist stupas, the dome shaped mounds. The apsidal temples are modelled in the pattern of chaitya halls, the assembly halls of Buddhist monks. The chaitya window seen repeated in the decorative moulding of the thorana around the temple shrine is clearly a Buddhist motif adopted in Hindu style, according to [[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]]. Basically thorana is a gateway provided in the palisade seen in the vertical and horizontal members of the vilakkumadam, which is a feature seen only in Kerala temples of the post-Buddhist period. In its most primitive form this construction is seen in the hypaethral temples enshrining trees and later on the outer walls of the shrines proper. With the stylistic development of the Hindu temple this form of palisade is removed from the shrine structure (srikovil) and taken as a separate edifice beyond the temple cloister (chuttambalam).\n[[File:Kottarakkara Temple(HighResoluion).jpg|thumb|right|The single-storeyed temple complex at [[Kottarakkara]] in [[Kollam]]]]\n\n=== Hindu Influence ===\n[[File:TVM aps temple.jpg|thumb|right|The ornate multi-storeyed [[Gopuram]] of the Dravidian Kovil of Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram]]\nHinduism was co-existent with the indigenous Dravidian cultural and social practices of Kerala. Early Tamil [[Sangam literature]] says that by the First century A.D. the Cheras all of present-day Kerala, parts of [[Tulunadu]] and Kodagu, and the Kongu lands (present Salem and Coimbatore region). It had multiple capitals simultaneously administered by different lineages of the Family, its main capital being Vanchi, identified with the Thiruvanchikulam near Kodungallur. At this time, the two extremities of the Kerala region were administered by two Velir families. The southernmost part administered by the [[Ay Kingdom|Ay]] chieftains of Thiruvananthapuram and the northernmost parts by the [[Mushika Kingdom|Nannans of Ezhilmalai]]. The Nannan line was a branch of the Ay originating in the Thiruvananthapuram area and both were representatives (or vassals) under the suzerainty of the Cheras (and sometimes the Pandyas or Cholas or Pallavas). Brahmanas appeared to have settled in Kerala and established [[Hinduism]]. The amalgamation of different cultures and religious philosophies helped to evolve the architectural styles of Kerala temples.  This was highly conducive of architectural development and renovation of a large number of temples. After the decline of the Cheras several small principalities developed all over Kerala. By fifteenth century, Kerala was broadly covered by the suzerainty of four principal chieftains \u2013 Venad rulers in the south, Kochi Maharajas in the centre, Zamorins of Kozhikode in the north and Kolathiri Rajas in the extreme north. They were rulers who patronised architectural activities. It was this period, Kerala Architecture started shaping its own distinctive style. A regional character in construction incorporating the Dravidian craft skills, unique forms of Buddhist buildings, design concepts of [[vedic]] times and canonical theories of [[Hindu]] [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] practices in locally available materials and suited to the climatic conditions was finally evolved in Kerala. The theory and practice of architectural construction were also compiled during this period.\n\nTheir compilations remain as classical texts of a living tradition to this day. Four important books in this area are;\n\n* '''Thantrasamuchayam''' (Chennas Narayanan Namboodiri) and '''Silpiratnam''' (Sreekumara), covering temple architecture\n* '''Vastuvidya''' (anon.) and '''Manushyalaya Chandrika''' (Thirumangalathu Sri Neelakandan), dealing with the domestic architecture. A number of minor works in Sanskrit, Manipravalam and refined Malayalam, all based on the above texts have found popularity in Kerala with the craftsmen and professionals related with the subject.\n\nKerala is referred as one of the border kingdoms of the Maurya empire. It is possible that Buddhists and Jainas were the first north Indian groups to cross the borders of Kerala and establish their monasteries. These religious groups were able to practise their faith and receive patronage from the local kings to build shrines and viharas. For nearly eight centuries Buddhism and Jainism seem to have co-existed in Kerala as an important faith, contributing in its own way to the social and architectural development of the region.\n\n== Composition and structure ==\n[[File:Kanakakkunnu Palace DSW.jpg|300px|thumb|A full view of [[Kanakakkunnu Palace]] at [[Thiruvananthapuram]]]]\nKerala architecture can be broadly divided into 2 distinctive areas based on their functionality, each guided by different set of principles;\n[[File:Padmanabhapuram Palace, roof works.jpg|thumb|right|The gabled roof and ceiling works are the prime feature of Kerala architectural style]]\n* '''Religious Architecture''', primarily patronised by [[temples of Kerala]] as well as several old churches, mosques etc.\n* '''Domestic Architecture''', primarily seen in most of the residential houses. There are distinctively styles in this area, as Palaces and large mansions of feudal lords different from houses of commoners and also marked difference exists between religious communities.\n[[File:VadakkumnathanTemple.JPG|thumb|right|The circular roofs of temples are direct legacy of Buddhist influences in Ancient Kerala Architectural styles]]\n\n=== Composition ===\n\nThe primary elements of all structures trends to remain same. The base model is normally circular, square or rectangular plain shapes with a ribbed roof evolved from functional consideration. The most distinctive visual form of Kerala architecture is the long, steep sloping roof built to protect the house's walls and to withstand the heavy monsoon, normally laid with tiles or thatched labyrinth of palm leaves, supported on a roof frame made of hard wood and timber. Structurally the roof frame was supported on the pillars on walls erected on a plinth raised from the ground for protection against dampness and insects in the tropical climate. Often the walls were also of timbers abundantly available in Kerala. Gable windows were evolved at the two ends to provide attic ventilation when ceiling was incorporated for the room spaces.\n[[File:Koothambalam at Kerala Kalamandalam.jpg|thumb|right|Most of Kerala buildings appears to low height visually, due to over-sloping of roofs, which are meant to protect walls from rains and direct sun shine]]\nThe belief system of [[Vastu]] plays a very important role in developing architecture styles. The basic underlying belief is that, every structure built on earth has its own life, with a soul and personality which is shaped by its surroundings. The most important science which has Kerala has developed purely indigenously is Thachu-Shastra (Science of Carpentry) as the easily availability of timber and its heavy use of it. The concept of Thachu underlines that as timber is derived from a living form, the wood, when used for construction, has its own life which must be synthesised in harmony with its surroundings and people whom dwell inside it.\n\n=== Materials ===\nThe natural building materials available for construction in Kerala are stones, timber, clay and palm leaves. Granite is a strong and durable building stone; however its availability is restricted mostly to the highlands and only marginally to other zones. Owing to this, the skill in quarrying, dressing and sculpturing of stone is scarce in Kerala. Laterite on the other hand is the most abundant stone found as outcrops in most zones. Soft laterite available at shallow depth can be easily cut, dressed and used as building blocks. It is a rare local stone which gets stronger and durable with exposure at atmospheric air. Laterite blocks may be bonded in mortars of shell lime, which have been the classic binding material used in traditional buildings. Lime mortar can be improved in strength and performance by admixtures of vegetable juices. Such enriched mortars were used for plastering or for serving as the base for mural painting and low relief work. Timber is the prime structural material abundantly available in many varieties in Kerala \u2013 from bamboo to teak. Perhaps the skilful choice of timber, accurate joinery, artful assembly and delicate carving of wood work for columns, walls and roofs frames are the unique characteristics of Kerala architecture. Clay was used in many forms \u2013 for walling, in filling the timber floors and making bricks and tiles after [[pug mill|pugging]] and tempering with admixtures. Palm leaves were used effectively for thatching the roofs and for making partition walls.\n[[File:Wood carvings on the ceiling and a hanging oillamp.jpg|thumb|The typical wood carvings made on ceilings of Sree Padmanabhapuram Palace]]\nFrom the limitations of the materials, a mixed mode of construction was evolved in Kerala architecture. The stone work was restricted to the plinth even in important buildings such as temples. Laterite was used for walls. The roof structure in timber was covered with palm leaf thatching for most buildings and rarely with tiles for palaces or temples. The exterior of the laterite walls were either left as such or plastered with lime mortar to serve as the base for mural painting. The sculpturing of the stone was mainly moulding in horizontal bands in the plinth portion (adhistans) whereas the carving of timber covered all elements _ pillars, beams, ceiling, rafters and the supporting brackets. The Kerala murals are paintings with vegetable dyes on wet walls in subdued shades of brown. The indigenous adoption of the available raw materials and their transformation as enduring media for architectural expression thus became the dominant feature of the Kerala style.\n\n== Structure ==\nStructure wise, there can be two major classifications having its own specialities.\n\n=== Religious architecture ===\n\n==== Temple architecture ====\n[[File:Madhurtemple.jpg|thumb|[[Madhur Temple]], [[Kasaragod]], Kerala]]\nThe variety of temples, numbering more than 2000 dotting the Kerala state has no match with any other regions of India. The temples of Kerala highly developed in strict accordance to two temple construction thesis, Thantra-Samuchayam and Sliparatnam. While the former deals in developing structures that regulates [[Energy (esotericism)|energy flows]] so that positive energy flows in, while negative energy do not trend to remain retarded within the structure; whereas the latter deals in developing stone and timber architecture in such manner that each carved structure imbibe a life and personality of its own.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.keralahistory.ac.in/keralaarchitecture.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082519/http://www.keralahistory.ac.in/keralaarchitecture.htm |archive-date=2011-07-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kerala temple layout.jpg|thumb|250px|The standard layout of Kerala temple.]]\n\n===== Elements and features of Kerala Temple =====\n\n* '''Sri-Kovil'''\n\n[[File:Tkm1.jpg|thumb|right|The circular Sreekovil style of Kerala temples]]\nThe inner sanctum sanctorum where the idol of presiding deity is installed and worshiped. It shall be an independent structure, detached from other buildings with no connections and having its own roof shared with none. The Sri-kovil does not have any windows and have only one large door opening mostly towards east (sometimes it happens towards west, whereas a few temples have north facing door as its specialty, while no temples will have a south facing door).\n\nThe Srikovil may be built in different plan shapes \u2013 square, rectangular, circular or apsidal. Of these the square plan shows an even distribution throughout Kerala state. The square shape is basically the form of the vedic fire altar and strongly suggest the vedic mooring. It is categorised as the nagara style of temple in the architecutural texts. The rectangular plan is favoured for the Ananthasai Vishnu (Lord Vishnu in reclining posture) and the Sapta matrikas (Seven Mother Goddesses). The circular plan and the apsidal plan are rare in other parts of India and unknown even in the civil architecture of Kerala, but they constitute an important group of temples. The circular plan shows a greater preponderance in the southern part of Kerala, in regions once under the influence of Buddhism. The apsidal plan is a combination of the semi-circle and the square and it is seen distributed sporadically all over the coastal region. The circular temples belong to the vasara category. A variation of circle-elipse is also seen as an exception in the Siva shrine at Vaikkom. Polygonal shapes belonging to the Dravida category are also adopted rarely in temple plans but they find use as a feature of shikhara. As per the Thantrasamuchayam, every Sreekovil should be built either neutral or even sided.\nFor the unitary temples, the overall height is taken as 13/7/ to 2 1/8 of the width of the shrine, and categorised into 5 classes as i.e.; ''santhika, purshtika, yayada, achudha and savakamika'' \u2013 with increasing height of the temple form. The total height is basically divided into two-halves. The lower half consists of the basement, the pillar or the wall (stambha or bhithi) and the entablature (prasthara) in the ratio 1:2:1, in height. Similarly the upper half is divided into the neck (griva), the roof tower (shikhara) and the fonial (Kalasham) in the same ratio. The adisthana or foundation is generally in granite but the superstructure is built in laterite. The roofings will be of normally taller than other temple structures.  The structural roof of the shrine is constructed as the corbelled dome of masonry; however in order to protect it from the vagaries of climate it was superposed by a functional roof, made of timber frame covered by planks and tiles. This sloping roof with its projecting caves gave the characteristic form to the Kerala temple. The fenial or Kalasham, made of copper, provided the crowning spire denoting the focus of the shrine wherein the idol was installed.\n[[File:Kotimaram.jpg|thumb|right|The flag post normally seen in all Kerala Temples]]\nNormally the Srikovil is on a raised platform and has a flight or 3 or 5 steps to be. The steps are called Sopanapadi and on sides of the Sopanapadi, two large statues known as Dwarapalakas (Door Guards) are craved to guard the deity. As per Kerala rituals style, only main priest (Thantri) and second priest (Melshanti) only allowed to enter into Sri-kovil.\n\n* '''Namaskara Mandapam'''\n\nThe namaskara mandapa is a square shaped pavilion with a raised platform, a set of pillars and a pyramidal roof. The size of the mandapa is decided by the width of the shrine cell. The pavilion in its simplest form has four corner pillars; but larger pavilions are provided with two sets of pillars; four inside and twelve outside. Pavilions of circular, elliptical and polygonal shapes are mentioned in the texts, but they are not seen in Kerala temples. The Mandapams are used to conducting Vedic-Thantric rites.\n\n* '''Nalambalam'''\n\n[[File:Peruvanam-temple-b.jpg|thumb|right|The outer grounds of Temple, called Chuttuambalam]]\nThe shrine and the mandapa building are enclosed in a rectangular structure called the nalambalam. Functionally the rear and side halls of the nalambalam serves for various activities related to the ritualistic worship. The front hall is pierced with the entry, dividing it into two parts. These two halls; Agrasalas which used for feeding Brahmans, performing yagas and while Koothuambalam are used for staging temple arts such as koothu and temple murals. In few cases, Koothuambalams are separated as an individual structure outside Nalambalam.\n\n* '''Balithara'''\n\n[[File:0507-Kodimaram2.jpg|thumb|right|The Dwajasthampam or flag post of temple, in Chuttuambalam]]\nAt the entrance of Nalambalam, a square shaped raised stone altar called as Balithara can be seen. This altar is used to make ritualistic offerings to demi-gods and other spirits. Inside the Nalambalam, several small stones, called Balikallukal can be seen, meant for same purpose.\n\n*  '''Chuttuambalam'''\n\n[[File:Varikkasseri Gopuram.jpg|thumb|right|The Goppuram or Gatehouse]]\nThe outer structure within the temple walls, is known as Chuttuambalam. Normally Chuttuambalam has main pavilion known as Mukha-Mandapam or Thala-mandapam. The Mukha-Mandapam will have the Dwajastambam (Sacred Flag-post) in center of it and has several pillars supporting mandapam. The temple is now fully enclosed in a massive wall (Kshetra-Madillukal) pierced with gate houses or gopurams. The gopuram is usually two-storeyed, which served two purposes. The ground floor was an open space generally used as a platform for temple dances such as kurathy dance or ottan thullal during festivals. The upper floor with wooden trails covering the sides functioned as a kottupura _ (a hall for drums beating). The Chuttuambalam will normally has 4 gates from outside to entrance at all sides. A stone paved walk-way will be seen around the Chuttuambalam to allow devotees circulate around the temple, which for some large temples are covered with roof supported with massive pillars on both sides. The Chuttuambalam will have Dwajavillakku or giant lamp-posts in several places, mostly in Mukha-mandapams.\n\n* '''Ambala-Kulam'''\n[[File:Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple.JPG|thumb|right|The temple pond or Ambala-Kulam at Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple]]\nEvery temple will have a sacred temple pond or water lake located within temple complex. As per Vastu-rules, water is considered as source of positive energy and synthesis balance of all energies. Hence a temple pond or Ambala Kulam will be made available within the temple complex. The temple pond is normally used only by priests as holy bath before start of rituals as well as for various sacred rituals within the temple. In few cases, a separate pond will be constructed to allow devotees to bath before entering in temple. Today several temples have Mani-Kenar or Holy Well within the Nalambalam complex to get sacred waters for purposes of Abisekham.\n\n* '''Thevarapura'''\n[[File:Koothambalam at Koodal Maanikka Temple.JPG|thumb|right|Koothuambalams are prime venues for conduct of temple dances and other art forms. The height of Koothuambalam's roof are much similar to Pyramids, makes it more majestic and gives a distant feeling from temple]]\nNormally within Nalambalam, a separate complex will be constructed for cooking foods meant to serve for the deity and distribution among devotees as holy prasadam. Such complexes are called Thevarapura, where the holy fire or [[Agni]] is invoked.\n\n===== Phases of evolution =====\nIn its stylistic development, the temple architecture can be divided into three phases.\n[[File:Paliam naalukettu.jpg|thumb|right|The Nalukettu complex]]\n[[File:Theyyam Kovil lighting lady.jpg| thumb|250px|right|A ''Madappura'' (stand alone Kovil) from North Kerala where [[Theyyam]] rituals are performed seasonally. Noted for its stand alone, singular, tile roofed structure. All the Muthappan Madappura's are structured in similar style. These structures are found mainly in [[North Malabar]] region of Kerala ]]\nThe first phase is that of rock-cut temples. This earliest form is contemporary to Buddhist cave temples. Rock-cut temples are mainly located in southern Kerala\u2014at Vizhinjam and Ayirurpara near Tiruvananthapuram, Kottukal near Kollam and Kaviyoor near Alappuzha. Of these the one at Kaviyoor is the best example. The Kaviyoor cave temple dedicated to Siva comprises a shrine room and a spacious [[ardhamandapa]] arranged axially facing the west. On the pillared facade as well as on the walls inside the ardhamandapa are sculptured reliefs of the donor, a bearded rishi, a seated four armed Ganesh and dwarapalas. The other cave temples also have this general pattern of a shrine and an ante-room and they are associated with Siva worship. In the north similar rock-cut temples of saiva cult are seen at Trikkur and Irunilamkode in Trissoor district. Historically the cave architecture in India begins with Buddhism and the technique of rock-cut architecture in Kerala seems to be a continuation of similar works in Tamil Nadu under the Pandyas. The rock-cut temples are all dated prior to the eighth century A.D.\n\nThe structural temples appear in the second phase spanning the eighth to tenth centuries, and patronised by the Chera, Ay and Mushika chieftains. The earliest temples had a unitary shrine or a srikovil. In rare cases a porch or ardhamandapa is seen attached to the shrine. A detached namaskara mandapa is generally built in front of the srikovil. A quadrangular building, nalambalam that encloses the srikovil, the namaskara mandapa, balikkal (altar stones) etc. became part of this basic plan composition of the Kerala temple started emerging in this phase.\n\nThe middle phase of the evolution of the temples is characterised by the emergence of the sandhara shrine. In the unitary shrine of the earlier type, Nirendhara (single level of srikovil), there is a cell with a single doorway to the cell. But in the sandhara shrine the cell has twin wells leaving a passage in between them. Also there are often four functional doors on all the four cardinal directions and pierced windows to provide subdued light in the passage. Sometimes the functional door on the sides and the rear are replaced by pseudo doors.\n\nThe concept of the storeyed temple is also seen in this phase. The tower of the shrine rises to the second storey with a separate upper roof forming a dwitala (two-storeyed) temple. There is a unique example of thrithala (three-storeyed temple) is at Shiva shrine at Peruvanam with lower two storeys of square plan and the third storey of octagonal form.\n\nIn the last phase, (1300\u20131800 A.D.) the stylistic development reached its apogee with greater complexity in the temple layout and elaboration of detail. The vilakkumadam, the palisade structure fixed with rows of oil lamps is added beyond the nalambalam as an outer ring. The Altar stone is also housed in a pillared structure, the Balikkal mandapam in front of the agrasala (valiyambalam). A deepastambham and dwajasthambham (the lamp post and flag mast) are added in front of the balikkal mandapam.\n\nWithin the prakara but beyond the vilakkumadam, stood the secondary shrines of parivara devathas (sub-gods) in their assigned positions. These were unitary cells, in general, though in a few cases each became a full-fledged shrine as in the case of Krishna shrine in the Siva temple at Tali, Kozhikode. The last phase culminated in the concept of the composite shrines. Herein two or three shrines of equal importance are seen cloistered inside a common nalambalam. The typical example of this is the Vadakkumnatha temple at Trissoor, where in three shrines dedicated to Siva, Rama and Sankaranarayana are located inside the nalambalam. The prakara may also contain temple tanks, vedapadhasalas and dining halls. Paradoxically some shrines have not a single secondary shrine, the unique example being the Bharatha shrine at Irinjalakuda.\n\nA significant feature of big temple complexes is the presence of a theatre hall known as Koothambalam, meant for dance, musical performance and religious recitals. This is a unique edifice of Kerala architecture, distinct from the natyasabha or natyamandir seen in north Indian temples of this period. Koothambalam is a large pillared hall with a high roof. Inside the hall is a stage structure called as Rangamandapam for the performances. The stage as well as the pillars are ornately decorated. Visual and acoustic considerations are incorporated in the layout of the pillars and construction details so that the performances can be enjoyed by the spectators without discomfort and distortion. The Koothambalam design seems to have been based on the canons given in the Natyasastra of Bharata Muni.\n\nIn the southernmost Kerala, the temple architecture was also influenced by the developments in Tamil Nadu. At Sucheendram and Tiruvananthapuram this influence is clearly seen. Herein lofty enclosures, sculptured corridors and ornate mandapas all in granite stone practically conceal the view of the original main shrine in typical Kerala style. The entrance tower, Gopuram also rises to lofty heights in a style distinct from that of the humble two-storeyed structure seen elsewhere.\n\nTechnically the most important feature of the temple architecture of Kerala is the construction technique using a dimensional standardisation. The nucleus of the temple plan is the shrine containing the garbhagrhiha cell. The width of this cell is the basic module of the dimensional system. In plan composition, the width of the shrine, the open space around it, the position and sizes of the surrounding structures, are all related to the standard module. In vertical composition, this dimensional co-ordination is carried right up to the minute construction details such as the size of the pillars, wall plates, rafters etc. The canonical rules of the proportionate system are given in the treatises and preserved by the skilled craftsmen. This proportionate system has ensured uniformity in architectural style irrespective of the geographical distribution and scale of construction.\n\nTemple architecture is a synthesis of engineering and decorative arts. The decorative elements of the Kerala temples are of three types \u2013 mouldings, sculptures and painting. The moulding is typically seen in the plinth where in horizontal hands of circular and rectangular projections and recesses in varying proportions help to emphasize the form of the adisthana. Occasionally this plinth is raised over a secondary platform \u2013 upapeedam \u2013 with similar treatment. Mouldings are also seen in the mandapam, the hand rails of the steps (sopanam) and even in the drain channel ([[pranala]]) or the shrine cell.\n\nThe sculptural work is of two types. One category is the low relief done on the outer walls of the shrine with masonry set in lime mortar and finished with plaster and painting. The second is the sculpturing of the timber elements \u2013 the rafter ends, the brackets, the timber columns and their capitals, door frames, wall plates and beams. Decorative sculptural work is seen best in the ceiling panels of the mandapas. Exquisite lacquer work in brick red and black colour was adopted for turned columns of timber. Metal craft was also used in sculpturing idols, motifs, cladding and finials. All sculptural works were done strictly according to the canons of proportions (ashtathala, navathala and dasathala system) applicable to different figures of men, gods and goddesses, prescribed in texts.\n\nThe painting was executed in organic pigments on walls when the plaster was still wet \u2013 in soft subdued colours, making them into a class designated as Kerala murals. The theme of these paintings is invariably mythological and the epic stories unfold as one [[circumambulation|circumambulates]] around the temple. The moulding, sculpture and painting are also taken in vertical compositions to emphasise the different storey heights, projecting dormer windows which break the sloping roof and the crowning finial. But in all cases the decoration is secondary to the structural form. The sculptured walls are protected by the projecting caves which keep them in shade in sharp contrast with the bright sunlit exterior. This helps to impart the overall perceptual experience of light and shade revealing details only gradually to a keen observer.\n\n==== Islamic architecture ====\n[[File:Mithqalpalli Mosque - Kozhikode - Kerala 02.JPG|thumb|300px|right| The Mithqalpalli in Kozhikode is a classic example of Kerala's native Mosque style with gabled roofs, sloped wooden window panels and without minarets]]\n\nThe [[Arabian Peninsula]], the cradle of [[Islam]] also had direct trade contact with [[Kerala]] coast from very early times, as far as the time of [[Muhammad]] or even before. As local Muslim legends and tradition goes, a [[Chera dynasty|Chera King]] embraced [[Islam]] and made [[Hajj|a voyage to Mecca]]. In his return trip accompanied by many [[Sahabah|Islamic religious leaders]] including [[Malik ibn Dinar]], he fell sick and died. But he had given introductory letters for the party to proceed to [[Kodungallur]]. The visitors came to the port and handed over the letter to the reigning King who treated the guests with all respect and extended facilities to establish their faith in the land. The king arranged for the artisans to build the [[Cheraman Juma Masjid|first mosque at Kodungallur]] near the port and ear-marked the area around it for their settlement. The original mosque has undergone extensive repairs, but the traces of the original construction are seen in the plinth, the columns and the roof which are in the old traditional styles of [[Hindu temple]]s.\n[[File:ThazhathangadyJumaMasjid1.JPG|thumb|right|An example of traditional Kerala style of Mosque at Thazhathangady in Kottayam]]\nUndoubtedly Islam spread in [[Kerala]] through the migration of new groups from [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the gradual conversion of native population in the permissive and all accommodating Indian cultural ethos and social set up of Kerala. By twelfth century AD there were at least ten major settlements of Muslims distributed from [[Kollam]] in the south to [[Mangalore]] in the north each centered on the mosque. Also a branch of the ruling [[Ali Raja|kingdom at Arakkal]], [[Kannur]] was converted to Islam. The primacy in trade, the spread of the faith and the experience of the sea made [[Muslim]]s a prominent class and dear to the rulers, especially of the [[Zamorin|Kozhikode Zamorins]]. Consequently, by fifteenth century Islamic constructions reached considerable heights.\n[[File:Muchundi Mosque.JPG|thumb|right|Muchundi Mosque with classic Kerala styles]]\n\nThe mosque architecture of Kerala exhibits none of the features of the [[Islamic architecture|Arabic style]] nor those of the [[Indo-Islamic architecture]]s of the imperial or provincial school in north India. The reason for this is not far to seek. The work of mosque construction was done by the local Hindu artisans under instructions of the Muslim religious heads who wanted to erect the places of worship. The models for places of worship were only [[Hindu temple]]s or the theatre halls (\"koothambalam\") and these models are to be adapted for the new situations. The early mosques in Kerala consequently resemble the traditional building of the region. Arabic style of architecture was introduced to the Malabar area of present-day Kerala, during the period of occupation by Hyder Ali and later by Tipu Sultan during the eighteenth century. A large number of temples were converted to mosques during this period as evidenced by the traditional Kerala style of these structures.\n[[File:MiskalMosque.jpg|thumb|right|Miskal Mosque has three-storeyed gabled roofs with windows which offers an alternative to minarets in traditional Kerala style]]\n\nIn plan the mosque comprises a large [[Mosque#Prayer hall|prayer hall]] with a [[mihrab]] on the western wall (since [[Mecca]] is west to Kerala) and covered [[verandah]] all around. Generally it has a tall basement similar to the adhistana of the Brahmanical temple and often the columns are treated with square and octagonal section as in [[mandapa]] pillars. The walls are made of laterite blocks. The arch form is seen only in one exceptional case for the [[mosque at Ponnani]] and nowhere else in the early ten mosques of the land. Wood was used extensively in superstructure for the construction of ceiling and roof. The roof in many cases is covered with sheets of copper incorporating fenials in the ridge, completing the form of temple [[shikhara]] with the stupi. At [[Tanur, India|Tanur]] the Jama Masjid even has a gate built in the manner of temple gopuram, covered with copper sheeting. This mosque itself is a three-storeyed building with tiled roof crowned by five fenials.\n[[File:New cheraman masjid.jpg|thumb|right|The Cheraman Mosque, which is World's second and sub-continent's first mosque was originally built in Kerala style, which was renovated recently to give Arabic touch]]\nThe pulpit in the mosque present the best example of wood carvings associated with Islamic architecture of Kerala. The Jama Masjid at Beypore and Mithqal Mosque at Kozhikode have the pulpit (mimbar) built by the ship masters of the Arab vessels.\n[[File:Moulana Masjid, Kannur.jpg|thumb|right|The Kannur Mosque symbolises the slow transit from Kerala style to Persian style with additions of Minarets and other classical Persian features in traditional Kerala style]]\nAll other construction work was done by the same local craftsmen who were building the [[Hindu temple]]s and residences. The Arabic tradition of simplicity of plan had perhaps combined itself with the indigenous construction techniques giving rise to the unique style of mosque architecture, not found anywhere else in the world. In contrast the [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] drew its inspiration from the [[Ottoman architecture|Turkish]] and [[Iranian architecture|Persian tradition]]s and created highly ornamental style in the north India. The typical Kerala mosques are seen at Kollampalli, near [[Kollam]], Panthalayani near [[Koyilandy]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Tanur, India|Tanur]], [[Ponnani]] and [[Kasargode]] as well as in most old Muslim settlements. The austere architectural features of the old mosques are however in the process of being replaced in recent times by [[Islamic architecture]]. The use of [[Arch|arcuated]] [[Formwork|form]]s, [[dome]]s and [[minar]]-[[minaret]]s of the imperial school of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] are being projected as the visible symbols of [[Islamic culture]]. The [[Palayam Juma Masjid|Jama Masjid]] at [[Palayam, Thiruvananthapuram|Palayam]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]] is the classic example of this new trend. Similar structures are coming up all over [[Kerala]] in the modification of old mosques during the last decades.\n\nPerhaps the influence of [[Islamic architecture|Arabic style]] of Kerala construction is seen in a subtle manner in the secular architecture of Muslims. The bazar streets lined by buildings on both sides, the upper floor living rooms with view windows to the streets, the wooden screens used to provide privacy and shade in the [[verandah]]s (specially of upper floors) etc., are a few features superposed on the traditional construction. These built forms would have been modelled in the pattern of the houses in Arab countries (such as [[Egypt]], [[Basra]] (present day [[Iraq]]) and [[Iran]]) having contact with this region. This trend is most conspicuous in market towns such as [[Kozhikode]], [[Thalassery]], [[Kasaragode]] etc. But basically the Muslim domestic architectures at large follow the traditional Hindu styles. Both \"ekasalas\" and \"[[n\u0101lukettu]]s\" are seen adopted for this. These buildings with extensive alindams and [[verandah]]s are also seen generally surrounding the mosques in Muslim settlements.\n\n==== Church architecture ====\n{{Split section|date=March 2020 |Kerala church architecture}}\n[[File:Kadamattom St. George Church.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Kadamattom Malankara Syrian Church near Muvattupuzha, is one of the oldest churches in Kerala, built in pure Kerala style.]]\nThe evolution of the church architecture of Kerala springs from two sources \u2013 the first from the work of Apostle St. Thomas and the Syrian Christians and second from the missionary work of European settlers. The tradition has it that St. Thomas who landed in Muziris in 52 AD had seven churches built in Kerala at Kodungallur, Chayil, Palur, Paravur-Kottakkavu, Kollam, Niranom and Kothamangalam, but none of these Syrian churches are now extant. It is possible that some of the temples were adapted as Syrian churches for services by the population who got converted into Syriac Christianity by St. Thomas. For example, the present Palur Syrian church has preserved the abhisheka patra (the letter of intonation) and certain shaiva symbols as the relics of the old church which is said to have been a Hindu shrine adapted for Christian worship. \n[[File:Edathua Church sideView.jpg|thumb|right|A Syro-Malabar Church with a mixture of Portuguese and Kerala architecture.]]\nHistorical evidences suggest that the first wave of Christianity came from Edessa, Persia in the fourth century A.D. owing to the persecution of Syrian Christians in the Persian empire. According to the narration of Byzantine monk Cosmas, Kerala had many churches by sixth century A.D. According to the inscription of the times of Stanu Ravi by ninth century, Syrian Christian communities enjoyed many rights and privileges. They also played a vital role in trade and commerce. The domestic buildings of the Syrian Christians were akin to the native architecture.\n[[File:Chengannur 2.JPG|thumb|right|Syrian Christians have most their churches built in traditional Kerala style, resembling temples of Kerala. This Old Syrian church of Orthodox and Marthoma Syrian churches in Chengannur has been built in Kerala style with stone lamps, and is a testimony of assimilation of Kerala Christianity with native architecture.]]\nBut original Syrians who had migrated to Kerala had brought with them some of the West Asian conventions in church architecture. Consequently, churches with regular chancel and nave began to be built and there evolved a distinctive style of church architecture. The peculiar feature of this style was the ornamental gable facade at the nave end, surmounted by a cross. An entry porch (shala) in front of the nave was another feature of these early shrines. The baptistry was a small chamber inside the nave near the entrance. Belfries were built on one side of the nave, but in smaller churches the bell was hung in an opening in the nave gable.\n[[File:Kottakkavu St. Thomas Church, Paravur, Thrissur, Kerala, India.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Kottakkavu Mar Thoma Syro-Malabar Pilgrim Church, North Paravur|Kottakkavu Mar Thoma Syro-Malabar Roman Catholic Church, North Paravur]] is a mixture of Portuguese, Kerala and Dutch architecture]]\n\n===== Elements of Kerala church architecture =====\n[[File:Altar-Kanjoor Church.jpg|thumb|Altar-Kanjoor Church]]\nUnlike Kerala temples, there is no uniform or standard layout for all churches of Kerala. Rather most of churches have different set to architecture according to various sects and their traditions apart from experimentation of new designs. Still most of churches, particularly [[Saint Thomas Christian]] churches of Kerala, do share several common features.\n\nThe church had a gable roof extending to the chancel, the most sacred part of the church and the sacristy by its side. The tower over the chancel soared higher than the roof of the nave similar to the shikhara over the garbhagriha in a Hindu temple. The residence of the priest and the parish hall were located on one side of the church and the cemetery was on the other side.\n[[File:Archbishop's House, Changanassery, Kerala.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Syro-Malabar Archbishop's Palace at Changassery is built assimilating Dutch architecture with Kerala's native styles]]\nIn their external feature Syrian churches retained some of the indigenous features of the Hindu style. The church and the ancillary buildings were enclosed in a massive laterite wall.\n\nThere was an open cross in front of the main entrance on a granite basement in the model of balikkal, the altar stone. A church also had the flag mast, (the dwajastambha) in front. In the Orthodox Syrian church at Chengannur, Peter and Paul occupy the place of dwarapalas, the guarding deities of a Hindu shrine. Sometimes a gateway like the temple gopuram with a kottupura or music room on the upper storey was also provided. The Marth Mariam church at Kuravilangad, originally built in 345 A.D had undergone renovations several times. The church has a rich collection of old relics including an idol of Virgin Mary and a cross carved in granite. The Knanaya Valiapally of Kaduthuruthy is another old church with the biggest cross formed in a single granite piece. The Valiapally of Piravom is also another old church with old Persian writings.\n\nWood carving and mural paintings, the two decorative media of temples are seen to be adopted in ancient churches also. A famous piece of wooden carving is a large panel depicting the last supper in St. Thomas church, Mulanthuruthy. The All Saints church at Udayamperur has a beam resting on wooden mouldings of heads of elephants and rhinoceros. Floral figures, angels and apostles are the usual motifs of mural paintings. This form of decoration had continued in later churches as well. In St. Sebastian's church at Kanjoor a mural even depicts the fight between British and Tippu Sultan.\n[[File:Church Kerala white.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The assimilated Dutch style in Kerala architectural patterns]]\n\n===== Colonial influences in church architecture =====\n\nThe Portuguese were the first to introduce European styles in the church architecture of Kerala, followed by Dutch and British. The first church of this type in India was built by the Franciscan missionaries in 1510 A.D. at Fort Kochi. It is a small unpretentious building of the medieval Spanish type. When Vasco De Gama died in Kochi in 1524 his body was interned in this church and later removed to Lisbon in 1538. The church thus came to be known as Vasco De Gama's church. It was later seized by the Dutch and was used for reformed services. Later with British occupation of Kochi it became an Anglican church and presently it belongs to church of south India.\n\nThe Portuguese had introduced many innovations in the Kerala churches. For the first time, the dominating tower above the altar, which was the adaptation from temple architecture, was discarded. Inside the church, the granite images were not favoured owing to their association with the Hindu art; instead images of Saints made of wood were used to adorn the riches. Generally pulpits were erected and altar pieces were ornamented in an impressive manner. Ceilings and walls were painted with religious themes in the style of European masters. Pointed and rounded arches were introduced and stained glass windows were installed.\n\nThe subsequent development in church architecture in the British period also saw the introduction of a new church design. In place of the rectangular Basilican plan the cross shaped plan became increasingly popular especially in places where large congregation had to be accommodated. Apart from the obvious symbolism of the cross, this plan is more suited for better visibility of the altar from all points in the church. Further, sufficient space was now available at the transepts for additional altars for services by several priests on important occasions like Christmas.\n\nIn the external features the central tower or rather the Roman dome now comes at the centre of the transept imparting a classic form of European architecture. Also on either side of the main entrance in the front, rose towers to serve as belfries. In the treatment of the exterior, typical features of European church architecture were introduced \u2013 the Gothic arches, the pilasters and buttresses, the rounded openings, the classic mouldings and stained glass windows making the whole composition completely different from the native architecture. Depending on the period of construction, one can also distinguish between the churches done in the simplicity of Gothic style as in the Palayam church, Tiruvananthapuram, and the luxury of renaissance style as in the church of Our Lady of Dolorous at Trissoor.\n\n===== Modern trends in church architecture =====\n\nWhile the character of church architecture is generally identified with the form evolved in the medieval times, the modernistic trends in adapting new plan shapes and structural forms are visible in the Kerala scene as well. This circular plan shape with domical shell roof has been adopted in the Christ College church at Irinjalakkuda. The Cathedral church of Archbishop of Varapuzha at Ernakulam is a soaring hyperbolic paraboloid in reinforced concrete with a bold expression in sharp contrast with all traditional forms. Perhaps experimentation in religious architecture is mostly manifested in church architecture as compared to that in temples or mosques which more or less adhere to old evolved forms.\n\n==== Jewish architecture ====\nThe architectural scene of Kerala was influenced by many socio-cultural groups and religious thoughts from foreign lands. The sea board had promoted trade contacts with maritime nations such as Israel, Rome, Arabia and China even prior to the dawn of the Christian era. The trade contact would have paved the way of establishing settlements near the old port towns and gradually spreading in the interior. During the time of the second Chera Kingdom, the old port city of Makotai (Kodungallur) had different parts occupied by these groups. For example, the cultural contact of Jews with Kerala predates the time of Solomen and by fifteenth century there were Jewish settlements in Kodungallur, Kochi and other coastal towns. The most important Jewish settlement is seen at Kochi near the Mattancherry palace. Their residential buildings resemble the Kerala type in their external appearance; nevertheless they are of a different plan concept. The ground floor rooms are used as shops or warehouses and the living rooms are planned on the first floor. The frontage of the building about the streets and the sides are continuous with adjoining buildings in the pattern of the row houses. An important historic monument of the Jew town is the Synagogue. It is a simple tall structure with a sloping tile roof but it has a rich interior with hand painted tiles from Canton, China and ancient chandeliers from Europe. This religious structure built for worship according to Judaism stands in contrast with the temples of Hindus. Jewish community however did not influence the architecture of Kerala.\n\n=== Domestic architecture ===\n[[File:Chappamattam Tharavadu.jpg|thumb|right|Intricate wood carvings & chuttu verandah in Kerala architecture]]\n[[File:Padmanabhapuram Palace.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Sree Padmanabhapuram Palace represents the most classic Kerala domestic architecture. It is also the world's largest wooden palace made on sloping roofs, granite and rosewood-teak wood work combinations]]\nThe evolution of domestic architecture of Kerala followed closely the trend of development in temple architecture. The primitive models were huts made of bamboo frame thatched with leaves in circular, square or rectangular plain shapes. The rectangular shape with a hipped roof appears to have been finally evolved from functional consideration. Structurally the roof frame was supported on the pillars on walls erected on a plinth raised from the ground for protection against dampness and insects in the tropical climate. Often the walls were also of timbers abundantly available in the land. The roof frame consisted of the bressumer or wall plate which supported lower ends of the rafters, the upper ends being connected to the ridge. The weight of the rafters and the roof covering created a sage in the ridge when the ridge piece was made of flexible materials like bamboo. This sage however remained as the hall-mark of roof construction even when strong timber was used for the roof frame. Further gable windows were evolved at the two ends to provide attic ventilation when ceiling was incorporated for the room spaces. This ensured air circulation and thermal control for the roof. The lower ends of the rafters projected much beyond the walls to shade the walls from the sun and driving rain. The closed form of the Kerala houses was thus gradually evolved from technical considerations. One can see the striking similarity of this form with the temple structure. The plinth, the lower most part is still called adisthana, though it is plain or less ornate. The sthambas or pillars and bhithis or walls are again of simple shape with no projection or recesses. The main door faces only in one cardinal direction and the windows are small and are made like pierced screens of wood. The rectangular plan is usually divided into two or three activity rooms with access from a front passage. The projecting caves cover a verandah all round. By tenth century, the theory and practice of domestic architecture were codified in books such as Manushyalaya Chandrika and Vastu vidya. This attempt standardised the house construction suited to different socio-economic groups and strengthens the construction tradition among the craftsmen. The traditional craftsman, specially carpenters, preserved the knowledge by rigidly following the canonical rules of proportions of different elements as well as the construction details to this day.\n[[File:Padmanabhapuram palace ClockTower.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The classic roof decors made in Kerala Palaces]]\nBasically the domestic architecture of Kerala follows the style of detached building; row houses seen in other parts of India are neither mentioned in Kerala texts nor put up in practice except in settlements (sanketam) occupied by Tamil or Konkini Brahmans. In its most developed form the typical Kerala house is a courtyard type \u2013 nalukettu. The central courtyard is an outdoor living space which may house some object of cult worship such as a raised bed for tulssi or jasmine (mullathara). The four halls enclosing the courtyard, identical to the nalambalam of the temple, may be divided into several rooms for different activities such as cooking, dining, sleeping, studying, storage of grains etc. Depending on the size and importance of the household the building may have one or two upper storeys (malika) or further enclosed courtyard by repetition of the nalukettu to form ettukettu (eight halled building) or a cluster of such courtyards.\n\n==== Nalukettu ====\n[[File:Krishnapuram palace2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A Classic Nalukettu of Kerala built in Kerala architecture]]\nN\u0101lukettu is the traditional homestead of [[Tharavadu]] where many generations of a matrilineal family lived. These types of buildings are typically found in the Indian state of Kerala. The traditional architecture is typically a rectangular structure where four blocks are joined together with a central courtyard open to the sky. The four halls on the sides are named Vadakkini (northern block), Padinjattini (western block), Kizhakkini (eastern block) and Thekkini (southern block). The architecture was especially catered to large families of the traditional tharavadu, to live under one roof and enjoy the commonly owned facilities of the marumakkathayam homestead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knol.google.com/k/kerala-architecture# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013011001/http://knol.google.com/k/kerala-architecture |archivedate=13 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===== Elements of Nalukettu =====\n\n* '''Padippura'''\n\nIt is a structure containing a door forming part of Compound wall for the house with a tiled roof on top. It is the formal entry to the compound with the house. At present the door is not there as car will have to enter the house through the entry. Still tiled roof is provided preferably with a traditional type lamp below the roof. Instead of door of entry, we now have the Gate\n\n* '''Poomukham'''\n\nIt is the prime [[portico]] soon after steps to the house. Traditionally it has a slope tiled roof with pillars supporting roof. Sides are open. In the earlier days, the head of the family called ''Karanavar'' used to sit here in a reclining chair with thuppal kolambi (Spittoon) by the side of chair. This chair will have long rails on either side where the Karanavar will keep his legs raised for comfortable rest\n\n* '''Chuttu verandah'''\n[[File:Krishnapuram durbar.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The wooden gabbled windows of Krishnapuram Palace]]\nFrom the Poomukham, a verandah to either side in front of the house through open passage called Chuttu Verandah. Chuttu verandah will have hanging lights in equal distance hanging from its slope roof.\n\n* '''Charupady'''\n[[File:Padamanabhapuram Palace varanda.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The typical wooden windows and charupady of Kerala]]\nBy the side of Chuttu verandah and Poomukham, wooden benches with carved decorative resting wooden pieces for resting the back are provided. This is called Charupady. Traditionally the family members or visitors used to sit on these charupady to talk\n\n* '''Ambal Kulam (Pond)'''\n[[File:\u0d24\u0d43\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d42\u0d23\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d41\u0d31 \u0d39\u0d3f\u0d7d \u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d32\u0d38\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d46 \u0d15\u0d41\u0d33\u0d02.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Almost every Nalukettu has its own Kulam or Pond for bathing of its members.]]\nAt the end of Chuttu verandah there used to be a small pond built with rubble on sides where lotus or Ambal used to be planted. The water bodies are maintained to synthesised energy flow inside.\n\n* '''Nadumuttom'''\n[[File:Kerala courtyard with planter.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A typical Nadumuttom of Kerala Nalukettu]]\nTraditionally Nadumuttom or central open courtyard is the prime center the Nalukettu. There is an open area usually square shaped in the exact middle of the house dividing the house in its four sides. Due to this four side division of the house by having a Nadumuttom. Similarly there was Ettu kettu and Pathinaru kettu which are quite rare with two and four Nadumuttom respectively\n[[File:Varikkasseri Nadumuttam.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A classic Nadumuttom with holy thulsi in center of it]]\nNadumuttom will be normally open to sky, allowing sunshine and rains to pour in. This is to allow natural energies to circulate within the house and allow positive vibrance within. A thulsi or tree will be normally planted in center of Nadumuttom, which is used to worship. Architecturally the logic is allow tree to act as a natural air purifier.\n\n* '''Pooja Room'''\n\nPooja room should preferably be in the North East corner of the house. Idols can be placed facing east or west and the person praying can face west or east respectively. At present, wooden panelling is done on Pooja room walls and there is a standard design for Pooja room which can be given to clients interested in having traditional Pooja room\n\n===== Key features =====\n[[File:Kanakakkunnu Palace.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The exterior of Kanakakkunnu Palace built in Kerala style with Dutch influences]]\nThe whole being protected with a compound wall or fence. An entrance structure (padippura) may also be constructed like the gopuram of a temple. This may contain one or two rooms for guests or occasional visitors who are not entertained in the main house. The position and sizes of various buildings, including the location of trees and paths within the compound wall were to be decided from the analysis of the site according to the prescriptions in the classic texts. This analysis involved the concept of vastupurusha mandala wherein the site (vastu) was divided into a number of grids (padam) occupied by different deities (devatha) and appropriate grids were chosen to house the suspicious structures. The site planning and building design was done by learned vishwakarma sthapathis (master builders) who synthesised the technical matters with astrological and mystical sciences.\n\nThere are numerous buildings of the nalukettu type in different parts of Kerala, though many of them are in a poor state of maintenance. Changing socio-economic conditions have split up the joint-family system centered on the large nalukettu. The Kailasa mandiram at Kottakkal belonging to the Arya Vaidyasala is a standing example of a three-storeyed nalukettu complex. Of the best preserved examples of this type are Mattancherry palace at Kochi and the taikottaram of the Padmanabhapuram palace near Kanyakumari.\n\nNalukettu type buildings are also seen in many villages and towns, occupied by prominent people. The humbler buildings of the population are however smaller and simpler in form but basically derived from the nalukettu. Nalukettu is a combination of four halls along four cardinal directions, centered on the courtyard or anganam one may build any one of the four halls (Ekasala), a combination of two (Dwisala) or a complex of three (Thrisala) depending on the needs. The most commonly found type in Kerala is the Ekasala facing east or north. Being located on the western and southern sides of the anganam they are referred as western hall (padinjattini) and southern hall (thekkini) respectively.\n\nThe core unit of Ekasala consists of generally three rooms connected to a front passage. The central room is used as prayer room and grain store and the two side rooms are used as living rooms. The core unit may be raised to an upper storey with a steep stair located in the front passage. The building may also be extended horizontally on all the four sides adding alindams or side rooms for activities such as cooking, dining, additional sleeping rooms, and a front hall for receiving guests. The Chappamattam Tharavadu at Chirakkadavu is a classical example of extended Ekasala. If needed Ekasala may also be provided with ancillary buildings for cattle keeping, barn, bathing rooms near tanks, outhouse for guests, gate house etc. By such extension the building may become much larger than a Nalukettu in space, but it is still categorised as Ekasala with reference to its core unit.\n\nVastuvidya texts prescribe the dimensions of different house types suitable for different classes. They also give the proportional system of measurements for different parts of the building all based on the perimeter (chuttu) of the core unit. The scientific basis of this dimensional system is yet to be enquired by modern studies; however the system appears to be well founded on traditional computational methods and rigidily adhered to all sizes of buildings. All over Kerala and specially in villages where the building activity is still carried out under the control of traditional stapathis, the system is still a living practice, though it has started disappearing under the impact of 'modern architecture'.\n\n===== Types of Nalukettu =====\n\nNalukettus can be differentiated based on structure kind as well as based on caste of its occupants.\n\n====== Based on structure ======\n[[File:Traditional Kerala house in Mattanur.jpg|thumb|right|Korean visitors looking at an Ettukettu Architecture in Mattanur]]\nNalukettus are primarily differentiated based on their structure. Traditionally Nalukettu has one courtyard with 4 blocks/halls constructed around it in cardinal directions. However some Nalukettus have 2 courtyards, which are known as Ettukettu (8 Blocked structure) as they have altogether 8 blocks in cardinal directions. Some super structures have 4 courtyards, which then are known as Patinarukettu (16 blocked structure).\n\nWhile Nalukettus and Ettukettus are more common, Pathinarukettu are extremely rare, due to its enormous size.\n\nLikewise Nalukettus can be differentiated based on their height and number of floors. Some Nalukettus are single-storeyed and made with wood completely. Other Nalukettus are two-storeyed or sometimes even three-storeyed and have laterite-and-clay mixture as walls.\n\n====== Based on caste ======\n\nThe actual term used for Nalukettus differ based on caste and social status of its occupants.\n\n* For [[Nairs]] and other Feudal lords, most of the Nalukettus are referred as '''[[Tharavadu]]\n* For Upper [[Ezhava]] and [[Thiyya]] classes, their Nalukettus are referred as '''Madom''', '''Meda''' and '''Tharavadu'''\n* For [[Samantha Kshatriya|Kshatriya]], their residences are referred as '''Kovilakoms''' and''' Kottarams'''\n* For [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christians]], their residences are referred as '''Medas and Veedus'''\n* For [[Nambudiri]] communities, their residences are referred as '''Illams'''\n\n=== Public structures architecture ===\n[[File:Kavannayil tharavaadu(ancestral home) Thelakkad.jpg|thumbnail|Kavannayil tharavaadu Thelakkad. Perinthalmanna, Malappuram Dt, Kerala, India.]]\nUnlike other parts of India as well as outside, most of the administrative functions under monarchical days were conducted within premises of palace complexes. Hence the concept of independent secular public structures and its architecture evolved towards later part of the 17th century, particularly due to the contributions made by colonial powers in Kerala.\n\nPortuguese were the first, to introduce independent office complexes which stand away from residential quarters. This was out of necessity to make warehouses and its related offices away from residential apart as safety precautions. The public architectural development in Kerala was highly influenced by the European style during seventeenth to nineteenth century. The influence of the Portuguese and Dutch was most predominant in the initial stages. A Portuguese architect Thomas Fernandez is credited with the construction of forts, warehouses and bungalows at Kochi, Kozhikode and Kannur. The projecting balconies, Gothic arches and cast-iron window grill work are a few of the features passed on to Kerala architecture by the Portuguese construction. Portuguese have commissioned more than 2000 office and warehouse complexes in [[Fort Cochin]] area, apart from several European styled castles and private residential villas.\n\nBy eighteenth century British style was being popularised in the land as a result of a large number of modern constructions directly carried out by the British rulers on the one hand and the fashion for things Western by the princely class and the rich on the other. The architectural work was guided by the officers and engineers whose knowledge of the architectural style was essentially restricted to the classic books on renaissance architects \u2013 Vitruvious, Alberti & Palladio and executed by indigenous knowledge of traditional masons and carpenters recruited for the work. In a sense it was a compromise of antique craft and neo-classical construction needs.\n\nA notable feature of the early European work in India was a tendency to demonstrate military, political and cultural superiority of the west. The Greek and Roman antiquity was considered as the richest heritage of the west and the same was emphasised in the classic orders of pillars with triangular pediments, arches and domes for public buildings, town halls, hospitals, railway stations, colleges etc. Expression of dominance was inbuilt in Doric and Ionian columns of large dimension. At the same time the purity of classic Western style gave way to the effect of style by mixing different types of columns in all sorts of buildings. For example, Corinthian columns were used mixed with Doric order in public buildings as well as residences.\n\nThis trend was however moderated very much in Kerala owing to the limitations of materials and climate.\n\nFor the masonry work the media of Indo-European work remained the laterite and lime plastering. The potentiality of exposed laterite was explored in many cases from railway quarters to government offices (e.g. old Huzur office \u2013 Collectorate, Kozhikode). Lime plastering and finishing was transferred from the interior walls of places to the exterior of buildings also to create the superwhite buildings of marble cult. The old pan tiles were replaced by Mangalore pattern tiles and flat tiles. The roof frame of traditional type was changed to trussed roof-using King post and Queen post trusses, making it possible to span large areas.\n\nPerhaps the adaptations of European style to the climatic needs and the synthesis with traditional style are best seen in the bungalow architecture. The comfort requirement in the hot humid climate prompted the European settlers to go in for buildings with large rooms with high ceiling with verandah all around. For upper floor rooms balconies were adopted as a necessary feature, originating from the Portuguese construction. The portico, the shaded spot for passage from one building to another was added. The solid wooden shutter of doors and windows underwent change to ribbed elements \u2013 Venetian blades \u2013 permitting air circulation and providing privacy simultaneously. By 1800 glazed panels came into vogue and semicircular fan light over doors and windows became fashionable features of domestic buildings. Brick arches, terracota pieces and exposed brick work in various bonding patterns became popular. With larger number and bigger size of windows, pediments or projections supported by ornamental brackets and column decoration for protecting the window opening from rain and sun also were introduced. Cast iron fences, stair balustrades and iron grills, made in England, were used to complete the bungalow architecture.\n\nExcellent examples of this synthesis are seen in the Napier museum at Tiruvananthapuram, and many government bungalows. In fact many of these features were smoothly adopted by the native builders to the extent that they are considered by most as traditional elements. The works of Public Works Departments have helped to spread this type of construction all over Kerala. Further the introduction of engineering education with emphasis to the western practice of construction have promoted this trend practically displacing traditional design methods.\n\n=== Environmentally friendly architecture ===\n\nBritish Architect [[Laurie Baker]] has contributed to the Modern Architecture era in Kerala by introducing a blend of British Brick-based and Vernacular Architecture style to influence the contemporary Architects. Kerala boasts of many beautiful buildings created by Architects like Laurie baker, and Architects, who were influenced by him. [[Banasura Hill Resort]] is another innovative Architectural design where the traditional cost effective principles of Indian Architecture were used in an exemplary way.\n\n== See also ==\n* Padippura\n* [[Padmanabhapuram Palace]]\n* [[Krishnapuram Palace]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Temple architecture in Kerala}}\n{{Commons category|Dravidian architecture}}\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Archhistory}}\n{{Architecture of India}}\n{{kerala|show=show}}\n{{Topics related to Kerala}}\n{(Church Architecture cf. www.indianchristianity.com)}\n\n[[Category:Arts of Kerala]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Kerala| ]]\n[[Category:Indian architecture by state or union territory|Kerala]]\n", "name_user": "99v", "label": "safe", "comment": "Split", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Kerala"}
{"title_page": "List of The Fairly OddParents characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''List of The Fairly OddParents characters'''. [[The Fairly OddParents]] is an [[America|American]] animated television show, created by [[Butch Hartman]].\n==Main==\n<!-- http://www.nick.com/shows/fairly-oddparents/characters/timmy-turner.html -->\n\n===Timmy Turner===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Timmy Turner pose.png|thumb|Timmy Turner]] -->\n\nVoiced by:\n* [[Tara Strong]]\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] \u2013 Adult Timmy in ''[[Channel Chasers]]'' episode\n* [[Mary Kay Bergman]] \u2013 ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' shorts\n\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Drake Bell]] \u2013 Live-action movies\n\nTimothy Tiberiusaurus-rex jr \"Timmy\" Turner is a 10-year-old boy who was given fairy godparents to grant his every wish as a result of his neglectful parents and abuse from Vicky. He wears a pink hat and shirt with blue pants. He also has comically large front teeth, which are usually mocked. His wishes often have unpredictable and problematic side effects, and are often reverted upon Timmy's request by the end of the episode. His interests include comic books, video games, cartoons, and sports. During a time travel trip, Timmy accidentally arrives the day his parents moved into their house; unseen, he learns that they were expecting a girl, hence his pink hat.\n\n===Cosmo===\nVoiced by:\n* [[Daran Norris]]\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Jason Alexander]] (in ''[[A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!]]'')<ref name=\"screenrant.com\" />\n\nCosmo and Wanda are fairy godparents assigned to grant Timmy's, and later Chloe's, wishes. They were previously the godparents of Denzel Crocker, Billy Gates, Tina Turner, and other historical and modern day figures; such as [[Benjamin Franklin]]. To avoid being seen by humans other than Timmy, they often disguise themselves as animals or inanimate objects.\n\nCosmo is Wanda's husband, Poof's father, and Timmy and Chloe's godfather. He is known for his stupidity and has been responsible for inadvertently causing disasters since he was born. As explained in \"Fairly Oddbaby\", Cosmo's ability for destruction is such that when he was born, all fairies were henceforth no longer allowed to have children out of the fear that another potential fairy baby would be as bad as or worse than Cosmo. Although he is very laid back and dim, Cosmo is prone to fits of jealousy and becomes defensive when he sees others flirting with Wanda. He was the youngest fairy until Poof was born and, though he was considered an only child in earlier episodes, has a brother named Schnozmo that debuts later. His mother, Mama Cosma, is overprotective of Cosmo and thus despises Wanda. Cosmo has green hair and typically wears a white shirt, black pants, and a black necktie.  \n\n===Wanda===\nVoiced by:\n* [[Susanne Blakeslee]]\n\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Cheryl Hines]] (in [[A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!]]<ref name=\"screenrant.com\">{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/fairly-oddparents-movie-alexander-hines-sandy-71777/ |title=Early Look At 'Fairly Oddparents' Movie |publisher=Screen Rant |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2011-06-01}}</ref>)\n\nWanda Venus Cosma (n\u00e9e Fairywinkle) is Cosmo's wife, Poof's mother, and Timmy and Chloe's godmother. She is depicted as being smart and caring. Unlike Cosmo, she tries to prevent Timmy from wishing for things which can be disastrous, though her attempts often fail. However, she is responsible for [[K-t event|the extinction of dinosaurs, 65 million years ago]]. She has a sister, who is a popular actress, named Blonda whom she fights with a lot, as Wanda believes her sister's life as a Soap Star is easier than hers as a housewife. Wanda also has a father named Big Daddy, who also despised Cosmo similar to how Mama Cosma dislikes Wanda but to a much lesser extent. She has pink hair styled with a swirl in front and is usually shown wearing a yellow T-shirt and black pants. Wanda has an [[chocoholic|obsession with chocolate]], and it is one of the only things that can distract her from her top priorities.\n\n===Vicky ===\n<!-- DO NOT MOVE VICKY FROM MAIN --->\nVicky (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]], portrayed by Devon Weigel in the live-action movies), is Timmy's rude, selfish, greedy, sadistic, conniving, malicious, and tyrannical 16-year-old babysitter and the main antagonist of the series. She has but a few friends and enjoys torturing children, watching television and making the world miserable, especially for Timmy. She lives with her mother, her father, and her younger sister Tootie. She has encountered Cosmo & Wanda on numerous occasions, but does not believe in them.\n\nAlso, she has encountered Mark Chang in his natural form but dismisses it as a Halloween costume. A plot point in the episode \"Frenemy Mine\" involved her belonging to a dark society known as B.R.A.T. (Babysitters Raging Against Twerps). She has been shown to be accepting of her own cruelty, and that the only reason she is, is that she was mistreated as a child by her own babysitter.\n\n===Poof===\nPoof Cosma (voiced by Tara Strong, Jeff Bennett in ''Certifiable Super Sitter'') is Cosmo and Wanda's son, introduced into the series in the 2008 special ''[[Fairly OddBaby]]''. He was the first fairy baby born in over ten thousand years, with his own father being the second to last. His magical abilities are controlled by his emotions and channeled through his magic rattle. \n\nIn \"Fairy Old Parent\", Poof is assigned to his very first person as a fairy godparent as his own, for miserable old people; such as Mrs. Crocker. He grants her wishes but became overworked and exhausted, returning to Cosmo and Wanda.\n\nIn the Season 10 episode \"Certifiable Super Sitter\", Poof returned from Spellementary [[Boarding School]] for spring break. His voice has gotten deeper and more comical as part of his formal training to be a great fairy. Chloe goes completely crazy over him, as she loves babies.\n\n===Sparky===\nSparky (voiced by [[Maddie Taylor|Matthew Taylor]]) is Timmy's talking fairy dog, who was a character in [[The Fairly OddParents (season 9)|season 9]], but was dropped from the show before season 10 due to negative reception. Sparky has orange fur, a wand for a tail, a blue nose, and fairy wings. He wears a fairy crown and a blue collar. Sparky's magic tail doesn't work when he is wet. He has magic fleas that will turn people into dogs if bitten. He is highly allergic to pasta, and is capable of performing human acts, such as driving. Unlike Timmy's fairy godparents, it is okay for other people to know about Sparky, but they cannot know that he can talk.\n\n===Chloe Carmichael===\nChloe Carmichael (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]) is Timmy's neighbor who debuts in the [[The Fairly OddParents (season 10)|season 10]] premiere episode, \"The Big Fairy Share Scare.\" Due to there not being enough fairies available for kids, she and Timmy are forced to share Cosmo and Wanda. Although in the beginning they do not get along, they end up becoming best friends. Chloe is seen by Timmy as an annoying, goody goody, and boastful, little girl and she has the tendency to cause chaos with her wishes.\n\n==Supporting==\n\n===Mr. and Mrs. Turner===\nEdgar Turner, also known as Dad or Mr. Turner, (voiced by Daran Norris, portrayed by Norris in the live-action films) and Clemence Turner, also known as Mom or Mrs. Turner, (Susanne Blakeslee, portrayed by [[Teryl Rothery]] in the live-action films) are Timmy's parents. Mom is a real estate agent and home dealer; and Dad works as an employee of a pencil factory called Pencil Nexus and troop leader for Timmy's Squirrelly Scouts Troop, though both have had several other jobs, usually only for a single episode. Mom is shown to be a horrible gardener and cook, as anything she tries to grow dies and her meals usually come alive and try to attack her family. Dad is often shown hating the Dinklebergs, the next door neighbors, which can be compared to [[Homer Simpson]]'s hatred for [[Ned Flanders]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]''.  Both are completely oblivious to the magic in their home, and despite their love for Timmy, tend to be somewhat neglectful. They leave Timmy with Vicky, his babysitter, and are oblivious to signs that she is evil; even going as far as believing that the song \"Icky Vicky\" was about pumpkins.\n\n=== Chester McBadbat ===\nChester McBadbat (voiced by [[Frankie Muniz]] in 2001\u20132003; [[Jason Marsden]] in 2003\u20132017) is one of Timmy's best friends. He lives in a trailer with his father in an impoverished community with few amenities. He is generous and cares more for others than himself, as every time he has obtained magic, he has used his wishes to try to improve the lives of others, even though it usually leads to disaster. He becomes the only classmate of Timmy to know about his godparents' existence in ''[[Fairy Idol]]'', but it is not mentioned again in later episodes. He often wears worn-in, oversized clothes. He has freckles, green eyes, [[dental braces]], and blonde shaggy hair and eyebrows.\n\nHe was played by Chris Anderson in ''A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!''.\n\n=== A.J. ===\nA.J. (voiced by Ibrahim Haneef Muhammad (2001\u20132003), [[Gary LeRoi Gray]] (2003\u20132017)) is the resident genius in Timmy's class, and one of his best friends. He comes from an upper-middle-class family, and is a straight \"A\" student in school, a quality both his parents have achieved as well. He has constructed an older brother who defends him from bullies, fulfilling his need for a real one. He plays with video games and reads comic books like his other friends, in spite of his superior intellect. He has a secret laboratory that he conceals with a \"cloak\" button on his bedroom wall which, when pressed, converts his lab into a typical bedroom.\n\nHe was played by Jesse Reid in ''A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!''.\n\n=== Jorgen Von Strangle ===\nJorgen Von Strangle (voiced by [[Daran Norris]], played by [[Mark Gibbon]] in the live-action movies) is the toughest fairy in the universe who speaks with an Austrian accent and is a high-ranking official in Fairy World. Unlike other fairies who \"poof\" from place to place, Jorgen appears and disappears in the form of an atomic explosion and has a [[jet pack]] instead of wings. In \"The Zappies\", he mentioned he has had only one godchild, Winston; the reason for this, as revealed in \"Temporary Fairy\", is that his extreme wish-granting and daredevil stunts unnecessarily endanger the lives of godchildren. He is [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] and enjoys the idea of others cowering in fear of him, which affects his ability to have friends besides Cosmo and Wanda. Although Jorgen is known as the toughest fairy in Fairy World, he is seen multiple times crying in front of Cosmo and Wanda. In 'Teeth for Two', it is revealed that he dated the Tooth Fairy before breaking up over Timmy's teeth. He married her at the end of the episode, but the marriage was not mentioned since. It is revealed in \"Cosmo Rules\" that Cosmo is his distant cousin. \n\n=== Tootie ===\nTootie (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]] in the TV series, Amber Hood in the ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' episode \"The Fairy Flu\", portrayed in the live-action movies by [[Daniella Monet]]) is Vicky's younger sister. She is a bespectacled girl who has an [[obsessive love|obsessive crush]] on Timmy, often going to the extreme of spying on and stalking him. While Timmy rejects her regularly, he does have a soft spot for her and does nice things for her in several episodes, including sending Cosmo and Wanda out on loan for her birthday after Vicky ruins it. When Vicky isn't torturing the children she babysits, she regularly tortures Tootie at home in substitution.\n\n=== Mark Chang ===\nMark Chang (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is an alien prince from the planet of [[Tyche (hypothetical planet)|Yugopotamia]] (located almost 10,760 astronomical units away from Earth) and one of Timmy's friends. Chang resembles a green squid-like creature with a brain contained in glass. He also features a \"Fake-i-fier\" on his waist, allowing him to shapeshift into objects and human forms. Introduced in \"Spaced Out\", Chang and the other aliens of Yugopotamia are horrified by things commonly considered cute and are attracted to disgusting objects (like manure) and people. As such, Chang has a crush on Vicky, who is unaware that he is a real alien. His parents, King Gripullon and Queen Jipjorrulac (voiced by Paulsen and Laraine Newman, respectively) eventually marry Chang to the vicious, homicidal Princess Mandie (pronounced \"Man-DIE\"). To escape her wrath, Chang relocates to the Dimmsdale Dump on Earth. He also celebrates F.L.A.R.G., a holiday celebrating revolting activities before blowing up the host's planet.\n\n=== Other Fairies ===\n*{{anchor|Binky Abdul|Binky}}'''Binky Abdul''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is a meek yet optimistic fairy who is always getting hurt or beaten up by Jorgen.\n*{{anchor|Juandissimo Magnifico|Juandissimo}}'''Juandissimo Magnifico''' (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]) is Remy Buxaplenty's fairy godparent who speaks with a Spanish accent.

He is Wanda's ex-boyfriend and is still infatuated over her, much to Cosmo's chagrin. A running gag has him magically tearing off his white T-shirt to show off his muscles and then making it reappear shortly thereafter. In later seasons, Remy Buxaplenty was never heard or seen again.\n*{{anchor|Cupid}}'''Cupid''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) is a fairy who promotes love across the universe, yet his arrogance contrasts his love-themed abilities.\n*{{anchor|Tooth Fairy}}'''Tooth Fairy''' (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) is one of the few adult-sized fairies, which is dedicated to changing the teeth that children leave under the pillows for coins, and the wife of Jorgen Von Strangle.\n*{{anchor|Mama Cosma}}'''Mama Cosma''' (voiced by [[Jane Carr]]), Cosmo and Schnozmo's mother, loathes Wanda and repeatedly attempts to get rid of her because of the over-protective bond she has with her son.\n*{{anchor|Blonda Fairywinkle|Blonda}}'''Blonda Fairywinkle''' (voiced by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] in her first appearance and [[Tara Strong]] in all subsequent appearances) is the twin sister of Wanda.

Based on his mannerisms and [[Western (genre)|Western]] attire, he is most likely a parody of American businessman [[William Randolph Hearst]] and the [[Rich Texan]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]''.\n*{{anchor|King Gripullon|Queen Jipjorrulac}}'''King Gripullon and Queen Jipjorrulac''' (voiced respectively by [[Rob Paulsen]] and [[Laraine Newman]]) are Mark Chang's parents, and rulers of Yugopotamia.\n*{{anchor|Mr. Ed Leadly|Ed Leadly|Mr. Leadly}}'''Mr. Ed Leadly''' (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]], portrayed by [[Tony Alcantar]] in ''A Fairly Odd Summer'') is the president and CEO of Pencil Nexus, and boss of Timmy's Dad. His design resembles a small #2 pencil.\n*{{anchor|Clark Carmichael|Connie Carmichael}}'''Clark and Connie Carmichael''' (voiced respectively by [[Mick Wingert]] and [[Cheri Oteri]]) are Chloe's parents. He is a \"Professional Hero\", and she is an \"Extreme Veterinarian\".\n\n==Antagonists==\n===Denzel Crocker===\nDenzel Quincy Crocker, a.k.a. Mr. Crocker (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]], portrayed by [[David Lewis (Canadian actor)|David Lewis]] in the live-action movies), is a gray-skinned, hunchbacked man and Timmy's fairy-obsessed teacher. He correctly suspects that Timmy has fairy godparents of his own, and he is often able to tell what Timmy has wished for by the smallest, most irrelevant clues. His unshakable belief in fairy godparents leads to other adults perceiving him as mentally ill. crocker has been proven to be able to run at speeds of 120MPH and can lift 600 lbs and can worp the fabric of space and time \n\nCrocker has been shown to go to great extents to prove his theory that Timmy has fairy godparents, sinking vast quantities of money into expensive equipment and conducting elaborate experiments. He is also willing to do highly dangerous and immoral things to confirm the belief. For example, in his debut episode, \"Transparents!\", he attempts to test whether Cosmo and Wanda are fairies by trying to get them to sit in an [[electric chair]]. He states that, \"If they survive, they're fairies!\" but \"If they don't, I have [[tenure]]!\"\n\nSurprisingly, Crocker is the previous godchild of Cosmo and Wanda. Though he lost them and the memories of their time with him, his belief in fairies remains. Timmy tries to alter this event via time travel in \"The Secret Origin of Denzel Crocker!\", but he paradoxically fails and becomes the reason Crocker lost Cosmo and Wanda and made him remember his belief in fairies.\n\nAlthough being a middle-aged man, he still lives with his mother, Dolores Crocker. His father has never been seen or mentioned in the series.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Crocker served for many decades as the main power source for fairy magic; his belief is so strong that it was used to power the Big Wand, the source of all the magic in Fairy World. In one episode, this leads to the Big Wand losing all its power after he is hypnotized into believing fairies do not exist. To remedy this, Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda, Poof, and Jorgen make it so that everyone as equally crazy about fairies as Crocker is used as a source of power for the Big Wand.\n\n===Francis===\nFrancis (voiced by Faith Abrahams) is the school bully and another of Timmy's enemies. He has grey skin and a low pitched voice, and his clothes and underwear are ragged. In \"It's a Wishful Life\" it is revealed that if Timmy did not exist, Francis would funnel all of the aggression he expends bullying into football. \n\n===Anti-Fairies===\nThe Anti-Fairies, as their name suggests, are the evil opposite of fairies. The anti-fairies are responsible for all the bad luck on earth and, according to Cosmo, [[Friday the 13th]] is their \"Christmas\". Each fairy has an anti-fairy counterpart, who is their opposite in both personality and morality.\n\n{{anchor|Anti-Cosmo|Anti-Wanda}}'''Anti-Cosmo''' ([[Daran Norris]]) is portrayed as a cynical, evil, sadistic, and intelligent anti-fairy with a British accent, and is hinted to be the leader of the Anti-Fairies, while '''Anti-Wanda''' ([[Susanne Blakeslee]]), is portrayed as a dumb, hillbilly fairy who eats with her feet.\n\nThe Anti-Fairies reside in Anti-Fairy World, an enclosed environment within Fairy World, first shown as a chamber with a gate guarded by Jorgen. After Timmy accidentally set them free on Earth, Anti-Fairy World was turned into a prison-styled containment facility, where residents live in cells and wear suits preventing them from using magic. The high levels of security were still deemed penetrable, due in part to a specific group effort to get Anti-Cosmo out of Anti-Fairy World to be used as a donor for an operation. The Anti-Fairies serve as the main villains of ''The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2: When Nerds Collide'', ''Fairly OddBaby'', and ''Fairy Oddlympics''. They are fairly important villains early in the series, but have made few appearances after Poof is introduced.\n\n{{anchor|Anti Sparky|Anti-Sparky}}'''Anti Sparky''' is the evil version of Sparky who appeared in the episode \"Man's Worst Friend\". Unlike Sparky who is stupid yet very loyal and friendly, Anti Sparky is smart and takes advice from nobody.\n\n====Foop====\n[[File:Foop costume (3757044958).jpg|200px|thumb]]\nFoop (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]], portrayed by [[Scott Baio]] in ''[[A Fairly Odd Summer]]'') is the evil counterpart of Poof and the son of Anti-Cosmo and Anti-Wanda. Because Poof is so nice and attracts so much positive attention, Foop is portrayed as evil and extremely jealous of his counterpart. Foop wants nothing but to destroy Poof, and he cares not for anyone who gets in his way. Unlike Poof, who causes bad things to happen when he cries, Foop's cause good things to happen. \n\nFoop resembles Poof, but he is shaped like a cube rather than a ball. He also has a black mustache and goatee, the kind typically seen on stereotypical villains. Foop has bat wings and a black crown, and his wand is a baby bottle with bat wings on the side. He also speaks with a stereotypical British gentleman accent.\n\n===Pixies, Inc.===\nPixies, Inc. is an organization of magical pixies (all voiced by [[Ben Stein]]) who are similar to fairies but portrayed as monotonous, nearly identical businessmen who do not like anything amusing or fun. The pixies have square physical features, utilize [[mobile phones]] instead of wands, dress in predominantly greyscale outfits with cone-shaped hats, and require that wishes be submitted as multiple written copies and be subject to approval. When they warp from place to place, they use \"ping\" clouds instead of the fairies' traditional \"poof\" clouds. The Head Pixie (H.P.) and Sanderson are the two leaders of Pixies, Inc. On numerous occasions, they have attempted to take over Fairy World and replace all fairies with pixies using elaborate business schemes.  \n\n===Doctor Bender===\nDoctor Bender (voiced by [[Gilbert Gottfried]] in \"The Same Game\", \"Scary GodParents\", and \"Shiny Teeth\"; [[Butch Hartman]] onwards) is an evil dentist. He has an obsession with perfect teeth, wears dentures that keep his mouth in a perpetual smile, and is intolerant toward anyone who does not have quality teeth. His son, Wendell (also voiced by Gilbert Gottfried and later Butch Hartman), is almost identical to his father in appearance and is also tooth-hygienic, but hates it when his father scares off other kids. Doctor Bender enjoys performing pointless procedures on children's teeth and encourages children to eat refined sugar to boost his business.\n\n===Dark Laser===\nDark Laser (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a science fiction character who is first seen as an image of a catalog toy before Timmy brings him to life in \"Hard Copy\". In \"Escape from Unwish Island,\" Dark Laser is among the Unwished characters that work for Imaginary Gary. He becomes a recurring villain in season six, appearing in \"Mission: Responsible\", \"The End of Universe-ity\", \"Dread 'n' Breakfast\", \"Please Don't Feed The Turners\" and \"Momnipresent\". He parodies [[Darth Vader]] of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series. He is often seen carrying his mechanical toy dog Flipsy, whose backflipping function always makes him giggle.\n\n===Norm the Genie===\nNorm (voiced by [[Norm Macdonald]] in the series and by Robert Cait in \"[[Fairy Idol]]\") is a [[jinn|genie]] tired of being bound to his [[lava lamp]], into which he must return after being released and granting three wishes to his releaser. While there are no rules as to what wishes he can grant, he is deceptive and can find clever ways to subvert his master's expectations. After Timmy outsmarts him in his first appearance, he [[collusion|colludes]] with Crocker in his second appearance to get revenge on Timmy. In the special episode \"[[Fairy Idol]]\", he formulates a scheme to become a fairy godparent so he can escape his lamp and sabotages a \"Fairy Idol\" contest (parodying ''[[American Idol]]'') to reach this goal.\n\n===Princess Mandie===\nPrincess Mandie a.k.a. Man-DIE (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is Mark Chang's terrifying though beautiful former fiance\u00e9, a barbaric extraterrestrial princess who can be described as psychotically violent. Antagonized by Mark's intimidation about her and his refusal to marry her, Mandie constantly plots revengeful, bloodthirsty murder against him. It was later revealed Mandie never loved Mark and only wanted to marry him as a way of seizing power. Mandie was eventually defeated by Vicky when Timmy and Mark tricked Vicky into attacking her.\n\n===Remy Buxaplenty===\nRemy Buxaplenty (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is an [[archetypical]] privileged wealthy child, and one of Timmy's rivals. Despite being very rich, Remy is usually unhappy due to his neglectful, wealth-distracted parents, which is the reason why he has a fairy godparent, Wanda's ex-boyfriend Juandissimo. Both Remy and Timmy are aware of each other's fairy godparents, and Remy continuously tries to remove Timmy's fairies, primarily out of jealousy of not having both fairy and human parents who love him. Other than Timmy, and later, Chloe, he is the only known child in the series with a fairy godparent, though many episodes have featured a cameo of at least one unknown child with their fairy godparent. His last name is a pun of \"Bucks aplenty.\" He wasn't seen or heard in later seasons.\n\n===Crimson Chin Villains===\nThe enemies of Crimson Chin that threaten Chincinnati.\n\n*{{anchor|The Bronze Kneecap|Bronze Kneecap}}'''The Bronze Kneecap''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is the archenemy of the Crimson Chin and the founder of the Body of Evil. His origin story is explained in the episode \"The Masked Magician\": he was born Ron Hambone, a [[jai alai]] player famous for his numerous third-place wins. At one point, he was about to claim a first-place win for the first time, only to trip over the Crimson Chin's eponymous chin and break one of his knees. This led him to melt his trophies into a bronze cast suit of armor, inspiring his villain name. His particular ability involves shooting various weapons out of the kneecap pieces of his suit. He once tried to have his enemy pulverised by strapping him to a giant mechanical leg and have a giant doctor robot test the leg's reflex while simultaneously smashing the Chin, later revealed as part of a plan to destroy the City Hall via the leg's reflex kicking a giant soccer ball towards it.\n*{{anchor|Nega Chin}}'''Nega Chin''' (voiced by [[Jay Leno]]) is the evil twin of the Crimson Chin, who possesses the same powers. He wears a dark gray costume instead of red, has pointed teeth and red eyes, and has a [[no symbol]] over the C logo on his chin.\n*{{anchor|H2Olga}}'''H<sub>2</sub>Olga''' (voiced by [[Susanne Blakeslee]]) is a water-based villain in the Crimson Chin comics. In \"The Crime Wave\", it is revealed she becomes more powerful when she absorbs more water. She speaks with a [[Russian phonology|Russian accent]].\n*{{anchor|The Gilded Arches|Gilded Arches}}'''The Gilded Arches''' (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is a former child film actor who crushes theaters with his gigantic, golden legs and feet, his only body parts that grew during puberty. He is very fond of disco and has a golden tooth. He appears in both the Crimson Chin webcomics, in which he tried to destroy any and all theaters that no longer showed his films (including the Someguy Asian-American theater due to them never allowing Arches to put his feet in their cement) and the video game [[The Fairly OddParents: Breakin' da Rules|Breakin' da Rules]], in which he steals the Chin's speed.\n*{{anchor|The Titanium Toenail|Titanium Toenail}}'''The Titanium Toenail''' is a villain in the Crimson Chin comics. He has the ability to shoot from his helmet sharp projectiles shaped like toenail clippings, which can cut through metal.\n*{{anchor|The Iron Lung|Iron Lung}}'''The Iron Lung''' is a metal-based villain in the Crimson Chin comics. He is a robotic enemy that uses the power of wind, which he uses to blow heavy gusts at his enemies as well as vacuum anything in his path. In the webcomics he disrupted Chincinatti's 200th anniversary using his power not only to blow out the candle on a giant birthday cake commemorating the event but blow the cake (with the heroes on it) towards the city's Liberty Statue.\n*{{anchor|The Golden Gut|Golden Gut}}'''The Golden Gut''' is a villain in the Crimson Chin comics. His stomach is made of weighted metal, which extends from his body and rams into his adversaries.\n*{{anchor|The Copper Cranium|Copper Cranium}}'''The Copper Cranium''' is a villain in the Crimson Chin comics.

Coslo Puncholowski, is a hand-to-hand combat villain who has attempted to defeat the Crimson Chin in battle. As his name indicates, he has thick brass knuckles which enable him to punch through walls. He was once responsible for burglary spree of nail salons, glove factories and the bank (the latter out of the need to pay for the manicures and gloves)\n*{{anchor|Spatula Woman}}'''Spatula Woman''' (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) is a woman who uses a giant red spatula to squish her enemies. She made her first appearance in the segment \"Chin Up!\", where she first encounters Cleft. She returned in the video game [[The Fairly Oddparents: Breakin' Da Rules|Breakin' Da Rules]] as the villain who stole the Crimson Chin's charisma.\n*{{anchor|Short Fuse}}'''Short-Fuse''' is a short-statured, [[bomb]]-themed villain in the Crimson Chin comics. As his name suggests, he is distinguished by his short temper, which lights the fuse on the hat he wears; and he literally explodes when others call him \"small\", \"short\" and \"tiny\".\n\n===The Darkness===\n'''The Darkness''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is an ancient entity that has existed for millennia and the main antagonist in the first two thirds of the \"Wishology\" trilogy. It was first encountered by the Ancient Fairy Warriors. Only when the fairies combined their powers to neutralize the Darkness by using its natural enemy, light, did they manage to stop the Darkness completely. In \"Wishology\", the Darkness returns, seeking out the Chosen One prophesied to stop it: Turbo Thunder, a superhero who resembles Timmy. In \"Wishology 3: The Final Ending\", the Darkness' true intentions are revealed: it only wants to alleviate its lonely existence by making friends, but it frightens everyone on almost every planet it visits. Together, Timmy, Turbo Thunder, and their friends transform the Darkness into a light being called \"The Kindness\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n{{The Fairly OddParents}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The Fairly OddParents'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Characters In The Fairly Oddparents}}\n[[Category:The Fairly OddParents]]\n[[Category:Nicktoon characters|Fairly Oddparents The]]\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television animation|Fairly OddParents, The]]\n[[Category:Lists of children's television characters|Fairly OddParents]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a '''List of The Fairly OddParents characters'''. [[The Fairly OddParents]] is an [[America|American]] animated television show, created by [[Butch Hartman]].\n==Main==\n<!-- http://www.nick.com/shows/fairly-oddparents/characters/timmy-turner.html -->\n\n===Timmy Turner===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Timmy Turner pose.png|thumb|Timmy Turner]] -->\n\nVoiced by:\n* [[Tara Strong]]\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] \u2013 Adult Timmy in ''[[Channel Chasers]]'' episode\n* [[Mary Kay Bergman]] \u2013 ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' shorts\n\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Drake Bell]] \u2013 Live-action movies\n\nTimothy Tiberius \"Timmy\" Turner is a 10-year-old boy who was given fairy godparents to grant his every wish as a result of his neglectful parents and abuse from Vicky. He wears a pink hat and shirt with blue pants. He also has comically large front teeth, which are usually mocked. His wishes often have unpredictable and problematic side effects, and are often reverted upon Timmy's request by the end of the episode. His interests include comic books, video games, cartoons, and sports. During a time travel trip, Timmy accidentally arrives the day his parents moved into their house; unseen, he learns that they were expecting a girl, hence his pink hat.\n\n===Cosmo===\nVoiced by:\n* [[Daran Norris]]\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Jason Alexander]] (in ''[[A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!]]'')<ref name=\"screenrant.com\" />\n\nCosmo and Wanda are fairy godparents assigned to grant Timmy's, and later Chloe's, wishes. They were previously the godparents of Denzel Crocker, Billy Gates, Tina Turner, and other historical and modern day figures; such as [[Benjamin Franklin]]. To avoid being seen by humans other than Timmy, they often disguise themselves as animals or inanimate objects.\n\nCosmo is Wanda's husband, Poof's father, and Timmy and Chloe's godfather. He is known for his stupidity and has been responsible for inadvertently causing disasters since he was born. As explained in \"Fairly Oddbaby\", Cosmo's ability for destruction is such that when he was born, all fairies were henceforth no longer allowed to have children out of the fear that another potential fairy baby would be as bad as or worse than Cosmo. Although he is very laid back and dim, Cosmo is prone to fits of jealousy and becomes defensive when he sees others flirting with Wanda. He was the youngest fairy until Poof was born and, though he was considered an only child in earlier episodes, has a brother named Schnozmo that debuts later. His mother, Mama Cosma, is overprotective of Cosmo and thus despises Wanda. Cosmo has green hair and typically wears a white shirt, black pants, and a black necktie.  \n\n===Wanda===\nVoiced by:\n* [[Susanne Blakeslee]]\n\nPortrayed by:\n* [[Cheryl Hines]] (in [[A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!]]<ref name=\"screenrant.com\">{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/fairly-oddparents-movie-alexander-hines-sandy-71777/ |title=Early Look At 'Fairly Oddparents' Movie |publisher=Screen Rant |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2011-06-01}}</ref>)\n\nWanda Venus Cosma (n\u00e9e Fairywinkle) is Cosmo's wife, Poof's mother, and Timmy and Chloe's godmother. She is depicted as being smart and caring. Unlike Cosmo, she tries to prevent Timmy from wishing for things which can be disastrous, though her attempts often fail. However, she is responsible for [[K-t event|the extinction of dinosaurs, 65 million years ago]]. She has a sister, who is a popular actress, named Blonda whom she fights with a lot, as Wanda believes her sister's life as a Soap Star is easier than hers as a housewife. Wanda also has a father named Big Daddy, who also despised Cosmo similar to how Mama Cosma dislikes Wanda but to a much lesser extent. She has pink hair styled with a swirl in front and is usually shown wearing a yellow T-shirt and black pants. Wanda has an [[chocoholic|obsession with chocolate]], and it is one of the only things that can distract her from her top priorities.\n\n===Vicky ===\n<!-- DO NOT MOVE VICKY FROM MAIN --->\nVicky (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]], portrayed by Devon Weigel in the live-action movies), is Timmy's rude, selfish, greedy, sadistic, conniving, malicious, and tyrannical 16-year-old babysitter and the main antagonist of the series. She has but a few friends and enjoys torturing children, watching television and making the world miserable, especially for Timmy. She lives with her mother, her father, and her younger sister Tootie. She has encountered Cosmo & Wanda on numerous occasions, but does not believe in them.\n\nAlso, she has encountered Mark Chang in his natural form but dismisses it as a Halloween costume. A plot point in the episode \"Frenemy Mine\" involved her belonging to a dark society known as B.R.A.T. (Babysitters Raging Against Twerps). She has been shown to be accepting of her own cruelty, and that the only reason she is, is that she was mistreated as a child by her own babysitter.\n\n===Poof===\nPoof Cosma (voiced by Tara Strong, Jeff Bennett in ''Certifiable Super Sitter'') is Cosmo and Wanda's son, introduced into the series in the 2008 special ''[[Fairly OddBaby]]''. He was the first fairy baby born in over ten thousand years, with his own father being the second to last. His magical abilities are controlled by his emotions and channeled through his magic rattle. \n\nIn \"Fairy Old Parent\", Poof is assigned to his very first person as a fairy godparent as his own, for miserable old people; such as Mrs. Crocker. He grants her wishes but became overworked and exhausted, returning to Cosmo and Wanda.\n\nIn the Season 10 episode \"Certifiable Super Sitter\", Poof returned from Spellementary [[Boarding School]] for spring break. His voice has gotten deeper and more comical as part of his formal training to be a great fairy. Chloe goes completely crazy over him, as she loves babies.\n\n===Sparky===\nSparky (voiced by [[Maddie Taylor|Matthew Taylor]]) is Timmy's talking fairy dog, who was a character in [[The Fairly OddParents (season 9)|season 9]], but was dropped from the show before season 10 due to negative reception. Sparky has orange fur, a wand for a tail, a blue nose, and fairy wings. He wears a fairy crown and a blue collar. Sparky's magic tail doesn't work when he is wet. He has magic fleas that will turn people into dogs if bitten. He is highly allergic to pasta, and is capable of performing human acts, such as driving. Unlike Timmy's fairy godparents, it is okay for other people to know about Sparky, but they cannot know that he can talk.\n\n===Chloe Carmichael===\nChloe Carmichael (voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]) is Timmy's neighbor who debuts in the [[The Fairly OddParents (season 10)|season 10]] premiere episode, \"The Big Fairy Share Scare.\" Due to there not being enough fairies available for kids, she and Timmy are forced to share Cosmo and Wanda. Although in the beginning they do not get along, they end up becoming best friends. Chloe is seen by Timmy as an annoying, goody goody, and boastful, little girl and she has the tendency to cause chaos with her wishes.\n\n==Supporting==\n\n===Mr. and Mrs. Turner===\nEdgar Turner, also known as Dad or Mr. Turner, (voiced by Daran Norris, portrayed by Norris in the live-action films) and Clemence Turner, also known as Mom or Mrs. Turner, (Susanne Blakeslee, portrayed by [[Teryl Rothery]] in the live-action films) are Timmy's parents. Mom is a real estate agent and home dealer; and Dad works as an employee of a pencil factory called Pencil Nexus and troop leader for Timmy's Squirrelly Scouts Troop, though both have had several other jobs, usually only for a single episode. Mom is shown to be a horrible gardener and cook, as anything she tries to grow dies and her meals usually come alive and try to attack her family. Dad is often shown hating the Dinklebergs, the next door neighbors, which can be compared to [[Homer Simpson]]'s hatred for [[Ned Flanders]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]''.  Both are completely oblivious to the magic in their home, and despite their love for Timmy, tend to be somewhat neglectful. They leave Timmy with Vicky, his babysitter, and are oblivious to signs that she is evil; even going as far as believing that the song \"Icky Vicky\" was about pumpkins.\n\n=== Chester McBadbat ===\nChester McBadbat (voiced by [[Frankie Muniz]] in 2001\u20132003; [[Jason Marsden]] in 2003\u20132017) is one of Timmy's best friends. He lives in a trailer with his father in an impoverished community with few amenities. He is generous and cares more for others than himself, as every time he has obtained magic, he has used his wishes to try to improve the lives of others, even though it usually leads to disaster. He becomes the only classmate of Timmy to know about his godparents' existence in ''[[Fairy Idol]]'', but it is not mentioned again in later episodes. He often wears worn-in, oversized clothes. He has freckles, green eyes, [[dental braces]], and blonde shaggy hair and eyebrows.\n\nHe was played by Chris Anderson in ''A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!''.\n\n=== A.J. ===\nA.J. (voiced by Ibrahim Haneef Muhammad (2001\u20132003), [[Gary LeRoi Gray]] (2003\u20132017)) is the resident genius in Timmy's class, and one of his best friends. He comes from an upper-middle-class family, and is a straight \"A\" student in school, a quality both his parents have achieved as well. He has constructed an older brother who defends him from bullies, fulfilling his need for a real one. He plays with video games and reads comic books like his other friends, in spite of his superior intellect. He has a secret laboratory that he conceals with a \"cloak\" button on his bedroom wall which, when pressed, converts his lab into a typical bedroom.\n\nHe was played by Jesse Reid in ''A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!''.\n\n=== Jorgen Von Strangle ===\nJorgen Von Strangle (voiced by [[Daran Norris]], played by [[Mark Gibbon]] in the live-action movies) is the toughest fairy in the universe who speaks with an Austrian accent and is a high-ranking official in Fairy World. Unlike other fairies who \"poof\" from place to place, Jorgen appears and disappears in the form of an atomic explosion and has a [[jet pack]] instead of wings. In \"The Zappies\", he mentioned he has had only one godchild, Winston; the reason for this, as revealed in \"Temporary Fairy\", is that his extreme wish-granting and daredevil stunts unnecessarily endanger the lives of godchildren. He is [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] and enjoys the idea of others cowering in fear of him, which affects his ability to have friends besides Cosmo and Wanda. Although Jorgen is known as the toughest fairy in Fairy World, he is seen multiple times crying in front of Cosmo and Wanda. In 'Teeth for Two', it is revealed that he dated the Tooth Fairy before breaking up over Timmy's teeth. He married her at the end of the episode, but the marriage was not mentioned since. It is revealed in \"Cosmo Rules\" that Cosmo is his distant cousin. \n\n=== Tootie ===\nTootie (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]] in the TV series, Amber Hood in the ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' episode \"The Fairy Flu\", portrayed in the live-action movies by [[Daniella Monet]]) is Vicky's younger sister. She is a bespectacled girl who has an [[obsessive love|obsessive crush]] on Timmy, often going to the extreme of spying on and stalking him. While Timmy rejects her regularly, he does have a soft spot for her and does nice things for her in several episodes, including sending Cosmo and Wanda out on loan for her birthday after Vicky ruins it. When Vicky isn't torturing the children she babysits, she regularly tortures Tootie at home in substitution.\n\n=== Mark Chang ===\nMark Chang (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is an alien prince from the planet of [[Tyche (hypothetical planet)|Yugopotamia]] (located almost 10,760 astronomical units away from Earth) and one of Timmy's friends. Chang resembles a green squid-like creature with a brain contained in glass. He also features a \"Fake-i-fier\" on his waist, allowing him to shapeshift into objects and human forms. Introduced in \"Spaced Out\", Chang and the other aliens of Yugopotamia are horrified by things commonly considered cute and are attracted to disgusting objects (like manure) and people. As such, Chang has a crush on Vicky, who is unaware that he is a real alien. His parents, King Gripullon and Queen Jipjorrulac (voiced by Paulsen and Laraine Newman, respectively) eventually marry Chang to the vicious, homicidal Princess Mandie (pronounced \"Man-DIE\"). To escape her wrath, Chang relocates to the Dimmsdale Dump on Earth. He also celebrates F.L.A.R.G., a holiday celebrating revolting activities before blowing up the host's planet.\n\n=== Other Fairies ===\n*{{anchor|Binky Abdul|Binky}}'''Binky Abdul''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is a meek yet optimistic fairy who is always getting hurt or beaten up by Jorgen.\n*{{anchor|Juandissimo Magnifico|Juandissimo}}'''Juandissimo Magnifico''' (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]) is Remy Buxaplenty's fairy godparent who speaks with a Spanish accent. He is often a villain in the episodes in which he appears alongside his godchild, but is actually a kind fairy whom Timmy considers a friend. He is Wanda's ex-boyfriend and is still infatuated over her, much to Cosmo's chagrin. A running gag has him magically tearing off his white T-shirt to show off his muscles and then making it reappear shortly thereafter. In later seasons, Remy Buxaplenty was never heard or seen again.\n*{{anchor|Cupid}}'''Cupid''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) is a fairy who promotes love across the universe, yet his arrogance contrasts his love-themed abilities.\n*{{anchor|Tooth Fairy}}'''Tooth Fairy''' (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) is one of the few adult-sized fairies, which is dedicated to changing the teeth that children leave under the pillows for coins, and the wife of Jorgen Von Strangle.\n*{{anchor|Mama Cosma}}'''Mama Cosma''' (voiced by [[Jane Carr]]), Cosmo and Schnozmo's mother, loathes Wanda and repeatedly attempts to get rid of her because of the over-protective bond she has with her son.\n*{{anchor|Blonda Fairywinkle|Blonda}}'''Blonda Fairywinkle''' (voiced by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] in her first appearance and [[Tara Strong]] in all subsequent appearances) is the twin sister of Wanda. She is far more self-centered and vain compared to Wanda. She is the star of the [[soap opera]] \"All My Biceps\" which is Jorgen's favorite show.\n*{{anchor|Dr. Rip Studwell|Rip Studwell|Dr. Studwell}}'''Dr. Rip Studwell''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] in the first appearance, [[Butch Hartman]] in later appearances) is a fairy doctor who insists on being referred to by his full name and usually plays golf and spends time with ladies rather than performing medical procedures.\n*{{anchor|Big Daddy Fairywinkle}}'''Big Daddy Fairywinkle''' (voiced by [[Tony Sirico]]) is the father of Wanda and Blonda.

Due to Timmy not being popular, Trixie rarely acknowledges his existence, except in secret. It is revealed that she likes comic books, but keeps it a secret to maintain her popularity. There is some debate amongst fans of the show between whom Timmy will end up with due to the end of \"Channel Chasers\", where his children (especially daughter Tammy) have physical similarities of both Trixie and Tootie\n*{{anchor|Veronica}}'''Veronica''' (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]) is Trixie Tang's obsessive best friend who wants to be Trixie.

Though he has many standard superhero abilities such as flight, superior strength, and heat vision, his main weapon is his enormous chin, a reference to that of his voice actor.

Nevertheless, Sheldon is a well-meaning and friendly neighbor and puts up with Mr. Turner's hatred of him, and he even humors the theories Mr. Turner makes about himself. He and his wife, Mrs. Dinkleberg (voiced by [[Susan Blakeslee]]) do not have any children and so can afford many luxuries that the Turners cannot.\n*{{anchor|Bucky McBadbat}}'''Bucky McBadbat''' (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is Chester's father and former baseball player who was kicked out of the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] for being, per Timmy's words, \"the worst baseball player ever\".

He is a hippy that lives in a trailer and collects items made of \"smoof\" which he calls \"the greatest natural occurring substance in the world\".

He is a \"Professional Hero\", and she is an \"Extreme Veterinarian\".\n\n==Antagonists==\n===Denzel Crocker===\nDenzel Quincy Crocker, a.k.a. Mr. Crocker (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]], portrayed by [[David Lewis (Canadian actor)|David Lewis]] in the live-action movies), is a gray-skinned, hunchbacked man and Timmy's fairy-obsessed teacher. He correctly suspects that Timmy has fairy godparents of his own, and he is often able to tell what Timmy has wished for by the smallest, most irrelevant clues. His unshakable belief in fairy godparents leads to other adults perceiving him as mentally ill.\n\nCrocker has been shown to go to great extents to prove his theory that Timmy has fairy godparents, sinking vast quantities of money into expensive equipment and conducting elaborate experiments. He is also willing to do highly dangerous and immoral things to confirm the belief. For example, in his debut episode, \"Transparents!\", he attempts to test whether Cosmo and Wanda are fairies by trying to get them to sit in an [[electric chair]]. He states that, \"If they survive, they're fairies!\" but \"If they don't, I have [[tenure]]!\"\n\nSurprisingly, Crocker is the previous godchild of Cosmo and Wanda. Though he lost them and the memories of their time with him, his belief in fairies remains. Timmy tries to alter this event via time travel in \"The Secret Origin of Denzel Crocker!\", but he paradoxically fails and becomes the reason Crocker lost Cosmo and Wanda and made him remember his belief in fairies.\n\nAlthough being a middle-aged man, he still lives with his mother, Dolores Crocker. His father has never been seen or mentioned in the series.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Crocker served for many decades as the main power source for fairy magic; his belief is so strong that it was used to power the Big Wand, the source of all the magic in Fairy World. In one episode, this leads to the Big Wand losing all its power after he is hypnotized into believing fairies do not exist. To remedy this, Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda, Poof, and Jorgen make it so that everyone as equally crazy about fairies as Crocker is used as a source of power for the Big Wand.\n\n===Francis===\nFrancis (voiced by Faith Abrahams) is the school bully and another of Timmy's enemies. He has grey skin and a low pitched voice, and his clothes and underwear are ragged. In \"It's a Wishful Life\" it is revealed that if Timmy did not exist, Francis would funnel all of the aggression he expends bullying into football. \n\n===Anti-Fairies===\nThe Anti-Fairies, as their name suggests, are the evil opposite of fairies. The anti-fairies are responsible for all the bad luck on earth and, according to Cosmo, [[Friday the 13th]] is their \"Christmas\". Each fairy has an anti-fairy counterpart, who is their opposite in both personality and morality.\n\n{{anchor|Anti-Cosmo|Anti-Wanda}}'''Anti-Cosmo''' ([[Daran Norris]]) is portrayed as a cynical, evil, sadistic, and intelligent anti-fairy with a British accent, and is hinted to be the leader of the Anti-Fairies, while '''Anti-Wanda''' ([[Susanne Blakeslee]]), is portrayed as a dumb, hillbilly fairy who eats with her feet.\n\nThe Anti-Fairies reside in Anti-Fairy World, an enclosed environment within Fairy World, first shown as a chamber with a gate guarded by Jorgen. After Timmy accidentally set them free on Earth, Anti-Fairy World was turned into a prison-styled containment facility, where residents live in cells and wear suits preventing them from using magic. The high levels of security were still deemed penetrable, due in part to a specific group effort to get Anti-Cosmo out of Anti-Fairy World to be used as a donor for an operation. The Anti-Fairies serve as the main villains of ''The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2: When Nerds Collide'', ''Fairly OddBaby'', and ''Fairy Oddlympics''. They are fairly important villains early in the series, but have made few appearances after Poof is introduced.\n\n{{anchor|Anti Sparky|Anti-Sparky}}'''Anti Sparky''' is the evil version of Sparky who appeared in the episode \"Man's Worst Friend\". Unlike Sparky who is stupid yet very loyal and friendly, Anti Sparky is smart and takes advice from nobody.\n\n====Foop====\n[[File:Foop costume (3757044958).jpg|200px|thumb]]\nFoop (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]], portrayed by [[Scott Baio]] in ''[[A Fairly Odd Summer]]'') is the evil counterpart of Poof and the son of Anti-Cosmo and Anti-Wanda. Because Poof is so nice and attracts so much positive attention, Foop is portrayed as evil and extremely jealous of his counterpart. Foop wants nothing but to destroy Poof, and he cares not for anyone who gets in his way. Unlike Poof, who causes bad things to happen when he cries, Foop's cause good things to happen. \n\nFoop resembles Poof, but he is shaped like a cube rather than a ball. He also has a black mustache and goatee, the kind typically seen on stereotypical villains. Foop has bat wings and a black crown, and his wand is a baby bottle with bat wings on the side. He also speaks with a stereotypical British gentleman accent.\n\n===Pixies, Inc.===\nPixies, Inc. is an organization of magical pixies (all voiced by [[Ben Stein]]) who are similar to fairies but portrayed as monotonous, nearly identical businessmen who do not like anything amusing or fun. The pixies have square physical features, utilize [[mobile phones]] instead of wands, dress in predominantly greyscale outfits with cone-shaped hats, and require that wishes be submitted as multiple written copies and be subject to approval. When they warp from place to place, they use \"ping\" clouds instead of the fairies' traditional \"poof\" clouds. The Head Pixie (H.P.) and Sanderson are the two leaders of Pixies, Inc. On numerous occasions, they have attempted to take over Fairy World and replace all fairies with pixies using elaborate business schemes.  \n\n===Doctor Bender===\nDoctor Bender (voiced by [[Gilbert Gottfried]] in \"The Same Game\", \"Scary GodParents\", and \"Shiny Teeth\"; [[Butch Hartman]] onwards) is an evil dentist. He has an obsession with perfect teeth, wears dentures that keep his mouth in a perpetual smile, and is intolerant toward anyone who does not have quality teeth. His son, Wendell (also voiced by Gilbert Gottfried and later Butch Hartman), is almost identical to his father in appearance and is also tooth-hygienic, but hates it when his father scares off other kids. Doctor Bender enjoys performing pointless procedures on children's teeth and encourages children to eat refined sugar to boost his business.\n\n===Dark Laser===\nDark Laser (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is a science fiction character who is first seen as an image of a catalog toy before Timmy brings him to life in \"Hard Copy\". In \"Escape from Unwish Island,\" Dark Laser is among the Unwished characters that work for Imaginary Gary. He becomes a recurring villain in season six, appearing in \"Mission: Responsible\", \"The End of Universe-ity\", \"Dread 'n' Breakfast\", \"Please Don't Feed The Turners\" and \"Momnipresent\". He parodies [[Darth Vader]] of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series. He is often seen carrying his mechanical toy dog Flipsy, whose backflipping function always makes him giggle.\n\n===Norm the Genie===\nNorm (voiced by [[Norm Macdonald]] in the series and by Robert Cait in \"[[Fairy Idol]]\") is a [[jinn|genie]] tired of being bound to his [[lava lamp]], into which he must return after being released and granting three wishes to his releaser. While there are no rules as to what wishes he can grant, he is deceptive and can find clever ways to subvert his master's expectations. After Timmy outsmarts him in his first appearance, he [[collusion|colludes]] with Crocker in his second appearance to get revenge on Timmy. In the special episode \"[[Fairy Idol]]\", he formulates a scheme to become a fairy godparent so he can escape his lamp and sabotages a \"Fairy Idol\" contest (parodying ''[[American Idol]]'') to reach this goal.\n\n===Princess Mandie===\nPrincess Mandie a.k.a. Man-DIE (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is Mark Chang's terrifying though beautiful former fiance\u00e9, a barbaric extraterrestrial princess who can be described as psychotically violent. Antagonized by Mark's intimidation about her and his refusal to marry her, Mandie constantly plots revengeful, bloodthirsty murder against him. It was later revealed Mandie never loved Mark and only wanted to marry him as a way of seizing power. Mandie was eventually defeated by Vicky when Timmy and Mark tricked Vicky into attacking her.\n\n===Remy Buxaplenty===\nRemy Buxaplenty (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is an [[archetypical]] privileged wealthy child, and one of Timmy's rivals. Despite being very rich, Remy is usually unhappy due to his neglectful, wealth-distracted parents, which is the reason why he has a fairy godparent, Wanda's ex-boyfriend Juandissimo. Both Remy and Timmy are aware of each other's fairy godparents, and Remy continuously tries to remove Timmy's fairies, primarily out of jealousy of not having both fairy and human parents who love him. Other than Timmy, and later, Chloe, he is the only known child in the series with a fairy godparent, though many episodes have featured a cameo of at least one unknown child with their fairy godparent. His last name is a pun of \"Bucks aplenty.\" He wasn't seen or heard in later seasons.\n\n===Crimson Chin Villains===\nThe enemies of Crimson Chin that threaten Chincinnati.\n\n*{{anchor|The Bronze Kneecap|Bronze Kneecap}}'''The Bronze Kneecap''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is the archenemy of the Crimson Chin and the founder of the Body of Evil. His origin story is explained in the episode \"The Masked Magician\": he was born Ron Hambone, a [[jai alai]] player famous for his numerous third-place wins. At one point, he was about to claim a first-place win for the first time, only to trip over the Crimson Chin's eponymous chin and break one of his knees. This led him to melt his trophies into a bronze cast suit of armor, inspiring his villain name. His particular ability involves shooting various weapons out of the kneecap pieces of his suit. He once tried to have his enemy pulverised by strapping him to a giant mechanical leg and have a giant doctor robot test the leg's reflex while simultaneously smashing the Chin, later revealed as part of a plan to destroy the City Hall via the leg's reflex kicking a giant soccer ball towards it.\n*{{anchor|Nega Chin}}'''Nega Chin''' (voiced by [[Jay Leno]]) is the evil twin of the Crimson Chin, who possesses the same powers.

He is very fond of disco and has a golden tooth. He appears in both the Crimson Chin webcomics, in which he tried to destroy any and all theaters that no longer showed his films (including the Someguy Asian-American theater due to them never allowing Arches to put his feet in their cement) and the video game [[The Fairly OddParents: Breakin' da Rules|Breakin' da Rules]], in which he steals the Chin's speed.\n*{{anchor|The Titanium Toenail|Titanium Toenail}}'''The Titanium Toenail''' is a villain in the Crimson Chin comics. He has the ability to shoot from his helmet sharp projectiles shaped like toenail clippings, which can cut through metal.\n*{{anchor|The Iron Lung|Iron Lung}}'''The Iron Lung''' is a metal-based villain in the Crimson Chin comics. He is a robotic enemy that uses the power of wind, which he uses to blow heavy gusts at his enemies as well as vacuum anything in his path.

His stomach is made of weighted metal, which extends from his body and rams into his adversaries.\n*{{anchor|The Copper Cranium|Copper Cranium}}'''The Copper Cranium''' is a villain in the Crimson Chin comics.

Coslo Puncholowski, is a hand-to-hand combat villain who has attempted to defeat the Crimson Chin in battle.

She made her first appearance in the segment \"Chin Up!\", where she first encounters Cleft. She returned in the video game [[The Fairly Oddparents: Breakin' Da Rules|Breakin' Da Rules]] as the villain who stole the Crimson Chin's charisma.\n*{{anchor|Short Fuse}}'''Short-Fuse''' is a short-statured, [[bomb]]-themed villain in the Crimson Chin comics. As his name suggests, he is distinguished by his short temper, which lights the fuse on the hat he wears; and he literally explodes when others call him \"small\", \"short\" and \"tiny\".\n\n===The Darkness===\n'''The Darkness''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is an ancient entity that has existed for millennia and the main antagonist in the first two thirds of the \"Wishology\" trilogy. It was first encountered by the Ancient Fairy Warriors. Only when the fairies combined their powers to neutralize the Darkness by using its natural enemy, light, did they manage to stop the Darkness completely. In \"Wishology\", the Darkness returns, seeking out the Chosen One prophesied to stop it: Turbo Thunder, a superhero who resembles Timmy. In \"Wishology 3: The Final Ending\", the Darkness' true intentions are revealed: it only wants to alleviate its lonely existence by making friends, but it frightens everyone on almost every planet it visits. Together, Timmy, Turbo Thunder, and their friends transform the Darkness into a light being called \"The Kindness\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n{{The Fairly OddParents}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The Fairly OddParents'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Characters In The Fairly Oddparents}}\n[[Category:The Fairly OddParents]]\n[[Category:Nicktoon characters|Fairly Oddparents The]]\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television animation|Fairly OddParents, The]]\n[[Category:Lists of children's television characters|Fairly OddParents]]\n", "name_user": "Derpboi9000", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Fairly_OddParents_characters"}

The word ''risali'' (follower of the message) was inspired by the [[Quran|Quranic]] verse: \"[Allah praises] those who convey the ''messages'' of Allah and fear Him and do not fear anyone but Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant.\" [<nowiki/>[[Al-A\u1e25z\u0101b|33]]:39].\n\nBefore the Iranian revolution, the group remained a secret organisation, working on raising religious awareness, however, after the revolution, in 1979, it went public, calling for [[Islamism]] in the [[Middle East|region]], with different aliases across various countries. In Iraq, it was known as the [[Islamic Action Organisation]]. In Saudi Arabia, it was known as the Islamic Revolution of the Arabian Peninsula. In Bahrain, it was known as the Islamic Front for Liberation of Bahrain and headed by his brother [[Hadi al-Modarresi|Hadi]]. But all these groups were identified as the ''risalis'' in the Islamic world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Lobad|first=Adil|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4E5HAQAAIAAJ&q|title=al-Inqilab, Bay'

some [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] activists to support the movement in their writings, this included Dr. Ahmed al-Abyadh of the [[Renaissance (Tunisia)|Renaissance Organisation]] in [[Tunisia]] and various activists from [[Morocco]].\n\nDespite the ''risali'' term being used in Iraq, it really resonated with many activist groups across the Islamic world, transcending differences and any sectarianism that existed in the region.\n\nMany books were issued to propagate the Risali Movement, some of the ones al-Modarresi wrote included:\n\n*''Fi Suluk al-Risali'' (The Ways of a Risali)\n*''Kayfa Nunami al-Fi'at al-Risaliya'' (How We Develop Risali Factions)\n*''al-Masjid Muntalaq al-Thawra al-Risaliya'' (The Mosque Is The Starting Point of The Risali Revolution)\n*''Khalaya al-Muqawama al-Risaliya''

The building had three floors, which later, was split into departments for teaching and research as well as more accommodation. There is also a large theatre hall outside the buildings, with tiered seating, used for lectures, plays, and functions for religious events.

It began with introducing a mandatory [[Persian language|Farsi]] class of 2.5 hours a day. This then was followed by the introduction of a few other lessons like ''al-A'immah al-Ithna Ashar'' by Adil al-Adib.\n\nIn 1990, the seminary was stormed by 10 armed Iranian soldiers, and they began to arrest whoever was in front of them. However, when they noticed that all of those inside were either in black or white turbans, and since it was close to [[Zuhr prayer|Dhuhr]], they were preparing for prayer, the soldiers were surprised. So they told one of the senior teachers; \"We're confused, we were told to break into this seminary because it was infested with Munafeqi Khalq (derogatory name for [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mujahedin Khalq]]), not religious people like yourselves.\" The soldiers then left that evening.\n\nA few days later, the seminary was stormed again, under the command of Shaykh Safarian this time. He ordered everyone to leave the seminary immediately. [[Nimr al-Nimr]] (who was known by his code name - Shaykh Jihad - at the time) protested Safarian's command, and said that they will not move until al-Modarresi is phoned and informed of what was happening. When the news reached al-Modarresi, he ordered that nobody leave, unless an official order is issued by [[Ali Khamenei|Khamenei's]] office. It got rather heated between Nimr and Safarian, until the official order from Khamenei's office came in. However it was in Farsi, to which Nimr protested again, and requested it be in Arabic. After much frustration, the Arabic order came in, ordering the vacant possession of the seminary, and that was the last of the seminary.<ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Lobad|first=Adil|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4E5HAQAAIAAJ&q|title=al-Inqilab, Bay' al-Qiyam 'Alal Thaat|date=|publisher=Laila for Publishing & Distributing|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=339-40|language=Arabic|trans-title=Coups, Selling Morals For Ego}}</ref>\n\n'''- Al-Jaafaria Shia Islamic Centre''' -

The word ''risali'' (follower of the message) was inspired by the [[Quran|Quranic]] verse: \"[Allah praises] those who convey the ''messages'' of Allah and fear Him and do not fear anyone but Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant.\" [<nowiki/>[[Al-A\u1e25z\u0101b|33]]:39].\n\nBefore the Iranian revolution, the group remained a secret organisation, working on raising religious awareness, however, after the revolution, in 1979, it went public, calling for [[Islamism]] in the [[Middle East|region]], with different aliases across various countries. In Iraq, it was known as the [[Islamic Action Organisation]]. In Saudi Arabia, it was known as the Islamic Revolution of the Arabian Peninsula. In Bahrain, it was known as the Islamic Front for Liberation of Bahrain and headed by his brother [[Hadi al-Modarresi|Hadi]]. But all these groups were identified as the ''risalis'' in the Islamic world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Lobad|first=Adil|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4E5HAQAAIAAJ&q|title=al-Inqilab, Bay'

some [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] activists to support the movement in their writings, this included Dr. Ahmed al-Abyadh of the [[Renaissance (Tunisia)|Renaissance Organisation]] in [[Tunisia]] and various activists from [[Morocco]].\n\nDespite the ''risali'' term being used in Iraq, it really resonated with many activist groups across the Islamic world, transcending differences and any sectarianism

The seminary was split into two buildings. The first building was previously a women's society building in the time of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]. It then became a seminary for the ladies, and accommodation for married students. The second building was one of [[Farah Pahlavi|Princess Farah's]] palaces. The building had three floors, which later, was split into departments for teaching and research as well as more accommodation. There is also a large theatre hall outside the buildings, with tiered seating, used for lectures, plays, and functions for religious events. Near the theatre hall there is a large kitchen, where food is made and prepared. The seminary's library stands to the right of its entrance.

It began with introducing a mandatory [[Persian language|Farsi]] class of 2.5 hours a day. This then was followed by the introduction of a few other lessons like ''al-A'immah al-Ithna Ashar'' by Adil al-Adib.\n\nIn 1990, the seminary was stormed by 10 armed Iranian soldiers, and they began to arrest whoever was in front of them. However, when they noticed that all of those inside were either in black or white turbans, and since it was close to [[Zuhr prayer|Dhuhr]], they were preparing for prayer, the soldiers were surprised. So they told one of the senior teachers; \"We're confused, we were told to break into this seminary because it was infested with Munafeqi Khalq (derogatory name for [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mujahedin Khalq]]), not religious people like yourselves.\" The soldiers then left that evening.\n\nA few days later, the seminary was stormed again, under the command of Shaykh Safarian this time. He ordered everyone to leave the seminary immediately. [[Nimr al-Nimr]] (who was known by his code name - Shaykh Jihad - at the time) protested Safarian's command, and said that they will not move until al-Modarresi is phoned and informed of what was happening. When the news reached al-Modarresi, he ordered that nobody leave, unless an official order is issued by [[Ali Khamenei|Khamenei's]] office. It got rather heated between Nimr and Safarian, until the official order from Khamenei's office came in. However it was in Farsi, to which Nimr protested again, and requested it be in Arabic.

The present Thai royal family, the [[Chakri dynasty]], was founded by King [[Rama I]] who himself was partly Chinese. His predecessor, King [[Taksin]] of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]], was the son of a Thai mother and a Chinese immigrant from [[Guangdong]] Province. With the highly successful integration of historic Chinese immigrant communities throughout Thailand, a significant number of Thai Chinese are the descendants of intermarriages between ethnic Chinese and native Thais.

William Skinner]] observed that the level of assimilation of the descendants of Chinese immigrants in Thailand disproved the \"myth about the 'unchanging Chinese'\", noting that \"''assimilation is considered complete when the immigrant's descendant identifies himself in almost all social situations as a Thai, speaks Thai language habitually and with native fluency, and interacts by choice with Thai more often than with Chinese.''\" {{sfn|Skinner|1957|page=237}} Skinner believed that the assimilation success of the Thai Chinese was a result of the wise policy of the Thai rulers who, since the 17th century, allowed able Chinese tradesmen to advance their ranks into the kingdom's nobility.{{sfn|Skinner|1957|page=240-41}} The rapid and successful assimilation of the Thai Chinese has been celebrated by the Chinese descendants themselves, as evident in contemporary literature such as the novel ''Letters from Thailand'' ({{lang-th|\u0e08\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22}}) by Botan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Letters from Thailand: A Novel|isbn=9747551675|author1=B\u014dtan|date=2002-01-01}}</ref>\n\nToday, the Thai Chinese constitute a significant part of the royalist/nationalist movements. When the then prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], who is Thai Chinese, was ousted from power in 2006, it was [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], another prominent Thai Chinese businessman, who formed and led People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) movement to protest the successive governments run by Thaksin's allies.<ref>[https://www.pressreader.com/thailand/the-nation/20091019/282110632670264 The Symbolism of Sondhi's Hat]</ref><ref>[https://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20080805-80724.html Thai PM condemns race-baiting at anti-govt rally]</ref> Mr. Sondhi accused Mr. Thaksin of corruption based on improper business ties between Thaksin's corporate empire and the Singapore-based [[Temasek Holdings|Temasek Holdings Group]].<ref>{{cite website|title=Sondhi Limthongkul|website=Political Prisoners in Thailand|url=https://thaipoliticalprisoners.wordpress.com/pendingcases/sondhi-limthongkul/|date=2009-01-23}}</ref> The Thai Chinese in and around Bangkok were also the main participants of the months-long political campaign against the government of Ms. Yingluck (Mr. Thaksin's sister), between November 2013 and May 2014, the event which culminated in the military takeover in May 2014.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/01/21/why-thai-politics-is-broken Why Thai politics is broken]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Han Chinese]] traders, mostly from [[Fujian province|Fujian]] and [[Guangdong province|Guangdong]], began arriving in [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] by at least the 13th century. According to the ''Chronicles of Ayutthaya'', [[Sanpet III|King Ekathotsarot]] (r. 1605\u20131610) had been \"concerned solely with ways of enriching his treasury,\" and was \"greatly inclined toward strangers and foreign nations,\" especially [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[China]], [[Japan]], and the [[Philippines]].\n\nAyutthaya was under almost constant [[Burmese\u2013Siamese wars|Burmese threat]] from the 16th century onward, and the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] was alarmed by Burmese military might. From 1766-1769, the Qianlong Emperor sent his armies four times to subdue the [[Myanmar|Burmese]], but the [[Sino-Burmese War]]s ended in complete failure and Ayutthaya fell in the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)]]. However, the Chinese efforts did divert the attention of Burma's Siam army. General [[Taksin]], himself the son of a Chinese immigrant, took advantage of this to organize his force and attack the Burmese invaders. When he became king, Taksin actively encouraged Chinese immigration and trade. Settlers mainly from [[Chaozhou]] prefecture came to Siam in large numbers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Blood Brothers: The Criminal Underworld of Asia|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|isbn=1-4039-6154-9|page=234|author-link=Bertil Lintner|year=2003}}</ref> Immigration continued over the following years, and the Chinese population in Thailand jumped from 230,000 in 1825 to 792,000 by 1910. By 1932, approximately 12.2 percent of the population of Thailand was Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Short History of China and Southeast Asia: Tribute, Trade and Influence|last=Stuart-Fox|first=Martin|publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]]|isbn=1-86448-954-5|page=126|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe early Chinese immigration consisted almost entirely of men who did not bring women. Therefore, it became common for male Chinese immigrants to marry local Thai women. The children of such relationships were called ''Sino-Thai''<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Thailand|author=Smith Nieminen Win|isbn=0-8108-5396-5|page=231|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2005|edition=2nd}}</ref> or ''luk-jin'' (\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e08\u0e35\u0e19) in Thai.<ref>{{cite book|title=In the Place of Origins: Modernity and Its Mediums in Northern Thailand|author= Rosalind C.

If successful, they sent money back to their families in China. Many Chinese immigrants prospered under the \"[[tax farming]]\" system, whereby private individuals were sold the right to collect taxes at a price below the value of the tax revenues.\n\nIn the late 19th century, when Thailand was struggling to defend its independence from the colonial powers, Chinese bandits from Yunnan Province began making raids into the country in the [[Haw Wars]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e0f\u0e2e\u0e48\u0e2d}}). Thai nationalist attitudes at all levels were thus colored by anti-Chinese sentiment. Members of the Chinese community had long dominated domestic commerce and had served as agents for royal trade monopolies. With the rise of European economic influence, however, many Chinese shifted to opium trafficking and tax collecting, both of which were despised occupations.\n\nFrom 1882 to 1917, nearly 13,000 to 34,000 Chinese entered the country per year from [[southern China]] which was vulnerable to [[flood]]s and [[drought]], mostly settling in [[Bangkok]] and along the coast of the [[Gulf of Siam]]. They predominated in occupations requiring arduous labor, skills, or entrepreneurship. They worked as blacksmiths, railroad laborers and [[rickshaw]] pullers. While most Thais were engaged in rice production, the Chinese brought new farming ideas and new methods to supply labor on its rubber plantations,  both domestically and internationally.<ref name=\"Sowell 1997 182\u2013184\"/> However, [[republicanism|republican]] ideas brought by the Chinese were considered seditious by the Thai government. For example, a translation of Chinese revolutionary [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ''[[Three Principles of the People]]'' was banned under the Communism Act of 1933. The government had regulated [[Chinese school]]s even before [[compulsory education]] was established in the country, starting with the Private Schools Act of 1918. This act required all foreign teachers to pass a [[Thai language]] test and for principals of all schools to implement standards set by the Thai [[Ministry of Education (Thailand)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"W\">{{cite news|title=Contending for a Claim on Civilization: The Sino-Siamese Struggle to Control Overseas Chinese Education in Siam|first=Wasana|last=Wongsurawat|journal=Journal of Chinese Overseas|volume=4|number=2| date=November 2008 |pages=161\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nLegislation by King [[Vajiravudh|Rama VI (1910\u20131925)]] that required the adoption of Thai surnames was largely directed at the Chinese community as a number of ethnic Chinese families left [[Burma]] between 1930 and 1950 and settled in the [[Ratchaburi Province|Ratchaburi]] and [[Kanchanaburi Province]]s of western Thailand. A few of the ethnic Chinese families in that area had already emigrated from Burma in the 19th century.\n\nThe Chinese in Thailand also suffered discrimination between the 1930s to 1950s under the military dictatorship of Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (in spite of having part-Chinese ancestry himself),<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of the Modern Politics of South-East Asia|last=Leifer|first=Michael|year=1996|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-13821-3|page=204}}</ref> which allied itself with the [[Empire of Japan]]. The Primary Education Act of 1932 made the [[Thai language]] the compulsory medium of education, but as a result of protests from Thai Chinese, by 1939, students were allowed two hours per week of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] instruction.<ref name=\"W\"/> State corporations took over commodities such as rice, tobacco, and petroleum and Chinese businesses found themselves subject to a range of new taxes and controls. By 1970, more than 90 percent of the Chinese born in [[Thailand]] had abandoned Chinese citizenship and were granted Thai citizenship instead. In 1975, diplomatic relations were established with China.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/wjb/zzjg/yzs/gjlb/2787/ |title= Bilateral Relations   |accessdate= 2010-06-12 |date= 2003-10-23 |publisher= Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the People's Republic of China |quote= On July 1, 1975, China and Thailand established Diplomatic relations.}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nIntermarriage with the [[Thai people|Thais]] has resulted in many people who claim Thai ethnicity with Chinese ancestry or mixed.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Thai Economy: Uneven Development and internationalisation|last=Dixon|first=Chris|year=1999|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-02442-0|page=267}}</ref> People of Chinese descent are concentrated in the coastal areas of Thailand, principally [[Bangkok]] and Paknampho ([[Nakhonsawan]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=50 Plus One Greatest Cities in the World You Should Visit|author=Paul J.

His predecessor, King [[Taksin]] of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]], was the son of a Thai mother and a Chinese immigrant from [[Guangdong]] Province. With the highly successful integration of historic Chinese immigrant communities throughout Thailand, a significant number of Thai Chinese are the descendants of intermarriages between ethnic Chinese and native Thais.

When the then prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], who is Thai Chinese, was ousted from power in 2006, it was [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], another prominent Thai Chinese businessman, who formed and led People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) movement to protest the successive governments run by Thaksin's allies.<ref>[https://www.pressreader.com/thailand/the-nation/20091019/282110632670264 The Symbolism of Sondhi's Hat]</ref><ref>[https://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20080805-80724.html Thai PM condemns race-baiting at anti-govt rally]</ref> Mr. Sondhi accused Mr. Thaksin of corruption based on improper business ties between Thaksin's corporate empire and the Singapore-based [[Temasek Holdings|Temasek Holdings Group]].<ref>{{cite website|title=Sondhi Limthongkul|website=Political Prisoners in Thailand|url=https://thaipoliticalprisoners.wordpress.com/pendingcases/sondhi-limthongkul/|date=2009-01-23}}</ref> The Thai Chinese in and around Bangkok were also the main participants of the months-long political campaign against the government of Ms. Yingluck (Mr. Thaksin's sister), between November 2013 and May 2014, the event which culminated in the military takeover in May 2014.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2014/01/21/why-thai-politics-is-broken Why Thai politics is broken]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Han Chinese]] traders, mostly from [[Fujian province|Fujian]] and [[Guangdong province|Guangdong]], began arriving in [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] by at least the 13th century. According to the ''Chronicles of Ayutthaya'', [[Sanpet III|King Ekathotsarot]] (r. 1605\u20131610) had been \"concerned solely with ways of enriching his treasury,\" and was \"greatly inclined toward strangers and foreign nations,\" especially [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[China]], [[Japan]], and the [[Philippines]].\n\nAyutthaya was under almost constant [[Burmese\u2013Siamese wars|Burmese threat]] from the 16th century onward, and the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] was alarmed by Burmese military might. From 1766-1769, the Qianlong Emperor sent his armies four times to subdue the [[Myanmar|Burmese]], but the [[Sino-Burmese War]]s ended in complete failure and Ayutthaya fell in the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)]]. However, the Chinese efforts did divert the attention of Burma's Siam army. General [[Taksin]], himself the son of a Chinese immigrant, took advantage of this to organize his force and attack the Burmese invaders. When he became king, Taksin actively encouraged Chinese immigration and trade. Settlers mainly from [[Chaozhou]] prefecture came to Siam in large numbers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Blood Brothers: The Criminal Underworld of Asia|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|isbn=1-4039-6154-9|page=234|author-link=Bertil Lintner|year=2003}}</ref> Immigration continued over the following years, and the Chinese population in Thailand jumped from 230,000 in 1825 to 792,000 by 1910.

Therefore, it became common for male Chinese immigrants to marry local Thai women. The children of such relationships were called ''Sino-Thai''<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Thailand|author=Smith Nieminen Win|isbn=0-8108-5396-5|page=231|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2005|edition=2nd}}</ref> or ''luk-jin'' (\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e08\u0e35\u0e19) in Thai.<ref>{{cite book|title=In the Place of Origins: Modernity and Its Mediums in Northern Thailand|author= Rosalind C.

If successful, they sent money back to their families in China. Many Chinese immigrants prospered under the \"[[tax farming]]\" system, whereby private individuals were sold the right to collect taxes at a price below the value of the tax revenues.\n\nIn the late 19th century, when Thailand was struggling to defend its independence from the colonial powers, Chinese bandits from Yunnan Province began making raids into the country in the [[Haw Wars]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e0f\u0e2e\u0e48\u0e2d}}). Thai nationalist attitudes at all levels were thus colored by anti-Chinese sentiment. Members of the Chinese community had long dominated domestic commerce and had served as agents for royal trade monopolies. With the rise of European economic influence, however, many Chinese shifted to opium trafficking and tax collecting, both of which were despised occupations.\n\nFrom 1882 to 1917, nearly 13,000 to 34,000 Chinese entered the country per year from [[southern China]] which was vulnerable to [[flood]]s and [[drought]], mostly settling in [[Bangkok]] and along the coast of the [[Gulf of Siam]]. They predominated in occupations requiring arduous labor, skills, or entrepreneurship. They worked as blacksmiths, railroad laborers and [[rickshaw]] pullers. While most Thais were engaged in rice production, the Chinese brought new farming ideas and new methods to supply labor on its rubber plantations,  both domestically and internationally.<ref name=\"Sowell 1997 182\u2013184\"/> However, [[republicanism|republican]] ideas brought by the Chinese were considered seditious by the Thai government. For example, a translation of Chinese revolutionary [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s ''[[Three Principles of the People]]'' was banned under the Communism Act of 1933. The government had regulated [[Chinese school]]s even before [[compulsory education]] was established in the country, starting with the Private Schools Act of 1918. This act required all foreign teachers to pass a [[Thai language]] test and for principals of all schools to implement standards set by the Thai [[Ministry of Education (Thailand)|Ministry of Education]].<ref name=\"W\">{{cite news|title=Contending for a Claim on Civilization: The Sino-Siamese Struggle to Control Overseas Chinese Education in Siam|first=Wasana|last=Wongsurawat|journal=Journal of Chinese Overseas|volume=4|number=2| date=November 2008 |pages=161\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nLegislation by King [[Vajiravudh|Rama VI (1910\u20131925)]] that required the adoption of Thai surnames was largely directed at the Chinese community as a number of ethnic Chinese families left [[Burma]] between 1930 and 1950 and settled in the [[Ratchaburi Province|Ratchaburi]] and [[Kanchanaburi Province]]s of western Thailand. A few of the ethnic Chinese families in that area had already emigrated from Burma in the 19th century.\n\nThe Chinese in Thailand also suffered discrimination between the 1930s to 1950s under the military dictatorship of Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (in spite of having part-Chinese ancestry himself),<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of the Modern Politics of South-East Asia|last=Leifer|first=Michael|year=1996|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-13821-3|page=204}}</ref> which allied itself with the [[Empire of Japan]]. The Primary Education Act of 1932 made the [[Thai language]] the compulsory medium of education, but as a result of protests from Thai Chinese, by 1939, students were allowed two hours per week of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] instruction.<ref name=\"W\"/> State corporations took over commodities such as rice, tobacco, and petroleum and Chinese businesses found themselves subject to a range of new taxes and controls. By 1970, more than 90 percent of the Chinese born in [[Thailand]] had abandoned Chinese citizenship and were granted Thai citizenship instead.

This Government has known the Philippine insurgents only as discontented and rebellious subjects of Spain and is not acquainted with their purposes. While their contest with that power has been a matter of public notoriety, they have neither asked nor received from this Government any recognition. The United States, in entering upon the occupation of the islands, as the result of its military operations in that quarter, will do so in the exercise of the rights which the state of war confers, and will expect from the inhabitants, without regard to their former attitude toward the Spanish Government, that obedience which will be lawfully due from them.\n\nIf in the course of your conferences with General Aguinaldo, you acted upon the assumption that this Government would co-operate with him for the furtherance of any plan of his own, or that, in accepting his co-operation, it would consider itself pledged to recognize any political claims which he may put forward, your action was unauthorized and can not be approved.}}\n\nFilipino scholar [[Maximo Kalaw]] wrote in 1927: \"A few of the principal facts, however, seem quite clear. Aguinaldo was not made to understand that, in consideration of Filipino cooperation, the United States would extend its sovereignty over the Islands, and thus in place of the old Spanish master a new one would step in.

Day]], explaining the details of his meeting with Aguinaldo: {{cquote|\"At this interview, after learning from General Aguinaldo the state of an object sought to be obtained by the present insurrectionary movement, which, though absent from the Philippines, he was still directing, I took it upon myself, whilst explaining that I had no authority to speak for the Government, to point out the danger of continuing independent action at this stage; and, having convinced him of the expediency of cooperating with our fleet, then at Hongkong, and obtained the assurance of his willingness to proceed thither and confer with Commodore Dewey to that end, should the latter so desire, I telegraphed the Commodore the same day as follows, through our consul-general at Hongkong:--<ref>{{Harvnb|Worcester|1914|p=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=56151&pageno=19 19]}}</ref>}}\n\nThere was no mention in the cablegrams between Pratt and Dewey of independence or indeed of any conditions on which Aguinaldo was to cooperate, these details being left for future arrangement with Dewey. Pratt had intended to facilitate the occupation and administration of the Philippines, and also to prevent a possible conflict of action. In a communication written on July 28, Pratt made the following statement: {{cquote|\"I declined even to discuss with General Aguinaldo the question of the future policy of the United States with regard to the Philippines, that I held out no hopes to him of any kind, committed the government in no way whatever, and, in the course of our confidences, never acted upon the assumption that the Government would cooperate with him--General Aguinaldo--for the furtherance of any plans of his own, nor that, in accepting his said cooperation, it would consider itself pledged to recognize any political claims which he might put forward.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Worcester|1914|p=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=56151&pageno=21 21]}}</ref>}}\n[[File:Pic geo photos - ph=cavite=kawit=aguinaldo shrine - front view -philippines--2015-0611--ls- (1).JPG|thumb|[[Aguinaldo Shrine]] where the [[Flag of the Philippines]] was waved declaring Philippine independence from Spain]]\nOn June 16, Secretary Day cabled Consul Pratt: \"Avoid unauthorized negotiations with the Philippine insurgents,\" and later on the same day:<ref name=\"Halstead1898ch28p311\">{{Harvnb|Halstead|1898|Ref=Halstead1898ch28|p=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=58428&pageno=311 311]}} Ch.28</ref> {{cquote|The Department observes that you informed General Aguinaldo that you had no authority to speak for the United States; and, in the absence of the fuller report which you promise, it is assumed that you did not attempt to commit this Government to any alliance with the Philippine insurgents. To obtain the unconditional personal assistance of General Aguinaldo in the expedition to Manila was proper if in so doing he was not induced to form hopes which it might not be practicable to gratify. This Government has known the Philippine insurgents only as discontented and rebellious subjects of Spain and is not acquainted with their purposes. While their contest with that power has been a matter of public notoriety, they have neither asked nor received from this Government any recognition. The United States, in entering upon the occupation of the islands, as the result of its military operations in that quarter, will do so in the exercise of the rights which the state of war confers, and will expect from the inhabitants, without regard to their former attitude toward the Spanish Government, that obedience which will be lawfully due from them.\n\nIf in the course of your conferences with General Aguinaldo, you acted upon the assumption that this Government would co-operate with him for the furtherance of any plan of his own, or that, in accepting his co-operation, it would consider itself pledged to recognize any political claims which he may put forward, your action was unauthorized and can not be approved.}}\n\nFilipino scholar [[Maximo Kalaw]] wrote in 1927: \"A few of the principal facts, however, seem quite clear. Aguinaldo was not made to understand that, in consideration of Filipino cooperation, the United States would extend its sovereignty over the Islands, and thus in place of the old Spanish master a new one would step in. The truth was that nobody at the time ever thought that the end of the war would result in the retention of the Philippines by the United States.\"<ref name=\"Kalaw1927p100\">{{harvnb|Kalaw|1927|pp=[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=philamer;cc=philamer;rgn=full%20text;idno=afj2233.0001.001;didno=AFJ2233.0001.001;view=image;seq=120;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset 100 (Ch.5)]}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Agoncillo|first=Teodoro A.|title=History of the Filipino People|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoffilipin00teod|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=Garotech Publishing|isbn=978-971-8711-06-4|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Duka|first=Cecilio D.|title=Struggle for Freedom' 2008 Ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wk8yqCEmJUC|year=2008|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-5045-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Elliott|first=Charles Burke|title=The Philippines:  To the End of the Commission Government, a Study in Tropical Democracy|url=http://www.minnesotalegalhistoryproject.org/assets/Elliott%20end%20Philippines%20Comm.%20Govt%20(1917).pdf|year=1917|ref=harv|format=pdf}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Guevara|1972}} |reference=Guevara, Sulpico ed. 1972.
