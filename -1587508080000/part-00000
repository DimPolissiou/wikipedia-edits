After he films her swimming, she asks him to film her continuously for two days and he agrees. Everything seems normal until Mashiro kills her \"boyfriend\" who was a former bully and delinquent, while Machiya films it all. He then finds out Mashiro is uploading videos to a website called Dead Tube, where users post content and are rewarded with money based on the number of views they get. The users are encouraged to post videos, but there is a catch: the person or people whose video gets the fewest views has to pay for the expenses and the crimes of all the other participants. As Machiya gets dragged deeper and deeper into the world of Dead Tube, he starts questioning his ambiguous relationship with Mashiro and the dark feelings lying within himself.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|'''Tomohiro Machiya'''|\u753a\u8c37 \u667a\u6d69}}\n:The protagonist of the series. He is a member of the film research society. He is unwillingly brought into Dead Tube when Mashiro poses as his bully's girlfriend and had him film her while she kills his bully. At the beginning, he is easily frightened when it comes to the idea of killing, but as the series progresses, he is shown to have less and less aversion and his fear is replaced by a dull lack of interest. He is shown to be an expert cameraman, not flinching or fazing while filming, and always catching the lead actor (usually Mashiro) in their most beautiful state. While filming, his personality changes drastically, and he remains completely focused on the film. He has a younger sister, who becomes the victim of a Dead tube game, in an attempt to draw out his talent. \n;{{Nihongo|'''Mai Mashiro'''|\u771f\u57ce \u821e}}\n:The heroine of the series. She is the one who brought Machiya into Dead Tube by asking him to film her continuously for two days, and then killing a bully that terrorized Machiya before the series, after posing as the bully's girlfriend. She is in love with Machiya for various reasons, and always states that he is the one \"who captures me (on camera) most beautifully\". She is a violent and ruthless killer, and shows little to no empathy for others, except for Machiya. She is extremely possessive of him, and will even respond with lethal force to any woman who tries to steal his affections. Her primary weapon of choice is a collapsible baton. She is also a virgin.\n:It is revealed that she met Machiya at one point in their childhood and became fascinated with his desire to capture beautiful things on camera, and made him promise to capture her on camera in the same way. \n;{{Nihongo|'''Hanae Miwa'''|\u4e09\u8f2a \u82b1\u6c5f}}\n:Another girl in Machiya's class who got into Dead Tube carelessly without finding out all the instructions before hand. As a result she was under the belief that one would receive a pay as long as they were first, and was unaware of the penalty until Machiya warned her. After her first game, she teamed up with Machiya and Mashiro, and remains the most humane in the group as she responds to death and torture in an angry manner, different from Machiya's and Mashiro's indifference. She often tries to make Machiya \"normal\" and is relieved by his acts of normalcy, such as lust when she tries to have sex with him, and fear when he discovers his sister is placed in a Dead Tube game. Mashiro often treats her as a rival and has once tried to kill her because she nearly had sex with Machiya.\n:Despite her initial carefree and callous demeanor, she is actually kind hearted and willing to place others before herself.\n\n==Volumes==\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n| OneLanguage    = yes\n| Width          = 75%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 1\n| RelDate

The film is based on the [[X-Men]] superhero team appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. It is the [[sequel]] to 2000's ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', as well as the second installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], and features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[James Marsden]], [[Rebecca Romijn|Rebecca Romijn-Stamos]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Alan Cumming]], [[Bruce Davison]], and [[Anna Paquin]]. Its plot, inspired by the [[graphic novel]] ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]'', concerns the [[genocide|genocidal]] Colonel [[William Stryker]] leading an assault on [[Professor X]]avier's school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer [[Cerebro]], in order to destroy every mutant on Earth and to \"save\" the human race from them, forcing the X-Men to team up with the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], their former enemies, to stop Stryker and save the mutant race.\n\nDevelopment on the sequel began shortly after the first film was released in 2000. [[David Hayter]] and [[Zak Penn]] wrote separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. [[Michael Dougherty]] and [[Dan Harris (screenwriter)|Dan Harris]] were eventually hired to rewrite the work, and changed the characterizations of [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], and [[Lady Deathstrike]]. [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and the [[Danger Room]] were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns. The film's premise was influenced by the Marvel Comics storylines ''[[List of Ultimate X-Men story arcs#Return to Weapon X|Return to Weapon X]]'' and ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]''. Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November, mostly taking place at [[Vancouver Film Studios]], the largest North American production facility outside of Los Angeles. [[Production design]]er [[Guy Hendrix Dyas]] adapted similar designs by [[John Myhre]] from the previous film.\n\n''X2'' was released in the United States on May 2, 2003 by [[20th Century Fox]], and received positive reviews for its storyline, action sequences, and performances. The film grossed $407 million worldwide, and received eight [[Saturn Award]]s nominations. A sequel, ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', was released in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[White House]], brainwashed teleporting [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] attempts to assassinate the [[President of the United States]] but before he can do so, is shot and retreats. Meanwhile, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in [[Alberta]] for clues to his past, but finds nothing. Jean has been having premonitions and struggles to concentrate as her powers become increasingly difficult to control. Later, Wolverine returns to [[Professor Xavier]]'s school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using [[Cerebro]]. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] go to question the imprisoned [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] about the attack, while X-Men [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Jean Grey]] retrieve Nightcrawler. Military scientist Colonel [[William Stryker]] approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants in the wake of the recent attack. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] leads the remaining students to safety while Wolverine, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] escape, and Stryker's assistant [[Lady Deathstrike|Yuriko Oyama]] captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack Wolverine confronts Stryker, who addresses him by name and seems to know about his past.\n\nThe shape-shifting [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] gains information about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics for a second Cerebro. Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents in [[Boston]] and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]] is attacked by fighter jets while flying back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it and Xavier to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, [[Jason Stryker|Jason]], is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, whom Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker was the man who grafted his [[adamantium]] skeleton onto his bones and is responsible for his amnesia. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake.\n\nDisguised as Logan, Mystique infiltrates Stryker's base. She lets the rest of the mutants in and Magneto and Mystique go to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Jean fights a mind-controlled Cyclops; their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins to rupture. Wolverine finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it as where he received his adamantium skeleton. Wolverine fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter's wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on normal humans. The two subsequently use Stryker's helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro who has been swayed to Magneto's views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control.\n\nThe X-Men flee the dam as water engulfs it, killing Stryker, but the X-Jet loses all power and struggles to take flight as the flood water rushes towards them. Jean sneaks off the jet and telepathically wishes the team goodbye. She holds back the water and raises the jet above it as flames erupt from her body, until she lets go and allows the flood to crash down upon her, presumably killing her. The X-Men give the president Stryker's files, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Wolverine remember Jean, and Xavier begins to hold a class.\n\nA [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix-like shape]] rises from the flooded Alkali Lake.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier / Professor X]]: A powerful [[telepathic]] mutant confined to a wheelchair who founded a School for \"Gifted Youngsters\", Xavier is a [[pacifist]] who believes humans and mutants can live together in harmony. He uses the [[Cerebro]] device, designed by Magneto and himself, to track and locate mutants across the world. A natural genius, Xavier is regarded as an authority on genetic mutation.\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Wolverine (character)|Logan / Wolverine]]: A mysterious mutant who suffers from amnesia and has little to no recollection of his past life before he was grafted with an indestructible [[Adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] skeleton. Wolverine is a gruff loner, but is in love with Jean Grey and acts as a father figure to Rogue. He wields three highly durable adamantium blades that come out of each of his fists, has keen animal-like senses, the ability to heal rapidly from virtually any injury, and is a ruthless and aggressive fighter.\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: Once Xavier's ally, Magneto now believes mutants are superior to humans and that a genetic war is coming. Magneto wields the ability to manipulate metal magnetically, as well as the power to create magnetic fields and fly. He wears a helmet that renders him immune to Xavier's powers and all related telepathic powers. Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information over Cerebro and the Xavier Institute, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker. He has demonstrated sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation and engineering. The character's helmet was slightly redesigned as McKellen found wearing it uncomfortable in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591281/s Louise Mingenbach], United Colors of ''X2'', 2003, [[20th Century Fox]]</ref>\n* [[Halle Berry]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: An African mutant and teacher at Xavier's School who can control the weather with her mind.

and written by [[Michael Dougherty]], [[Dan Harris (screenwriter)|Dan Harris]] and [[David Hayter]], from a story by Singer, Hayter and [[Zak Penn]]. The film is based on the [[X-Men]] superhero team appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. It is the [[sequel]] to 2000's ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', as well as the second installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], and features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[James Marsden]], [[Rebecca Romijn|Rebecca Romijn-Stamos]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Alan Cumming]], [[Bruce Davison]], and [[Anna Paquin]]. Its plot, inspired by the [[graphic novel]] ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]'', concerns the [[genocide|genocidal]] Colonel [[William Stryker]] leading an assault on [[Professor X]]avier's school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer [[Cerebro]], in order to destroy every mutant on Earth and to \"save\" the human race from them, forcing the X-Men to team up with the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], their former enemies, to stop Stryker and save the mutant race.\n\nDevelopment on the sequel began shortly after the first film was released in 2000. [[David Hayter]] and [[Zak Penn]] wrote separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. [[Michael Dougherty]] and [[Dan Harris (screenwriter)|Dan Harris]] were eventually hired to rewrite the work, and changed the characterizations of [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], and [[Lady Deathstrike]]. [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and the [[Danger Room]] were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns. The film's premise was influenced by the Marvel Comics storylines ''[[List of Ultimate X-Men story arcs#Return to Weapon X|Return to Weapon X]]'' and ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]''. Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November, mostly taking place at [[Vancouver Film Studios]], the largest North American production facility outside of Los Angeles. [[Production design]]er [[Guy Hendrix Dyas]] adapted similar designs by [[John Myhre]] from the previous film.\n\n''X2'' was released in the United States on May 2, 2003 by [[20th Century Fox]], and received positive reviews for its storyline, action sequences, and performances. The film grossed $407 million worldwide, and received eight [[Saturn Award]]s nominations. A sequel, ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', was released in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[White House]], brainwashed teleporting [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] attempts to assassinate the [[President of the United States]] but before he can do so, is shot and retreats. Meanwhile, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in [[Alberta]] for clues to his past, but finds nothing. Jean has been having premonitions and struggles to concentrate as her powers become increasingly difficult to control. Later, Wolverine returns to [[Professor Xavier]]'s school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using [[Cerebro]]. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] go to question the imprisoned [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] about the attack, while X-Men [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Jean Grey]] retrieve Nightcrawler. Military scientist Colonel [[William Stryker]] approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants in the wake of the recent attack. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] leads the remaining students to safety while Wolverine, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] escape, and Stryker's assistant [[Lady Deathstrike|Yuriko Oyama]] captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack Wolverine confronts Stryker, who addresses him by name and seems to know about his past.\n\nThe shape-shifting [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] gains information about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics for a second Cerebro. Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents in [[Boston]] and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]] is attacked by fighter jets while flying back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it and Xavier to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, [[Jason Stryker|Jason]], is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, whom Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker was the man who grafted his [[adamantium]] skeleton onto his bones and is responsible for his amnesia. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake.\n\nDisguised as Logan, Mystique infiltrates Stryker's base. She lets the rest of the mutants in and Magneto and Mystique go to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Jean fights a mind-controlled Cyclops; their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins to rupture. Wolverine finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it as where he received his adamantium skeleton. Wolverine fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter's wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on normal humans. The two subsequently use Stryker's helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro who has been swayed to Magneto's views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control.\n\nThe X-Men flee the dam as water engulfs it, killing Stryker, but the X-Jet loses all power and struggles to take flight as the flood water rushes towards them. Jean sneaks off the jet and telepathically wishes the team goodbye. She holds back the water and raises the jet above it as flames erupt from her body, until she lets go and allows the flood to crash down upon her; presumably killing her. The X-Men give the president Stryker's files, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Wolverine remember Jean, and Xavier begins to hold a class.\n\nA [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix-like shape]] rises from the flooded Alkali Lake.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier / Professor X]]: A powerful [[telepathic]] mutant confined to a wheelchair who founded a School for \"Gifted Youngsters\", Xavier is a [[pacifist]] who believes humans and mutants can live together in harmony.

Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information over Cerebro and the Xavier Institute, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker. He has demonstrated sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation and engineering.

The following Sunday I saw on a train a blind preacher selling a ballad he had composed on the disaster. The title was 'Didn't that ship go down?'\" (cited by Habling 2008)</ref> Recordings of various songs about the disaster date to as early as 1913.<ref name = \"habing\">Habing 2008</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n\nThe canonical version of the song has the chorus:<ref name = \"habing\" />\n{{poemquote|It was sad when that great ship went down\nHusbands and wives and little children lost their lives\nIt was sad when that great ship went down}}\nIn most variants, although not the earliest,<ref>White 1928 (cited by Habing 2008)</ref> the chorus starts with a line \"it was sad, so sad, it was sad\", and in many versions, the line \"to the bottom of the...\" appended after the repeat of \"went down.\"  Other than the chorus, different versions may contain verses in different order.\n\nThere are several regional variations on the song. According to Newman I. White's 1928 book ''American Negro Folk-Songs'', \"The Titanic\" has been traced back to 1915 or 1916 in [[Hackleburg, Alabama]]. Other versions from around 1920 are documented in the Frank C. Brown Collection at [[Duke University]] in [[North Carolina]].

According to Newman I. White's 1928 book ''American Negro Folk-Songs'', \"The Titanic\" has been traced back to 1915 or 1916 in [[Hackleburg, Alabama]]. Other versions from around 1920 are documented in the Frank C. Brown Collection at [[Duke University]] in [[North Carolina]].

It established the [[Latin Empire]] and arranged the nominal partition of the Byzantine territory among the participants of the Crusade, with the [[Republic of Venice]] being the greatest titular beneficiary. However, because the crusaders did not in fact control most of the Empire, with local Byzantine Greek nobles establishing the Byzantine successor kingdoms ([[Empire of Nicaea]], [[Empire of Trebizond]], [[Despot of Epirus]]), most of the crusaders' declared division of the Empire amongst themselves could never be implemented. While the ordeal was a major blow to the Empire, the Empire of Nicaea would, in 1261, retake Constantinople, re-establishing the Byzantine Empire.\n\n==Background==\nIn March 1204, shortly before the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack]] of [[Constantinople]] in April, the Crusaders made a preliminary arrangement on the partition of the Byzantine territories between themselves.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|pp=179\u2013180}} This text, concluded between the principal leaders of the Crusade, the [[Doge of Venice]] [[Enrico Dandolo]], Marquess [[Boniface of Montferrat]], Count [[Baldwin of Flanders]], and Count [[Louis I of Blois]], has been preserved among the letters of [[Pope Innocent III]].{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1856|pp=444\u2013452}} According to its stipulations, the Venetians would retain their previous privileges granted by the Byzantine emperors, and a common committee, composed in equal numbers of Venetians and Crusaders, would elect an emperor for the [[Latin Empire]] to be established after the conquest of the city. The Latin Emperor would receive one quarter of all territories, as well as the palaces of [[Blachernae Palace|Blachernae]] and [[Boukoleon Palace|Boukoleon]] in the city. The remaining three quarters of the Byzantine territories would be divided equally between Venice and the other Crusaders.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=180}} On 9 May, Baldwin of Flanders was elected Latin Emperor, in place of the previous leader of the Crusade, Boniface of Montferrat. According to the Crusader and chronicler [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]], by previous agreement, Boniface should receive the territories lying beyond the [[Bosporus]] and [[Marmara Sea]], \"towards Turkey\", as well as \"the isle of Greece\". However, to placate Boniface, Baldwin agreed to assign to him the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] instead.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=181}}\n\nThe agreement, which was promulgated either in late September or early October 1204 (according to the opinions of W. Heyd, [[Dionysios Zakythinos]], and A. Carile) or (according to [[Nikolaos Oikonomides]]) immediately after the sack in April\u2013May 1204,{{sfn|Brand|1991|pp=1591\u20131592}} was drafted by a 24-man committee consisting of 12 Venetians and 12 representatives of the other Crusader leaders.{{sfn|Brand|1991|pp=1591\u20131592}} The Venetians played a major role in the proceedings, as they had first-hand knowledge of the area, and many of the final text's provisions can be traced to the imperial [[chrysobull]] [[Byzantine\u2013Venetian treaty of 1198|granted to Venice in 1198]] by [[Alexios III Angelos]].{{sfn|Nicol|1988|p=149}} It gave the Latin Emperor direct control of one fourth of the former Byzantine territory, to Venice three eighths \u2013 including three eighths of the city of Constantinople, with [[Hagia Sophia]] \u2013 and the remaining three eighths were apportioned among the other Crusader chiefs. Through this division, Venice became the chief power in Latin Romania, and the effective power behind the Latin Empire, a fact clearly illustrated by the lofty title its [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] acquired: {{lang|la|Dominator quartae et dimidiae partis totius Romaniae}} (\"Lord of a quarter and a half quarter of all of ''Romania''\").\n\nThe treaty survives in a number of manuscripts, all from Venice: the ''Liber Albus'' (fols. 34ff.), the ''Liber Pactorum'' (Vol. I, fols. 246ff. and Vol. II, fols. 261ff.), the ''Codex Sancti Marci'' 284, folio 3, and the ''Muratorii codices Ambrosiani'' I and II.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1856|p=452}}{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=182}} The first critical edition of the treaty was published in the collection of Venetian diplomatic documents compiled by Gottlieb Tafel and Georg Thomas for the [[Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna]] in 1856,{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1856|pp=452\u2013501}} while A. Carile published an up-to-date edition with full commentary in 1965.{{sfn|Nicol|1988|p=149}}\n\n== Territorial provisions ==\nAccording to the treaty's provisions, the territories were divided in the portion of the \"Lord Doge and [[Commune Veneciarum|Commune of Venice]]\" (''pars domini Ducis et communis Venetiae''), the portion of the Latin Emperor (''pars domini Imperatoris''), and the remainder as the portion of the Crusaders, or \"pilgrims\" (''pars Peregrinorum'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Latin text\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Translation\n! scope=\"col\" | Portion\n! scope=\"col\" | Region\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Comments\n|-\n| Civitas{{efn|The equivalent Byzantine administrative terms would be ''[[polis]]'' (\"city\") or ''[[kastron]]'' (\"fortress\").{{sfn|Maksimovi\u0107|1988|p=35}}}} Archadiopoli.

The provisions of the ''Partitio Romaniae'' were not fully carried out; much of the Byzantine realm fell into the hands not of the crusaders who had sacked the capital but of the local Byzantine Greek nobles, who established the Byzantine successor states of the [[Despotate of Epirus]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]], while the Crusaders also squabbled among themselves. The Latin Empire itself, consisting of the area surrounding [[Constantinople]], [[Thrace]], and the [[Sea of Marmara]] was also drawn into a [[Bulgarian\u2013Latin Wars|disastrous conflict]] with the powerful [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. Latin rule became most firmly established and lasted longest in southern Greece (the [[Principality of Achaea]] and the [[Duchy of Athens]]), as well as the Aegean islands, which came largely under the control of Venice.\n\n== Importance as a historical source ==\nAs the division was based on now lost documents and tax registers from the Byzantine imperial chancery, along with Alexios III's 1198 chrysobull, the ''Partitio Romaniae'' is a crucial document for the administrative divisions of the Byzantine Empire and the estates of the various Byzantine magnate families {{circa|1203}}, as well as the areas still controlled by the Byzantine central government at the time.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=179}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|group=notes}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Portal|Byzantine Empire|Middle Ages}}\n* {{ODB|last=Brand|first=C.

(\"Partition of the kingdom of the Greeks\"), was a treaty signed among the crusaders after the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack]] of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine (Eastern Roman)]] capital, [[Constantinople]], by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. It established the [[Latin Empire]] and arranged the nominal partition of the Byzantine territory among the participants of the Crusade, with the [[Republic of Venice]] being the greatest titular beneficiary. However, because the crusaders did not in fact control most of the Empire, with local Byzantine Greek nobles establishing the Byzantine successor kingdoms ([[Empire of Nicaea]], [[Empire of Trebizond]], [[Despot of Epirus]]), most of the crusaders' declared division of the Empire amongst themselves could never be implemented. While the ordeal was a major blow to the Empire, the Empire of Nicaea would in 1261 retake Constantinople, re-establishing the Byzantine Empire.\n\n==Background==\nIn March 1204, shortly before the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack]] of [[Constantinople]] in April, the Crusaders made a preliminary arrangement on the partition of the Byzantine territories between themselves.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|pp=179\u2013180}} This text, concluded between the principal leaders of the Crusade, the [[Doge of Venice]] [[Enrico Dandolo]], Marquess [[Boniface of Montferrat]], Count [[Baldwin of Flanders]], and Count [[Louis I of Blois]], has been preserved among the letters of [[Pope Innocent III]].{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1856|pp=444\u2013452}} According to its stipulations, the Venetians would retain their previous privileges granted by the Byzantine emperors, and a common committee, composed in equal numbers of Venetians and Crusaders, would elect an emperor for the [[Latin Empire]] to be established after the conquest of the city. The Latin Emperor would receive one quarter of all territories, as well as the palaces of [[Blachernae Palace|Blachernae]] and [[Boukoleon Palace|Boukoleon]] in the city. The remaining three quarters of the Byzantine territories would be divided equally between Venice and the other Crusaders.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=180}} On 9 May, Baldwin of Flanders was elected Latin Emperor, in place of the previous leader of the Crusade, Boniface of Montferrat. According to the Crusader and chronicler [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]], by previous agreement, Boniface should receive the territories lying beyond the [[Bosporus]] and [[Marmara Sea]], \"towards Turkey\", as well as \"the isle of Greece\". However, to placate Boniface, Baldwin agreed to assign to him the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] instead.{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=181}}\n\nThe agreement, which was promulgated either in late September or early October 1204 (according to the opinions of W. Heyd, [[Dionysios Zakythinos]], and A. Carile) or (according to [[Nikolaos Oikonomides]]) immediately after the sack in April\u2013May 1204,{{sfn|Brand|1991|pp=1591\u20131592}} was drafted by a 24-man committee consisting of 12 Venetians and 12 representatives of the other Crusader leaders.{{sfn|Brand|1991|pp=1591\u20131592}} The Venetians played a major role in the proceedings, as they had first-hand knowledge of the area, and many of the final text's provisions can be traced to the imperial [[chrysobull]] [[Byzantine\u2013Venetian treaty of 1198|granted to Venice in 1198]] by [[Alexios III Angelos]].{{sfn|Nicol|1988|p=149}} It gave the Latin Emperor direct control of one fourth of the former Byzantine territory, to Venice three eighths \u2013 including three eighths of the city of Constantinople, with [[Hagia Sophia]] \u2013 and the remaining three eighths were apportioned among the other Crusader chiefs. Through this division, Venice became the chief power in Latin Romania, and the effective power behind the Latin Empire, a fact clearly illustrated by the lofty title its [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] acquired: {{lang|la|Dominator quartae et dimidiae partis totius Romaniae}} (\"Lord of a quarter and a half quarter of all of ''Romania''\").\n\nThe treaty survives in a number of manuscripts, all from Venice: the ''Liber Albus'' (fols. 34ff.), the ''Liber Pactorum'' (Vol. I, fols. 246ff. and Vol. II, fols. 261ff.), the ''Codex Sancti Marci'' 284, folio 3, and the ''Muratorii codices Ambrosiani'' I and II.{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1856|p=452}}{{sfn|Zakythinos|1951|p=182}} The first critical edition of the treaty was published in the collection of Venetian diplomatic documents compiled by Gottlieb Tafel and Georg Thomas for the [[Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna]] in 1856,{{sfn|Tafel|Thomas|1856|pp=452\u2013501}} while A. Carile published an up-to-date edition with full commentary in 1965.{{sfn|Nicol|1988|p=149}}\n\n== Territorial provisions ==\nAccording to the treaty's provisions, the territories were divided in the portion of the \"Lord Doge and [[Commune Veneciarum|Commune of Venice]]\" (''pars domini Ducis et communis Venetiae''), the portion of the Latin Emperor (''pars domini Imperatoris''), and the remainder as the portion of the Crusaders, or \"pilgrims\" (''pars Peregrinorum'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Latin text\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Translation\n! scope=\"col\" | Portion\n! scope=\"col\" | Region\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Comments\n|-\n| Civitas{{efn|The equivalent Byzantine administrative terms would be ''[[polis]]'' (\"city\") or ''[[kastron]]'' (\"fortress\").{{sfn|Maksimovi\u0107|1988|p=35}}}} Archadiopoli.

The provisions of the ''Partitio Romaniae'' were not fully carried out; much of the Byzantine realm fell into the hands not of the crusaders who had sacked the capital but of the local Byzantine Greek nobles, who established the Byzantine successor states of the [[Despotate of Epirus]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]], while the Crusaders also squabbled among themselves. The Latin Empire itself, consisting of the area surrounding [[Constantinople]], [[Thrace]], and the [[Sea of Marmara]] was also drawn into a [[Bulgarian\u2013Latin Wars|disastrous conflict]] with the powerful [[Second Bulgarian Empire]].
