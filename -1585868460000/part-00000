He was a subscriber to the third charter of the [[Virginia Company]] who emigrated to the colony in 1618. After surviving the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], he moved to [[Jordan Point, Virginia|Jordan's Journey]]. In the following year, Farrar became involved in North America's first breach of promise suit when he proposed to [[Cecily Jordan Farrar|Cecily Jordan]].  In 1626, Farrar was appointed to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council of Virginia]] where he served as an advisor to the royal governor, a judge of the highest court in the colony, and a member of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] of [[Colonial Jamestown]]. He was also appointed magistrate of the upper James River community. In both these roles, he served as a voice of the early planters' interest as the colony transitioned from being managed by the Virginia Company and becoming a royal colony under [[Charles I of England]]. Farrar was also on the Council when it arrested Governor [[John Harvey (Virginia)|John Harvey]] for misgovernance and forced his temporary return to England. By the time of his death around 1637, Farrar had sold off his remaining assets in England and established rights to a 2000 acre patent on [[Farrar's Island]], located on a curl of the James River.\n\n[[File:Farrar Complete Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb|The [[Coat of arms|arms]] of William Farrar's father, John Farrar of Croxton and London, Esquire<ref name= Bannerman1899/>]]\n\n==Background==\nWilliam Farrar was born before April 28, 1583,<ref name=\"Dorman2004\" /> the date of his christening, in [[Croxton, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref name=CroxtonParish1583 /> He was the 3rd son of John Farrar of Croxton<ref name= \"Bannerman1899\" /> and London, [[Esquire]], a wealthy [[merchant]] and [[Land tenure|landowner]] with various holdings in [[West Yorkshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], and [[Hertfordshire]]<ref name =Farrer1936/>, and Cecily Kelke, an heiress <ref name=Richardson2011/> and direct descendant of [[Edward III of England]].<ref name=ElleMagazine2014/> The nineteenth century historian of Virginia, [[Alexander Brown (author)|Alexander Brown]], states that while in England, William Farrar received an education in law.<ref name=Brown1890v2 />\n\n== Relation to the Virginia Company and emigration to the New World ==\n[[File:Nova Britannia Cover.jpg|thumb|left|Facsimile cover of \"Nova Britannia\", a tract from Farrar's time used to recruit people to Virginia.]]\nWhen Farrar went to Virginia, it was still part of the [[Virginia Company of London]], a [[joint-stock company]], sanctioned by [[Royal charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]].<ref name=\"Wolfe2016\" /> Farrar was a subscriber to the Third Charter of the Virginia Company,<ref name= Kolp2014 /> where his name appears as \"William Ferrers\".<ref name= Bemiss1957 /> His subscription consisted of three shares that were bought for a total of \u00a337 10s (equivalent to about ${{formatnum:{{ To USD round|{{inflation|UK|37.5|1600}}|GBR|sf=3}}}} today).{{Notetag|For another comparison of the share's value, the entire annual wages of a skilled [[journeyman]] in London around 1588 was authorized to be between \u00a34 and \u00a310. {{refn|name=Aughterson1998}} }}<ref name=Brown1890v2 /> Farrar also had family interests in the Virginia Company as two of his second cousins,<ref name=Torrence1942 /> the brothers [[John Ferrar]] and [[Nicholas Ferrar]], played key roles in the managing the company's interests.<ref name=Kingsbury1906v1/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/recordsofvirgini01virg_0/page/n121/mode/2up 60}} }}\n\nFarrar left London on ''Neptune''<ref name= Hotten1874/> on March 16, 1617/18  {{notetag|[[Dual dating]] is given because the [[Old Style and New Style dates#Start of the year in the historical records of Britain and its colonies and possessions|English new year did not begin until March 25]] during Farrar's lifetime.}}<ref name=\"Kolb1980\" /> along with Virginia's governor, [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Thomas West, Baron De La Warr]].

After surviving the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], he moved to [[Jordan Point, Virginia|Jordan's Journey]]. In the following year, Farrar became involved in North America's first breach of promise suit when he proposed to [[Cecily Jordan Farrar|Cecily Jordan]].  In 1626, Farrar was appointed to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council of Virginia]] where he served as an advisor to the royal governor, a judge of the highest court in the colony, and a member of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] of [[Colonial Jamestown]]. He was also appointed magistrate of the upper James River community. In both these roles, he served as a voice of the early planters' interest as the colony transitioned from being managed by the Virginia Company and becoming a royal colony under [[Charles I of England]]. Farrar was also on the Council when it arrested Governor [[John Harvey (Virginia)|John Harvey]] for misgovernance and forced his temporary return to England. By the time of his death around 1637, Farrar had sold off his remaining assets in England and established rights to a 2000 acre patent on [[Farrar's Island]], located on a curl of the James River.\n\n[[File:Farrar Complete Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb|The [[Coat of arms|arms]] of William Farrar's father, John Farrar of Croxton and London, Esquire<ref name= Bannerman1899/>]]\n\n==Background==\nWilliam Farrar was born before April 28, 1583,<ref name=\"Dorman2004\" /> the date of his christening, in [[Croxton, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref name=CroxtonParish1583 /> He was the 3rd son of John Farrar of Croxton<ref name= \"Bannerman1899\" /> and London, [[Esquire]], a wealthy [[merchant]] and [[Land tenure|landowner]] with various holdings in [[West Yorkshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], and [[Hertfordshire]]<ref name =Farrer1936/>, and Cecily Kelke, an heiress <ref name=Richardson2011/> and direct descendant of [[Edward III of England]].<ref name=ElleMagazine2014/> The nineteenth century historian of Virginia, [[Alexander Brown (author)|Alexander Brown]], states that while in England, William Farrar received an education in law.<ref name=Brown1890v2 />\n\n== Relation to the Virginia Company and emigration to the New World ==\n[[File:Nova Britannia Cover.jpg|thumb|left|Facsimile cover of \"Nova Britannia\", a tract from Farrar's time used to recruit people to Virginia.]]\nWhen Farrar went to Virginia, it was still part of the [[Virginia Company of London]], a [[joint-stock company]], sanctioned by [[Royal charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]].<ref name=\"Wolfe2016\" /> Farrar was a subscriber to the Third Charter of the Virginia Company,<ref name= Kolp2014 /> where his name appears as \"William Ferrers\".<ref name= Bemiss1957 /> His subscription consisted of three shares that were bought for a total of \u00a337 10s (equivalent to about ${{formatnum:{{ To USD round|{{inflation|UK|37.5|1600}}|GBR|sf=3}}}} today).{{Notetag|For another comparison of the share's value, the entire annual wages of a skilled [[journeyman]] in London around 1588 was authorized to be between \u00a34 and \u00a310. {{refn|name=Aughterson1998}} }}<ref name=Brown1890v2 /> Farrar also had family interests in the Virginia Company as two of his second cousins,<ref name=Torrence1942 /> the brothers [[John Ferrar]] and [[Nicholas Ferrar]], played key roles in the managing the company's interests.<ref name=Kingsbury1906v1/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/recordsofvirgini01virg_0/page/n121/mode/2up 60}} }}\n\nFarrar left London on ''Neptune''<ref name= Hotten1874/> on March 16, 1617/18  {{notetag|[[Dual dating]] is given because the [[Old Style and New Style dates#Start of the year in the historical records of Britain and its colonies and possessions|English new year did not begin until March 25]] during Farrar's lifetime.}}<ref name=\"Kolb1980\" /> along with Virginia's governor, [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Thomas West, Baron De La Warr]].

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F.

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]].

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

The gametes produced by an organism define its sex: males produce small gametes (e.g. spermatozoa, or [[sperm]], in animals) while females produce large gametes ([[ovum|ova]], or egg cells). Individual organisms which produce both male and female gametes are termed [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]].<ref name=\"Purves\"/> Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as [[isogamy]]), but, in many cases, an asymmetry has evolved such that two different types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as [[anisogamy]]).\n\nPhysical differences are often associated with the different sexes of an organism; these [[sexual dimorphism]]s can reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes experience. For instance, [[mate choice]] and [[sexual selection]] can accelerate the evolution of physical differences between the sexes.\n\nAmong humans and other [[mammal]]s, males typically carry an X and a [[Y chromosome]] (XY), whereas females typically carry two [[X chromosome]]s (XX), which are a part of the [[XY sex-determination system]]. Humans may also be [[intersex]], though this is not exclusively a phenomenon of abnormal [[karyotype|chromosome numbers]]. Other animals have various [[sex-determination system]]s, such as the [[ZW sex-determination system|ZW system]] in birds, the [[X0 sex-determination system|X0 system]] in insects, and various [[environmental sex determination|environmental systems]], for example in reptiles and crustaceans. [[Fungi]] may also have more complex [[allelic]] mating systems, with sexes not accurately described as male, female, or hermaphroditic.<ref name=\"Watkinson Boddy Money 2015 p. 115\">{{cite book | last=Watkinson | first=S.C. | last2=Boddy | first2=L. | last3=Money | first3=N. | title=The Fungi | publisher=Elsevier Science| year=2015 | isbn=978-0-12-382035-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x8qcBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA115 | access-date=Feb 18, 2018 | page=115}}</ref>\n==Overview==\n[[File:Sperm-egg.jpg|thumb|The male gamete ([[sperm]]) fertilizing the female gamete ([[ovum]])]]\n\nOne of the basic properties of life is reproduction, the capacity to generate new individuals, and sex is an aspect of this process. Life has evolved from simple stages to more complex ones, and so have the reproduction mechanisms. Initially the reproduction was a replicating process that consists in producing new individuals that contain the same genetic information as the original or parent individual. This mode of reproduction is called ''asexual'', and it is still used by many species, particularly unicellular, but it is also very common in multicellular organisms, including many of those with sexual reproduction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Raven |first1=P.H. |title=Biology of Plants |publisher=Freeman and Company Publishers |location=NY |edition=7th|display-authors=etal}}</ref> In sexual reproduction, the genetic material of the offspring comes from two different individuals. As sexual reproduction developed by way of a long process of evolution, intermediates exist. Bacteria, for instance, reproduce asexually, but undergo a process by which a part of the genetic material of an individual donor is transferred to another recipient.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=R.K. |title=Genetics: Conjugation |date=1996 |publisher=University of Texas |edition=4th|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nDisregarding intermediates, the basic distinction between asexual and sexual reproduction is the way in which the genetic material is processed. Typically, prior to an asexual division, a cell duplicates its genetic information content, and then divides. This process of cell division is called [[mitosis]]. In sexual reproduction, there are special kinds of cells that divide without prior duplication of its genetic material, in a process named [[meiosis]]. The resulting cells are called [[gametes]], and contain only half the genetic material of the parent cells. These gametes are the cells that are prepared for the sexual reproduction of the organism.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Scott |title=Biological Science |url=https://archive.org/details/biologicalscienc00scot |url-access=registration |date=2005 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |edition=3rd}}</ref> Sex comprises the arrangements that enable sexual reproduction, and has evolved alongside the reproduction system, starting with similar gametes (isogamy) and progressing to systems that have different gamete types, such as those involving a large female gamete (ovum) and a small male gamete (sperm).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dusenbery |first1=David B. |title=Living at Micro Scale |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}</ref>\n\nIn complex organisms, the [[sex organ]]s are the parts that are involved in the production and exchange of gametes in sexual reproduction. Many species, both plants and animals, have sexual specialization, and their populations are divided into male and female individuals. Conversely, there are also species in which there is no sexual specialization, and the same individuals both contain masculine and feminine reproductive organs, and they are called [[hermaphrodites]]. This is very frequent in plants.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beukeboom |first1=L., and other |title=The Evolution of Sex Determination |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n{{Main|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}\n{{multiple image|total_width=220\n| align = left\n| image1 = Anisogamy.svg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Different forms of [[anisogamy]]:<br />A) anisogamy of motile cells, B) oogamy (egg cell and sperm cell), C) anisogamy of non-motile cells (egg cell and spermatia).\n| image2 = Isogamy.svg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Different forms of isogamy:<br />A) isogamy of [[motile cell]]s, B) isogamy of non-motile cells, C) conjugation.\n| footer = \n}}\nSexual reproduction first probably evolved about a billion years ago within ancestral single-celled [[eukaryotes]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Book Review for ''Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth'' |url=http://jupiterscientific.org/review/life.html |publisher=Jupiter Scientific |accessdate=7 April 2008}}</ref> The reason for the evolution of sex, and the reason(s) it has survived to the present, are still matters of debate. Some of the many plausible theories include: that sex creates variation among offspring, sex helps in the spread of advantageous traits, that sex helps in the removal of disadvantageous traits, and that sex facilitates repair of germ-line DNA.\n\nSexual reproduction is a process specific to [[eukaryote]]s, organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and mitochondria. In addition to animals, plants, and fungi, [[protist|other eukaryotes]] (e.g. the [[malaria]] parasite) also engage in sexual reproduction. Some bacteria use [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] to transfer genetic material between cells; while not the same as sexual reproduction, this also results in the mixture of genetic traits.\n\nThe defining characteristic of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is the difference between the gametes and the binary nature of fertilization. Multiplicity of gamete types within a species would still be considered a form of sexual reproduction. However, no third gamete type is known in multicellular plants or animals.<ref>Schaffer, Amanda (updated 27 September 2007) [http://www.slate.com/id/2174380/?GT1=10538 \"Pas de Deux: Why Are There Only Two Sexes?\"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hurst |first=Laurence D. |jstor=50723 |title=Why are There Only Two Sexes? |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |volume=263 |year=1996 |pages=415\u2013422 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0063 |issue=1369}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Haag |first=E.S. |year=2007 |title=Why two sexes?

In humans and other mammals this male organ is the [[penis]], which enters the female reproductive tract (called the [[vagina]]) to achieve [[insemination]]\u2014a process called [[sexual intercourse]]. The penis contains a tube through which [[semen]] (a fluid containing sperm) travels. In female mammals the vagina connects with the [[uterus]], an organ which directly supports the development of a fertilized embryo within (a process called [[gestation]]).\n\nBecause of their motility, [[animal sexual behavior]] can involve coercive sex.

Flowers are usually hermaphroditic, producing both male and female gametes. The female parts, in the center of a flower, are the [[pistils]], each unit consisting of a [[carpel]], a [[Style (botany)|style]] and a [[stigma (botany)|stigma]]. One or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form a single compound [[pistil]]. Within the carpels are [[ovules]] which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the [[stamen]]s: these consist of long filaments arranged between the pistil and the petals that produce pollen in [[Glossary of botanical terms#anther|anthers]] at their tips. When a pollen grain lands upon the stigma on top of a carpel's style, it germinates to produce a [[pollen tube]] that grows down through the tissues of the style into the carpel, where it delivers male gamete nuclei to fertilize an ovule that eventually develops into a seed.\n\nIn [[pine]]s and other [[conifer]]s the sex organs are [[conifer cone]]s and have male and female forms. The more familiar female cones are typically more durable, containing ovules within them. Male cones are smaller and produce pollen which is transported by wind to land in female cones. As with flowers, seeds form within the female cone after pollination.\n\nBecause plants are immobile, they depend upon passive methods for transporting pollen grains to other plants. Many plants, including conifers and grasses, produce lightweight pollen which is carried by wind to neighboring plants. Other plants have heavier, sticky pollen that is specialized for transportation by animals. The plants attract these insects or larger animals such as [[humming birds]] and [[bats]] with nectar-containing flowers. These animals transport the pollen as they move to other flowers, which also contain female reproductive organs, resulting in [[pollination]].\n\n===Fungi===\n{{Main|Mating in fungi}}\n[[File:Shiitake mushroom.jpg|thumb|Mushrooms are produced as part of fungal sexual reproduction]]\n\nMost [[fungus|fungi]] reproduce sexually, having both a haploid and diploid stage in their life cycles.

The gametes produced by an organism define its sex: males produce small gametes (e.g. spermatozoa, or [[sperm]], in animals) while females produce large gametes ([[ovum|ova]], or egg cells). Individual organisms which produce both male and female gametes are termed [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]].<ref name=\"Purves\"/> Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as [[isogamy]]), but, in many cases, an asymmetry has evolved such that two different types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as [[anisogamy]]).\n\nPhysical differences are often associated with the different sexes of an organism; these [[sexual dimorphism]]s can reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes experience. For instance, [[mate choice]] and [[sexual selection]] can accelerate the evolution of physical differences between the sexes.\n\nAmong humans and other [[mammal]]s, males typically carry an X and a [[Y chromosome]] (XY), whereas females typically carry two [[X chromosome]]s (XX), which are a part of the [[XY sex-determination system]]. Humans may also be [[intersex]].

Life has evolved from simple stages to more complex ones, and so have the reproduction mechanisms. Initially the reproduction was a replicating process that consists in producing new individuals that contain the same genetic information as the original or parent individual. This mode of reproduction is called ''asexual'', and it is still used by many species, particularly unicellular, but it is also very common in multicellular organisms, including many of those with sexual reproduction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Raven |first1=P.H. |title=Biology of Plants |publisher=Freeman and Company Publishers |location=NY |edition=7th|display-authors=etal}}</ref> In sexual reproduction, the genetic material of the offspring comes from two different individuals. As sexual reproduction developed by way of a long process of evolution, intermediates exist. Bacteria, for instance, reproduce asexually, but undergo a process by which a part of the genetic material of an individual donor is transferred to another recipient.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=R.K. |title=Genetics: Conjugation |date=1996 |publisher=University of Texas |edition=4th|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nDisregarding intermediates, the basic distinction between asexual and sexual reproduction is the way in which the genetic material is processed. Typically, prior to an asexual division, a cell duplicates its genetic information content, and then divides. This process of cell division is called [[mitosis]]. In sexual reproduction, there are special kinds of cells that divide without prior duplication of its genetic material, in a process named [[meiosis]]. The resulting cells are called [[gametes]], and contain only half the genetic material of the parent cells. These gametes are the cells that are prepared for the sexual reproduction of the organism.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Scott |title=Biological Science |url=https://archive.org/details/biologicalscienc00scot |url-access=registration |date=2005 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |edition=3rd}}</ref> Sex comprises the arrangements that enable sexual reproduction, and has evolved alongside the reproduction system, starting with similar gametes (isogamy) and progressing to systems that have different gamete types, such as those involving a large female gamete (ovum) and a small male gamete (sperm).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dusenbery |first1=David B. |title=Living at Micro Scale |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}</ref>\n\nIn complex organisms, the [[sex organ]]s are the parts that are involved in the production and exchange of gametes in sexual reproduction. Many species, both plants and animals, have sexual specialization, and their populations are divided into male and female individuals. Conversely, there are also species in which there is no sexual specialization, and the same individuals both contain masculine and feminine reproductive organs, and they are called [[hermaphrodites]].

Some of the many plausible theories include: that sex creates variation among offspring, sex helps in the spread of advantageous traits, that sex helps in the removal of disadvantageous traits, and that sex facilitates repair of germ-line DNA.\n\nSexual reproduction is a process specific to [[eukaryote]]s, organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and mitochondria. In addition to animals, plants, and fungi, [[protist|other eukaryotes]] (e.g. the [[malaria]] parasite) also engage in sexual reproduction.

Flowers are usually hermaphroditic, producing both male and female gametes. The female parts, in the center of a flower, are the [[pistils]], each unit consisting of a [[carpel]], a [[Style (botany)|style]] and a [[stigma (botany)|stigma]]. One or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form a single compound [[pistil]]. Within the carpels are [[ovules]] which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the [[stamen]]s: these consist of long filaments arranged between the pistil and the petals that produce pollen in [[Glossary of botanical terms#anther|anthers]] at their tips. When a pollen grain lands upon the stigma on top of a carpel's style, it germinates to produce a [[pollen tube]] that grows down through the tissues of the style into the carpel, where it delivers male gamete nuclei to fertilize an ovule that eventually develops into a seed.\n\nIn [[pine]]s and other [[conifer]]s the sex organs are [[conifer cone]]s and have male and female forms. The more familiar female cones are typically more durable, containing ovules within them. Male cones are smaller and produce pollen which is transported by wind to land in female cones. As with flowers, seeds form within the female cone after pollination.\n\nBecause plants are immobile, they depend upon passive methods for transporting pollen grains to other plants. Many plants, including conifers and grasses, produce lightweight pollen which is carried by wind to neighboring plants. Other plants have heavier, sticky pollen that is specialized for transportation by animals. The plants attract these insects or larger animals such as [[humming birds]] and [[bats]] with nectar-containing flowers. These animals transport the pollen as they move to other flowers, which also contain female reproductive organs, resulting in [[pollination]].\n\n===Fungi===\n{{Main|Mating in fungi}}\n[[File:Shiitake mushroom.jpg|thumb|Mushrooms are produced as part of fungal sexual reproduction]]\n\nMost [[fungus|fungi]] reproduce sexually, having both a haploid and diploid stage in their life cycles.

He wanted the hospital for sick children in Toronto to become one of the finest institutions of its kind in the world.  Finally, Mr. Robertson saw his ideal - the recently opened hospital for sick children in Glasgow, Scotland.

The hospital was provided with a fully equipped plant to provide pasteurized milk for the babies in the in and outpatient departments with the goal of reducing the infantile death rate.  If the families were unable to afford the milk, it would be provided for them.  To make sure the bottles would be returned and not kept for flower vases or any other purposes, they made rounded bottom bottles, which could not stand, on a flat surface.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1902, Robertson was appointed Grand Junior Warden of England.<ref>{{cite news|title=Honors for Canadian Mason|date=July 29, 1902|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Manitoba|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/politics-clipping-jul-29-1902-1420983/}}{{free access}}</ref> He also became president of the inaugural Canadian Copyright Association.<ref>{{cite news|title=Copyright Association|date=July 8, 1902|newspaper=Winnipeg Tribune|location=Manitoba|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/politics-clipping-jul-08-1902-1420990/}}{{free access}}</ref> A few years later, he refused [[Knighthood]] honour and chose to remain a companion.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Progress of War|date=February 20, 1917|newspaper=Lethbridge Herald|location=Alberta|page=4|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/politics-clipping-feb-20-1917-1420986/}}{{free access}}</ref>\n\nRobertson became Chairman of the Hospital in 1891 and remained Chairman until he died in 1918.

Robertson was appalled at what he saw.  Because the hospital had little money, the children were sleeping on torn mattresses in rooms so dilapidated they couldn't be scrubbed clean.

He wanted the hospital for sick children in Toronto to become one of the finest institutions of its kind in the world.  Finally, Mr. Robertson saw his ideal - the recently opened hospital for sick children in Glasgow, Scotland.  He asked the Scottish architect who had drawn up the plans of the hospital to draft blueprints for the proposed hospital in Toronto and placed these plans in the hands of Toronto Architects Darling and Curry.  The new building became a reality and on June 10, 1889, Mr. Robertson's seven-year-old son turned over the first sod.  The building was on College Street between LaPlante Avenue and Elizabeth Street.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nRobertson raised money for the new hospital through publicity in his newspaper by gaining support of influential citizens in the city and with the aid of a $20,000 grant from Toronto Council.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nWhen Robertson first heard of pasteurized milk in the early 1900's, he sent his sister off to New York City to learn the new process.  The hopsital was provided with a fully equipped plant to provide pasteurized milk for the babies in the in and out patient departments with the goal of reducing the infantile death rate.  If the families were unable to afford the milk, it would be provided for them.  To make sure the bottles would be returned and not kept for flower vases or any other purposes, they made rounded bottom bottles, which could not stand, on a flat surface.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1902, Robertson was appointed Grand Junior Warden of England.<ref>{{cite news|title=Honors for Canadian Mason|date=July 29, 1902|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Manitoba|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/politics-clipping-jul-29-1902-1420983/}}{{free access}}</ref> He also became president of the inaugural Canadian Copyright Association.<ref>{{cite news|title=Copyright Association|date=July 8, 1902|newspaper=Winnipeg Tribune|location=Manitoba|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/politics-clipping-jul-08-1902-1420990/}}{{free access}}</ref> A few years later, he refused [[Knighthood]] honour and chose to remain a companion.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Progress of War|date=February 20, 1917|newspaper=Lethbridge Herald|location=Alberta|page=4|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/politics-clipping-feb-20-1917-1420986/}}{{free access}}</ref>\n\nRobertson became Chairman of the Hospital in 1891 and remained Chairman until he died in 1918. In 1951, the hospital moved to its present building on University Avenue.  \n\nHe bequeathed his considerable book collection to the [[Toronto Public Library]], founded a children's home, and left a large annuity to the Toronto [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]].

We are nevertheless inclined...to keep the North-African and Indian Jackals distinct...The reasons why we prefer to keep them provisionally distinct is that though the difference between the two forms (African and Indian) is slight as regards coloration, yet it appears to be a very constant one. Out of seventeen skins of the Indian form, we have only found one which is wanting in the main characteristic as to difference of hue. The ears also are relatively shorter than in the North-African form. But there is another character to which we attach greater weight.

Center for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis Department of Bioscience Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, University of Oslo, Norway</ref>\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed by scientists at the [[University of Oslo|Oslo]] and [[University of Helsinki|Helsinki Universities]] that the binomial name ''C. anthus'' was a ''[[nomen dubium]]'', on account of the fact that Cuvier's 1820 description of the [[holotype]], a female collected from Senegal, seems to be describing the [[side-striped jackal]] rather than the actual African golden wolf, and does not match the appearance of a male specimen described by Cuvier in his later writings. This ambiguity, coupled with the disappearance of the holotype's remains, led to the scientists proposing giving priority to [[Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich|Hemprich]] and [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg]]'s name ''C. lupaster'', due to the [[type specimen]] having a more detailed and consistent description, and its remains being still examinable at the [[Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde]].<ref name=viranta2017/> The following year, a major genetic study of ''Canis'' species also referred to the African golden wolf as ''Canis lupaster''.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/SSC Canid Specialist Group recommended that because the specimen identified as ''Canis anthus'' Cuvier, 1820 was uncertain, the species should be known as ''Canis lupaster'' Hemprich and Ehrenberg, 1832 until ''Canis anthus'' can be validated.<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n===Admixture with other ''Canis'' species===\nIn 2018, [[whole genome sequencing]] was used to compare members of the genus ''Canis''. The study supports the African golden wolf being distinct from the golden jackal, and with the [[Ethiopian wolf]] being genetically [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to both. There are two genetically distinct African golden wolf populations that exist in northwestern and eastern Africa. This suggests that Ethiopian wolves \u2013 or a close and extinct relative \u2013 once had a much larger range within Africa to admix with other canids. There is evidence of gene flow between the eastern population and the Ethiopian wolf, which has led to the eastern population being distinct from the northwestern population. The common ancestor of both African golden wolf populations was a genetically [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72% gray wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. There is evidence of gene flow between African golden wolves,  golden jackals, and gray wolves. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] showed high admixture with the Middle Eastern gray wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and continents in canid evolution. African golden wolves form a sister clade to Middle Eastern gray wolves based on mitochondrial DNA, but to coyotes and gray wolves based on nuclear DNA.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\n===Relationship to the Himalayan wolf===\nBetween 2011 and 2015, two mDNA studies found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] and [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian wolf]] were closer to the African golden wolf than they were to the Holarctic gray wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=koepfli2015/> In 2017, a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]], [[X-chromosome]] (maternal lineage) markers and [[Y-chromosome]] (male lineage) markers found that the Himalayan wolf is genetically [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to the Holarctic gray wolf. The Himalayan wolf shares a maternal lineage with the African golden wolf, and possesses a unique paternal lineage that falls between the gray wolf and the African golden wolf.<ref name=werhahn2017/>\n\n===Subspecies===\nAlthough in the past several attempts have been made to [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymise]] many of the proposed names, the taxonomic position of West African wolves, in particular, is too confused to come to any precise conclusion, as the collected study materials are few. Prior to 1840, six of the 10 supposed West African subspecies were named or classed almost entirely because of their fur color.<ref name=\"r38\">Rosevear, Donovan Reginald (1974). \"The carnivores of West Africa\".

The basic social unit is a breeding pair, followed by its current offspring, or offspring from previous litters staying as \"helpers\".<ref name=\"jhala2004\"/> Large groups are rare, and have only been recorded to occur in areas with abundant human waste. Family relationships among African golden wolves are comparatively peaceful compared to those of the [[black-backed jackal]]; although the sexual and territorial behavior of grown pups is suppressed by the breeding pair, they are not actively driven off once they attain adulthood. African golden wolves also lie together and groom each other much more frequently than black-backed jackals. In the Serengeti, pairs defend permanent territories encompassing 2\u20134&nbsp;km\u00b2, and will vacate their territories only to drink or when lured by a large carcass.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> The pair patrols and [[territorial marking|marks its territory]] in tandem. Both partners and helpers will react aggressively towards intruders, though the greatest aggression is reserved for intruders of the same sex; pair members do not assist each other in repelling intruders of the opposite sex.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n[[File:Canis anthus threat postures.png|thumb|Threat postures in ''C. a. lupaster'' (left) and ''C. a. anthus'' (right)]]\n{{anchor|Courtship}}The African golden wolf's courtship rituals are remarkably long, during which the breeding pair remains almost constantly together. Prior to mating, the pair patrols and [[scent mark]]s its territory. [[Animal sexual behavior|Copulation]] is preceded by the female holding her tail out and angled in such a way that her genitalia are exposed. The two approach each other, whimpering, lifting their tails and bristling their fur, displaying varying intensities of offensive and defensive behavior. The female sniffs and licks the male's genitals, whilst the male nuzzles the female's fur. They may circle each other and fight briefly. The [[copulatory tie]] lasts roughly four minutes. Towards the end of estrus, the pair drifts apart, with the female often approaching the male in a comparatively more submissive manner. In anticipation of the role he will take in raising pups, the male regurgitates or surrenders any food he has to the female. In the Serengeti, pups are born in December\u2013January, and begin eating solid food after a month. [[Weaning]] starts at the age of two months, and ends at four months. At this stage, the pups are semi-independent, venturing up to 50 meters from the den, even sleeping in the open. Their playing behavior becomes increasingly more aggressive, with the pups competing for rank, which is established after six months. The female feeds the pups more frequently than the male or helpers do, though the presence of the latter allows the breeding pair to leave the den and hunt without leaving the litter unprotected.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nThe African golden wolf's life centers around a home burrow, which usually consists of an abandoned and modified [[aardvark]] or [[warthog]] earth. The interior structure of this burrow is poorly understood, though it is thought to consist of a single central chamber with 2\u20133 escape routes. The home burrow can be located in both secluded areas or surprisingly near the dens of other predators.<ref name=\"r47\"/>\n\n===Communication===\nAfrican golden wolves frequently groom one another, particularly during courtship, during which it can last up to 30 minutes.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Nibbling of the face and neck is observed during greeting ceremonies. When fighting, the African golden wolf slams its opponents with its hips, and bites and shakes the shoulder. The species' postures are typically canine, and it has more facial mobility than the black-backed and side-striped jackals, being able to expose its [[canine teeth]] like a dog.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nThe vocabulary of the African golden wolf is similar to that of the domestic dog, with seven sounds having been recorded.<ref name=\"kingdon1988\"/> The African golden wolf's vocalizations include howls, barks, growls, whines and cackles.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> Subspecies can be recognised by differences in their howls.<ref name=\"kingdon1988\"/> One of the most commonly heard sounds is a high, keening wail, of which there are three varieties; a long single toned continuous howl, a wail that rises and falls, and a series of short, staccato howls. These howls are used to repel intruders and attract family members. Howling in chorus is thought to reinforce family bonds, as well as establish territorial status.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> A comparative analysis of African golden wolf and some gray wolf subspecies' howls demonstrated that the former's howls bear similarities to those of the [[Indian wolf]], being high-pitched and of relatively short duration.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hennelly | first1 = Lauren | last2 = Habib | first2 = Bilal | last3 = Root-Gutteridge | first3 = Holly | last4 = Palacios | first4 = Vicente | last5 = Passilongo | first5 = Daniela | year = 2017 | title = Howl variation across Himalayan, North African, Indian, and Holarctic wolf clades: tracing divergence in the world's oldest wolf lineages using acoustics | url = | journal = Current Zoology | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 341\u2013348 | doi=10.1093/cz/zox001| pmid = 29491993 | pmc = 5804178 }}</ref>\n\n===Hunting behavior===\n[[File:Golden Wolf, navigating Wildebeest, Ngorongoro.jpg|thumb|right|A Serengeti wolf (''C. a. bea'') navigating through a herd of [[blue wildebeest]] in the [[Ngorongoro National Park]], [[Tanzania]]]]\nThe African golden wolf rarely catches hares, due to their speed. [[Gazelle]] mothers (often working in groups of two or three) are formidable when defending their young against single wolves, which are much more successful in hunting gazelle fawns when working in pairs. A pair of wolves will methodically search for concealed gazelle fawns within herds, tall grass, bushes and other likely hiding places.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nAlthough it is known to kill animals up to three times its own weight, the African golden wolf targets mammalian prey much less frequently than the [[black-backed jackal]] overall.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> On capturing large prey, the African golden wolf makes no attempt to kill it; instead it rips open the belly and eats the entrails. Small prey is typically killed by shaking, though snakes may be eaten alive from the tail end. The African golden wolf often carries away more food than it can consume, and [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|caches]] the surplus, which is generally recovered within 24 hours.<ref name=\"r47\"/> When foraging for insects, the African golden wolf turns over dung piles to find dung beetles. During the dry seasons, it excavates dung balls to reach the larvae inside. Grasshoppers and flying termites are caught either by pouncing on them while they are on the ground or are caught in mid-air. It is fiercely intolerant of other scavengers, having been known to dominate [[Old World Vulture|vultures]] on kills \u2013 one can hold dozens of vultures at bay by threatening, snapping and lunging at them.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Distribution and habitat===\nFossil finds dating back to the [[Pleistocene]] indicate that the species' range was not always restricted to Africa, with remains having been found in the [[Levant]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name=viranta2017/> In [[Tanzania]], the African golden wolf is limited to a small area of the north between the western slopes of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and the centre of the [[Serengeti]]. In the latter area, it occurs mostly in the short-grass plains, the floor of the [[Ngorongoro Crater]], and the plains between the Olmoti and Empakai Craters, being relatively rare in [[Serengeti National Park]], [[Loliondo]] and the [[Maswa District|Maswa]] game reserve. The species also inhabits the [[Lake Natron]] area and West Kilimanjaro. It is sometimes found in the northern part of [[Arusha National Park]], and as far south as [[Manyara Region|Manyara]]. In areas where it is common, such as the short-grass plains of Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater, population densities can range between 0.5-1.5 specimens per km<sup>2</sup>. A population decrease of 60% has been recorded in the southern plains of Serengeti National Park since the early 1970s, though the reasons are unknown.<ref>Foley, C. et al.

Wolf populations in [[Mali]] have been documented in arid Sahelian [[massif]]s.<ref name=\"gaubert2012\"/> In [[Egypt]], the African golden wolf inhabits agricultural areas, wastelands, desert margins, rocky areas, and cliffs.

We are nevertheless inclined...to keep the North-African and Indian Jackals distinct...The reasons why we prefer to keep them provisionally distinct is that though the difference between the two forms (African and Indian) is slight as regards coloration, yet it appears to be a very constant one. Out of seventeen skins of the Indian form, we have only found one which is wanting in the main characteristic as to difference of hue. The ears also are relatively shorter than in the North-African form. But there is another character to which we attach greater weight. However much the different races of Wolves differ in size, we have not succeeded in finding any constant distinctive characters in the form of the skull or the proportions of the lobes of any of the teeth.

Considering its phylogenetic position and the canid [[fossil record]], it is likely that the African golden wolf evolved from larger ancestors that became progressively more jackal-like in size upon populating Africa on account of [[interspecific competition]] with both larger and smaller indigenous [[Carnivora|carnivores]].

Center for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis Department of Bioscience Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, University of Oslo, Norway</ref>\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed by scientists at the [[University of Oslo|Oslo]] and [[University of Helsinki|Helsinki Universities]] that the binomial name ''C. anthus'' was a ''[[nomen dubium]]'', on account of the fact that Cuvier's 1820 description of the [[holotype]], a female collected from Senegal, seems to be describing the [[side-striped jackal]] rather than the actual African golden wolf, and does not match the appearance of a male specimen described by Cuvier in his later writings. This ambiguity, coupled with the disappearance of the holotype's remains, led to the scientists proposing giving priority to [[Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich|Hemprich]] and [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg]]'s name ''C. lupaster'', due to the [[type specimen]] having a more detailed and consistent description, and its remains being still examinable at the [[Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde]].<ref name=viranta2017/> The following year, a major genetic study of ''Canis'' species also referred to the African golden wolf as ''Canis lupaster''.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/SSC Canid Specialist Group recommended that because the specimen identified as ''Canis anthus'' Cuvier, 1820 was uncertain, the species should be known as ''Canis lupaster'' Hemprich and Ehrenberg, 1832 until ''Canis anthus'' can be validated.<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n===Admixture with other ''Canis'' species===\nIn 2018, [[whole genome sequencing]] was used to compare members of the genus ''Canis''. The study supports the African golden wolf being distinct from the golden jackal, and with the [[Ethiopian wolf]] being genetically [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to both. There are two genetically distinct African golden wolf populations that exist in northwestern and eastern Africa. This suggests that Ethiopian wolves \u2013 or a close and extinct relative \u2013 once had a much larger range within Africa to admix with other canids. There is evidence of gene flow between the eastern population and the Ethiopian wolf, which has led to the eastern population being distinct from the northwestern population. The common ancestor of both African golden wolf populations was a genetically [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72% gray wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. There is evidence of gene flow between African golden wolves,  golden jackals, and gray wolves. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] showed high admixture with the Middle Eastern gray wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and continents in canid evolution. African golden wolves form a sister clade to Middle Eastern gray wolves based on mitochondrial DNA, but to coyotes and gray wolves based on nuclear DNA.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\n===Relationship to the Himalayan wolf===\nBetween 2011 and 2015, two mDNA studies found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] and [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian wolf]] were closer to the African golden wolf than they were to the Holarctic gray wolf.<ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=koepfli2015/> In 2017, a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]], [[X-chromosome]] (maternal lineage) markers and [[Y-chromosome]] (male lineage) markers found that the Himalayan wolf is genetically [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to the Holarctic gray wolf. The Himalayan wolf shares a maternal lineage with the African golden wolf, and possesses a unique paternal lineage that falls between the gray wolf and the African golden wolf.<ref name=werhahn2017/>\n\n===Subspecies===\nAlthough in the past several attempts have been made to [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymise]] many of the proposed names, the taxonomic position of West African wolves, in particular, is too confused to come to any precise conclusion, as the collected study materials are few. Prior to 1840, six of the 10 supposed West African subspecies were named or classed almost entirely because of their fur color.<ref name=\"r38\">Rosevear, Donovan Reginald (1974). \"The carnivores of West Africa\".

The basic social unit is a breeding pair, followed by its current offspring, or offspring from previous litters staying as \"helpers\".<ref name=\"jhala2004\"/> Large groups are rare, and have only been recorded to occur in areas with abundant human waste. Family relationships among African golden wolves are comparatively peaceful compared to those of the [[black-backed jackal]]; although the sexual and territorial behavior of grown pups is suppressed by the breeding pair, they are not actively driven off once they attain adulthood. African golden wolves also lie together and groom each other much more frequently than black-backed jackals. In the Serengeti, pairs defend permanent territories encompassing 2\u20134&nbsp;km\u00b2, and will vacate their territories only to drink or when lured by a large carcass.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> The pair patrols and [[territorial marking|marks its territory]] in tandem. Both partners and helpers will react aggressively towards intruders, though the greatest aggression is reserved for intruders of the same sex; pair members do not assist each other in repelling intruders of the opposite sex.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n[[File:Canis anthus threat postures.png|thumb|Threat postures in ''C. a. lupaster'' (left) and ''C. a. anthus'' (right)]]\n{{anchor|Courtship}}The African golden wolf's courtship rituals are remarkably long, during which the breeding pair remains almost constantly together. Prior to mating, the pair patrols and [[scent mark]]s its territory. [[Animal sexual behavior|Copulation]] is preceded by the female holding her tail out and angled in such a way that her genitalia are exposed. The two approach each other, whimpering, lifting their tails and bristling their fur, displaying varying intensities of offensive and defensive behavior. The female sniffs and licks the male's genitals, whilst the male nuzzles the female's fur. They may circle each other and fight briefly. The [[copulatory tie]] lasts roughly four minutes. Towards the end of estrus, the pair drifts apart, with the female often approaching the male in a comparatively more submissive manner. In anticipation of the role he will take in raising pups, the male regurgitates or surrenders any food he has to the female. In the Serengeti, pups are born in December\u2013January, and begin eating solid food after a month. [[Weaning]] starts at the age of two months, and ends at four months. At this stage, the pups are semi-independent, venturing up to 50 meters from the den, even sleeping in the open. Their playing behavior becomes increasingly more aggressive, with the pups competing for rank, which is established after six months. The female feeds the pups more frequently than the male or helpers do, though the presence of the latter allows the breeding pair to leave the den and hunt without leaving the litter unprotected.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nThe African golden wolf's life centers around a home burrow, which usually consists of an abandoned and modified [[aardvark]] or [[warthog]] earth. The interior structure of this burrow is poorly understood, though it is thought to consist of a single central chamber with 2\u20133 escape routes. The home burrow can be located in both secluded areas or surprisingly near the dens of other predators.<ref name=\"r47\"/>\n\n===Communication===\nAfrican golden wolves frequently groom one another, particularly during courtship, during which it can last up to 30 minutes.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Nibbling of the face and neck is observed during greeting ceremonies. When fighting, the African golden wolf slams its opponents with its hips, and bites and shakes the shoulder. The species' postures are typically canine, and it has more facial mobility than the black-backed and side-striped jackals, being able to expose its [[canine teeth]] like a dog.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nThe vocabulary of the African golden wolf is similar to that of the domestic dog, with seven sounds having been recorded.<ref name=\"kingdon1988\"/> The African golden wolf's vocalizations include howls, barks, growls, whines and cackles.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> Subspecies can be recognised by differences in their howls.<ref name=\"kingdon1988\"/> One of the most commonly heard sounds is a high, keening wail, of which there are three varieties; a long single toned continuous howl, a wail that rises and falls, and a series of short, staccato howls. These howls are used to repel intruders and attract family members. Howling in chorus is thought to reinforce family bonds, as well as establish territorial status.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> A comparative analysis of African golden wolf and some gray wolf subspecies' howls demonstrated that the former's howls bear similarities to those of the [[Indian wolf]], being high-pitched and of relatively short duration.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hennelly | first1 = Lauren | last2 = Habib | first2 = Bilal | last3 = Root-Gutteridge | first3 = Holly | last4 = Palacios | first4 = Vicente | last5 = Passilongo | first5 = Daniela | year = 2017 | title = Howl variation across Himalayan, North African, Indian, and Holarctic wolf clades: tracing divergence in the world's oldest wolf lineages using acoustics | url = | journal = Current Zoology | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 341\u2013348 | doi=10.1093/cz/zox001| pmid = 29491993 | pmc = 5804178 }}</ref>\n\n===Hunting behavior===\n[[File:Golden Wolf, navigating Wildebeest, Ngorongoro.jpg|thumb|right|A Serengeti wolf (''C. a. bea'') navigating through a herd of [[blue wildebeest]] in the [[Ngorongoro National Park]], [[Tanzania]]]]\nThe African golden wolf rarely catches hares, due to their speed. [[Gazelle]] mothers (often working in groups of two or three) are formidable when defending their young against single wolves, which are much more successful in hunting gazelle fawns when working in pairs. A pair of wolves will methodically search for concealed gazelle fawns within herds, tall grass, bushes and other likely hiding places.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\nAlthough it is known to kill animals up to three times its own weight, the African golden wolf targets mammalian prey much less frequently than the [[black-backed jackal]] overall.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/> On capturing large prey, the African golden wolf makes no attempt to kill it; instead it rips open the belly and eats the entrails. Small prey is typically killed by shaking, though snakes may be eaten alive from the tail end. The African golden wolf often carries away more food than it can consume, and [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|caches]] the surplus, which is generally recovered within 24 hours.<ref name=\"r47\"/> When foraging for insects, the African golden wolf turns over dung piles to find dung beetles. During the dry seasons, it excavates dung balls to reach the larvae inside. Grasshoppers and flying termites are caught either by pouncing on them while they are on the ground or are caught in mid-air. It is fiercely intolerant of other scavengers, having been known to dominate [[Old World Vulture|vultures]] on kills \u2013 one can hold dozens of vultures at bay by threatening, snapping and lunging at them.<ref name=\"estes1992\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Distribution and habitat===\nFossil finds dating back to the [[Pleistocene]] indicate that the species' range was not always restricted to Africa, with remains having been found in the [[Levant]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name=viranta2017/> In [[Tanzania]], the African golden wolf is limited to a small area of the north between the western slopes of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and the centre of the [[Serengeti]]. In the latter area, it occurs mostly in the short-grass plains, the floor of the [[Ngorongoro Crater]], and the plains between the Olmoti and Empakai Craters, being relatively rare in [[Serengeti National Park]], [[Loliondo]] and the [[Maswa District|Maswa]] game reserve. The species also inhabits the [[Lake Natron]] area and West Kilimanjaro. It is sometimes found in the northern part of [[Arusha National Park]], and as far south as [[Manyara Region|Manyara]]. In areas where it is common, such as the short-grass plains of Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater, population densities can range between 0.5-1.5 specimens per km<sup>2</sup>. A population decrease of 60% has been recorded in the southern plains of Serengeti National Park since the early 1970s, though the reasons are unknown.<ref>Foley, C. et al.

The home team for each tie was determined by the toss of a coin unless it was mutually agreed or only one of the two clubs drawn against one another had a private ground. In the event of a draw, the team who lost the toss would have the choice of ground for the replay. A similar procedure was used for subsequent rounds however, any club which had received a bye in the previous round would first be drawn against one of the winners of the previous round. The names of winning teams were placed into one lot for later rounds. The choice of venue for the final matches was reserved to the [[Scottish Football Association]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/uploads/3/3/6/0/3360867/scottish_football_annual_1875.pdf |title=Rules of the Scottish Football Association |publisher=Scottish Football Association |date=14 October 1875 |accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Calendar===\n\nThe exact dates of some matches are unknown as newspaper coverage of football in the late 19th century was not as comprehensive as it would become.<ref name=\"Potter and Jones\"/><ref name=\"Soccer Books\">{{cite book |date=2017 |title=Scottish F.A.

The home team for each tie was determined by the toss of a coin unless it was mutually agreed or only one of the two clubs drawn against one another had a private ground. In the event of a draw, the team who lost the toss would have the choice of ground for the replay. A similar procedure was used for subsequent rounds however, any club which had received a bye in the previous round would first be drawn against one of the winners of the previous round. The names of winning teams were placed into one lot for later rounds. The choice of venue for the final matches was reserved to the [[Scottish Football Association]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/uploads/3/3/6/0/3360867/scottish_football_annual_1875.pdf |title=Rules of the Scottish Football Association |publisher=Scottish Football Association |date=14 October 1875 |accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Calendar===\n\nThe exact dates of some matches are unknown as newspaper coverage of football in the late 19th century was not as comprehensive as it would become.<ref name=\"Potter and Jones\"/><ref name=\"Soccer Books\">{{cite book |date=2017 |title=Scottish F.A.

An official [[.NET Framework|.NET]] wrapper written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] is available and makes it easier for .NET applications to interact with SEAL.\n\n== Features ==\n\n=== Algorithms ===\nMicrosoft SEAL supports both [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetric]] and [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric]] (added in version 3.4) encryption algorithms.\n\n=== Scheme types ===\nMicrosoft SEAL comes with two different homomorphic encryption schemes with very different properties:\n\n* '''BFV'''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Junfeng|last2=Vercauteren|first2=Frederik|date=2012|title=Somewhat Practical Fully Homomorphic Encryption|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/144}}</ref>: The BFV scheme allows modular arithmetic to be performed on encrypted integers. For applications where exact values are necessary, the BFV scheme is the only choice.\n* '''CKKS'''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheon|first=Jung Hee|last2=Kim|first2=Andrey|last3=Kim|first3=Miran|last4=Song|first4=Yongsoo|date=2017|editor-last=Takagi|editor-first=Tsuyoshi|editor2-last=Peyrin|editor2-first=Thomas|title=Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-70694-8_15|journal=Advances in Cryptology \u2013 ASIACRYPT 2017|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|location=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|pages=409\u2013437|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-70694-8_15|isbn=978-3-319-70694-8}}</ref>: The CKKS scheme allows additions and multiplications on encrypted real or complex numbers, but yields only approximate results.

[[John Corridan]] (1911\u20131984), whose populist activism later provided the inspiration for the film ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954). He trained for the priesthood in the Philippines, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1954 and a master\u2019s degree in 1955 from [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines#Defunct_institutions|Berchmans College]] in [[Cebu City]].{{efn|During these years he became acquainted with Philippine first lady [[Imelda Marcos]]: \"I knew Mrs. Marcos pretty well.
