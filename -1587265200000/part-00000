A popular breakfast dish in [[Thailand]], ''kuy teav'' can be found at marketplace stalls, roadside vendors, restaurants and in [[shophouses]] across the country, and is distinguished by its clear broth and array of herbs, aromatics and other garnishes and condiments.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''kway teow'' derives from the [[Teochew dialect|Teochew Chinese]] word {{lang|zh|[[wikt:\u7cbf\u689d|\u7cbf\u689d]]}} ([[peng'im]]: ''gu\u00ea<sup>2</sup>diao<sup>5</sup>'') and refers to cut noodles made from long-grain rice flour (as opposed to glutinous rice flour).<ref name=\"Nath\">[[Chuon Nath|Nath, Chuon]]. Khmer-Khmer Dictionary.

The term has cognates in [[Southeast Asia]] with ''[[h\u1ee7 ti\u1ebfu]]'' in Vietnamese,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Hai ti\u1ebfng \u201ch\u1ee7 t\u00edu\u201d c\u00f3 ph\u1ea3i do ti\u1ebfng Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u00f4ng m\u00e0 ra?|trans-title=Does the compound word \u201ch\u1ee7 t\u00edu\u201d come from Cantonese?|work=H\u1ed3n Vi\u1ec7t|location=Ho Chi Minh City|date=September 14, 2010|accessdate=July 16, 2018|url=http://honvietquochoc.com.vn/bai-viet/3138-hai-ting-h-tu-c-phi-do-ting-qung-ng-m-ra.aspx|language=vi}}</ref> ''[[kway teow]]'' in Malaysia and Singapore, and ''kuai tiao'' ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27}}) in Thai being analogues.\n\n==Preparation==\n''Kuy teav'' is prepared with partially dry thin squarish rice noodles cooked by quickly immersing the noodles in boiling water. The noodles are then strained, placed into a bowl, and moistened with nutty, caramelised [[garlic oil]]. After dressing with a sticky brown liquid made of [[oyster sauce]], [[soy sauce]] and a pinch of [[sugar]], the bowl is then filled with a clear broth made from pork bones, dried squid, and sugar, and seasoned with a bit of fish sauce. Then the meat toppings are added, which may include an assembly of different types of meat, such as [[Gi\u00f2 l\u1ee5a|pork loaf]], minced pork, pork belly, duck, seafood or offal. Availability is the main factor in what toppings are used in ''kuy teav''; some versions can be quite humble and basic, using only some ground pork and perhaps some [[dried shrimp]] for protein, while others can be more time-consuming and extravagant. Finally, when the dish is presented at the table, the diner may add a number of garnishes and aromatics to customise the dish in accordance with his or her preferences.\n\nMoreover, ''kuy teav'' may be presented in one of two ways: with all the ingredients in the soup, or with the soup on the side. Both versions can have exactly the same ingredients but allow the diner to control the balance of flavours, spiciness and textures. When the dish is served this way (\u201cdry\u201d as opposed to \u201cwet\u201d) the dish takes on the appearance of a noodle salad. Finally, the Phnom Penh version of ''kuy teav'' is the most extravagant and features the most embellishments, owing to the city\u2019s historical wealth and importance.

A popular breakfast dish in [[Cambodia]], ''kuy teav'' can be found at marketplace (''phsar'') stalls, roadside vendors, restaurants and in [[shophouses]] across the country, and is distinguished by its clear broth and array of herbs, aromatics and other garnishes and condiments.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''kway teow'' derives from the [[Teochew dialect|Teochew Chinese]] word {{lang|zh|[[wikt:\u7cbf\u689d|\u7cbf\u689d]]}} ([[peng'im]]: ''gu\u00ea<sup>2</sup>diao<sup>5</sup>'') and refers to cut noodles made from long-grain rice flour (as opposed to glutinous rice flour).<ref name=\"Nath\">[[Chuon Nath|Nath, Chuon]].

The term has cognates in [[Southeast Asia]] with ''[[h\u1ee7 ti\u1ebfu]]'' in Vietnamese,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Hai ti\u1ebfng \u201ch\u1ee7 t\u00edu\u201d c\u00f3 ph\u1ea3i do ti\u1ebfng Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u00f4ng m\u00e0 ra?|trans-title=Does the compound word \u201ch\u1ee7 t\u00edu\u201d come from Cantonese?|work=H\u1ed3n Vi\u1ec7t|location=Ho Chi Minh City|date=September 14, 2010|accessdate=July 16, 2018|url=http://honvietquochoc.com.vn/bai-viet/3138-hai-ting-h-tu-c-phi-do-ting-qung-ng-m-ra.aspx|language=vi}}</ref> ''[[kway teow]]'' in Malaysia and Singapore, and ''kuai tiao'' ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27}}) in Thai being analogues.\n\n==Preparation==\n''Kuy teav'' is prepared with partially dry thin squarish rice noodles cooked by quickly immersing the noodles in boiling water. The noodles are then strained, placed into a bowl, and moistened with nutty, caramelised [[garlic oil]]. After dressing with a sticky brown liquid made of [[oyster sauce]], [[soy sauce]] and a pinch of [[sugar]], the bowl is then filled with a clear broth made from pork bones, dried squid, and sugar, and seasoned with a bit of fish sauce. Then the meat toppings are added, which may include an assembly of different types of meat, such as [[Gi\u00f2 l\u1ee5a|pork loaf]], minced pork, pork belly, duck, seafood or offal. Availability is the main factor in what toppings are used in ''kuy teav''; some versions can be quite humble and basic, using only some ground pork and perhaps some [[dried shrimp]] for protein, while others can be more time-consuming and extravagant. Finally, when the dish is presented at the table, the diner may add a number of garnishes and aromatics to customise the dish in accordance with his or her preferences.\n\n==In Cambodia==\nIn Cambodia, ''kuy teav'' is still primarily a [[breakfast]] dish, and will typically be sold out by vendors before midday. As the pork broth is intended to be subtle rather than spicy, a plethora of optional herbs and other aromatics is always presented, allowing the diner to adjust the textures and flavours of the dish to his or her liking. In fact, in Cambodia it is precisely the use of garnishes and condiments that defines the main flavour profile of the dish (garlic, limes and pepper are a common flavour trio in Cambodian cuisine), rather than the broth. The dish is served with garnishes that can include [[lettuce]] leaves, [[sprouting|bean sprouts]], fresh herbs (such as [[spring onions]] (scallions), [[eryngium foetidum|sawtooth coriander]] and [[holy basil]]), crushed black [[Kampot (pepper)|kampot pepper]], lime juice, and caramelised garlic oil. Many types of chilli (fresh, dried, pickled) and chilli sauce are also normally present at the table, to either add into the broth or to be used as a dipping sauce for the meat toppings, as well as [[soy sauce]], [[fish sauce]] and sugar. ''Kuy teav'' is also sometimes eaten with [[Youtiao|deep fried breadsticks]], similar to how the Cambodians would eat [[congee]] (rice porridge).\n\nMoreover, ''kuy teav'' may be presented in one of two ways: with all the ingredients in the soup, or with the soup on the side. Both versions can have exactly the same ingredients but allow the diner to control the balance of flavours, spiciness and textures. When the dish is served this way (\u201cdry\u201d as opposed to \u201cwet\u201d) the dish takes on the appearance of a noodle salad. Finally, the Phnom Penh version of ''kuy teav'' is the most extravagant and features the most embellishments, owing to the city\u2019s historical wealth and importance. ''Kuy teav Phnom Penh'' may contain some or all of the following toppings: sliced [[pork belly]], ground pork, pig\u2019s blood jelly, chopped pork offal (such as intestine, heart, liver and lung), [[Peking duck|roast duck]], Mekong River prawns, sliced [[fish cake]] and [[squid]]. Modern-day versions of ''kuy teav'' featuring beef, chicken or seafood (rather than the original pork broth) have also evolved, but the plethora of garnishes that distinguish ''kuy teav'' remains the same.\n\n[[File:Kuyteavphnompenhkok.jpg|thumb|Kuy teav Phnom Penh kok]]\n\n==Vietnam==\n{{lang|vi|H\u1ee7 ti\u1ebfu}} or {{lang|vi|h\u1ee7 t\u00edu}} is eaten in Vietnam as a [[breakfast]] dish.

During this time, his relations with the Asato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Asato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank\u014d Asato.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/>\n\n==Shotokan Karate==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\nFunakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan [[karate]] of the time: [[Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b]] and [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]]. Shotokan is named after Funakoshi's pen name, ''Sh\u014dt\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u677e|\u677e]][[wikt:\u6fe4|\u6fe4]]), which means \"waving pines\".  ''Kan'' means training hall or house, thus ''Sh\u014dt\u014dkan'' (\u677e\u6fe4\u9928) referred to the \"house of Sh\u014dt\u014d\". This name was coined by Funakoshi's students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught. In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would [[meditation|meditate]] and write his poetry.<ref name=\"threemasters\">John Stevens (1995). \"Three Budo Masters: Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba\". Kodansha International {{ISBN|4-7700-1852-5}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings. Continuing his effort to garner widespread interest in Okinawan karate, Funakoshi ventured to mainland Japan in 1917, and again in 1922.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" />\n\nIn 1930, Funakoshi established an association named Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai to promote communication and information exchange among people who study karate-d\u014d. In 1936, Dai-Nippon Karate-do Kenkyukai changed its name to Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |title=The Official Homepage of Nihon Karate-do Shotokai |access-date=2010-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227032101/http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The association is known today as [[Shotokai]], and is the official keeper of Funakoshi's karate heritage.\n\nIn 1936, Funakoshi built the first Sh\u014dt\u014dkan ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) in Tokyo. While on the Japanese mainland, he changed the [[kanji|written characters]]  of karate to mean \"empty hand\" (\u7a7a\u624b) instead of \"China hand\" (\u5510\u624b) (literally [[Tang dynasty]]) to downplay its connection to [[Chinese boxing]]. Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing.  Funakoshi also argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of \"empty\" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object.\n\nFunakoshi's re-interpretation of the [[kanji|character]] ''kara'' in karate to mean \"empty\" ([[wikt:\u7a7a|\u7a7a]]) rather than \"Chinese\" ([[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]])  caused some tension with traditionalists back in Okinawa, prompting Funakoshi to remain in [[Tokyo]] indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1949 Funakoshi's students created the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization. However, in practise this organization was led by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]. The JKA began formalizing Funakoshi's teachings.\n\n==Illness and death==\nFunakoshi developed [[osteoarthritis]] in 1948, and died in April 26, 1957.\n\n==Legacy==\nFunakoshi published several books on karate including his autobiography, ''Karate-Do: My Way of Life''. His legacy, however, rests in a document containing his philosophies of karate training now referred to as the ''[[niju kun]]'', or \"twenty principles\".  These rules are the premise of training for all Shotokan practitioners and are published in a work titled ''The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate''.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate: The Spiritual Legacy of the Master  | publisher=Kodansha International Ltd | author=Funakoshi, Gichin | translator=John Teramoto| year=1975 |isbn=4-7700-2796-6}}</ref> Within this book, Funakoshi lays out 20 rules by which students of karate are urged to abide in an effort to \"become better human beings\".<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" /> Funakoshi's Karate-Do Kyohan \"The Master Text\" remains his most detailed publication, containing sections on history, basics, [[kata]], and [[kumite]].

From about eleven years old he began to study to-te jutsu under [[Azato Anko]] and [[Itosu Anko]]. He practiced diligently and in 1912 became the president of the Okinawan Shobukai. In May 1922, he relocated to Tokyo and became a professional teacher of karate-do. He devoted his entire life to the development of karate-do.

His father's name was Gisu.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> After entering primary school he became close friends with the son of [[Ank\u014d Asato]], a karate and [[Jigen-ry\u016b]] master who would soon become his first karate teacher.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> \n\u2212\t\nFunakoshi's family was stiffly opposed to the Meiji government's abolition of the Japanese [[Chonmage|topknot]], and this meant that he would be ineligible to pursue his goal of attending medical school (where topknots were banned), despite having passed the entrance examination.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/> Being trained in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, Funakoshi became an assistant teacher in Okinawa. During this time, his relations with the Asato family grew and he began nightly travels to the Asato family residence to receive karate instruction from Ank\u014d Asato.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\"/>\n\n==Shotokan Karate==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\nFunakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan [[karate]] of the time: [[Sh\u014drei-ry\u016b]] and [[Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b]]. Shotokan is named after Funakoshi's pen name, ''Sh\u014dt\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u677e|\u677e]][[wikt:\u6fe4|\u6fe4]]), which means \"waving pines\".  ''Kan'' means training hall or house, thus ''Sh\u014dt\u014dkan'' (\u677e\u6fe4\u9928) referred to the \"house of Sh\u014dt\u014d\". This name was coined by Funakoshi's students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught. In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would [[meditation|meditate]] and write his poetry.<ref name=\"threemasters\">John Stevens (1995). \"Three Budo Masters: Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba\". Kodansha International {{ISBN|4-7700-1852-5}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings. Continuing his effort to garner widespread interest in Okinawan karate, Funakoshi ventured to mainland Japan in 1917, and again in 1922.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" />\n\nIn 1930, Funakoshi established an association named Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai to promote communication and information exchange among people who study karate-d\u014d. In 1936, Dai-Nippon Karate-do Kenkyukai changed its name to Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |title=The Official Homepage of Nihon Karate-do Shotokai |access-date=2010-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227032101/http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The association is known today as [[Shotokai]], and is the official keeper of Funakoshi's karate heritage.\n\nIn 1936, Funakoshi built the first Sh\u014dt\u014dkan ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) in Tokyo. While on the Japanese mainland, he changed the [[kanji|written characters]]  of karate to mean \"empty hand\" (\u7a7a\u624b) instead of \"China hand\" (\u5510\u624b) (literally [[Tang dynasty]]) to downplay its connection to [[Chinese boxing]]. Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing.  Funakoshi also argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of \"empty\" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object.\n\nFunakoshi's re-interpretation of the [[kanji|character]] ''kara'' in karate to mean \"empty\" ([[wikt:\u7a7a|\u7a7a]]) rather than \"Chinese\" ([[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]])  caused some tension with traditionalists back in Okinawa, prompting Funakoshi to remain in [[Tokyo]] indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1949 Funakoshi's students created the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization. However, in practise this organization was led by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]. The JKA began formalizing Funakoshi's teachings.\n\n==Illness and death==\nFunakoshi developed [[osteoarthritis]] in 1948, and died in April 26, 1957.\n\n==Legacy==\nFunakoshi published several books on karate including his autobiography, ''Karate-Do: My Way of Life''. His legacy, however, rests in a document containing his philosophies of karate training now referred to as the ''[[niju kun]]'', or \"twenty principles\".  These rules are the premise of training for all Shotokan practitioners and are published in a work titled ''The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate''.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate: The Spiritual Legacy of the Master  | publisher=Kodansha International Ltd | author=Funakoshi, Gichin | translator=John Teramoto| year=1975 |isbn=4-7700-2796-6}}</ref> Within this book, Funakoshi lays out 20 rules by which students of karate are urged to abide in an effort to \"become better human beings\".<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" /> Funakoshi's Karate-Do Kyohan \"The Master Text\" remains his most detailed publication, containing sections on history, basics, [[kata]], and [[kumite]].

If at each date-event there exists a complete set of such contracts, one for each contingency that can occur at the following date, individuals will trade these contracts in order to insure against future risks, targeting a desirable and budget feasible level of consumption in each state (i.e. [[consumption smoothing]]). In most set ups when these contracts are not available, optimal risk sharing between [[Agent (economics)|agents]] will not be possible. For this scenario, agents (homeowners, workers, firms, investors, etc.) will lack the instruments to insure against future risks such as employment status, health, labor income, prices, among others.\n\n== Markets, securities and market incompleteness ==\n\nIn a [[competitive market]], each agent makes [[intertemporal choice]]s in a [[stochastic]] environment.

While several contingent claims are traded routinely against many states such as insurance policies, [[futures contract|futures]], financial [[option (finance)|option]]s, among others, the set of outcomes is far greater than the set of claims.\n\nIn practice the idea of a state contingent security for every possible realization of nature seems unrealistic. For example, if the economy lacks the institutions to guarantee that the contracts are enforced, it is unlikely that agents will either sell or buy these securities.\n\nAnother common way to motivate the absence of state contingent securities is [[Information asymmetry|asymmetric information]] between agents. For example, the realization of labor income for a given individual is private information and it cannot be known without cost by anyone else. If an insurance company cannot verify the individual's labor income, the former would always have the incentive to claim a low realization of income and the market would collapse.\n\n== Failure of the standard complete markets model ==\n\nMany authors have argued that modeling incomplete markets and other sorts of financial [[Frictionless market|frictions]] is crucial to explain the counterfactual predictions of the standard Complete Market models. The most notable example is the [[equity premium puzzle]] Mehra and Prescott (1985),<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Mehra | first1=R. | last2=Prescott | first2=E.C. | date=1985 | title=The Equity Premium: A Puzzle. | journal=J.

For example, in a Complete Market framework, given that agents can fully insure against idiosyncratic risks, each individual's consumption must fluctuate as much as anyone else's, and the relative position in terms wealth distribution of an individual should not vary much over time. The empirical evidence suggests otherwise. Further, the individual consumptions are not highly correlated with each other and wealth holdings are very volatile.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Christopher | last=Carroll | date=1997 | title=Buffer-stock saving and the Life Cycle/Permanent Income Hypothesis | journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics | volume=112 | issue=1 | pages=1\u201356| doi=10.1162/003355397555109 | url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w5788.pdf }}</ref>\n\n== Modeling market incompleteness ==\n\nIn the economic and financial literature, a significant effort has been made in recent years to part from the setting of Complete Markets.

This literature has focused on information frictions. Risk sharing in private information models with asset accumulation and enforcement frictions. The advantage of this approach is that market incompleteness and the available state contingent claims respond to the economic environment, which makes the model appealing for policy experiments since it is less vulnerable to the [[Lucas critique]].\n\n== Example of complete vs. incomplete markets ==\n\nSuppose there is an economy with two agents (Robinson and Jane) with identical [[log utility]] functions. There are two equally likely states of nature. If state 1 is realized, Robinson is endowed with 1 unit of wealth and Jane with 0. In state 2, Robinson gets 0 while Jane receives 1 unit of wealth. With Complete Markets there are two state contingent claims:\n*<math> q_1  </math> pays 1 unit in state 1 and 0 otherwise.\n*<math> q_2  </math> pays 1 unit in state 2 and 0 in state 1.\n\nBefore the realization of the uncertainty, the two agents can trade the state contingent securities. In equilibrium, the two Arrow-Debreu securities have the same price and the allocation is as follows:\n* Robinson buys 0.5 of <math> q_2 </math>  and sells 0.5 of <math> q_1  </math>.\n* Jane buys 0.5 of <math> q_1  </math>  and sells 0.5 of <math> q_2  </math>.\n\nThe main outcome in this economy is that both Robinson and Jane will end up with 0.5 units of wealth independently of the state of nature that is realized.\n\nIf the market is incomplete, meaning one or both of the securities are not available for trade, the two agents can't trade to hedge against a bad realization of nature and thus remain exposed to the possibility of the undesirable outcome of having zero wealth. In fact, with certainty, one of the agents will be 'rich' and the other 'poor'.\n\nThis example is an extreme case of market incompleteness. In practice, agents do have some type of savings or insurance instrument. The main point here is to illustrate the potential welfare losses that can arise if markets are incomplete.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Complete market]]\n*[[Financial innovation]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== Literature ==\n*{{Citation\n| last = Magill\n| first = Michael J.P.\n| last2 = Quinzii\n| first2 = Martine|author2-link= Martine Quinzii\n| title = Theory of Incomplete Markets\n| place = Cambridge (Massachusetts), London (England)\n| publisher = [[The MIT Press]]\n| volume = Vol. I\n| year = 1996\n| isbn = 0-262-13324-5}}\n\n[[Category:Mathematical finance]]\n", "text_old": "In economics, '''incomplete markets''' are markets in which the number of [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model|Arrow\u2013Debreu]] securities  is less than the number of states  of nature.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Arrow | first=K. | title=The Role of Securities in the Optimal Allocation of Risk Bearing | journal=Review of Economic Studies | volume=31 | issue=2 | pages=91\u201396 | jstor=2296188| year=1964 | doi=10.2307/2296188 }}</ref> In contrast with [[complete market]]s, this shortage of securities will likely restrict individuals from transferring the desired level of wealth among states.\n\nAn Arrow security purchased or sold at date ''t'' is a contract promising to deliver one unit of income in one of the possible contingencies which can occur at date ''t'' + 1.
