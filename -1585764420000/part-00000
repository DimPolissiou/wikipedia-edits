By the 1870s, 17 families, most of them immigrating as a result of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|potato famine]] in Ireland, had come to Minnesota and claimed land in the southwest section of what was then Richfield Township.<ref name=\"edinachapterhistorybook\">{{cite book|last1=Morse-Kahn|first1=Deborah|title=Edina : Chapters in the City History|date=1998|publisher=City of Edina|location=Edina, Minn.|isbn=0-9605054-1-5|pages=16\u201317}}</ref> They were followed by settlers from New England and Germany, who claimed additional land near [[Minnehaha Creek]].<ref name=\"settler-nationality\">{{cite book|last1=Hesterman|first1=Paul D.|title=The History of Edina, Minnesota : From Settlement to Suburb|date=1988|publisher=Burgess Pub.|location=Edina, MN|isbn=0-8087-9058-7|pages=4\u20135}}</ref> The Baird and Grimes neighborhoods (which are both listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]) and the Country Club District (then known as Waterville Mills) in the northeast part of Edina were among the first areas to be established.

The idea was favorably accepted by those within the community and a committee was established to oversee the transition.<ref name=\"City of Edina\">{{cite web|title=Edina's Name|url=https://www.edinamn.gov/1016/Edinas-Name|publisher=The City of Edina|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Naming ===\nAfter the decision was made to form a new village, a debate ensued regarding the naming of the new village.  Several town meetings were held in the [[Minnehaha Grange Hall]], during which the names Hennepin Park, Westfield and Edina were suggested.  Minutes taken by Henry F. Brown, a farmer and future owner (1889) of the [[Edina Mill]], are summarized as follows:\n\n{{quote|A long debate ensued with regard to the name by which the corporation shall be called. A motion was made and passed to reconsider the vote taken at the previous meeting of the name of the proposed village, Westfield.  Another motion was then made by Andrew Craik to call the proposed village Edina (upon moving to the township in 1869 from Edinburgh, he bought and renamed the mill to the Edina Mill). Before the motion could be decided, James A. Bull, a member of the five person committee, made another motion to adjourn, which was seconded by the majority.  However, the chairman of the meeting called this motion out of order, at which time disorder ensued with Baird, Wilson, Ryan and Bull declaring their intent to no longer serve as members of the committee if a gag law was to prevail. During this heated moment the meeting became somewhat boisterous until, after a few minutes order was restored.  Seeing that no more work could be done at this time, a final motion was made and passed to reschedule the meeting to a future date.<ref name=\"From Settlement to Suburb\">''From Settlement to Suburb: The History of Edina, Minnesota'' by Paul Hesterman, Published by the Edina Historical Society, 1988</ref>}}\n\nAt the next meeting, the name Edina was finally chosen with a vote of 47 for and 42 against.<ref name=\"City of Edina\" />\n\nThere has been a prevailing [[mythology|myth]] about the decision to name the new village Edina, which states that two opposing communities\u2014the [[Irish people|Irish]] Cahill community and the Scottish Mill community\u2014fought about whether to give the community an Irish name (Killarney Lakes) or a Scottish name (Edina).  The 1860 [[census]], however, indicates that there were no Scottish people in Edina in 1860, and only a couple were present at the time of Edina's founding (1888).<ref name=\"settler-nationality\" />\n\n===Morningside===\n{{Main|Morningside, Minnesota}}\nThe first suburban development in Edina occurred during the early 1900s in Morningside, a neighborhood in the northeastern part of the village.  As Morningside grew, conflict arose between its residents who wanted more city services, and the residents of the rest of the village who wanted to maintain Edina's rural character.  As a result of that conflict, Morningside seceded from Edina in 1920 and became a separate village.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hesterman|first1=Paul D.|title=The history of Edina, Minnesota : from settlement to suburb|date=1988|publisher=Burgess Pub.|location=Edina, MN|isbn=0-8087-9058-7|pages=48\u201350}}</ref> In 1966, however, the Village of Morningside once again became part of Edina.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hesterman|first1=Paul D.|title=The history of Edina, Minnesota : from settlement to suburb|date=1988|publisher=Burgess Pub.|location=Edina, MN|isbn=0-8087-9058-7|page=97}}</ref>\n\n===Early settlement===\nEdina was not the first settlement in its location.

Although in poor condition and rated for speeds less than 35&nbsp;mph the tracks are still used by freight trains. Under the [[Dan Patch Corridor]] proposal commuter trains would operate between Minneapolis and Northfield with a station in Edina, requiring hundreds of millions of dollars of upgrades to the rail corridor. A feasibility study was conducted in 2000 and found that while ridership would be high there would be a significant cost to upgrade the corridor for commuter trains. Due to this and strong opposition from residents living near the rail line, the proposal was put on hold until other commuter rail lines could be built. In 2002 a legislative gag order was placed on the project, which forbid the Metropolitan Council, MnDOT, and county rail authorities from discussing, studying, and building commuter rail on the Dan Patch Line. In 2017 the Edina City Council conducted a study on the pros and cons of passenger rail on the Dan Patch Line. The conclusion was to not pursue passenger rail at this time (as of 2018). {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Braemar golf course.jpg|thumb|Overlooking the 12th hole on [[Braemar Golf Course]]]]\n\n===Parks===\nEdina's parkland and open space total more than {{convert|1,550|acre|km2}}.

Several town meetings were held in the [[Minnehaha Grange Hall]], during which the names Hennepin Park, Westfield and Edina were suggested.  Minutes taken by Henry F. Brown, a farmer and future owner (1889) of the [[Edina Mill]], are summarized as follows:\n\n{{quote|A long debate ensued with regard to the name by which the corporation shall be called. A motion was made and passed to reconsider the vote taken at the previous meeting of the name of the proposed village, Westfield.  Another motion was then made by Andrew Craik to call the proposed village Edina (upon moving to the township in 1869 from Edinburgh, he bought and renamed the mill to the Edina Mill). Before the motion could be decided, James A. Bull, a member of the five person committee, made another motion to adjourn, which was seconded by the majority.  However, the chairman of the meeting called this motion out of order, at which time disorder ensued with Baird, Wilson, Ryan and Bull declaring their intent to no longer serve as members of the committee if a gag law was to prevail. During this heated moment the meeting became somewhat boisterous until, after a few minutes order was restored.  Seeing that no more work could be done at this time, a final motion was made and passed to reschedule the meeting to a future date.<ref name=\"From Settlement to Suburb\">''From Settlement to Suburb: The History of Edina, Minnesota'' by Paul Hesterman, Published by the Edina Historical Society, 1988</ref>}}\n\nAt the next meeting, the name Edina was finally chosen with a vote of 47 for and 42 against.<ref name=\"City of Edina\" />\n\nThere has been a prevailing [[mythology|myth]] about the decision to name the new village Edina, which states that two opposing communities\u2014the [[Irish people|Irish]] Cahill community and the Scottish Mill community\u2014fought about whether to give the community an Irish name (Killarney Lakes) or a Scottish name (Edina).  The 1860 [[census]], however, indicates that there were no Scottish people in Edina in 1860, and only a couple were present at the time of Edina's founding (1888).<ref name=\"settler-nationality\" />\n\n===Morningside===\n{{Main|Morningside, Minnesota}}\nThe first suburban development in Edina occurred during the early 1900s in Morningside, a neighborhood in the northeastern part of the village.  As Morningside grew, conflict arose between its residents who wanted more city services, and the residents of the rest of the village who wanted to maintain Edina's rural character.  As a result of that conflict, Morningside seceded from Edina in 1920 and became a separate village.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hesterman|first1=Paul D.|title=The history of Edina, Minnesota : from settlement to suburb|date=1988|publisher=Burgess Pub.|location=Edina, MN|isbn=0-8087-9058-7|pages=48\u201350}}</ref> In 1966, however, the Village of Morningside once again became part of Edina.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hesterman|first1=Paul D.|title=The history of Edina, Minnesota : from settlement to suburb|date=1988|publisher=Burgess Pub.|location=Edina, MN|isbn=0-8087-9058-7|page=97}}</ref>\n\n===Early settlement===\nEdina was not the first settlement in its location.

Although in poor condition and rated for speeds less than 35&nbsp;mph the tracks are still used by freight trains. Under the [[Dan Patch Corridor]] proposal commuter trains would operate between Minneapolis and Northfield with a station in Edina, requiring hundreds of millions of dollars of upgrades to the rail corridor. A feasibility study was conducted in 2000 and found that while ridership would be high there would be a significant cost to upgrade the corridor for commuter trains. Due to this and strong opposition from residents living near the rail line, the proposal was put on hold until other commuter rail lines could be built. In 2002 a legislative gag order was placed on the project, which forbid the Metropolitan Council, MnDOT, and county rail authorities from discussing, studying, and building commuter rail on the Dan Patch Line. In 2017 the Edina City Council conducted a study on the pros and cons of passenger rail on the Dan Patch Line.

A major proponent of the [[serve-and-volley]] style of tennis, he won six [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles and three Grand Slam men's doubles titles between 1985 and 1996. He also won the [[ATP World Tour Finals|Masters Grand Prix]] and was a part of the Swedish Davis Cup-winning-team four times. In addition he won four [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|Masters Series]] titles, four [[Grand Prix Tennis Championship Series|Championship Series]] titles and the unofficial [[Tennis at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament 1984]], was ranked in the singles top 10 for ten successive years, and ranked 9 years in the top 5.

Edberg also reached the French Open doubles final with J\u00e4rryd in 1986 and consequently was world No. 1 in doubles in that year.\n\nU.S. fans first took notice of Edberg's professional career when he won the U.S. Indoor in Memphis in February 1985, defeating [[Yannick Noah]] in the final. Edberg's first two Grand Slam singles titles came at the [[Australian Open]]. In December 1985, he defeated [[Mats Wilander]] in straight sets to claim his first major title. In January 1987, he defended his title by defeating local favourite [[Pat Cash]] in five sets to win the last Australian Open held on grass courts. Edberg also won the Australian Open and US Open men's doubles titles in 1987 (partnering fellow Swede [[Anders J\u00e4rryd]]).\n\nIn 1988, Edberg reached the first of three consecutive finals at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], but lost his ranking as Sweden's number-one-player when Mats Wilander had his best year by winning the Australian, French and US Opens, becoming the world's number-one-ranked player. In all three of his consecutive Wimbledon finals, Edberg played German [[Boris Becker]] in what became one of Wimbledon's greatest rivalries. Edberg won their first encounter in a four-set match spread over two days because of rain delays. A year later, Becker won in straight sets. The closest of their matches came in the 1990 final, when Edberg won in five sets after being down a break in the fifth set.\n\nEdberg reached the French Open final in 1989 but lost in five sets to 17-year-old [[Michael Chang]], who became the youngest ever male winner of a Grand Slam singles title. This was the only Grand Slam singles title that Edberg never won, denying him the completion of a career Grand Slam at the senior level, to match his junior Grand Slam.\n\nIn 1990, an abdominal muscle injury forced Edberg to retire from the Australian Open final while trailing [[Ivan Lendl]] 5\u20132 (including two breaks of serve) in the third set. Edberg nevertheless took the world No. 1 ranking from Lendl on 13 August 1990 by winning the [[Cincinnati Masters|Super 9 tournament in Cincinnati]]. He held it for the rest of that year and for much of 1991 and 1992. Edberg spent a total of 72 weeks as World No. 1. In 1991, Edberg again reached the semifinals of Wimbledon but lost to Michael Stich in a close match: 6\u20134, 6\u20137, 6\u20137, 6\u20137.<ref>[[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles players|Weeks at Number One]]</ref>\n\nEdberg's final two Grand Slam singles triumphs came at the US Open, with wins over [[Jim Courier]] in the 1991 final and [[Pete Sampras]] (who was just months away from attaining the world No. 1 ranking) in the 1992 final.\n\nEdberg reached the finals of the Australian Open again in 1992 and 1993, losing both times to Jim Courier in four sets. He was one of the few players who reached the finals of the Australian Open five times. The 1993 Australian Open final was Edberg's last Grand Slam singles final appearance.\n\nIn 1996, Edberg reached the finals of Queens Club but lost the match to Boris Becker. He won his third and final Grand Slam doubles title at the Australian Open with [[Petr Korda]]. He reached the quarterfinals of his last US Open after defeating [[Richard Krajicek]] and Tim Henman, but lost in the quarterfinals to [[Goran Ivanisevic]].\n\nEdberg was most comfortable playing tennis on fast-playing surfaces. Of his six Grand Slam singles titles, four were won on grass courts at the Australian Open (1985 and 1987) and Wimbledon (1988 and 1990) and two were won on [[hardcourt]]s at the US Open (1991 and 1992).\n\nIn December 2013, Edberg began coaching [[Roger Federer]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Roger Federer hires Stefan Edberg to join coaching team |url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/12/roger-federer-hires-stefan-edberg-to-join-coaching-team/ |accessdate=27 December 2013 |date=27 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Style of play==\nEdberg is noted as the finest serve-and-volley player of his era and arguably the greatest of all-time.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/784127-stefan-edberg-and-the-15-best-serve-and-volleyers-of-the-open-era/page/16 Stefan Edberg and the 15 Best Serve-and-Volleyers of the Open Era], Bleacher report, 9 July 2010. Retrieved 28 July 2012.</ref> Edberg did not possess a powerful dominating serve like [[Pete Sampras]] or [[Boris Becker]], but his serve was still largely effective. Edberg often chose to use a less powerful serve, such as a kick or slice serve. The extra time from using a slower serve gave Edberg more time to get to the net, where he used his quick feet and athleticism to gain control of the point. Edberg's volleying skills were among the very best and he could easily redirect powerfully struck balls to the open court.

Edberg also reached the French Open doubles final with J\u00e4rryd in 1986 and consequently was world No. 1 in doubles in that year.\n\nU.S. fans first took notice of Edberg's professional career when he won the U.S. Indoor in Memphis in February 1985, defeating [[Yannick Noah]] in the final. Edberg's first two Grand Slam singles titles came at the [[Australian Open]]. In December 1985, he defeated [[Mats Wilander]] in straight sets to claim his first major title. In January 1987, he defended his title by defeating local favourite [[Pat Cash]] in five sets to win the last Australian Open held on grass courts. Edberg also won the Australian Open and US Open men's doubles titles in 1987 (partnering fellow Swede [[Anders J\u00e4rryd]]).\n\nIn 1988, Edberg reached the first of three consecutive finals at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], but lost his ranking as Sweden's number-one-player when Mats Wilander had his best year by winning the Australian, French and US Opens, becoming the world's number-one-ranked player. In all three of his consecutive Wimbledon finals, Edberg played German [[Boris Becker]] in what became one of Wimbledon's greatest rivalries. Edberg won their first encounter in a four-set match spread over two days because of rain delays. A year later, Becker won in straight sets. The closest of their matches came in the 1990 final, when Edberg won in five sets after being down a break in the fifth set.\n\nEdberg reached the French Open final in 1989 but lost in five sets to 17-year-old [[Michael Chang]], who became the youngest ever male winner of a Grand Slam singles title. This was the only Grand Slam singles title that Edberg never won, denying him the completion of a career Grand Slam at the senior level, to match his junior Grand Slam.\n\nIn 1990, an abdominal muscle injury forced Edberg to retire from the Australian Open final while trailing [[Ivan Lendl]] 5\u20132 (including two breaks of serve) in the third set. Edberg nevertheless took the world No. 1 ranking from Lendl on 13 August 1990 by winning the [[Cincinnati Masters|Super 9 tournament in Cincinnati]]. He held it for the rest of that year and for much of 1991 and 1992. Edberg spent a total of 72 weeks as World No. 1. In 1991, Edberg again reached the semifinals of Wimbledon but lost to Michael Stich in a close match: 6\u20134, 6\u20137, 6\u20137, 6\u20137.<ref>[[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles players|Weeks at Number One]]</ref>\n\nEdberg's final two Grand Slam singles triumphs came at the US Open, with wins over [[Jim Courier]] in the 1991 final and [[Pete Sampras]] (who was just months away from attaining the world No. 1 ranking) in the 1992 final.\n\nEdberg reached the finals of the Australian Open again in 1992 and 1993, losing both times to Jim Courier in four sets. He was one of the few players who reached the finals of the Australian Open five times. The 1993 Australian Open final was Edberg's last Grand Slam singles final appearance.\n\nIn 1996, Edberg reached the finals of Queens Club but lost the match to Boris Becker. He won his third and final Grand Slam doubles title at the Australian Open with [[Petr Korda]]. He reached the quarterfinals of his last US Open after defeating [[Richard Krajicek]] and Tim Henman, but lost in the quarterfinals to [[Goran Ivanisevic]].\n\nEdberg was most comfortable playing tennis on fast-playing surfaces. Of his six Grand Slam singles titles, four were won on grass courts at the Australian Open (1985 and 1987) and Wimbledon (1988 and 1990) and two were won on [[hardcourt]]s at the US Open (1991 and 1992).\n\nIn December 2013, Edberg began coaching [[Roger Federer]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Roger Federer hires Stefan Edberg to join coaching team |url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/12/roger-federer-hires-stefan-edberg-to-join-coaching-team/ |accessdate=27 December 2013 |date=27 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Style of play==\nEdberg is noted as the finest serve-and-volley player of his era and arguably the greatest of all-time.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/784127-stefan-edberg-and-the-15-best-serve-and-volleyers-of-the-open-era/page/16 Stefan Edberg and the 15 Best Serve-and-Volleyers of the Open Era], Bleacher report, 9 July 2010. Retrieved 28 July 2012.</ref> Edberg did not possess a powerful dominating serve like [[Pete Sampras]] or [[Boris Becker]], but his serve was still largely effective. Edberg often chose to use a less powerful serve, such as a kick or slice serve. The extra time from using a slower serve gave Edberg more time to get to the net, where he used his quick feet and athleticism to gain control of the point. Edberg's volleying skills were among the very best and he could easily redirect powerfully struck balls to the open court. He had sufficient groundstrokes, and his one-handed [[backhand]] was one of his marquee shots. Edberg's backhand was extremely effective and considered amongst the best of his era.\n\n==Equipment==\nThroughout his career, Edberg used [[Wilson Sporting Goods]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theworldlovesmelbourne.com/lifestyle/sport-in-melbourne/696-wilson-racquet-launch-with-stefan-edberg.html|title=Wilson Racquet Launch with Stefan Edberg {{!}} The World Loves Melbourne|website=theworldlovesmelbourne.com|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> racquets and [[Adidas]] clothing and shoes.\n\n==Post-career competitive racquet sports==\nEdberg began playing competitive [[squash (sport)|squash]] after his retirement from professional tennis and soon became an elite player in Sweden.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}  When [[racketlon]] emerged as a growing sport in [[Scandinavia]], Edberg's pro-level tennis ability and emerging squash prowess made him highly competitive, despite his relative inexperience in badminton and table tennis.\n\nIn September 2008, Stefan Edberg officially joined the \"Black Rock Tour of Champions\", a tour for professional tennis players who have retired from the [[ATP Tour]].

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he has stayed with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as a less-than-ordinary boy, who was quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it enough that he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by the lifestyle that Parker led, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. This improves nothing in their relationship, with Sarah Ruth judging Parker for having so many tattoos and Parker constantly deciding that he would not return home to her that day, yet he always finds himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back; even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, and in the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon, and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one, there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention, so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequented in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story closes with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt.

In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''. O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" is set in the early 1960\u2019s [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he has stayed with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as a less-than-ordinary boy, who was quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it enough that he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by the lifestyle that Parker led, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. This improves nothing in their relationship, with Sarah Ruth judging Parker for having so many tattoos and Parker constantly deciding that he would not return home to her that day, yet he always finds himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back; even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging.

If they fail to do so, they will faint from exhaustion.<ref>Greg Toppo, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/11/henry-david-thoreau-walden-pond-game-dives-into-deliberate-living/468756001/ \"Learn to \u2018live deliberately\u2019 with \u2018Walden\u2019 game on Thoreau\u2019s birthday\"], ''USA Today''</ref>\n\nThe inspiration aspects of the game focus on several of the themes discussed in the later chapters of the book ''Walden''\u2014visitors, sound, solitude and reading. Players can find inspiration by exploring the woods and interacting with animals (visitors), finding places of solitude, which are marked by cairns, listening to the sounds of civilization (wagons, a train whistle, church bells, etc.) that can be heard from the edges of the woods, and reading the books found throughout the woods. When the player is inspired, the colors and sounds of the game are richer, however if they let their inspiration fall, these colors and sounds will become dull.<ref>Alexander Stern, [https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2017/summer/feature/in-walden-the-video-game-you-the-player-are-henry-david-thoreau \"In Walden the Video Game, You the Player Are Henry David Thoreau\"], ''Humanities Magazine''</ref>\n\nIn addition to care-taking survival and inspiration, the player may also explore Thoreau's world to discover a series of intertwined stories about his life and the tensions in the world around him that sent him to the woods for his experiment in self-reliant living. Letters and visits from his mentor [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] explore his ambitions as a writer. A series of poetic clues from his sister Sophia lead the player to secret areas of the woods and to an understanding of a mutual tragedy.

Letters and visits from his mentor [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] explore his ambitions as a writer. A series of poetic clues from his sister Sophia lead the player to secret areas of the woods and to an understanding of a mutual tragedy.
