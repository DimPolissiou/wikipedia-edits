They were not the sons of Thomas Townsend of Lynn, MA and this is confirmed by male line YDNA testing which is incontrovertible. The Oyster Bay Townsends and the Townsends of Lynn do not share male line YDNA.  The testing was done at FTDNA under the auspices of the Townsend Society of America as the Townsend Project and is ongoing. https://gap.familytreedna.com/.  The Oyster Bay DNA group [haplogroup R-U152] has 73 men surnamed Townsend and another 10 with various surnames who match this large group of Oyster Bay descendants. The Lynn, MA YDNA group [haplogroup R-L21] has 10 men surnamed Townsend who match each other.  So far, fifteen completely unrelated Townsend families who have descendants living today in the United States have been identified by YDNA testing.  The majority are presumed to have originated in England and they arrived anywhere from about 1640 to the late 1700s.\n\n==Career==\nTownsend settled in Flushing, where his brother [[John Townsend (Norwich)|John Townsend]] was granted a patent by Gov. [[Willem Kieft]] in 1645.<ref>American Ancestry, by Thomas Patrick Hughes, Frank Munsell (1887)</ref>  Due to political difficulties with the Dutch governor, [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the Townsend brothers moved to [[Warwick, Rhode Island]]. Henry was listed as inhabitant #2 in Warwick in 1647/8.  He married his wife there, was a committeeman, a juror, and served as a commissioner representing the town in Providence.  On 19 April 1656 he sold his house, lot and meadow in Warwick.  Brother John returned to New York at the same time but Richard stayed in Warwick until 1666 when he sold his land there to his father-in-law.\n\nIn 1656, Townsend and his brother John again attempted to settle in Long Island, this time obtaining the patent of [[Rustdorp]] (now Jamaica). The following year in 1657, he was arrested, imprisoned and fined.

In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] and [[baroque]] buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|St Michael's Cathedral]] (Serbian: ''Saborna crkva)'', completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular [[Romanticism]], along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an [[Eclecticism|eclecticist]] style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Istorija Beograda.|last=Antoni\u0107|first=Zdravko (ed.)|year=1995|location=Belgrade|pages=263\u2013264}}</ref>\n[[File:Belgrade_University_Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|View of Belgrade between 1890 and 1900.]]\n\nIn 1841, Prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] moved the capital of the [[Principality of Serbia]] from [[Kragujevac]] to Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|title=History|publisher=City of Kragujevac official website|accessdate=15 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329035624/http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|archive-date=29 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201239 |title=History (Important Years Through City History)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (''mahalas''). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pa\u0161ina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pa\u0161ina, Bajram-begova and Laz Had\u017ei-Mahmudova.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beogradski odonimi.|last=Radovi\u0107|first=Sr\u0111an|year=2014|location=Belgrade|pages=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from [[Kalemegdan]].

Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks.

The historical core of Belgrade, [[Belgrade Fortress|Kalemegdan]], lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, [[New Belgrade]] was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with [[Zemun]]. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like [[Krnja\u010da]], [[Kote\u017e]] and [[Bor\u010da]], also merged with the city, while [[Pan\u010devo]], a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of {{convert|360|km2|sqmi}}, while together with its metropolitan area it covers {{convert|3223|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.\nOn the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is [[Torlak (Belgrade)|Torlak hill]] at {{convert|303|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{convert|511|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{convert|628|m|ft|abbr=on}}) lie south of the city.

On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. [[Downhill creep]]s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the [[clay]] or [[loam]] soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in [[Karaburma]], [[Zvezdara]], [[Vi\u0161njica, Serbia|Vi\u0161njica]], [[Vin\u010da]] and [[Ritopek]], in the Danube valley, and [[Umka]], and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire [[Terazijska Terasa|Terazije slope]] above the Sava (Kalemegdan, [[Savamala]]), which can be seen by the inclination of the [[Pobednik]] monument and the tower of the [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|Cathedral Church]], and the Vo\u017edovac section, between [[Banjica]] and [[Autokomanda]].\n{{wide image|The confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade.jpg|950px|The confluence of the [[Sava]] into the [[Danube]] at Belgrade.

The neighbourhood of [[Mirijevo]] is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem.

In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] and [[baroque]] buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|St Michael's Cathedral]] (Serbian: ''Saborna crkva)'', completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular [[Romanticism]], along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an [[Eclecticism|eclecticist]] style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Istorija Beograda.|last=Antoni\u0107|first=Zdravko (ed.)|year=1995|location=Belgrade|pages=263\u2013264}}</ref>\n[[File:Belgrade_University_Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|View of Belgrade between 1890 and 1900.]]\n\nIn 1841, Prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] moved the capital of the [[Principality of Serbia]] from [[Kragujevac]] to Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|title=History|publisher=City of Kragujevac official website|accessdate=15 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329035624/http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|archive-date=29 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201239 |title=History (Important Years Through City History)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (''mahalas'').

The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{convert|511|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{convert|628|m|ft|abbr=on}}) lie south of the city.

On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. [[Downhill creep]]s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the [[clay]] or [[loam]] soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in [[Karaburma]], [[Zvezdara]], [[Vi\u0161njica, Serbia|Vi\u0161njica]], [[Vin\u010da]] and [[Ritopek]], in the Danube valley, and [[Umka]], and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire [[Terazijska Terasa|Terazije slope]] above the Sava (Kalemegdan, [[Savamala]]), which can be seen by the inclination of the [[Pobednik]] monument and the tower of the [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|Cathedral Church]], and the Vo\u017edovac section, between [[Banjica]] and [[Autokomanda]].\n{{wide image|The confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade.jpg|950px|The confluence of the [[Sava]] into the [[Danube]] at Belgrade. Pictured from [[Kalemegdan Fortress]].}}\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial [[loess]] hills of Zemun: [[Gardo\u0161]], [[\u0106ukovac]] and [[Kalvarija (Zemun)|Kalvarija]]. \n[[File:Novo Beograd - ada ciganlija and Cukarica - Banovo Brdo IMG 1756 tempo supermarket E763.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Belgrade]], [[Ada Ciganlija]], [[\u010cukarica]] and [[Banovo Brdo]] with the old town in the background.]]\n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of [[Mirijevo]] is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.<ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Klizi\u0161ta nisu samo hir prirode| newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = Serbian | date = 8 November 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193711/Klizista-nisu-samo-hir-prirode}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Otapanje pokre\u0107e i klizi\u0161ta | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 22 February 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/209361/Otapanje-pokrece-i-klizista}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nBelgrade has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation.

Post occupancy evaluations may also include surveys [https://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/survey.htm] of building occupants to gather data on occupant satisfaction and well-being and to gather qualitative data on building performance that may not have been captured by measurement devices.\n\nMany aspects of building science are the responsibility of the [[architect]] (in Canada, many architectural firms employ an [[architectural technologist]] for this purpose), often in collaboration with the engineering disciplines that have evolved to handle 'non-building envelope' building science concerns: \n[[Civil engineering]], [[Structural engineering]], [[Earthquake engineering]], [[Geotechnical engineering]], Mechanical engineering, Electrical engineering, [[Acoustic engineering]], & fire code engineering. Even the interior designer will inevitably generate a few building science issues.\n\n==Topics==\n\n===Indoor environmental quality (IEQ)===\nIndoor environmental quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of a building's environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it. IEQ is determined by many factors, including lighting, air quality, and damp conditions. Workers are often concerned that they have symptoms or health conditions from exposures to contaminants in the buildings where they work. One reason for this concern is that their symptoms often get better when they are not in the building. While research has shown that some respiratory symptoms and illnesses can be associated with damp buildings,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fisk|first=W. J.|last2=Lei-Gomez|first2=Q.|last3=Mendell|first3=M. J.|date=2007-07-25|title=Meta-analyses of the associations of respiratory health effects with dampness and mold in homes|journal=Indoor Air|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=284\u2013296|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2007.00475.x|pmid=17661925|issn=0905-6947|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/471275c8f80d9007296c8e196597f80db7cfd525}}</ref> it is still unclear what measurements of indoor contaminants show that workers are at risk for disease. In most instances where a worker and his or her physician suspect that the building environment is causing a specific health condition, the information available from medical tests and tests of the environment is not sufficient to establish which contaminants are responsible. Despite uncertainty about what to measure and how to interpret what is measured, research shows that building-related symptoms are associated with building characteristics, including dampness, cleanliness, and ventilation characteristics.\nIndoor environments are highly complex and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the form of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning products, construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.\nUnderstanding the sources of indoor environmental contaminants and controlling them can often help prevent or resolve building-related worker symptoms. Practical guidance for improving and maintaining the indoor environment is available.[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/]\n\nBuilding indoor environment covers the environmental aspects in the design, analysis, and operation of energy-efficient, healthy, and comfortable buildings.  Fields of specialization include architecture, [[HVAC]] design, [[Thermal Comfort|thermal comfort]], [[Indoor Air Quality|indoor air quality]] (IAQ), [[lighting]], [[Architectural acoustics|acoustics]], and [[control systems]].\n\n===HVAC systems===\nThe mechanical systems, usually a sub-set of the broader Building Services, used to control the temperature, humidity, pressure and other select aspects of the indoor environment are often described as the Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning ([[HVAC]]) systems.\nThese systems have grown in complexity and importance (often consuming around 20% of the total budget in commercial buildings) as occupants demand tighter control of conditions, buildings become larger, and enclosures and passive measures became less important as a means of providing comfort.\n\nBuilding science includes the analysis of HVAC systems for both physical impacts (heat distribution, air velocities, relative humidities, etc.) and for effect on the comfort of the building's occupants. Because occupants' perceived comfort is dependent on factors such as current weather and the type of climate the building is located in, the needs for HVAC systems to provide comfortable conditions will vary across projects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brager|first=Gail S.|last2=de Dear|first2=Richard J.|date=1998-02-01|title=Thermal adaptation in the built environment: a literature review|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=27|issue=1|pages=83\u201396|doi=10.1016/s0378-7788(97)00053-4|issn=0378-7788|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5ts1r442}}</ref>\n\n===Enclosure (envelope) systems===\nThe building enclosure is the part of the building that separates the indoors from the outdoors. This includes the wall, roof, windows, slabs on grade, and joints between all of these. The comfort, productivity, and even health of building occupants in areas near the building enclosure (i.e., perimeter zones) are affected by outdoor influences such as noise, temperature, and solar radiation, and by their ability to control these influences. As part of its function, the enclosure must control (not necessarily block or stop) the flow of heat, air, vapor, solar radiation, insects, noise, etc.\nDaylight transmittance through glazed components of the facade can be analyzed to evaluate the reduced need for electric lighting.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leslie|first=R.P.|date=2003-02-01|title=Capturing the daylight dividend in buildings: why and how?|journal=Building and Environment|volume=38|issue=2|pages=381\u2013385|doi=10.1016/s0360-1323(02)00118-x|issn=0360-1323}}</ref>\n\nHigh Performance Facades Case Studies: [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4vq936rc]\n\n===Building sustainability===\nPart of building science is the attempt to design buildings with consideration for the future and the resources and realities of tomorrow. This field may also be referred to as [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]].\n\nA push towards [[zero-energy building]] also known as Net-Zero Energy Building has been present in the Building Science field. The qualifications for Net Zero Energy Building Certification can be found on the [[Living Building Challenge]] website.\n\n==Certification==\nAlthough there are no direct or integrated professional architecture or engineering certifications for building science, there are independent professional credentials associated with the disciplines. Building science is typically a specialization within the broad areas of architecture or engineering practice. However, there are professional organizations offering individual professional credentials in specialized areas such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]], which is called LEED;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://new.usgbc.org/credentials#ap|title=LEED professional credentials {{!}} USGBC|website=new.usgbc.org|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> or WELL,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellcertified.com/en/become-a-well-ap|title=Become a WELL AP|date=2017-02-11|website=International WELL Building Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> another credential maintained by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and the [[Green Business Certification Inc.]] respectively. There are other building sustainability accreditation and certification institutions as well. Also in the US, contractors certified by the Building Performance Institute, an independent organization, advertise that they operate businesses as Building Scientists.  This is questionable due to their lack of scientific background and credentials. On the other hand, more formal building science experience is true in Canada for most of the Certified Energy Advisors.

Design decisions can be made based on knowledge of building science principles and established guidelines, such as the NIBS [[Whole Building Design Guide|Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG)]] and the collection of [[ASHRAE#Publications|ASHRAE Standards]] related to building science.\n\nComputational tools can be used during design to [[Building performance simulation|simulate building performance]] based on input information about the designed [[building envelope]], [[Architectural lighting design|lighting system]], and [[HVAC|mechanical system]]. Models can be used to predict [[Energy modeling|energy]] use over the building life, solar heat and radiation distribution, [[Computational fluid dynamics|air flow]], and other physical phenomena within the building.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Building performance simulation for design and operation|date=2011|publisher=Spon Press|others=Hensen, Jan., Lamberts, Roberto.|isbn=9780415474146|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=244063540}}</ref> These tools are valuable for evaluating a design and ensuring it will perform within an acceptable range before construction begins.

An array of in-field testing equipment can be used to measure temperature, moisture, sound levels, air pollutants, or other criteria.

Post occupancy evaluations may also include surveys [https://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/survey.htm] of building occupants to gather data on occupant satisfaction and well-being and to gather qualitative data on building performance that may not have been captured by measurement devices.\n\nMany aspects of building science are the responsibility of the [[architect]] (in Canada, many architectural firms employ an [[architectural technologist]] for this purpose), often in collaboration with the engineering disciplines that have evolved to handle 'non-building envelope' building science concerns: \n[[Civil engineering]], [[Structural engineering]], [[Earthquake engineering]], [[Geotechnical engineering]], Mechanical engineering, Electrical engineering, [[Acoustic engineering]], & fire code engineering. Even the interior designer will inevitably generate a few building science issues.\n\n==Topics==\n\n===Indoor environmental quality (IEQ)===\nIndoor environmental quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of a building's environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it. IEQ is determined by many factors, including lighting, air quality, and damp conditions. Workers are often concerned that they have symptoms or health conditions from exposures to contaminants in the buildings where they work. One reason for this concern is that their symptoms often get better when they are not in the building. While research has shown that some respiratory symptoms and illnesses can be associated with damp buildings,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fisk|first=W. J.|last2=Lei-Gomez|first2=Q.|last3=Mendell|first3=M. J.|date=2007-07-25|title=Meta-analyses of the associations of respiratory health effects with dampness and mold in homes|journal=Indoor Air|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=284\u2013296|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2007.00475.x|pmid=17661925|issn=0905-6947|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/471275c8f80d9007296c8e196597f80db7cfd525}}</ref> it is still unclear what measurements of indoor contaminants show that workers are at risk for disease. In most instances where a worker and his or her physician suspect that the building environment is causing a specific health condition, the information available from medical tests and tests of the environment is not sufficient to establish which contaminants are responsible. Despite uncertainty about what to measure and how to interpret what is measured, research shows that building-related symptoms are associated with building characteristics, including dampness, cleanliness, and ventilation characteristics.\nIndoor environments are highly complex and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the form of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning products, construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.\nUnderstanding the sources of indoor environmental contaminants and controlling them can often help prevent or resolve building-related worker symptoms. Practical guidance for improving and maintaining the indoor environment is available.[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/]\n\nBuilding indoor environment covers the environmental aspects in the design, analysis, and operation of energy-efficient, healthy, and comfortable buildings.  Fields of specialization include architecture, [[HVAC]] design, [[Thermal Comfort|thermal comfort]], [[Indoor Air Quality|indoor air quality]] (IAQ), [[lighting]], [[Architectural acoustics|acoustics]], and [[control systems]].\n\n===HVAC systems===\nThe mechanical systems, usually a sub-set of the broader Building Services, used to control the temperature, humidity, pressure and other select aspects of the indoor environment are often described as the Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning ([[HVAC]]) systems.\nThese systems have grown in complexity and importance (often consuming around 20% of the total budget in commercial buildings) as occupants demand tighter control of conditions, buildings become larger, and enclosures and passive measures became less important as a means of providing comfort.\n\nBuilding science includes the analysis of HVAC systems for both physical impacts (heat distribution, air velocities, relative humidities, etc.) and for effect on the comfort of the building's occupants. Because occupants' perceived comfort is dependent on factors such as current weather and the type of climate the building is located in, the needs for HVAC systems to provide comfortable conditions will vary across projects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brager|first=Gail S.|last2=de Dear|first2=Richard J.|date=1998-02-01|title=Thermal adaptation in the built environment: a literature review|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=27|issue=1|pages=83\u201396|doi=10.1016/s0378-7788(97)00053-4|issn=0378-7788|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5ts1r442}}</ref>\n\n===Enclosure (envelope) systems===\nThe building enclosure is the part of the building that separates the indoors from the outdoors. This includes the wall, roof, windows, slabs on grade, and joints between all of these. The comfort, productivity, and even health of building occupants in areas near the building enclosure (i.e., perimeter zones) are affected by outdoor influences such as noise, temperature, and solar radiation, and by their ability to control these influences. As part of its function, the enclosure must control (not necessarily block or stop) the flow of heat, air, vapor, solar radiation, insects, noise, etc.\nDaylight transmittance through glazed components of the facade can be analyzed to evaluate the reduced need for electric lighting.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leslie|first=R.P.|date=2003-02-01|title=Capturing the daylight dividend in buildings: why and how?|journal=Building and Environment|volume=38|issue=2|pages=381\u2013385|doi=10.1016/s0360-1323(02)00118-x|issn=0360-1323}}</ref>\n\nHigh Performance Facades Case Studies: [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4vq936rc]\n\n===Building sustainability===\nPart of building science is the attempt to design buildings with consideration for the future and the resources and realities of tomorrow. This field may also be referred to as [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]].\n\nA push towards [[zero-energy building]] also known as Net-Zero Energy Building has been present in the Building Science field. The qualifications for Net Zero Energy Building Certification can be found on the [[Living Building Challenge]] website.\n\n==Certification==\nAlthough there are no direct or integrated professional architecture or engineering certifications for building science, there are independent professional credentials associated with the disciplines. Building science is typically a specialization within the broad areas of architecture or engineering practice. However, there are professional organizations offering individual professional credentials in specialized areas such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]], which is called LEED;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://new.usgbc.org/credentials#ap|title=LEED professional credentials {{!}} USGBC|website=new.usgbc.org|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> or WELL,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellcertified.com/en/become-a-well-ap|title=Become a WELL AP|date=2017-02-11|website=International WELL Building Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> another credential maintained by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and the [[Green Business Certification Inc.]] respectively. There are other building sustainability accreditation and certification institutions as well. Also in the US, contractors certified by the Building Performance Institute, an independent organization, advertise that they operate businesses as Building Scientists.  This is questionable due to their lack of scientific background and credentials. On the other hand, more formal building science experience is true in Canada for most of the Certified Energy Advisors. Many of these trades and technologists require and receive some training in very specific areas of building science (e.g., air tightness, or thermal insulation).\n\n==List of principal building science journals==\n''Building and Environment'': This international journal publishes original research papers and review articles related to building science, urban physics, and human interaction with the indoor and outdoor built environment.

There have been numerous theories of gravitation since ancient times.\n[[Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] (f.&nbsp;4th century&nbsp;BC) believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner ''gravitas'' (heaviness). [[Vitruvius]] (f.&nbsp;1st century&nbsp;BC) understood that objects fall based on their [[specific gravity]]. In the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] spoke of gravity as an attractive force.\n\nThe [[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotelian concept of gravity]] began to be rejected, initially by [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic physicists]], starting in the 11th century with [[Ibn Sina]]'s [[theory of impetus]]. The following century, [[Abu'l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b]] described [[gravitational acceleration]]. The works of Ibn Sina and al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b were [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by the 14th century, influencing [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]]. The same century, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s [[Merton College]] developed the [[mean speed theorem]].\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]] found that all objects tend to accelerate equally in [[free fall]]. In 1632, he put forth [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]]. The existence of the [[gravitational constant]] was explored by various researchers from the mid-17th century, helping [[Angry Prash]] formulate his [[law of universal gravitation]].\nPrash's [[classical mechanics]] were superseded in the early 20th century, when [[Albert Einstein]] developed the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]]. The [[Graviton|force carrier of gravity]] remains an outlier in the search for a [[theory of everything]], which various models of [[quantum gravity]] are candidates for.\n\n==Antiquity==\nVarious ancient texts such as the [[Bible]] describe some of the everyday effects of gravity;<ref>{{cite web |last=Deem |first=Rich |title=The Word 'Gravity' Never Appears in the Bible |url=https://www.godandscience.org/doctrine/gravity.html |website=God and Science |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=25 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Scriptures Mention Gravity 1500 Years Before Isaac Newton: Former ISRO Chief G Madhavan Nair |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-scriptures-mention-gravity-1500-years-before-isaac-newton-former-isro-chief-g-madhavan-nair-741360 |website=NDTV |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=21 February 2015}}</ref> some religious scholars interpret particular scriptures as describing the cosmic force of gravity while not explicitly naming it as such.<ref>{{cite web |last=DeYoung |first=Don |title=Gravity |url=https://answersingenesis.org/physics/gravity/ |website=Answers in Genesis |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=1 June 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Greco-Roman world===\n{{See also|Aristotelian physics}}\nIn the 4th century BC, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] taught that there is no [[Causality|effect]] or [[Motion (physics)|motion]] without a [[causality|cause]]. The cause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element [[earth (classical element)|earth]], was related to their [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], which caused them to move downward toward the centre of the universe, which was their natural place. Conversely, light bodies such as the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the [[Celestial spheres|sphere]] of the Moon.  Thus in Aristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the [[Earth]] by an external force, but tend toward the centre of the universe because of an inner ''gravitas'' or heaviness.<ref>Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

[[specific gravity]]):\n\n<blockquote>If the [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] is poured into a vessel, and a stone weighing one hundred pounds is laid upon it, the stone swims on the surface, and cannot depress the liquid, nor break through, nor separate it. If we remove the hundred pound weight, and put on a scruple of gold, it will not swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own accord. Hence, it is undeniable that the gravity of a substance depends not on the amount of its weight, but on its nature.<ref>\n{{Cite book | last = Vitruvius| first = Marcus Pollio  | author-link = Marcus Vitruvius Pollio | editor = Alfred A.

In his own words:<blockquote>I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and found them to answer pretty nearly.</blockquote>\n\nNewton's original formula was:\n:<math>{\\rm Force\\,of\\,gravity} \\propto \\frac{\\rm mass\\,of\\,object\\,1\\,\\times\\,mass\\,of\\,object\\,2}{\\rm distance\\,from\\,centers^2}</math>\n\nwhere the symbol <math>\\propto</math> means \"is proportional to\".\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them.  This gravitational constant was first accurately measured in 1797 by Henry Cavendish.{{efn|name=constant}}\n\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets.  Calculations by [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] both predicted the general position of the planet. Le Verrier's sent his position to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]], asking him to verify; in the same night, Galle spotted Neptune near the position Le Verrier had predicted.\n\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) were fruitless. This issue was resolved in 1915 by Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit, thereby superseding Newton's theory. However, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations still use Newton's equations because they are easier to work with and sufficiently accurate for many everyday applications.\n\n==Modern era==\nIn the late 19th century, [[Lord Kelvin]] pondered the possibility of a [[theory of everything]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Silvanus P. |title=Lord Kelvin |url=https://www.iec.ch/about/history/figures/lord_kelvin.htm |website=International Electrotechnical Commission |accessdate=October 16, 2019 |date=2019}}</ref> He proposed that every body pulsates, which might be an explanation of gravitation and [[electric charge]]s. However, his ideas were largely mechanistic and required the existence of the aether, which the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]] failed to detect in 1887. This, combined with [[Mach's principle]], led to gravitational models which feature [[action at a distance]].\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|thumb|upright|One of [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, which confirmed [[Einstein]]'s theory that light 'bends']]\n\nIn 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published a series of papers in which he established the [[special theory of relativity]] and the fact that [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass and energy are equivalent]]. In 1907, in what he described as \"the happiest thought of my life\", Einstein realized that someone who is in free fall experiences no [[gravitational field]]. In other words, gravitation is exactly equivalent to acceleration. Between 1911 and 1915, Einstein developed this idea, initially stated as the [[equivalence principle]], into his [[general theory of relativity]], which fuses the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions of space]] and the one dimension of [[time]] into the [[four-dimensional]] fabric of [[spacetime]]. However, it does not unify gravity with [[quantum|quanta]]\u2014individual particles of energy, which Einstein himself had postulated the existence of in 1905.\n\nIn 1914, [[Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m]] attempted to unify gravity and [[electromagnetism]] in [[Nordstr\u00f6m's theory of gravitation|his theory]] of [[Five-dimensional space|five-dimensional]] gravitation.{{efn|In [[string theory]], dimensions exceeding four allow for the existence of [[Multiverse|parallel realities]]\u2014which along with the [[anthropic principle]], help to explain the statistical near-impossibility of our [[fine-tuned universe]].}} This was superseded by general relativity in 1919, when [[gravitational lens]]ing around a solar eclipse was observed by [[Arthur Eddington]]. Thereafter, German mathematician [[Theodor Kaluza]] promoted the idea of general relativity with a fifth dimension, which in 1921 Swedish physicist [[Oskar Klein]] gave [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory|a physical interpretation]] of in a prototypical [[string theory]], a possible model of [[quantum gravity]] and potential theory of everything.\n\n[[Einstein's field equations]] include a [[cosmological constant]] to account for the alleged [[static universe|staticity of the universe]]. However, [[Edwin Hubble]] observed in 1929 that the universe appears to be expanding.

The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion.  The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other.\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along [[Geodesics in general relativity|locally straight paths in curved spacetime]]. More specifically, Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime. [[Einstein field equations|These field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equation|simultaneous]], [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s.  The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime, which describes its geometry. The geodesic paths of spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] non-rotating uncharged massive object. For objects with radii smaller than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], this solution generates a [[black hole]] with a central singularity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with an [[event horizon]] surrounding a [[Cauchy horizon]].\n* The [[Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple horizons.\n* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Robertson\u2013Walker coordinates|Robertson\u2013Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the universe.\n\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because its predictions (not called for by older theories of gravity) have been regularly confirmed.  For example:\n* General relativity accounts for the anomalous [[perihelion precession of Mercury]].\n* Gravitational lensing was first confirmed in 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a [[quasar]] which passes behind the Sun as seen from the Earth.\n* The expansion of the universe (predicted by the [[Robertson\u2013Walker metric]]) was confirmed by Edwin Hubble in 1929.\n* The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been confirmed by the [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]], the [[Hafele\u2013Keating experiment]], and the [[GPS]].\n* The [[time delay of light]] passing close to a massive object was first identified by [[Irwin Shapiro]] in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.\n* [[Gravitational radiation]] has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [[pulsar]]s such as [[PSR 1913+16]].\n** In 2015, the [[LIGO]] experiments directly [[First observation of gravitational waves|detected gravitational radiation]] from [[Binary black hole|two colliding black holes]], making this the first direct observation of both gravitational waves and black holes.<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\">{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

There have been numerous theories of gravitation since ancient times.\n[[Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] (f.&nbsp;4th century&nbsp;BC) believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner ''gravitas'' (heaviness). [[Vitruvius]] (f.&nbsp;1st century&nbsp;BC) understood that objects fall based on their [[specific gravity]]. In the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] spoke of gravity as an attractive force.\n\nThe [[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotelian concept of gravity]] began to be rejected, initially by [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic physicists]], starting in the 11th century with [[Ibn Sina]]'s [[theory of impetus]]. The following century, [[Abu'l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b]] described [[gravitational acceleration]]. The works of Ibn Sina and al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b were [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by the 14th century, influencing [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]]. The same century, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s [[Merton College]] developed the [[mean speed theorem]].\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]] found that all objects tend to accelerate equally in [[free fall]]. In 1632, he put forth [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]]. The existence of the [[gravitational constant]] was explored by various researchers from the mid-17th century, helping [[Isaac Newton]] formulate his [[law of universal gravitation]].\nNewton's [[classical mechanics]] were superseded in the early 20th century, when [[Albert Einstein]] developed the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]]. The [[Graviton|force carrier of gravity]] remains an outlier in the search for a [[theory of everything]], which various models of [[quantum gravity]] are candidates for.\n\n==Antiquity==\nVarious ancient texts such as the [[Bible]] describe some of the everyday effects of gravity;<ref>{{cite web |last=Deem |first=Rich |title=The Word 'Gravity' Never Appears in the Bible |url=https://www.godandscience.org/doctrine/gravity.html |website=God and Science |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=25 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Scriptures Mention Gravity 1500 Years Before Isaac Newton: Former ISRO Chief G Madhavan Nair |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-scriptures-mention-gravity-1500-years-before-isaac-newton-former-isro-chief-g-madhavan-nair-741360 |website=NDTV |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=21 February 2015}}</ref> some religious scholars interpret particular scriptures as describing the cosmic force of gravity while not explicitly naming it as such.<ref>{{cite web |last=DeYoung |first=Don |title=Gravity |url=https://answersingenesis.org/physics/gravity/ |website=Answers in Genesis |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=1 June 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Greco-Roman world===\n{{See also|Aristotelian physics}}\nIn the 4th century BC, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] taught that there is no [[Causality|effect]] or [[Motion (physics)|motion]] without a [[causality|cause]]. The cause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element [[earth (classical element)|earth]], was related to their [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], which caused them to move downward toward the centre of the universe, which was their natural place. Conversely, light bodies such as the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the [[Celestial spheres|sphere]] of the Moon.  Thus in Aristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the [[Earth]] by an external force, but tend toward the centre of the universe because of an inner ''gravitas'' or heaviness.<ref>Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

In his own words:<blockquote>I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and found them to answer pretty nearly.</blockquote>\n\nNewton's original formula was:\n:<math>{\\rm Force\\,of\\,gravity} \\propto \\frac{\\rm mass\\,of\\,object\\,1\\,\\times\\,mass\\,of\\,object\\,2}{\\rm distance\\,from\\,centers^2}</math>\n\nwhere the symbol <math>\\propto</math> means \"is proportional to\".\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them.

Calculations by [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] both predicted the general position of the planet. Le Verrier's sent his position to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]], asking him to verify; in the same night, Galle spotted Neptune near the position Le Verrier had predicted.\n\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) were fruitless. This issue was resolved in 1915 by Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit, thereby superseding Newton's theory. However, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations still use Newton's equations because they are easier to work with and sufficiently accurate for many everyday applications.\n\n==Modern era==\nIn the late 19th century, [[Lord Kelvin]] pondered the possibility of a [[theory of everything]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Silvanus P. |title=Lord Kelvin |url=https://www.iec.ch/about/history/figures/lord_kelvin.htm |website=International Electrotechnical Commission |accessdate=October 16, 2019 |date=2019}}</ref> He proposed that every body pulsates, which might be an explanation of gravitation and [[electric charge]]s.

In other words, gravitation is exactly equivalent to acceleration. Between 1911 and 1915, Einstein developed this idea, initially stated as the [[equivalence principle]], into his [[general theory of relativity]], which fuses the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions of space]] and the one dimension of [[time]] into the [[four-dimensional]] fabric of [[spacetime]].

The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion.  The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other.\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along [[Geodesics in general relativity|locally straight paths in curved spacetime]]. More specifically, Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime. [[Einstein field equations|These field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equation|simultaneous]], [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s.  The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime, which describes its geometry. The geodesic paths of spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] non-rotating uncharged massive object. For objects with radii smaller than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], this solution generates a [[black hole]] with a central singularity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with an [[event horizon]] surrounding a [[Cauchy horizon]].\n* The [[Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple horizons.\n* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Robertson\u2013Walker coordinates|Robertson\u2013Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the universe.\n\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because its predictions (not called for by older theories of gravity) have been regularly confirmed.  For example:\n* General relativity accounts for the anomalous [[perihelion precession of Mercury]].\n* Gravitational lensing was first confirmed in 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a [[quasar]] which passes behind the Sun as seen from the Earth.\n* The expansion of the universe (predicted by the [[Robertson\u2013Walker metric]]) was confirmed by Edwin Hubble in 1929.\n* The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been confirmed by the [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]], the [[Hafele\u2013Keating experiment]], and the [[GPS]].\n* The [[time delay of light]] passing close to a massive object was first identified by [[Irwin Shapiro]] in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.\n* [[Gravitational radiation]] has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [[pulsar]]s such as [[PSR 1913+16]].\n** In 2015, the [[LIGO]] experiments directly [[First observation of gravitational waves|detected gravitational radiation]] from [[Binary black hole|two colliding black holes]], making this the first direct observation of both gravitational waves and black holes.<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\">{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.
