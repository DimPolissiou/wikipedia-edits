He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{harvnb|Black|2007|p=735}}.</ref> His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius.

Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five [[novellas]], hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed [[Penny reading|readings]] extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.\n\nDickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the [[serial (literature)|serial]] publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.<ref name=\"Grossman 2012 54\">{{harvnb|Grossman|2012|p=54}}</ref><ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\">{{harvnb|Lodge|2002|p=118}}.</ref> [[Cliffhanger]] endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.<ref name=\"NewYorker\">{{cite magazine|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|magazine=The New Yorker|date=2 December 2017}}</ref> The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.<ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\"/> For example, when his wife's [[chiropodist]] expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in ''[[David Copperfield]]'' seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|2007|pp=46\u201347}}.</ref> His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|1987|pp=267\u2013268}}.</ref> Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|ha'pennies]] to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hauser|1999|p=116}}.</ref>\n\nHis 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' and ''[[Great Expectations]]'' are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.<ref name=\"Garratt\"/> Dickens has been praised by many of his fellow writers\u2014from [[Leo Tolstoy]] to [[George Orwell]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], and [[Tom Wolfe]]\u2014for his [[Realism (arts)|realism]], comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and [[Child labour#Historical|social criticism]]. However, [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henry James]], and [[Virginia Woolf]] complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of sentimentalism.\n\nThe term ''Dickensian'' is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Dickensian \"Oxford Dictionaries&nbsp;\u2013 Dickensian\"].

His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,<ref name=West1999>{{cite journal |last=West |first=Gilian |title=Huffam and Son |journal=The Dickensian |volume=95 |number=447 |date=Spring 1999 |pages=5\u201318 |publisher=Dickens Fellowship}}</ref> rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1848).<ref name=West1999 />\n\nIn January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, [[Fitzrovia]].<ref name=Callow2012p5>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=5}}</ref> When Charles was four, they relocated to [[Sheerness]], and thence to [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]], Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a \"very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy\".<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nCharles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the [[picaresque novel]]s of [[Tobias Smollett]] and [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[Gil Blas]]''. He read and reread ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' and the Collected Farces of [[Elizabeth Inchbald]].<ref name=Callow2012p7>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=7}}</ref> He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=22\u201324:29\u201330}}.</ref> His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a [[dame school]], and then at a school run by William Giles, a [[English Dissenters|dissenter]], in Chatham.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=41}}.</ref>\n[[File:Dickens-at-the-Blacking-Warehouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=drawing|Illustration by Fred Bernard of Dickens at work in a shoe-blacking factory after his father had been sent to the [[Marshalsea]], published in the 1892 edition of Forster's ''Life of Dickens''<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=158}}.</ref>]]\n\nThis period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at [[Somerset House]], and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term of work) moved to [[Camden Town]] in London.<ref name=Callow2009p13>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=13}}</ref> The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts, and, living beyond his means,<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}:'recklessly improvident'.</ref> John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the [[Marshalsea]] [[debtors' prison]] in [[Southwark]], London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.<ref>{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=11}}.</ref> Roylance was \"a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family\", whom Dickens later immortalised, \"with a few alterations and embellishments\", as \"Mrs Pipchin\" in ''Dombey and Son''. Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the [[Insolvency|Insolvent Court]], Archibald Russell, \"a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman... with a quiet old wife\" and lame son, in [[Lant Street]] in Southwark.<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=27}}.</ref> They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}.</ref>\n\nOn Sundays&mdash;with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]&mdash;he spent the day at the Marshalsea.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=53}}.</ref> Dickens later used the prison as a setting in ''[[Little Dorrit]]''. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's [[shoe polish|Blacking]] Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present [[Charing Cross railway station]], where he earned six [[shilling]]s a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered \"how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age\".<ref name=Foster23/> As he recalled to [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]] (from ''The Life of Charles Dickens''):\n\n<blockquote>The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.<ref name=Foster23>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of [[Covent Garden]] the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street and little audiences gathered and watched them at work\u2014in Dickens biographer [[Simon Callow]]'s estimation, the public display was \"a new refinement added to his misery\".<ref name=Callow2009p25>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Courtyard of the former Marshalsea prison, 1897 (2).png|upright|thumb|The [[Marshalsea]] around 1897, after it had closed.

Of these, ''A Christmas Carol'' was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America.<ref>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|pp=146\u2013148}}</ref> The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane [[Ragged School]], caused Dickens to resolve to \"strike a sledge hammer blow\" for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book.

This and ''[[David Copperfield]]'' (1849\u201350) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.\n\nAt about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, [[Augustus Dickens|Augustus]], worked (John Chapman & Co.). It had been carried out by [[Thomas Powell (1809-1887)|Thomas Powell]], a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called ''The Living Authors of England'' with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (''[[Dombey and Son]]'') on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], editor of the New York literary magazine ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications, and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co. to seek written confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moss|first1=Sidney P.|last2=Moss|first2=Carolyn J.|title=The Charles Dickens-Thomas Powell Vendetta|date=1996|publisher=The Whitston Publishing Company|location=Troy New York|pages=42\u2013125}}</ref>\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett Coutts]], heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of [[Fallen woman|fallen women]] of the working class.

''David Copperfield'' is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in ''Bleak House'' reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright.<ref>{{harvnb|Polloczek|1999|p=133}}.</ref> Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in ''Little Dorrit'' resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=}}.</ref> Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in ''David Copperfield'' and Lucie Manette in ''A Tale of Two Cities.''<ref>{{harvnb|Slater|1983|pp=43, 47}}</ref>{{refn|Slater detects also Ellen Ternan in the portrayal of Lucie Manette.|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nDickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=653}}.</ref>\n\n===Episodic writing===\n[[File:Publicit\u00e9 pour Great Expectations dans All the Year Round.jpeg|thumb|right|225px|Advertisement for ''Great Expectations'', serialised in the weekly literary magazine ''[[All the Year Round]]'' from December 1860 to August 1861]]\nA pioneer of [[Serial (literature)|serialised]] fiction, most of Dickens's major novels were first written in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as ''Master Humphrey's Clock'' and ''Household Words'', later reprinted in book form.<ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\"/><ref name=\"Grossman 2012 54\"/> These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, and the series of regular [[cliffhanger]]s made each new episode widely anticipated.<ref name=\"NewYorker\"/> When ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in [[New York harbor]], shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Glancy|1999|p=34}}.</ref> Dickens's talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.\n\n[[File:Charles Dickens, public reading, 1867.jpg|left|thumb|\"Charles Dickens as he appears when reading.\" Wood engraving from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 7 December 1867]]\n\nAnother important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in ''The Old Curiosity Shop''), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in ''Oliver Twist''. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1983|pp=166\u2013169}}.</ref>\n\nDickens's serialisation of his novels was criticised by other authors. In Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]]'', there is a comment by Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship: \"See! They were writing up the log,\" said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. \"Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stevenson |first1=Robert Louis |title=The Novels and Tales of Robert Louis Stevenson: The Wrecker |date=1895 |publisher=Scribner\u2019s |page=245}}</ref>\n\n===Social commentary===\n[[File:Martin Chuzzlewit illus11.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Nurse [[Sarah Gamp]] (left) from ''Martin Chuzzlewit'' became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of [[Florence Nightingale]]]]\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of [[social commentary]]. He was a fierce critic of the poverty and [[social stratification]] of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=345}}.</ref> Dickens's second novel, ''Oliver Twist'' (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.<ref>{{harvnb|Raina|1986|p=25}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bodenheimer|2011|p=147}}.</ref>\n\nAt a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues\u2014such as [[sanitation]] and the [[workhouse]]\u2014but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in ''Hard Times'' (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed \"Hands\" by the factory owners; that is, not really \"people\" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in ''The Pickwick Papers'' are claimed to have been influential in having the [[Fleet Prison]] shut down. [[Karl Marx]] asserted that Dickens \"issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together\".<ref name=\"KucichSadoff\">{{harvnb|Kucich|Sadoff|2006|p=155}}.</ref> [[George Bernard Shaw]] even remarked that ''Great Expectations'' was more seditious than Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref name=\"KucichSadoff\" /> The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (''Bleak House'', 1853; ''Little Dorrit'', 1857; ''Our Mutual Friend'', 1865), not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual d\u00e9nouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|1990|p=48}}, citing [[Gillian Beer]]'s ''Darwin's Plots'' (1983, p.8).</ref>\n\n===Literary techniques===\n\n[[File:Bleakhouse1920c.jpg|thumb|[[Bleak House, Broadstairs|Bleak House]] (pictured in the 1920s) in [[Broadstairs]], Kent, where Dickens wrote some of his novels]]\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his [[caricature]]s and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by [[Oscar Wilde]]. \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell\", he said in a famous remark, \"without dissolving into tears...of laughter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/boev1.html|title=Deconstructing Little Nell|last=Boev|first=Hristo|date=|website=The Victorian Web|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ellmann|1988|p=441}}: In conversation with [[Ada Leverson]].</ref> [[G.

Valerie Purton, in her book ''Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition'', sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his \"sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes\", and that \"''Dombey and Son'' is [ ... ] Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Purton |first=Valerie |title=Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition: Fielding, Richardson, Sterne, Goldsmith, Sheridan, Lamb |series=Anthem nineteenth century studies |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2012 |pages=xiii, 123 |isbn=978-0857284181}}</ref> The ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' online comments that, despite \"patches of emotional excess\", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in ''A Christmas Carol'' (1843), \"Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel |title=novel (literature) |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Oliver Twist'' Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]]. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in ''Bleak House'' and Amy Dorrit in ''Little Dorrit''), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.<ref>{{harvnb|Marlow|1994|pp=149\u2013150}}.</ref> For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]],'' which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=44}}.</ref>\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Ottawa Public Library.jpg|thumb|right|Dickens' portrait (top left), in between Shakespeare and Tennyson, on a stained glass window at the [[Ottawa Public Library]], Ottawa, Canada]]\nDickens was the most popular novelist of his time,<ref>{{harvnb|Trollope|2007|p=62}}.</ref> and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors.

He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{harvnb|Black|2007|p=735}}.</ref> His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are still widely read today.<ref>{{harvnb|Mazzeno|2008|p=76}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chesterton|2005|pp=100\u2013126}}.</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Portsmouth]], Dickens left school to work in a factory when [[John Dickens|his father]] was incarcerated in a [[debtors' prison]]. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five [[novellas]], hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed [[Penny reading|readings]] extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.\n\nDickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the [[serial (literature)|serial]] publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.<ref name=\"Grossman 2012 54\">{{harvnb|Grossman|2012|p=54}}</ref><ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\">{{harvnb|Lodge|2002|p=118}}.</ref> [[Cliffhanger]] endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.<ref name=\"NewYorker\">{{cite magazine|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|magazine=The New Yorker|date=2 December 2017}}</ref> The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.<ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\"/> For example, when his wife's [[chiropodist]] expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in ''[[David Copperfield]]'' seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|2007|pp=46\u201347}}.</ref> His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|1987|pp=267\u2013268}}.</ref> Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|ha'pennies]] to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hauser|1999|p=116}}.</ref>\n\nHis 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' and ''[[Great Expectations]]'' are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.<ref name=\"Garratt\"/> Dickens has been praised by many of his fellow writers\u2014from [[Leo Tolstoy]] to [[George Orwell]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], and [[Tom Wolfe]]\u2014for his [[Realism (arts)|realism]], comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and [[Child labour#Historical|social criticism]]. However, [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henry James]], and [[Virginia Woolf]] complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of sentimentalism.\n\nThe term ''Dickensian'' is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Dickensian \"Oxford Dictionaries&nbsp;\u2013 Dickensian\"].

His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,<ref name=West1999>{{cite journal |last=West |first=Gilian |title=Huffam and Son |journal=The Dickensian |volume=95 |number=447 |date=Spring 1999 |pages=5\u201318 |publisher=Dickens Fellowship}}</ref> rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1848).<ref name=West1999 />\n\nIn January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, [[Fitzrovia]].<ref name=Callow2012p5>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=5}}</ref> When Charles was four, they relocated to [[Sheerness]], and thence to [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]], Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a \"very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy\".<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nCharles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the [[picaresque novel]]s of [[Tobias Smollett]] and [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[Gil Blas]]''. He read and reread ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' and the Collected Farces of [[Elizabeth Inchbald]].<ref name=Callow2012p7>{{harvnb|Callow|2012|p=7}}</ref> He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=22\u201324:29\u201330}}.</ref> His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a [[dame school]], and then at a school run by William Giles, a [[English Dissenters|dissenter]], in Chatham.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=41}}.</ref>\n[[File:Dickens-at-the-Blacking-Warehouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=drawing|Illustration by Fred Bernard of Dickens at work in a shoe-blacking factory after his father had been sent to the [[Marshalsea]], published in the 1892 edition of Forster's ''Life of Dickens''<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=158}}.</ref>]]\n\nThis period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at [[Somerset House]], and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term of work) moved to [[Camden Town]] in London.<ref name=Callow2009p13>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=13}}</ref> The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts, and, living beyond his means,<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}:'recklessly improvident'.</ref> John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the [[Marshalsea]] [[debtors' prison]] in [[Southwark]], London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.<ref>{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=11}}.</ref> Roylance was \"a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family\", whom Dickens later immortalised, \"with a few alterations and embellishments\", as \"Mrs Pipchin\" in ''Dombey and Son''. Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the [[Insolvency|Insolvent Court]], Archibald Russell, \"a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman... with a quiet old wife\" and lame son, in [[Lant Street]] in Southwark.<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=27}}.</ref> They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}.</ref>\n\nOn Sundays&mdash;with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]&mdash;he spent the day at the Marshalsea.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=53}}.</ref> Dickens later used the prison as a setting in ''[[Little Dorrit]]''. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's [[shoe polish|Blacking]] Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present [[Charing Cross railway station]], where he earned six [[shilling]]s a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered \"how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age\".<ref name=Foster23/> As he recalled to [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]] (from ''The Life of Charles Dickens''):\n\n<blockquote>The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.<ref name=Foster23>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of [[Covent Garden]] the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street and little audiences gathered and watched them at work\u2014in Dickens biographer [[Simon Callow]]'s estimation, the public display was \"a new refinement added to his misery\".<ref name=Callow2009p25>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=25}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Courtyard of the former Marshalsea prison, 1897 (2).png|upright|thumb|The [[Marshalsea]] around 1897, after it had closed. Dickens based several of his characters on the experience of seeing his father in the debtors' prison, most notably [[Little Dorrit|Amy Dorrit]] from ''Little Dorrit''.]]\nA few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him \u00a3450. On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was released from prison. Under the [[Act of Parliament|Insolvent Debtors Act]], Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left Marshalsea,<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=157}}.</ref><!-- not for the bequest --> for the home of Mrs Roylance.\n\nCharles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: \"I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back\".

Of these, ''A Christmas Carol'' was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America.<ref>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|pp=146\u2013148}}</ref> The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane [[Ragged School]], caused Dickens to resolve to \"strike a sledge hammer blow\" for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he \"wept and laughed, and wept again\" as he \"walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=98}}.</ref>\n\nAfter living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846), where he began work on ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1846\u201348). This and ''[[David Copperfield]]'' (1849\u201350) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.\n\nAt about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, [[Augustus Dickens|Augustus]], worked (John Chapman & Co.). It had been carried out by [[Thomas Powell (1809-1887)|Thomas Powell]], a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called ''The Living Authors of England'' with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (''[[Dombey and Son]]'') on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], editor of the New York literary magazine ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications, and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co. to seek written confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moss|first1=Sidney P.|last2=Moss|first2=Carolyn J.|title=The Charles Dickens-Thomas Powell Vendetta|date=1996|publisher=The Whitston Publishing Company|location=Troy New York|pages=42\u2013125}}</ref>\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett Coutts]], heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of [[Fallen woman|fallen women]] of the working class.

''David Copperfield'' is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in ''Bleak House'' reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright.<ref>{{harvnb|Polloczek|1999|p=133}}.</ref> Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in ''Little Dorrit'' resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=}}.</ref> Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in ''David Copperfield'' and Lucie Manette in ''A Tale of Two Cities.''<ref>{{harvnb|Slater|1983|pp=43, 47}}</ref>{{refn|Slater detects also Ellen Ternan in the portrayal of Lucie Manette.|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nDickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=653}}.</ref>\n\n===Episodic writing===\n[[File:Publicit\u00e9 pour Great Expectations dans All the Year Round.jpeg|thumb|right|225px|Advertisement for ''Great Expectations'', serialised in the weekly literary magazine ''[[All the Year Round]]'' from December 1860 to August 1861]]\nA pioneer of [[Serial (literature)|serialised]] fiction, most of Dickens's major novels were first written in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as ''Master Humphrey's Clock'' and ''Household Words'', later reprinted in book form.<ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\"/><ref name=\"Grossman 2012 54\"/> These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, and the series of regular [[cliffhanger]]s made each new episode widely anticipated.<ref name=\"NewYorker\"/> When ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in [[New York harbor]], shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Glancy|1999|p=34}}.</ref> Dickens's talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.\n\n[[File:Charles Dickens, public reading, 1867.jpg|left|thumb|\"Charles Dickens as he appears when reading.\" Wood engraving from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 7 December 1867]]\n\nAnother important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in ''The Old Curiosity Shop''), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in ''Oliver Twist''. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1983|pp=166\u2013169}}.</ref>\n\nDickens's serialisation of his novels was criticised by other authors. In Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]]'', there is a comment by Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship: \"See! They were writing up the log,\" said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. \"Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stevenson |first1=Robert Louis |title=The Novels and Tales of Robert Louis Stevenson: The Wrecker |date=1895 |publisher=Scribner\u2019s |page=245}}</ref>\n\n===Social commentary===\n[[File:Martin Chuzzlewit illus11.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Nurse [[Sarah Gamp]] (left) from ''Martin Chuzzlewit'' became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of [[Florence Nightingale]]]]\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of [[social commentary]]. He was a fierce critic of the poverty and [[social stratification]] of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=345}}.</ref> Dickens's second novel, ''Oliver Twist'' (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.<ref>{{harvnb|Raina|1986|p=25}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bodenheimer|2011|p=147}}.</ref>\n\nAt a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues\u2014such as [[sanitation]] and the [[workhouse]]\u2014but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in ''Hard Times'' (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed \"Hands\" by the factory owners; that is, not really \"people\" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in ''The Pickwick Papers'' are claimed to have been influential in having the [[Fleet Prison]] shut down. [[Karl Marx]] asserted that Dickens \"issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together\".<ref name=\"KucichSadoff\">{{harvnb|Kucich|Sadoff|2006|p=155}}.</ref> [[George Bernard Shaw]] even remarked that ''Great Expectations'' was more seditious than Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref name=\"KucichSadoff\" /> The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (''Bleak House'', 1853; ''Little Dorrit'', 1857; ''Our Mutual Friend'', 1865), not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual d\u00e9nouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|1990|p=48}}, citing [[Gillian Beer]]'s ''Darwin's Plots'' (1983, p.8).</ref>\n\n===Literary techniques===\n\n[[File:Bleakhouse1920c.jpg|thumb|[[Bleak House, Broadstairs|Bleak House]] (pictured in the 1920s) in [[Broadstairs]], Kent, where Dickens wrote some of his novels]]\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his [[caricature]]s and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by [[Oscar Wilde]]. \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell\", he said in a famous remark, \"without dissolving into tears...of laughter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/boev1.html|title=Deconstructing Little Nell|last=Boev|first=Hristo|date=|website=The Victorian Web|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ellmann|1988|p=441}}: In conversation with [[Ada Leverson]].</ref> [[G.

Valerie Purton, in her book ''Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition'', sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his \"sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes\", and that \"''Dombey and Son'' is [ ... ] Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Purton |first=Valerie |title=Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition: Fielding, Richardson, Sterne, Goldsmith, Sheridan, Lamb |series=Anthem nineteenth century studies |location=London |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2012 |pages=xiii, 123 |isbn=978-0857284181}}</ref> The ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' online comments that, despite \"patches of emotional excess\", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in ''A Christmas Carol'' (1843), \"Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel |title=novel (literature) |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Oliver Twist'' Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]]. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in ''Bleak House'' and Amy Dorrit in ''Little Dorrit''), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.<ref>{{harvnb|Marlow|1994|pp=149\u2013150}}.</ref> For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]],'' which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=44}}.</ref>\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Ottawa Public Library.jpg|thumb|right|Dickens' portrait (top left), in between Shakespeare and Tennyson, on a stained glass window at the [[Ottawa Public Library]], Ottawa, Canada]]\nDickens was the most popular novelist of his time,<ref>{{harvnb|Trollope|2007|p=62}}.</ref> and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors.

It is based on the 1958 novel [[Dr. No (novel)|of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. Starring [[Sean Connery]], [[Ursula Andress]], [[Joseph Wiseman]], and [[Jack Lord]], it is the first film in the [[List of James Bond films|''James Bond'' series]], and was adapted by [[Richard Maibaum]], [[Johanna Harwood]], and [[Berkely Mather]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]], a partnership that continued until 1975.\n\nIn the film, [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] is sent to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]] to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of [[Julius No|Dr. No]], who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] with a radio beam weapon. Although it was the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, ''Dr. No'' was not the first of Fleming's novels. ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' was the debut for the character; however, the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film makes reference to later books in the series as well, such as the criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]], which was not introduced until the 1961 novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''.\n\nProduced on a low budget, ''Dr. No'' was a financial success. While the film received a mixed critical reaction upon release, it has gained a reputation over time as one of the series' best instalments.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF INSTALMENTS - this is an article written in British English and retains the correct spelling --> ''Dr. No'' also launched a genre of \"secret agent\" films that flourished in the 1960s. The film also spawned a [[Dr. No (comics)|comic book adaptation]] and [[Dr. No (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] as part of its promotion and marketing.\n\nMany of the iconic aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in ''Dr. No'': the film begins with an introduction to the character through the [[Gun barrel sequence|view of a gun barrel]] and a highly stylised main title sequence, both of which were created by [[Maurice Binder]].<ref>{{cite episode |date=2 April 2020 |title=Spies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gwzj |series=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |series-link=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |network=BBC |station=BBC Four |series-number=2 |number=3 |time=13:26 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> It also established the iconic \"James Bond\" theme music. [[Production designer]] [[Ken Adam]] established an elaborate visual style that is one of the hallmarks of the film series.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

They steal documents related to \"Crab Key\" and \"Doctor No\". In response, [[M (James Bond)|M]], the head of MI6, instructs agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his co-operation with the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] by [[Radar jamming and deception|radio jamming]].\n\nOn his arrival at Kingston Airport, Bond is picked up by a chauffeur claiming to have been sent to take him to [[King's House, Jamaica|Government House]]. Bond determines him to be an enemy agent and, after having him evade a car pursuing them, bests him in a fight. Bond starts to interrogate the chauffeur, who kills himself with a [[cyanide]] capsule hidden in a cigarette.\n\nAt Strangways' house, Bond sees a photograph of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named [[Quarrel (James Bond)|Quarrel]], whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, [[Felix Leiter]], a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.\n\nIn Strangways' house, Bond finds a receipt from Professor R.J. Dent concerning rock samples. Bond meets Dent, who claims he [[wikt:assay|assayed]] the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. Dent subsequently visits Dr. No, who expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond, as well as by visiting him in daylight, and orders him to try again with a [[tarantula]], which is released into Bond's bedroom at night. Bond survives, kills the poisonous spider and sets a trap for Dent, whom he interrogates and kills.\n\nUsing a [[Geiger counter]], Bond detects [[radioactive]] traces in Quarrel's boat where Strangways' mineral samples had been. Bond convinces a reluctant Quarrel to take him to Crab Key. There Bond meets the beautiful [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]], dressed only in a [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]], who is collecting shells. Ryder leads Bond and Quarrel inland to an open swamp contaminated by radiation. After nightfall, they are attacked by the \"dragon\" of Crab Key, which is, in reality, a [[flamethrower]]-equipped tank. In the resulting battle, Quarrel is incinerated and killed, while Bond and Ryder are kidnapped, decontaminated in Dr. No's lair, and rendered unconscious with drugged coffee.\n\nUpon waking, they are escorted to dine with Dr. No, a Chinese-German criminal scientist who has [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] metal hands due to radiation exposure. He reveals that he is a former member of a Chinese crime [[Tong (organization)|Tong]], from whom he stole ten million dollars, and is now an operative of the secret organisation  [[SPECTRE]] ('''SP'''ecial '''E'''xecutive for '''C'''ounter-intelligence, '''T'''errorism, '''R'''evenge, and '''E'''xtortion), after being rejected by both the Americans and the Soviets. He plans to disrupt the [[Project Mercury]] space launch from Cape Canaveral with his radio beam. He tries to recruit Bond into SPECTRE but fails. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards.\n\nBond is imprisoned in a holding cell but escapes by crawling through an air vent which is heated and then flooded. Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear [[pool reactor]]. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him, as the scientist is unable to climb out due to his metal hands. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat as the entire lair explodes. After the boat runs out of fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a [[Royal Navy]] ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's tow rope.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], a British MI6 agent, codename 007.\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as [[Honey Ryder]], A local shell diver, making a living by selling Jamaican seashells to dealers in Miami.\n**Andress' spoken dialogue was dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]]<ref name=\"Dr. No 1962 - Cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/455547/credits.html|title=Dr. No (1962) \u2013 Cast|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>, and her singing voice was dubbed by [[Diana Coupland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6136408.stm|title=Actress Diana Coupland dies at 74|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=7 June 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref> Both were uncredited.\n* [[Joseph Wiseman]] as [[Julius No|Dr. Julius No]], a reclusive member of [[SPECTRE]]\n* [[Jack Lord]] as [[Felix Leiter]], a [[CIA]] operative sent to liaise with James Bond while he is in Kingston.\n* [[Bernard Lee]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]]: The head of the British Secret Service.\n* [[Anthony Dawson]] as Professor R.J.

Instead, [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli]] wanted the rights to the novels and attempted to buy them from Saltzman. Saltzman did not want to sell the rights to Broccoli and instead, they formed a partnership to make the films. A number of Hollywood film studios did not want to fund the films, finding them \"too British\" or \"too blatantly sexual\".{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=13}} Eventually the two received authorisation from [[United Artists]] to produce ''Dr. No'', to be released in 1962. Saltzman and Broccoli created two companies: [[Danjaq]], which was to hold the rights to the films, and [[Eon Productions]], which was to produce them.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> The partnership between Broccoli and Saltzman lasted until 1975 when tensions during the filming of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' led to an acrimonious split and Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq to United Artists.<ref name=\"DNB: A.

They finally signed [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] who had a long background with Broccoli's [[Warwick Films]] as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would be able to make a real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that \"a lot of things in this film, the sex, and violence, and so on if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you [[Taking the piss|take the mickey out]], put the [[tongue-in-cheek|tongue out in the cheek]], it seems to disarm.\"<ref>{{cite video|last=Young|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Young (director)|title=Audio commentary |location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006) |year=1999|medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nThe producers asked United Artists for financing, but the studio would only put up $1 million.

My budget was \u00a314,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr. No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear-projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr. No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's [[Portrait of the Duke of Wellington]], which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display.<ref name=\"The Guardian 17 September 2005\">{{cite news |last= Dee |first= Johnny |title= Licensed to drill |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/17/culture.features| date= 17 September 2005 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=10 March 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Writing ===\nBroccoli had originally hired [[Richard Maibaum]] and his friend [[Wolf Mankowitz]] to write ''Dr. No''{{'}}s screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=158}} An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Mankowitz left the film, and Maibaum then undertook a second version of the story, more closely in line with the novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\" /> [[Johanna Harwood]] and thriller writer [[Berkely Mather]] then worked on Maibaum's script.{{sfn| McGilligan |1986|p=286}} Terence Young described Harwood as a [[script doctor]] who helped put elements more in tune with a British character.<ref name=comm/> Harwood stated in an interview in a ''Cinema Retro'' special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; she claimed both her screenplays for ''Dr. No'' and her screenplay for ''From Russia with Love'' had followed Fleming's novels closely.<ref>''Johanna Harwood Interview'' ''Movie Classics # 4'' Solo Publishing 2012</ref>\n\nDuring the series' decades-long history only a few of the films have remained substantially true to their source material; ''Dr. No'' has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a [[giant squid]], and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a [[centipede]]; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a [[bauxite]] mine instead of a [[guano]] quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt [[NASA]] space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\nSometimes episodes in the novel retained in the film's altered narrative introduce elements of absurdity into the plot. Bond's \"escape\" from his cell via the air shaft, for instance, originally conceived as a ruse of Dr. No's to test Bond's skill and endurance, becomes an authentic break-out in the film. Features carried over from the novel's obstacle course, however, such as the torrent of water and scalding surface, have no logical justification in the script. Such incongruities recurred in subsequent Bond films.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n==== James Bond ====\nWhile producers Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought [[Cary Grant]] for the role, they discarded the idea as Grant would be committed to only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Johnson Interview|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/1524-RICHARD-JOHNSON-ON-DECLINING-THE-ROLE-OF-JAMES-BOND.html|work=[[Cinema Retro]]|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref> Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was [[Patrick McGoohan]] on the strength of his portrayal of spy [[John Drake (Danger Man)|John Drake]] in the television series ''[[Danger Man]]'': McGoohan turned down the role.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Dennis|title=Obituary: Patrick McGoohan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/14/television2|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=14 January 2009}}</ref> Another potential Bond included [[David Niven]], who played the character in the 1967 parody ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=202}}\n\nThere are several [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]] stories as to whom Ian Fleming personally wanted.

While this is untrue, the contest itself did exist, and six finalists were chosen and screen-tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming. The winner of the contest was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had a [[Gregory Peck]] quality, but proved unable to cope with the role.{{sfn|Cork|Scivally|2002|p=31}} When Connery was invited to meet Broccoli and Saltzman he appeared scruffy and in unpressed clothes, but Connery \"put on an act and it paid off\" as he acted in the meeting with a macho, devil-may-care attitude.{{Sfn|Bray|2010|p=73}} When he left both Saltzman and Broccoli watched him through the window as he went to his car, both agreeing that he was the right man for Bond.{{Sfn|Bray|2010|p=74}} After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser,<ref name=gayson>{{cite video|last=Gayson|first=Eunice|authorlink=Eunice Gayson|title=Audio commentary|location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006) |medium=DVD|year=1999 |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London.

It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |title=Secrets Behind the Comics |first=Mark |last=Evanier |authorlink=Mark Evanier|publisher=NewsFromme.com |date=3 December 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208081002/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html|archivedate=8 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=33%|salign=right|It is because of [Ken Adam] that people believe criminal masterminds operate from the insides of dormant volcanoes and travel between their sumptuously decorated lairs on chrome-plated monorails.

It is based on the 1958 novel [[Dr. No (novel)|of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. Starring [[Sean Connery]], [[Ursula Andress]], [[Joseph Wiseman]], and [[Jack Lord]], it is the first film in the [[List of James Bond films|''James Bond'' series]], and was adapted by [[Richard Maibaum]], [[Johanna Harwood]], and [[Berkely Mather]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]], a partnership that continued until 1975.\n\nIn the film, [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] is sent to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]] to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of [[Julius No|Dr. No]], who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] with a radio beam weapon. Although it was the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, ''Dr. No'' was not the first of Fleming's novels. ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' was the debut for the character; however, the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film makes reference to later books in the series as well, such as the criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]], which was not introduced until the 1961 novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''.\n\nProduced on a low budget, ''Dr. No'' was a financial success. While the film received a mixed critical reaction upon release, it has gained a reputation over time as one of the series' best instalments.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF INSTALMENTS - this is an article written in British English and retains the correct spelling --> ''Dr. No'' also launched a genre of \"secret agent\" films that flourished in the 1960s. The film also spawned a [[Dr. No (comics)|comic book adaptation]] and [[Dr. No (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] as part of its promotion and marketing.\n\nMany of the iconic aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in ''Dr. No'': the film begins with an introduction to the character through the [[Gun barrel sequence|view of a gun barrel]] and a highly stylised main title sequence, both of which were created by [[Maurice Binder]].<ref>{{cite episode |date=2 April 2020 |title=Spies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gwzj |series=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |series-link=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |network=BBC |station=BBC Four |series-number=2 |number=3 |time=13:26 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> It also established the iconic \"James Bond\" theme music.

They steal documents related to \"Crab Key\" and \"Doctor No\". In response, [[M (James Bond)|M]], the head of MI6, instructs agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his co-operation with the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] by [[Radar jamming and deception|radio jamming]].\n\nOn his arrival at Kingston Airport, Bond is picked up by a chauffeur claiming to have been sent to take him to [[King's House, Jamaica|Government House]]. Bond determines him to be an enemy agent and, after having him evade a car pursuing them, bests him in a fight. Bond starts to interrogate the chauffeur, who kills himself with a [[cyanide]] capsule hidden in a cigarette.\n\nAt Strangways' house, Bond sees a photograph of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named [[Quarrel (James Bond)|Quarrel]], whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, [[Felix Leiter]], a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.\n\nIn Strangways' house, Bond finds a receipt from Professor R.J. Dent concerning rock samples. Bond meets Dent, who claims he [[wikt:assay|assayed]] the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. Dent subsequently visits Dr. No, who expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond, as well as by visiting him in daylight, and orders him to try again with a [[tarantula]], which is released into Bond's bedroom at night. Bond survives, kills the poisonous spider and sets a trap for Dent, whom he interrogates and kills.\n\nUsing a [[Geiger counter]], Bond detects [[radioactive]] traces in Quarrel's boat where Strangways' mineral samples had been. Bond convinces a reluctant Quarrel to take him to Crab Key. There Bond meets the beautiful [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]], dressed only in a [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]], who is collecting shells. Ryder leads Bond and Quarrel inland to an open swamp contaminated by radiation. After nightfall, they are attacked by the \"dragon\" of Crab Key, which is, in reality, a [[flamethrower]]-equipped tank. In the resulting battle, Quarrel is incinerated and killed, while Bond and Ryder are kidnapped, decontaminated in Dr. No's lair, and rendered unconscious with drugged coffee.\n\nUpon waking, they are escorted to dine with Dr. No, a Chinese-German criminal scientist who has [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] metal hands due to radiation exposure. He reveals that he is a former member of a Chinese crime [[Tong (organization)|Tong]], from whom he stole ten million dollars, and is now an operative of the secret organisation  [[SPECTRE]] ('''SP'''ecial '''E'''xecutive for '''C'''ounter-intelligence, '''T'''errorism, '''R'''evenge, and '''E'''xtortion), after being rejected by both the Americans and the Soviets. He plans to disrupt the [[Project Mercury]] space launch from Cape Canaveral with his radio beam. He tries to recruit Bond into SPECTRE but fails. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards.\n\nBond is imprisoned in a holding cell but escapes by crawling through an air vent which is heated and then flooded. Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear [[pool reactor]].

Saltzman and Broccoli created two companies: [[Danjaq]], which was to hold the rights to the films, and [[Eon Productions]], which was to produce them.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> The partnership between Broccoli and Saltzman lasted until 1975 when tensions during the filming of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' led to an acrimonious split and Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq to United Artists.<ref name=\"DNB: A.

They finally signed [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] who had a long background with Broccoli's [[Warwick Films]] as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would be able to make a real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that \"a lot of things in this film, the sex, and violence, and so on if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you [[Taking the piss|take the mickey out]], put the [[tongue-in-cheek|tongue out in the cheek]], it seems to disarm.\"<ref>{{cite video|last=Young|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Young (director)|title=Audio commentary |location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006) |year=1999|medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nThe producers asked United Artists for financing, but the studio would only put up $1 million.

My budget was \u00a314,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr. No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear-projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr. No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's [[Portrait of the Duke of Wellington]], which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display.<ref name=\"The Guardian 17 September 2005\">{{cite news |last= Dee |first= Johnny |title= Licensed to drill |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/17/culture.features| date= 17 September 2005 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=10 March 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Writing ===\nBroccoli had originally hired [[Richard Maibaum]] and his friend [[Wolf Mankowitz]] to write ''Dr. No''{{'}}s screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=158}} An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Mankowitz left the film, and Maibaum then undertook a second version of the story, more closely in line with the novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\" /> [[Johanna Harwood]] and thriller writer [[Berkely Mather]] then worked on Maibaum's script.{{sfn| McGilligan |1986|p=286}} Terence Young described Harwood as a [[script doctor]] who helped put elements more in tune with a British character.<ref name=comm/> Harwood stated in an interview in a ''Cinema Retro'' special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; she claimed both her screenplays for ''Dr. No'' and her screenplay for ''From Russia with Love'' had followed Fleming's novels closely.<ref>''Johanna Harwood Interview'' ''Movie Classics # 4'' Solo Publishing 2012</ref>\n\nDuring the series' decades-long history only a few of the films have remained substantially true to their source material; ''Dr. No'' has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a [[giant squid]], and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a [[centipede]]; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a [[bauxite]] mine instead of a [[guano]] quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt [[NASA]] space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\nSometimes episodes in the novel retained in the film's altered narrative introduce elements of absurdity into the plot. Bond's \"escape\" from his cell via the air shaft, for instance, originally conceived as a ruse of Dr. No's to test Bond's skill and endurance, becomes an authentic break-out in the film. Features carried over from the novel's obstacle course, however, such as the torrent of water and scalding surface, have no logical justification in the script. Such incongruities recurred in subsequent Bond films.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n==== James Bond ====\nWhile producers Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought [[Cary Grant]] for the role, they discarded the idea as Grant would be committed to only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Johnson Interview|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/1524-RICHARD-JOHNSON-ON-DECLINING-THE-ROLE-OF-JAMES-BOND.html|work=[[Cinema Retro]]|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref> Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was [[Patrick McGoohan]] on the strength of his portrayal of spy [[John Drake (Danger Man)|John Drake]] in the television series ''[[Danger Man]]'': McGoohan turned down the role.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Dennis|title=Obituary: Patrick McGoohan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/14/television2|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=14 January 2009}}</ref> Another potential Bond included [[David Niven]], who played the character in the 1967 parody ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=202}}\n\nThere are several [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]] stories as to whom Ian Fleming personally wanted.

While this is untrue, the contest itself did exist, and six finalists were chosen and screen-tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming. The winner of the contest was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had a [[Gregory Peck]] quality, but proved unable to cope with the role.{{sfn|Cork|Scivally|2002|p=31}} When Connery was invited to meet Broccoli and Saltzman he appeared scruffy and in unpressed clothes, but Connery \"put on an act and it paid off\" as he acted in the meeting with a macho, devil-may-care attitude.{{Sfn|Bray|2010|p=73}} When he left both Saltzman and Broccoli watched him through the window as he went to his car, both agreeing that he was the right man for Bond.{{Sfn|Bray|2010|p=74}} After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser,<ref name=gayson>{{cite video|last=Gayson|first=Eunice|authorlink=Eunice Gayson|title=Audio commentary|location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006) |medium=DVD|year=1999 |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London.

The SCAR-L fires [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]], fed from [[STANAG magazine|STANAG]] ([[M16 rifle|M16]]) magazines. The SCAR-H fires the more powerful [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] from proprietary 20-round magazines. Different length barrels are available for [[Close Quarters Battle|close quarters battle]] and for longer-range engagements. The initial solicitation indicated that the SCAR-H would also be able to be chambered in [[7.62\u00d739mm]] M43 Kalashnikov cartridge and [[6.8mm Remington SPC|6.8\u00d743mm Remington SPC]] cartridge. However, FN is not currently offering them and they likely have been cancelled.\n\nThe Mk 16 was intended to replace the [[M4 carbine#M4A1|M4A1]], the [[Close Quarters Battle Receiver|Mk 18 CQBR]] and the [[Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle|Mk 12 SPR]] currently in [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]] service, before SOCOM decided to cancel the order for the Mk 16 Mod 0 (see below).

The lower receiver is designed with an [[M16 rifle|M16]] compatible pistol grip, flared magazine well, and raised area around the magazine and bolt release buttons. The front sight flips down for unobstructed use of optics and accessories. The rifle uses a 'tappet' type of closed gas system much like the [[M1 carbine|M1 Carbine]] while the bolt carrier otherwise resembles the [[Stoner 63]] or [[Heckler & Koch G36]].\n\nThe SCAR is built at the FN Manufacturing, LLC plant in Columbia, South Carolina, in the United States.

The FN40GL is marketed in both an '''L (Light)''' and '''H (Heavy)''' model, for fitting the appropriate SCAR variant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fnherstal.com/index.php?id=265 |title=Grenade Launchers |publisher=FNHerstal.com |accessdate=19 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102024214/http://www.fnherstal.com/index.php?id=265 |archive-date=2 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The EGLM system features a double-action trigger and a swing-out chamber. These offer two advantages over the [[M203]] system, the first being that the launcher does not need to be re-cocked if the grenade does not fire, and the latter being that longer grenades can be used. Like the M203, the FN40GL uses the same [[High-Low System|High-Low Propulsion System]].\n\nThe FN40GL is deemed a third-generation grenade launcher, meaning it is multifunctional: it can be used mounted to the rifle or as a standalone system; it is manufactured using a number of materials like aluminum, composites, and polymers; the breech opens to the side for use of longer 40&nbsp;mm rounds including less-than-lethal; and it is mounted on the bottom accessory rail instead of requiring specialized mounting hardware. The FN40GL is attached to SCAR rifles on the bottom rail with a trigger adapter and dual locking clamp levers on the launcher, limiting the ability to integrate with other rifles. Barrel length is {{convert|9.6|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and is unique in that it is the only system where the barrel can swivel to the left or right for loading, while other breech-loading launchers pivot specifically to one side. This enhances its ambidextrousness, making it easy for a left-handed operator to load under fire. The standalone stock assembly has the FN40GL mounted to the bottom rail as with the rifle, but still has 3 o\u2019clock, 6 o\u2019clock, and 9 o\u2019clock rail positions for other accessories. This is mainly during non-lethal uses for other mounted additions like [[LED lights]] and [[laser dazzler]]s. The trigger is placed lower than normal for operation with the user's middle finger while keeping their trigger finger free to use the rifle. The double-action trigger is long and heavy to prevent easily and unintentionally firing a round under stress.<ref>[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=817 FN SCAR 47GL / MK 17] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111202856/http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=817 |date=11 November 2013 }} - SAdefensejournal.com, 9 January 2012</ref>\n\n===FNAC===\nIn July 2007, the US Army announced a limited competition between the [[M4 carbine]], FN SCAR, [[HK416]], and the previously shelved [[XM8 rifle|HK XM8]].

The 5.56mm conversion kit was finalized in late 2010 and orders began in mid-2011.<ref>[http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/11794/exclusive-update-on-the-fn-scar/ Update on the FN SCAR] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018232730/http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/11794/exclusive-update-on-the-fn-scar/ |date=18 October 2014 }} - Shootingillustrated.com, 27 June 2011</ref>\n\nOn 9 December 2011, the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division]] released a sole source 5 year [[IDIQ|indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity]] procurement notice for the Mk 16 Mod 0 (SCAR-L), Mk 17 Mod 0 (SCAR-H), Mk 20 Mod 0 (SSR), and Mk 13 Mod 0 (40mm EGLM) from FN to sustain inventory levels.<ref>[http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2011/12/15/navy-to-buy-additional-fn-scar-mk-13-mk-16-mk-17-and-mk-20/ Navy to buy additional FN SCAR Mk. 13, Mk 16, Mk. 17 and Mk. 20] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716045031/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2011/12/15/navy-to-buy-additional-fn-scar-mk-13-mk-16-mk-17-and-mk-20/ |date=16 July 2012 }} \u2013 The Firearm Blog, 15 December 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=25398bbee12496a7a88b87b3123b2d3e&tab=core&_cview=0 |title=Combat assault rifle and enhanced grenade launcher module |publisher=Fbo.gov |date=9 December 2011 |access-date=19 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406072902/https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=25398bbee12496a7a88b87b3123b2d3e&tab=core&_cview=0 |archive-date=6 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Navy special operations forces procures their firearms through SOCOM and fielded the MK 16 more than any other unit.<ref name=\"navyuse\" />\n\nThe Mk 17 is now in widespread use by United States SOF forces in Afghanistan, where its relative light weight, accuracy and stopping power has proved of worth on the battlefield.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanspecialops.com/special-ops-weapons/mk17-scar.php|title=MK 17 SCAR {{!}} US Special Operations {{!}} Weapons|website=www.americanspecialops.com|access-date=2017-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520010413/http://www.americanspecialops.com/special-ops-weapons/mk17-scar.php|archive-date=20 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Service with the Taliban===\nCaptured Mk 17 rifles have been observed being used by [[Taliban]] forces since 2015.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/how-did-taliban-fighters-get-hold-us-special-operations-gear-2017-7 How did Taliban fighters get their hands on US special-operations gear?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011115929/https://www.businessinsider.com/how-did-taliban-fighters-get-hold-us-special-operations-gear-2017-7 |date=11 October 2018 }} - Businessinsider.com, 21 March 2019</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n===Military variants===\n[[File:SFG SFAUC.jpg|thumb|Belgian SFG soldier armed with the SCAR-L with a suppressor]]\n[[File:A coalition Special Operations Forces member fires his sniper rifle from a hilltop during a firefight near Nawa Garay village (120403-N-MY805-202).jpg|thumb|U.S. coalition [[Special forces|SOF]] soldier with the Mk 20 Sniper Support Rifle (SSR)]]\n[[File:60th Merdeka Day Picture 69 Commando of PGK with FN SCAR-H.jpg|thumb|A Malaysian [[Pasukan Gerakan Khas|VAT 69]] commando armed with SCAR-H rifle, fitted with an EOTech sight during 60th Merdeka Day parade]]\n*'''SCAR-L (FN MK 16)''' \u2013 [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] [[assault rifle]]\n**SCAR-L CQC (FN MK 16 CQC) (Close Quarter Combat) \u2013 {{convert|10|in|order=flip|abbr=on}} barrel\n**SCAR-L STD (FN MK 16) (Standard) \u2013 {{convert|14|in|order=flip|abbr=on}} barrel\n**SCAR-L LB (FN MK 16 LB) (Long Barrel) \u2013 {{convert|18|in|order=flip|abbr=on}} barrel\n* '''SCAR PDW''' \u2013 [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] [[personal defense weapon]] variant with a 170&nbsp;mm (6.5&nbsp;in) barrel length.

The SCAR-L fires [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]], fed from [[STANAG magazine|STANAG]] ([[M16 rifle|M16]]) magazines. The SCAR-H fires the more powerful [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] from proprietary 20-round magazines. Different length barrels are available for [[Close Quarters Battle|close quarters battle]] and for longer-range engagements. The initial solicitation indicated that the SCAR-H would also be able to be chambered in [[7.62\u00d739mm]] M43 Kalashnikov cartridge and [[6.8mm Remington SPC|6.8\u00d743mm Remington SPC]] cartridge. However, FN is not currently offering them and they likely have been cancelled.\n\nThe Mk 16 was intended to replace the [[M4 carbine#M4A1|M4A1]], the [[Close Quarters Battle Receiver|Mk 18 CQBR]] and the [[Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle|Mk 12 SPR]] currently in [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]] service, before SOCOM decided to cancel the order for the Mk 16 Mod 0 (see below). The Mk 17 will replace the [[M14 rifle|M14]] and [[SR-25|Mk 11]] sniper rifles. However, the weapon will only supplement other weapons while issuing remains at the operator's decision.\n\nThe Mk 20 Mod 0 Sniper Support Rifle (SSR) is based on the SCAR-H. It includes a longer receiver, a beefed-up barrel extension and barrel profile to reduce whip and improve accuracy, and an enhanced modular trigger that can be configured for single-stage or two-stage operation together with either a folding or a non-folding precision stock.<ref name=\"Janes\">{{cite journal |last1= Wasseby|first1=Daniel |year=2010 |title=SCAR Variant approved for full-rate production |journal=Jane's Defence Weekly |volume=47 |issue=51 |page=11 |url= }}</ref>\n\nThe SCAR has two receivers: The lower is constructed of polymer, and the upper receiver is one piece and constructed of aluminum.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SJYjP_tJ9_wC Cartridges and Firearm Identification, Advances in materials science and engineering] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103063234/http://books.google.com/books?id=SJYjP_tJ9_wC |date=3 January 2014 }}, p295, by Robert E.

The lower receiver is designed with an [[M16 rifle|M16]] compatible pistol grip, flared magazine well, and raised area around the magazine and bolt release buttons. The front sight flips down for unobstructed use of optics and accessories. The rifle uses a 'tappet' type of closed gas system much like the [[M1 carbine|M1 Carbine]] while the bolt carrier otherwise resembles the [[Stoner 63]] or [[Heckler & Koch G36]].\n\nThe SCAR is built at the FN Manufacturing, LLC plant in Columbia, South Carolina, in the United States. Since 2008, FN Herstal has been offering semi-automatic versions of the SCAR rifles for commercial and law enforcement use.

The FN40GL is marketed in both an '''L (Light)''' and '''H (Heavy)''' model, for fitting the appropriate SCAR variant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fnherstal.com/index.php?id=265 |title=Grenade Launchers |publisher=FNHerstal.com |accessdate=19 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102024214/http://www.fnherstal.com/index.php?id=265 |archive-date=2 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The EGLM system features a double-action trigger and a swing-out chamber. These offer two advantages over the [[M203]] system, the first being that the launcher does not need to be re-cocked if the grenade does not fire, and the latter being that longer grenades can be used. Like the M203, the FN40GL uses the same [[High-Low System|High-Low Propulsion System]].\n\nThe FN40GL is deemed a third-generation grenade launcher, meaning it is multifunctional: it can be used mounted to the rifle or as a standalone system; it is manufactured using a number of materials like aluminum, composites, and polymers; the breech opens to the side for use of longer 40&nbsp;mm rounds including less-than-lethal; and it is mounted on the bottom accessory rail instead of requiring specialized mounting hardware. The FN40GL is attached to SCAR rifles on the bottom rail with a trigger adapter and dual locking clamp levers on the launcher, limiting the ability to integrate with other rifles. Barrel length is {{convert|9.6|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and is unique in that it is the only system where the barrel can swivel to the left or right for loading, while other breech-loading launchers pivot specifically to one side. This enhances its ambidextrousness, making it easy for a left-handed operator to load under fire. The standalone stock assembly has the FN40GL mounted to the bottom rail as with the rifle, but still has 3 o\u2019clock, 6 o\u2019clock, and 9 o\u2019clock rail positions for other accessories. This is mainly during non-lethal uses for other mounted additions like [[LED lights]] and [[laser dazzler]]s. The trigger is placed lower than normal for operation with the user's middle finger while keeping their trigger finger free to use the rifle. The double-action trigger is long and heavy to prevent easily and unintentionally firing a round under stress.<ref>[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=817 FN SCAR 47GL / MK 17] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111202856/http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=817 |date=11 November 2013 }} - SAdefensejournal.com, 9 January 2012</ref>\n\n===FNAC===\nIn July 2007, the US Army announced a limited competition between the [[M4 carbine]], FN SCAR, [[HK416]], and the previously shelved [[XM8 rifle|HK XM8]]. Ten examples of each of the four competitors were involved. During the testing, 6,000 rounds apiece were fired from each of the carbines in an \"extreme dust environment\". The purpose of the shoot-off was to assess future needs, not to select a replacement for the M4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,143790,00.html?ESRC=army-a.nl|title=Army Agrees to M4 Sand Test Shoot-Off|publisher=Military.com|accessdate=19 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012153212/http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,143790,00.html?ESRC=army-a.nl|archive-date=12 October 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the test, the SCAR suffered 226 stoppages.

The 2006 test focused only on the M4 and M16. The Summer 2007 test had only the M4 but increased lubrication.

When requirements were finalized, the decision was made to separate the 5.56\u00d745mm and 7.62\u00d751mm weapons because converting the medium caliber rifle to fire small caliber bullets created an assault rifle heavier than the M4 carbine. After fielding, operators reversed the previous decision and called for a SCAR that could change calibers. The Mk 17 was chosen to be scaled down because it had a larger receiver for the 7.62\u00d751mm round, and so the 5.56mm Mk 16 could not be scaled up to chamber the larger round.

The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]] bone (22,800&nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad V\u00e1hom]] near [[Pie\u0161\u0165any]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Z\u00e1kovsk\u00e1, Podkovice, Hubina, and Rado\u0161ina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Central Europe]].\n\n=== Bronze Age ===\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]], the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BCE. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this there period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[\u0160pania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.\n\n[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin<br/>Right: five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]\n\nAfter the disappearance of the \u010cakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.\n\n=== Iron Age ===\n\n==== Hallstatt Period ====\nThe arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sere\u010f]]) and in the hill forts like Molp\u00edr, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. Common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries.\n\nA special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the \"Princes\" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the century before the middle of first millennium BC, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught the interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.\n\n==== La T\u00e8ne Period ====\nFrom around 500&nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Dev\u00edn]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[P\u00fachov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the \"Velkobysterecky\" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].\n\n==== Roman Period ====\n[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]] (178\u2013179 AD)]]\nFrom 2&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Sz\u0151ny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in [[Dev\u00edn Castle]] (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of D\u00fabravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.\n\nNear the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&nbsp;CE during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]]an tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in western and central Slovakia from 8\u20136&nbsp;BCE to 179&nbsp;CE.\n\n=== Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries ===\nIn the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the [[Huns]] began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377&nbsp;AD and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]], and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].\n\nIn 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by [[Samo]], a Frankish merchant.<ref name=\"T\u00f6rt\u00e9neti Kronol\u00f3gia\">{{cite book|last=Benda|first=K\u00e1lm\u00e1n|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gi\u00e1ja ''(\"The Historical Chronology of Hungary\")''|publisher=Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}</ref> After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline<ref>Krist\u00f3, p.30\u201331</ref> but its reign lasted to 804.\n\n=== Slavic states ===\nThe [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of [[Samo]]'s empire in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the 8th century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighbouring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire from 833.

By 1648, Slovakia was not spared the [[Counter-Reformation]], which brought the majority of its population from Lutheranism back to [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1655, the printing press at the [[Trnava]] university produced the Jesuit Benedikt Sz\u00f6ll\u0151si's Cantus Catholici, a Catholic hymnal in the Slovak language that reaffirmed links to the earlier works of Cyril and Methodius.\n\nThe [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]], rivalry between [[Austria]] and [[Transylvania]], and the frequent insurrections against the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas.<ref>\"[http://www.slovakiasite.com/history-hungary.php Part of Hungary, Turkish occupation]\".

The Slovaks were not consulted. In 1919, during the chaos following the break-up of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous [[German people|Germans]], Slovaks, Hungarians and  Ruthenians within the newly set borders. The borders were set by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In the peace following the World War, Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European state. It provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities, at least on paper.\n\nDuring the [[Interwar period]], democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with France, and also with [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] ([[Little Entente]]); however, the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 left East European security open. Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity. There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy, but also culture and educational opportunities.

Revision of the borders was called for, as Czechs constituted only 43% of the population. Eventually this pressure led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed the majority ethnic Germans in the [[Sudetenland]], borderlands of Czechoslovakia, to join with Germany. The remaining minorities stepped up their pressures for autonomy and the State became federalised, with Diets in Slovakia and Ruthenia. The remainder of Czechoslovakia was renamed [[Czecho-Slovakia]] and promised a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy.

The dry continental air brings in the summer heat and winter frosts. In contrast, oceanic air brings rainfalls and reduces summer temperatures. In the lowlands and valleys there is often fog, especially in winter.\n\nSpring starts with 21 March and is characterised by colder weather with average daily temperature of {{convert|9|C}} in the first weeks and about {{convert|14|C}} in May and {{convert|17|C}} in June. In Slovakia, the weather and climate in the spring is very unstable.\n\nSummer starts on 22 June and is usually characterised by hot weather with daily temperatures exceeding {{convert|30|C}}. July is the warmest month with temperatures up to about {{convert|37|to|40|C}}, especially in regions of southern Slovakia\u2014in the urban area of Kom\u00e1rno, Hurbanovo or \u0160t\u00farovo. Showers or thunderstorms may occur because of the summer monsoon called Medardova kvapka (Medard drop\u201440 days of rain). Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|C}} (less in the mountains).\n\nAutumn in Slovakia starts on 23 September and is mostly characterised by wet weather and wind, although the first weeks can be very warm and sunny. The average temperature in September is around {{convert|14|C}}, in November to {{convert|3|C}}. Late September and early October is a dry and sunny time of year (so-called Indian Summer).\n\nWinter starts on 21 December with temperatures around {{convert|-5|to|-10|C}}. In December and January it is usually snowing, these are the coldest months of the year. At lower altitudes, snow does not stay the whole winter, it changes into the thaw and frost.

Parents may apply for social assistance for a child that is studying on an elementary school or a high-school. If approved, the state provides basic study necessities for the child. Schools provide books to all their students with usual exceptions of books for studying a foreign language and books which require taking notes in them, which are mostly present at the first grade of elementary school.\n\nAfter finishing elementary school, students are obliged to take one year in high school.\n\nAfter finishing high school, students can go to university and are highly encouraged to do so. Slovakia has a wide range of universities. The biggest university is [[Comenius University]], established in 1919.

[[Sheep|Lamb]] and [[goat]] are eaten but are not widely popular.\n\nThe traditional Slovak meals are [[bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky]], [[bryndzov\u00e9 pirohy]] and other meals with potato dough and [[bryndza]]. Bryndza is a salty cheese made of a sheep milk, characterised by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky must be on the menu of every traditional Slovak restaurant.\n\nA typical soup is a [[sauerkraut]] soup (\"kapustnica\"). A [[Black pudding|blood sausage]] called \"krvavnica\", made from any and all parts of a butchered pig is also a specific Slovak meal.\n\nWine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. [[Slovak wine]] comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or ros\u00e9 (except in some regions), and [[Sweetness of wine|sweet wine]] more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakiasite.com/slovak-cuisine.php |title=Slovak Cuisine |publisher=Slovakiasite.com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Beer (mainly of the [[pilsener]] style, though [[Dunkel|dark lagers]] are also consumed) is also popular.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Slovakia}}\nSporting activities are practised widely in Slovakia, many of them on a professional level. [[Ice hockey]] and [[association football|football]] have traditionally been regarded as the most popular sports in Slovakia, though [[tennis]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[whitewater slalom]], [[cycling]] and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] are also popular.\n\n;Ice Hockey\n[[File:Slovakia2010WinterOlympicscelebration2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Slovakia men's national ice hockey team|Slovak national ice hockey team]] celebrating a victory against [[Swedish national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]]]\nOne of the most popular team sports in Slovakia is [[ice hockey]].

The most recent success was a silver medal at the [[2012 IIHF World Championship]] in [[Helsinki]]. The Slovak national hockey team made five appearances in the Olympic games, finishing 4th in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]]. The country has 8,280 registered players and is ranked 7th in the [[IIHF World Ranking]] at present. Prior to 2012, the Slovak team [[HC Slovan Bratislava]] participated in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], considered the strongest hockey league in Europe, and the second-best in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |title=World of difference for KHL? |publisher=iihf.com |date=7 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082543/http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |archivedate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nSlovakia hosted the [[2011 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] won the gold medal and [[2019 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] also won the gold medal. Both competitions took place in [[Bratislava]] and [[Ko\u0161ice]].\n\n;Football\n[[File:Tehelne pole.jpg|thumb|right|Football stadium [[Teheln\u00e9 pole]] in Bratislava. Association football is the most popular sport in Slovakia.]]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Slovakia, with over 400,000 registered players. Since 1993, the [[Slovak national football team]] has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. They progressed to the last 16, where they were defeated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. The most notable result was the 3\u20132 victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. In 2016, the [[Slovak national football team]] qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] tournament, under head coach [[J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k (footballer, born 1954)|J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k]]. This helped the team reach their best ever position of 14th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nIn club competitions, only three teams have qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Stage, namely [[MFK Ko\u0161ice]] in [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|1997\u201398]], [[FC Artmedia Bratislava]] in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], and [[M\u0160K \u017dilina]] in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League|2010\u201311]]. FC Artmedia Bratislava has been the most successful team, finishing 3rd at the Group Stage of the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], therefore qualifying for the knockout stage. They remain the only Slovak club that has won a match at the group stage.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Slovakia}}\n* [[Outline of Slovakia]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Julius Bartl et al., ''Slovak History: Chronology & Lexicon.''

The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]] bone (22,800&nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad V\u00e1hom]] near [[Pie\u0161\u0165any]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Z\u00e1kovsk\u00e1, Podkovice, Hubina, and Rado\u0161ina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Central Europe]].\n\n=== Bronze Age ===\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]], the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BCE. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this there period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[\u0160pania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.\n\n[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin<br/>Right: five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]\n\nAfter the disappearance of the \u010cakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.\n\n=== Iron Age ===\n\n==== Hallstatt Period ====\nThe arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sere\u010f]]) and in the hill forts like Molp\u00edr, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. Common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries.\n\nA special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the \"Princes\" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the century before the middle of first millennium BC, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught the interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.\n\n==== La T\u00e8ne Period ====\nFrom around 500&nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Dev\u00edn]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[P\u00fachov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the \"Velkobysterecky\" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].\n\n==== Roman Period ====\n[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]] (178\u2013179 AD)]]\nFrom 2&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Sz\u0151ny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in [[Dev\u00edn Castle]] (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of D\u00fabravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.\n\nNear the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&nbsp;CE during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]]an tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in western and central Slovakia from 8\u20136&nbsp;BCE to 179&nbsp;CE.\n\n=== Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries ===\nIn the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the [[Huns]] began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377&nbsp;AD and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]], and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].\n\nIn 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by [[Samo]], a Frankish merchant.<ref name=\"T\u00f6rt\u00e9neti Kronol\u00f3gia\">{{cite book|last=Benda|first=K\u00e1lm\u00e1n|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gi\u00e1ja ''(\"The Historical Chronology of Hungary\")''|publisher=Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}</ref> After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline<ref>Krist\u00f3, p.30\u201331</ref> but its reign lasted to 804.\n\n=== Slavic states ===\nThe [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of [[Samo]]'s empire in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the 8th century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighbouring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire from 833. The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in 863, during the reign of [[Duke]] [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], and the territorial expansion under [[Duke]] [[Sv\u00e4topluk I]].\n\n=== Great Moravia (830\u2013before 907) ===\n{{Main|Great Moravia}}\n[[File:Cyril a metod zilina.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|A statue of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius]] in [[\u017dilina]].

Upper Hungary, modern Slovakia, became the site of frequent wars between Catholics in the west territory and Protestants in the east, also against Turks, the frontier was on a constant state of military alert and heavily fortified by castles and citadels often manned by Catholic German and Slovak troops on the Habsburg side. By 1648, Slovakia was not spared the [[Counter-Reformation]], which brought the majority of its population from Lutheranism back to [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1655, the printing press at the [[Trnava]] university produced the Jesuit Benedikt Sz\u00f6ll\u0151si's Cantus Catholici, a Catholic hymnal in the Slovak language that reaffirmed links to the earlier works of Cyril and Methodius.\n\nThe [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]], rivalry between [[Austria]] and [[Transylvania]], and the frequent insurrections against the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas.<ref>\"[http://www.slovakiasite.com/history-hungary.php Part of Hungary, Turkish occupation]\".

As the [[Great Turkish War|Turks withdrew]] from Hungary in the late 17th century, the importance of the territory comprising modern Slovakia decreased, although [[Pressburg]] retained its status as the capital of Hungary until 1848, when it was transferred back to Buda.<ref>[http://www.slovakiasite.com/bratislava.php Bratislava].

The Slovaks were not consulted. In 1919, during the chaos following the break-up of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous [[German people|Germans]], Slovaks, Hungarians and  Ruthenians within the newly set borders. The borders were set by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] and [[Treaty of Trianon]]. In the peace following the World War, Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European state. It provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities, at least on paper.\n\nDuring the [[Interwar period]], democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with France, and also with [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] ([[Little Entente]]); however, the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 left East European security open. Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity. There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy, but also culture and educational opportunities. Yet the [[Great Depression]] caused a sharp economic downturn, followed by political disruption and insecurity in Europe.<ref>J.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Polisencky, ''History of Czechoslovakia in Outline'' (Prague: Bohemia International 1947) at 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s Czechoslovakia came under continuous pressure from the [[Revanchism|revisionist]] governments of Germany, Hungary and Poland who used the aggrieved minorities in the country as a useful vehicle. Revision of the borders was called for, as Czechs constituted only 43% of the population. Eventually this pressure led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed the majority ethnic Germans in the [[Sudetenland]], borderlands of Czechoslovakia, to join with Germany. The remaining minorities stepped up their pressures for autonomy and the State became federalised, with Diets in Slovakia and Ruthenia. The remainder of Czechoslovakia was renamed [[Czecho-Slovakia]] and promised a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy. This however, failed to materialise.<ref>''Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1939'' edited by Professor E. L.

Temperature extremes are between {{convert|-41|to|40.3|C}} although temperatures below {{convert|-30|C}} are rare. The weather differs from the mountainous north to the plains in the south.\n\nThe warmest region is [[Bratislava]] and Southern Slovakia where the temperatures may reach {{convert|30|C}} in summer, occasionally to {{convert|39|C}} in [[Hurbanovo]]. During night, the temperatures drop to {{convert|20|C}}. The daily temperatures in winter average in the range of {{convert|-5|C}} to {{convert|10|C}}.

The dry continental air brings in the summer heat and winter frosts. In contrast, oceanic air brings rainfalls and reduces summer temperatures. In the lowlands and valleys there is often fog, especially in winter.\n\nSpring starts with 21 March and is characterised by colder weather with average daily temperature of {{convert|9|C}} in the first weeks and about {{convert|14|C}} in May and {{convert|17|C}} in June. In Slovakia, the weather and climate in the spring is very unstable.\n\nSummer starts on 22 June and is usually characterised by hot weather with daily temperatures exceeding {{convert|30|C}}. July is the warmest month with temperatures up to about {{convert|37|to|40|C}}, especially in regions of southern Slovakia\u2014in the urban area of Kom\u00e1rno, Hurbanovo or \u0160t\u00farovo. Showers or thunderstorms may occur because of the summer monsoon called Medardova kvapka (Medard drop\u201440 days of rain). Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|C}} (less in the mountains).\n\nAutumn in Slovakia starts on 23 September and is mostly characterised by wet weather and wind, although the first weeks can be very warm and sunny. The average temperature in September is around {{convert|14|C}}, in November to {{convert|3|C}}. Late September and early October is a dry and sunny time of year (so-called Indian Summer).\n\nWinter starts on 21 December with temperatures around {{convert|-5|to|-10|C}}. In December and January it is usually snowing, these are the coldest months of the year. At lower altitudes, snow does not stay the whole winter, it changes into the thaw and frost. Winters are colder in the mountains, where the snow usually lasts until March or April and the night temperatures fall to {{convert|-20|C}} and colder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026021233/http://www.slovensko.com/about/weather-climate|archivedate=26 October 2007 |title=Based on the \"Climate\" article from |publisher=www.slovensko.com |accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Biodiversity ==\n{{see also|Endemic Plant Species in Slovakia}}\n[[File:Vysok\u00e9 Tatry, Dolina Bielej vody, cestou od Zelen\u00e9ho plesa na Jah\u0148ac\u00ed \u0161t\u00edt (32).JPG|thumb|left|''[[Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica]]'' in the [[Tatra Mountains]]]]\nSlovakia signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 19 May 1993, and became a party to the convention on 25 August 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124005746/http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|archivedate=24 January 2011 |title=List of Parties |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref> It has subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], which was received by the convention on 2 November 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/sk/sk-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721013840/https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/sk/sk-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2008 |title=National Biodiversity Strategy of Slovakia |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe biodiversity of Slovakia comprises [[animal]]s (such as annelids, arthropods, molluscs, nematodes and vertebrates), [[fungi]] ([[Ascomycota]], [[Basidiomycota]], [[Chytridiomycota]], [[Glomeromycota]] and [[Zygomycota]]), micro-organisms (including [[Mycetozoa]]), and [[plant]]s.

[[\u010cachtice Castle]] was once the home of the world's most prolific female serial killer, the 'Bloody Lady', [[Elizabeth B\u00e1thory]].\n[[File:Bardejov10Slovakia6.JPG|thumb|left|The centre of [[Bardejov]] \u2013 a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]\n\nSlovakia's position in Europe and the country's past (part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Habsburg]] monarchy and [[Czechoslovakia]]) made many cities and towns similar to the cities in the [[Czech Republic]] (such as [[Prague]]), [[Austria]] (such as [[Salzburg]]) or [[Hungary]] (such as [[Budapest]]). A historical center with at least one square has been preserved in many towns. Large historical centers can be found in [[Bratislava]], [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]], [[Ko\u0161ice]], [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica]], [[Levo\u010da]], and [[Trnava]]. Historical centers have been going through restoration in recent years.\n\nHistorical churches can be found in virtually every village and town in Slovakia. Most of them are built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, but there are also many examples of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]], for example [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]], Bardejov and [[Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Kapitula]]. The [[Basilica of St. James, Levo\u010da|Basilica of St. James]] in Levo\u010da with the tallest wood-carved altar in the world and the Church of the Holy Spirit in [[\u017dehra]] with medieval [[fresco]]s are UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The [[St. Martin's Concathedral]] in [[Bratislava]] served as the [[coronation]] church for the Kingdom of Hungary. The oldest sacral buildings in Slovakia stem from the [[Great Moravia]]n period in the 9th century.\n[[File:Jasn\u00e1 Ski Resort - gondola lift Kosodrevina - Chopok (4).jpg|thumb|Cable cars at [[Jasn\u00e1]] in the Tatra Mountains.]]\n\nVery precious structures are the complete wooden churches of northern and northern-eastern Slovakia. Most were built from the 15th century onwards by [[Catholic]]s, [[Lutheran]]s and members of [[Eastern Christianity|eastern-rite]] churches.\n\nTypical souvenirs from Slovakia are dolls dressed in folk costumes, ceramic objects, crystal glass, carved wooden figures, [[\u010drp\u00e1k]]s (wooden pitchers), [[fujara]]s (a [[folk instrument]] on the UNESCO list) and [[vala\u0161ka]]s (a decorated folk hatchet) and above all products made from [[husk|corn husks]] and wire, notably human figures. Souvenirs can be bought in the shops run by the state organisation \u00da\u013dUV (''\u00dastredie \u013eudovej umeleckej v\u00fdroby''\u2014Centre of [[Folk art|Folk Art]] Production). ''Dielo'' shop chain sells works of Slovak artists and craftsmen. These shops are mostly found in towns and cities.\n\nPrices of imported products are generally the same as in the neighbouring countries, whereas prices of local products and services, especially food, are usually lower.\n\n=== Science ===\nThe [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]] has been the most important scientific and research institution in the country since 1953. Slovaks have made notable scientific and technical contributions during the history. Slovakia is currently in the negotiation process of becoming a member of the [[European Space Agency]].

In 2015, Slovakia signed the European Cooperating State Agreement based on which Slovakia committed to the finance entrance programme named PECS (Plan for the European Cooperating States) which serves as preparation for full membership. Slovak research and development organizations can apply for funding of projects regarding space technologies advancement.

The education system consists of elementary school which is divided into two parts, the first grade (age 6\u201310) and the second grade (age 10\u201315) which is finished by taking nationwide testing called Monitor, from Slovak language and math. Parents may apply for social assistance for a child that is studying on an elementary school or a high-school. If approved, the state provides basic study necessities for the child. Schools provide books to all their students with usual exceptions of books for studying a foreign language and books which require taking notes in them, which are mostly present at the first grade of elementary school.\n\nAfter finishing elementary school, students are obliged to take one year in high school.\n\nAfter finishing high school, students can go to university and are highly encouraged to do so. Slovakia has a wide range of universities. The biggest university is [[Comenius University]], established in 1919. Although it's not the first university ever established on Slovak territory, it's the oldest university that is still running. Most universities in Slovakia are public funded, where anyone can apply. Every citizen has a right to free education in public schools.\n\nSlovakia has several privately funded universities, however public universities consistently score better in the ranking than their private counterparts.

[[Ice hockey]] and [[association football|football]] have traditionally been regarded as the most popular sports in Slovakia, though [[tennis]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[whitewater slalom]], [[cycling]] and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] are also popular.\n\n;Ice Hockey\n[[File:Slovakia2010WinterOlympicscelebration2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Slovakia men's national ice hockey team|Slovak national ice hockey team]] celebrating a victory against [[Swedish national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]]]\nOne of the most popular team sports in Slovakia is [[ice hockey]]. Slovakia became a member of the [[IIHF]] on 2 February 1993<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/sk/iihf-home/countries/slovakia.html |title=Slovakia |publisher=Iihf.com |date=2 February 1993 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> and since then has won 4 medals in [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], consisting of 1 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze. The most recent success was a silver medal at the [[2012 IIHF World Championship]] in [[Helsinki]]. The Slovak national hockey team made five appearances in the Olympic games, finishing 4th in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]]. The country has 8,280 registered players and is ranked 7th in the [[IIHF World Ranking]] at present. Prior to 2012, the Slovak team [[HC Slovan Bratislava]] participated in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], considered the strongest hockey league in Europe, and the second-best in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |title=World of difference for KHL? |publisher=iihf.com |date=7 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082543/http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |archivedate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nSlovakia hosted the [[2011 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] won the gold medal and [[2019 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] also won the gold medal. Both competitions took place in [[Bratislava]] and [[Ko\u0161ice]].\n\n;Football\n[[File:Tehelne pole.jpg|thumb|right|Football stadium [[Teheln\u00e9 pole]] in Bratislava. Association football is the most popular sport in Slovakia.]]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Slovakia, with over 400,000 registered players. Since 1993, the [[Slovak national football team]] has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. They progressed to the last 16, where they were defeated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. The most notable result was the 3\u20132 victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. In 2016, the [[Slovak national football team]] qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] tournament, under head coach [[J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k (footballer, born 1954)|J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k]]. This helped the team reach their best ever position of 14th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nIn club competitions, only three teams have qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Stage, namely [[MFK Ko\u0161ice]] in [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|1997\u201398]], [[FC Artmedia Bratislava]] in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], and [[M\u0160K \u017dilina]] in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League|2010\u201311]]. FC Artmedia Bratislava has been the most successful team, finishing 3rd at the Group Stage of the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], therefore qualifying for the knockout stage. They remain the only Slovak club that has won a match at the group stage.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Slovakia}}\n* [[Outline of Slovakia]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Julius Bartl et al., ''Slovak History: Chronology & Lexicon.''
