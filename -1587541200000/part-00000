A disputed [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] border was the main cause of the war, but other issues had also played a role. There had been a series of violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], when India granted asylum to the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]. India initiated a [[Events leading to the Sino-Indian War#Forward policy|Forward Policy]] in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the [[McMahon Line]], the eastern portion of the [[Line of Actual Control]] proclaimed by [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]] in 1959.\n\nUnable to reach political accommodation on disputed territory along the 3,225 kilometre- (2,000 mile-) long Himalayan border,<ref name=\"Indo-China War of 1962\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-prc_1962.htm |title=Indo-China War of 1962 |website=globalseurity.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713235919/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-prc_1962.htm |archivedate=13 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> China launched simultaneous offensives in [[Ladakh]] and across the [[McMahon Line]] on 20 October 1962. Chinese troops outmatched Indian forces in both theatres, capturing [[Rezang La]] in [[Chushul]] in the western theatre, as well as [[Tawang]] in the eastern theatre. The war ended when China declared a [[ceasefire]] on 21 November 1962, and simultaneously announced its withdrawal to its claimed 'Line of Actual Control'.\n\nMuch of the fighting took place in harsh [[mountain warfare|mountain conditions]], entailing large-scale combat at altitudes of over 4,000 metres (14,000 feet).<ref name=\"Calvin\">{{cite web |last=Calvin |first=James Barnard |date=April 1984 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/CJB.htm |title=The China-India Border War |publisher=Marine Corps Command and Staff College |accessdate=15 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111000325/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/CJB.htm |archivedate=11 November 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Sino-Indian War was also noted for the lack of deployment of [[Navy|naval]] and [[Air force|aerial]] assets by both China and India.\n\nAs the [[Sino-Soviet split]] heated up, the [[Soviet Union]] ramped up its efforts to support India, especially with the sale of advanced [[Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG|MiG]] fighter aircraft. Initially, India had not accepted major offers of Soviet hardware, with Nehru fearing it would lead to heavy reliance on imported weapons for defence, but with major weapons being delivered to [[Pakistan]] by countries of the [[Western Bloc]], and in particular refusal by the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to sell advanced weaponry to India because of the political climate (India's inclination towards the Soviets), caused it to turn to the Soviet Union for military hardware.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chari | first1 = P.R. | year = 1979 | title = Indo-Soviet Military Cooperation: A Review | journal = Asian Survey | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 230\u2013244 | jstor = 2643691 | doi = 10.1525/as.1979.19.3.01p0028w }}</ref> It was the first war between China and India and the latter's second armed conflict in the span of less than a year following the [[Annexation of Goa|Indian invasion and annexation of Portuguese Goa]]. After the end of the war, both sides kept forward armed positions and a number of small clashes broke out, but no large-scale fighting ensued.\n\n==Location==\n[[Image:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-Simla British map published in 1909 shows the so-called \"Outer Line\" as India's northern boundary.]]\n[[File:Postal Map of China ,1917.jpg|thumb|right|Postal Map of China published by the Government of China in 1917]]\nChina and India shared a long border, sectioned into three stretches by [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]] (then an Indian [[protectorate]]), and [[Bhutan]], which follows the [[Himalayas]] between [[Burma]] and what was then [[West Pakistan]]. A number of disputed regions lie along this border. At its western end is the [[Aksai Chin]] region, an area the size of [[Switzerland]], that sits between the Chinese autonomous region of [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]] (which China declared as an autonomous region in 1965). The eastern border, between Burma and Bhutan, comprises the present Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (formerly the [[North East Frontier Agency|North-East Frontier Agency]]). Both of these regions were overrun by China in the 1962 conflict.\n\nMost combat took place at high altitudes. The Aksai Chin region is a desert of salt flats around 5,000 metres (16,000 feet) above sea level, and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is mountainous with a number of peaks exceeding 7,000 metres (23,000 feet). The [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|Chinese Army]] had possession of one of the highest ridges in the regions. The high altitude and freezing conditions also caused logistical and welfare difficulties; in past similar conflicts (such as the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War I]]) harsh conditions have caused more casualties than have enemy actions. The Sino-Indian War was no different, with many troops on both sides succumbing to the freezing cold temperatures.<ref name=\"Chushul\"/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|China\u2013India relations|Sino-Indian border dispute}}\n\nThe main cause of the war was a dispute over the [[sovereignty]] of the widely separated [[Aksai Chin]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] border regions. Aksai Chin, claimed by India to belong to [[Kashmir]] and by China to be part of Xinjiang, contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China's construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.\n\n===Aksai Chin===\n{{Main|Aksai Chin}}\n[[Image:Kashmir map big.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional borders of Jammu and Kashmir (CIA map).

The border preferred by British Indian Empire, shown in two-toned purple and pink, included the [[Aksai Chin]] and narrowed down to the [[Yarkand River]].]]\n\nThe western portion of the Sino-Indian boundary originated in 1834, with the conquest of [[Ladakh]] by the armies of Raja [[Gulab Singh]] (Dogra) under the suzerainty of the [[Sikh Empire]]. Following an [[Sino-Sikh War|unsuccessful campaign]] into Tibet, Gulab Singh and the Tibetans signed a [[Treaty of Chushul|treaty in 1842]] agreeing to stick to the \"old, established frontiers\", which were left unspecified.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=24}}<ref name=\"Rubin\">The Sino-Indian Border Disputes, by Alfred P.

British commissioners contacted Chinese officials to negotiate the border, who did not show any interest.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=25\u201326}} The British boundary commissioners fixed the southern end of the boundary at [[Pangong Lake]], but regarded the area north of it till the [[Karakoram Pass]] as ''terra incognita''.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=26}}\n\nThe Maharaja of Kashmir and his officials were keenly aware of the trade routes from Ladakh. Starting from [[Leh]], there were two main routes into Central Asia: one passed through the [[Karakoram Pass]] to [[Shahidulla]] at the foot of the [[Kunlun Mountains]] and went on to [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] through the Kilian and Sanju passes; the other went east via the [[Chang Chenmo Valley]], passed the [[Lingzi Tang Plains]] in the Aksai Chin region, and followed the course of the [[Karakash River]] to join the first route at Shahidulla.{{sfn|Warikoo, India's gateway to Central Asia|2009|pp=1\u20132}} The Maharaja regarded Shahidulla as his northern outpost, in effect treating the Kunlun mountains as the boundary of his domains. His British suzerains were sceptical of such an extended boundary because Shahidulla was 79 miles away from the Karakoram pass and the intervening area was uninhabited. Nevertheless, the Maharaja was allowed to treat Shahidulla as his outpost for more than 20 years.<ref>{{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=57}}: \"Shahidulla was occupied by the Dogras almost from the time they conquered Ladakh.\"</ref>{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=48}} quotes a report by [[Ney Elias]] in 1885: \"He [the Wazir] wants the Maharaja to re-occupy Shahidulla in the Karakash valley. Previous to the rebellions in Eastern Turkistan which broke up Chinese rule there in 1863, the Kashmiris had occupied Shahidulla for nearly 20 years. About 1865 they abandoned it, and in 1868 Shaw and Hayward found it occupied by the Andijani (Kokandi) troops of the late Amir Yakub Beg. In 1873\u201374 Sir D. Forsyth recognised the Amir\u2019s ownership, and recommended the Maharaja\u2019s boundary to be drawn to the north of the Karakash valley as shown in the map accompanying the mission report. This I believe has never been accepted by Kashmir, and the boundary has been left an open question.\"}}{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=48,&nbsp;83}}: An India Office (London) memorandum in 1893 stated: \"Shahidulla has hitherto been regarded as the frontier post on the road from Leh to Yarkand. Lord Kimberley the secretary of state would suggest that the Chinese Government at Peking ... should be intimated...that the Indian authorities, acting on behalf of the Kashmir State, will gladly co-operate with the Chinese authorities in Kashgaria in determining the frontier on the road from Leh to Kashgar. Her Majesty\u2019s Government would, however, demur to any attempt being made by the Kashgarian officials to fix the boundary of the Ladakh State on this road without their previous concurrence being obtained.\"}}\n\n[[File:Johnson-journey-ilchi1865-mapa.jpg|thumb|left|[[W.

The boundary, marked with a thin dot-dashed line, agrees with the 1878 British map.]]\nChinese Turkestan regarded the \"northern branch\" of the Kunlun range with the Kilian and Sanju passes as its southern boundary. Thus the Maharaja's claim was uncontested.<ref>{{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=57}}: \"The southern frontier of Chinese Turkestan was similarly undefined... the Chinese 'considered the Kuen-lun mountains (i.e. the branch of them over which are the Kilian and Sanju passes) as their frontier'...\"</ref>{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=58}} quotes Captain [[Francis Younghusband|Younghusband]]'s report of 1889: \"In the former Chinese occupation the Kuen-Lun Mountains (that is the branch of them over which are the Kilian and Sanju Passes) were always recognised as the frontier, and the country to the south belonged to no one in particular. When the Chinese revolt took place and they were driven from Yarkand, the Kashmir State sent a detachment of troops to Shahidullah and built a fort there. Yakub Beg when he came into power at Yarkand sent some troops, who built a fort at Ali Nazar on the Karakash River at the junction of the roads from the Kilian and Sanju Passes. Shortly afterwards the Kashmiris evacuated the Shahidullah fort after occupying it for about three years, and the Andijanis then took possession of it and occupied it till Yakub Beg's death.\"}} After the 1862 [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]], which saw the expulsion of the Chinese from Turkestan, the Maharaja of Kashmir constructed a small fort at Shahidulla in 1864. The fort was most likely supplied from [[Khotan]], whose ruler was now independent and on friendly terms with Kashmir. When the Khotanese ruler was deposed by the Kashgaria strongman [[Yakub Beg]], the Maharaja was forced to abandon his post in 1867. It was then occupied by Yakub Beg's forces until the end of the Dungan Revolt.<ref>{{harvnb|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Van Eekelen, Indian Foreign Policy and the Border Dispute|2013|p=160}}; {{harvnb|Fisher, Rose & Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=65}}; {{harvnb|Palit, War in High Himalaya|1991|p=29}}</ref>\nIn the intervening period, [[W. H. Johnson]] of [[Survey of India]] was commissioned to survey the Aksai Chin region. While in the course of his work, he was \"invited\" by the Khotanese ruler to visit his capital. After returning, Johnson noted that Khotan's border was at Brinjga, in the Kunlun mountains, and the entire the [[Karakash River|Karakash Valley]] was within the territory of Kashmir. The boundary of Kashmir that he drew, stretching from Sanju Pass to the [[Lanak La|eastern edge of Chang Chenmo Valley]] along the Kunlun mountains, is referred to as the \"[[Johnson Line (boundary)|Johnson Line]]\" (or \"Ardagh-Johnson Line\").{{sfn|Fisher, Rose & Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=116}}{{efn|Some commentators state that Johnson's work was \"severely criticised\" as inaccurate. His boundary line was described as \"patently absurd\", and extending further north than the Indian claim. Johnson is said to have been reprimanded by the British Government for crossing into Khotan without permission and he resigned from the Survey.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/><ref name=\"Noorani\"/> Others state that Johnson's bold explorations were highly commended, and he was rehired a year later at a higher salary. The \"invitation\" from the Khotanese ruler was likely a forcible removal, and the ruler was merely seeking British help in warding off Yakub Beg and the Russian Empire.{{sfn|Mehra, John Lall (Book review)|1991|p=149}}}}\n\nAfter the Chinese reconquered Turkestan in 1878, renaming it [[Xinjiang]], they again reverted to their traditional boundary. By now, the Russian Empire was entrenched in Central Asia, and the British were anxious to avoid a common border with the Russians. After creating the [[Wakhan corridor]] as the buffer in the northwest of Kashmir, they wanted the Chinese to fill out the \"no man's land\" between the Karakoram and Kunlun ranges. Under British (and possibly Russian) encouragement, the Chinese occupied the area up to the [[Yarkand River]] valley (called [[Raskam]]), including Shahidulla, by 1890.{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=65\u201366}} They also erected a boundary pillar at the Karakoram pass by about 1892.<ref>{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=73}}; {{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=63}}</ref> These efforts appear half-hearted. A map provided by Hung Ta-chen, a senior Chinese official at [[St. Petersburgh]], in 1893 showed the boundary of Xinjiang up to Raskam. In the east, it was similar to the Johnson line, placing Aksai Chin in Kashmir territory.<ref>{{harvp|Woodman, Himalayan Frontiers|1970|pp=73,&nbsp;78}}: \"Clarke added that a Chinese map drawn by Hung Ta-chen, Minister in St. Petersburg, confirmed the Johnson alignment showing West Aksai Chin as within British (Kashmir) territory.\"</ref>\n\nBy 1892, the British settled on the policy that their preferred boundary for Kashmir was the \"Indus watershed\", i.e., the water-parting from which waters flow into the Indus river system on one side and into the Tarim basin on the other. In the north, this water-parting was along the Karakoram range. In the east, it was more complicated because the [[Chip Chap River]], [[Galwan River]] and the [[Chang Chenmo River]] flow into the Indus whereas the [[Karakash River]] flows into the Tarim basin.{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=52\u201353,&nbsp;60,&nbsp;69,&nbsp;72}} A boundary alignment along this water-parting was defined by the Viceroy [[Lord Elgin]] and communicated to London. The British government in due course proposed it to China via its envoy Sir [[Claude MacDonald]] in 1899. This boundary, which came to be called the [[Macartney\u2013MacDonald Line]], ceded to China the Aksai Chin plains in the northeast, and the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]] in the north. In return, the British wanted China to cede its 'shadowy suzerainty' on [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]].{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=114\u2013115}}{{efn|The so-called Macartney-MacDonald proposal was precipitated by the crisis over [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]], which was theoretically a vassal state of both China and Kashmir. In 1890, the British invaded Hunza and replaced its ruler, and the Chinese remonstrated. The British wanted the Chinese to cede their suzerainty over Hunza and yet grant rights to cultivate lands outside its boundary. In return for this largesse, they were prepared to cede the Aksai Chin plains, but not Lingzi Tang plains, to China. Scholar Parshotam Mehra has termed it a 'barter'.<ref>{{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=160}}; {{harvp|Palit, War in High Himalaya|1991|pp=32\u201333}}; {{harvp|Van Eekelen, Indian Foreign Policy and the Border Dispute|2013|p=9}}; {{harvp|Fisher, Rose & Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=69}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1911 the [[Xinhai Revolution]] resulted in power shifts in China, and by the end of [[World War I]], the British officially used the Johnson Line.

Graham, [[North-East Frontier Agency|NEFA]] official, which included the Tawang Tract as part of Tibet. Thus, in the last half of the 19th century, it was clear that the British treated the Tawang Tract as part of Tibet. This boundary was confirmed in a 1 June 1912 note from the British General Staff in India, stating that the \"present boundary (demarcated) is south of Tawang, running westwards along the foothills from near Ugalguri to the southern Bhutanese border.\"<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> A 1908 map of The Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam prepared for the Foreign Department of the Government of India, showed the international boundary from Bhutan continuing to the Baroi River, following the Himalayas foothill alignment.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> In 1913, representatives of the UK, China and Tibet attended a conference in [[Shimla|Simla]] regarding the borders between Tibet, China and British India.

The details of the Indo-Tibetan boundary was not revealed to China at the time.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> The foreign secretary of the British Indian government, [[Henry McMahon]], who had drawn up the proposal, decided to bypass the Chinese (although instructed not to by his superiors) and settle the border bilaterally by negotiating directly with Tibet.<ref name=\"Neville_Maxwell\"/> According to later Indian claims, this border was intended to run through the highest ridges of the [[Himalayas]], as the areas south of the Himalayas were traditionally Indian.<ref name=\"VKSingh\">{{cite web |url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2006/562/562-vk-singh.htm |title=562 V.K.

There was \"a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian efforts to undermine Chinese control of Tibet, Indian efforts which were perceived as having the objective of restoring the pre-1949 status quo ante of Tibet\". The other was \"a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian aggression against Chinese territory along the border\". John W. Garver argues that the first perception was incorrect based on the state of the Indian military and polity in the 1960s. It was, nevertheless a major reason for China's going to war. He argues the Chinese perception of Indian aggression to be \"substantially accurate\".<ref name=\"Garver\"/>\n\nThe CIA's declassified POLO documents reveal contemporary American analysis of Chinese motives during the war. According to this document, \"Chinese apparently were motivated to attack by one primary consideration&nbsp;\u2014 their determination to retain the ground on which PLA forces stood in 1962 and to punish the Indians for trying to take that ground\". In general terms, they tried to show the Indians once and for all that China would not acquiesce in a military \"reoccupation\" policy.  Secondary reasons for the attack were to damage Nehru's prestige by exposing Indian weakness and<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/> to expose as traitorous Khrushchev's policy of supporting Nehru against a Communist country.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nAnother factor which might have affected China's decision for war with India was a perceived need to stop a Soviet-U.S.-India encirclement and isolation of China.<ref name=\"Garver\"/> India's relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and United States were both strong at this time, but the Soviets (and Americans) were preoccupied by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and would not interfere with the Sino-Indian War.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> P. B. Sinha suggests that China waited until October to attack because the timing of the war was exactly in parallel with American actions so as to avoid any chance of American or Soviet involvement. Although American buildup of forces around Cuba occurred on the same day as the first major clash at Dhola, and China's buildup between 10 and 20 October appeared to coincide exactly with the United States establishment of a blockade against Cuba which began 20 October, the Chinese probably prepared for this before they could anticipate what would happen in Cuba.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Another explanation is that the confrontation in the Taiwan Strait had eased by then.\n\nGarver argues that the Chinese correctly assessed Indian border policies, particularly the Forward Policy, as attempts for incremental seizure of Chinese-controlled territory. On Tibet, Garver argues that one of the major factors leading to China's decision for war with India was a common tendency of humans \"to attribute others' behavior to interior motivations, while attributing their own behavior to situational factors\". Studies from China published in the 1990s confirmed that the root cause for China going to war with India was the perceived Indian aggression in Tibet, with the forward policy simply catalysing the Chinese reaction.<ref name=\"Garver\"/>\n\nNeville Maxwell and [[Allen S. Whiting (political scientist)|Allen Whiting]] argue that the Chinese leadership believed they were defending territory that was legitimately Chinese, and which was already under de facto Chinese occupation prior to Indian advances, and regarded the Forward Policy as an Indian attempt at creeping annexation.<ref name=\"Garver\"/> Mao Zedong himself compared the Forward Policy to a strategic advance in [[Xiangqi|Chinese chess]]:\n\n{{quote|Their [India's] continually pushing forward is like crossing the [[Xiangqi#Board|Chu Han boundary]]. What should we do? We can also set out a few pawns, on our side of the river. If they don't then cross over, that\u2019s great. If they do cross, we'll eat them up [chess metaphor meaning to take the opponent's pieces]. Of course, we cannot blindly eat them. Lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans. We must pay attention to the situation.<ref name=\"Garver\"/>}}\n\nIndia claims that the motive for the Forward Policy was to cut off the supply routes for Chinese troops posted in NEFA and Aksai Chin.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> According to the official Indian history, the forward policy was continued because of its initial success, as it claimed that Chinese troops withdrew when they encountered areas already occupied by Indian troops. It also claimed that the Forward Policy was having success in cutting out supply lines of Chinese troops who had advanced South of the McMahon Line, though there was no evidence of such advance before the 1962 war. The Forward Policy rested on the assumption that Chinese forces \"were not likely to use force against any of our posts, even if they were in a position to do so\". No serious re-appraisal of this policy took place even when Chinese forces ceased withdrawing.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Nehru's confidence was probably justified given the difficulty for China to supply the area over the high altitude terrain over 5000&nbsp;km (3000 miles) from the more populated areas of China.\n\nChinese policy toward India, therefore, operated on two seemingly contradictory assumptions in the first half of 1961. On the one hand, the Chinese leaders continued to entertain a hope, although a shrinking one, that some opening for talks would appear. On the other hand, they read Indian statements and actions as clear signs that Nehru wanted to talk only about a Chinese withdrawal. Regarding the hope, they were willing to negotiate and tried to prod Nehru into a similar attitude. Regarding Indian intentions, they began to act politically and to build a rationale based on the assumption that Nehru already had become a lackey of imperialism; for this reason he opposed border talks.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nKrishna Menon is reported to have said that when he arrived in Geneva on 6 June 1961 for an international conference in Laos, Chinese officials in Chen Yi's delegation indicated that Chen might be interested in discussing the border dispute with him. At several private\nmeetings with Menon, Chen avoided any discussion of the dispute and Menon surmised that the Chinese wanted him to broach the matter first. He did not, as he was under instructions from Nehru to avoid taking the initiative, leaving the Chinese with the impression\nthat Nehru was unwilling to show any flexibility.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nIn September, the Chinese took a step toward criticising Nehru openly in their commentary. After citing Indonesian and Burmese press criticism of Nehru by name, the Chinese critiqued his moderate remarks on colonialism (People's Daily Editorial, 9 September): \"Somebody at the Non-Aligned Nations Conference advanced the argument that the era of classical colonialism is gone and dead...contrary to facts.\" This was a distortion of Nehru's remarks but appeared close enough to be credible. On the same day, Chen Yi referred to Nehru by implication at the Bulgarian embassy reception: \"Those who attempted to deny history, ignore reality, and distort the truth and who attempted to divert the Conference from its important object have failed to gain support and were isolated.\" On 10 September, they dropped all circumlocutions and criticised him by name in a China Youth article and NCNA report\u2014the first time in almost two years that they had commented extensively on the Prime Minister.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nBy early 1962, the Chinese leadership began to believe that India's intentions were to launch a massive attack against Chinese troops, and that the Indian leadership wanted a war.<ref name = \"Garver\"/><ref name=\"Calvin\"/> In 1961, the Indian army had been sent into [[Goa]], a small region without any other international borders apart from the Indian one, after [[Portugal]] refused to surrender the [[exclave]] [[colony]] to the Indian Union. Although this action met little to no international protest or opposition, China saw it as an example of India's expansionist nature, especially in light of heated rhetoric from Indian politicians. India's Home Minister declared, \"If the Chinese will not vacate the areas occupied by it, India will have to repeat [[Invasion of Goa|what it did in Goa]]. India will certainly drive out the Chinese forces\",<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> while another member of the Indian Congress Party pronounced, \"India will take steps to end [Chinese] aggression on Indian soil just as it ended Portuguese aggression in Goa\".<ref name = \"Patterson\"/> By mid-1962, it was apparent to the Chinese leadership that negotiations had failed to make any progress, and the Forward Policy was increasingly perceived as a grave threat as [[Delhi]] increasingly sent probes deeper into border areas and cut off Chinese supply lines.<ref name = \"Patterson\"/> Foreign Minister [[Chen Yi (communist)|Marshal Chen Yi]] commented at one high-level meeting, \"Nehru's forward policy is a knife.

This was further triggered by [[Mao Zedong]]'s views that: \"The way to world conquest lies through Havana, Accra, and Calcutta\". Calvin believes that Chinese actions show a \"pattern of conservative aims and limited objectives, rather than expansionism\" and blames this particular conflict on India's provocations towards China. Calvin also expresses that China, in the past, has been adamant to gain control over regions to which it has a \"traditional claim\", which triggered the dispute over NEFA and [[Aksai Chin]] and indeed [[Tibet]]. Calvin's assumption, based on the history of the Cold War and the Domino Effect, assumed that China might ultimately try to regain control of everything that it considers as \"traditionally Chinese\" which in its view includes the entirety of South East Asia.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/>\n\nThe [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration was disturbed by what they considered \"blatant Chinese communist aggression against India\". In a May 1963 [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]] meeting, contingency planning on the part of the United States in the event of another Chinese attack on India was discussed. [[Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Robert McNamara]] and General [[Maxwell Taylor]] advised the president to use nuclear weapons should the Americans intervene in such a situation. McNamara stated \"Before any substantial commitment to defend India against China is given, we should recognise that in order to carry out that commitment against any substantial Chinese attack, we would have to use nuclear weapons.

These jets were seen as necessary to beef up Indian air strength so that air-to-air combat could be initiated safely from the Indian perspective (bombing troops was seen as unwise for fear of Chinese retaliatory action). Nehru also asked that these aircraft be manned by American pilots until Indian airmen were trained to replace them. These requests were rejected by the Kennedy Administration (which was involved in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] during most of the Sino-Indian War).

Indians reacted with a surge in patriotism and memorials were erected for many of the Indian troops who died in the war. Arguably, the main lesson India learned from the war was the need to strengthen its own defences and a shift from Nehru's foreign policy with China based on his stated concept of \"brotherhood\".

The new Indian republic had avoided international alignments; by asking for help during the war, India demonstrated its willingness to accept military aid from several sectors.

A disputed [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] border was the main cause of the war, but other issues had also played a role. There had been a series of violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], when India granted asylum to the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]. India initiated a [[Events leading to the Sino-Indian War#Forward policy|Forward Policy]] in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the [[McMahon Line]], the eastern portion of the [[Line of Actual Control]] proclaimed by [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]] in 1959.\n\nUnable to reach political accommodation on disputed territory along the 3,225 kilometre- (2,000 mile-) long Himalayan border,<ref name=\"Indo-China War of 1962\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-prc_1962.htm |title=Indo-China War of 1962 |website=globalseurity.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713235919/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-prc_1962.htm |archivedate=13 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> China launched simultaneous offensives in [[Ladakh]] and across the [[McMahon Line]] on 20 October 1962. Chinese troops outmatched Indian forces in both theatres, capturing [[Rezang La]] in [[Chushul]] in the western theatre, as well as [[Tawang]] in the eastern theatre. The war ended when China declared a [[ceasefire]] on 21 November 1962, and simultaneously announced its withdrawal to its claimed 'Line of Actual Control'.\n\nMuch of the fighting took place in harsh [[mountain warfare|mountain conditions]], entailing large-scale combat at altitudes of over 4,000 metres (14,000 feet).<ref name=\"Calvin\">{{cite web |last=Calvin |first=James Barnard |date=April 1984 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/CJB.htm |title=The China-India Border War |publisher=Marine Corps Command and Staff College |accessdate=15 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111000325/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/CJB.htm |archivedate=11 November 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Sino-Indian War was also noted for the lack of deployment of [[Navy|naval]] and [[Air force|aerial]] assets by both China and India.\n\nAs the [[Sino-Soviet split]] heated up, the [[Soviet Union]] ramped up its efforts to support India, especially with the sale of advanced [[Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG|MiG]] fighter aircraft. Initially, India had not accepted major offers of Soviet hardware, with Nehru fearing it would lead to heavy reliance on imported weapons for defence, but with major weapons being delivered to [[Pakistan]] by countries of the [[Western Bloc]], and in particular refusal by the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to sell advanced weaponry to India because of the political climate (India's inclination towards the Soviets), caused it to turn to the Soviet Union for military hardware.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chari | first1 = P.R. | year = 1979 | title = Indo-Soviet Military Cooperation: A Review | journal = Asian Survey | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 230\u2013244 | jstor = 2643691 | doi = 10.1525/as.1979.19.3.01p0028w }}</ref> It was the first war between China and India and the latter's second armed conflict in the span of less than a year following the [[Annexation of Goa|Indian invasion and annexation of Portuguese Goa]]. After the end of the war, both sides kept forward armed positions and a number of small clashes broke out, but no large-scale fighting ensued.\n\n==Location==\n[[Image:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-Simla British map published in 1909 shows the so-called \"Outer Line\" as India's northern boundary.]]\n[[File:Postal Map of China ,1917.jpg|thumb|right|Postal Map of China published by the Government of China in 1917]]\nChina and India shared a long border, sectioned into three stretches by [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]] (then an Indian [[protectorate]]), and [[Bhutan]], which follows the [[Himalayas]] between [[Burma]] and what was then [[West Pakistan]]. A number of disputed regions lie along this border. At its western end is the [[Aksai Chin]] region, an area the size of [[Switzerland]], that sits between the Chinese autonomous region of [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]] (which China declared as an autonomous region in 1965). The eastern border, between Burma and Bhutan, comprises the present Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (formerly the [[North East Frontier Agency|North-East Frontier Agency]]). Both of these regions were overrun by China in the 1962 conflict.\n\nMost combat took place at high altitudes. The Aksai Chin region is a desert of salt flats around 5,000 metres (16,000 feet) above sea level, and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is mountainous with a number of peaks exceeding 7,000 metres (23,000 feet). The [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|Chinese Army]] had possession of one of the highest ridges in the regions. The high altitude and freezing conditions also caused logistical and welfare difficulties; in past similar conflicts (such as the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War I]]) harsh conditions have caused more casualties than have enemy actions. The Sino-Indian War was no different, with many troops on both sides succumbing to the freezing cold temperatures.<ref name=\"Chushul\"/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|China\u2013India relations|Sino-Indian border dispute}}\n\nThe main cause of the war was a dispute over the [[sovereignty]] of the widely separated [[Aksai Chin]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] border regions. Aksai Chin, claimed by India to belong to [[Kashmir]] and by China to be part of Xinjiang, contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China's construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.\n\n===Aksai Chin===\n{{Main|Aksai Chin}}\n[[Image:Kashmir map big.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional borders of Jammu and Kashmir (CIA map).

The border preferred by British Indian Empire, shown in two-toned purple and pink, included the [[Aksai Chin]] and narrowed down to the [[Yarkand River]].]]\n\nThe western portion of the Sino-Indian boundary originated in 1834, with the conquest of [[Ladakh]] by the armies of Raja [[Gulab Singh]] (Dogra) under the suzerainty of the [[Sikh Empire]]. Following an [[Sino-Sikh War|unsuccessful campaign]] into Tibet, Gulab Singh and the Tibetans signed a [[Treaty of Chushul|treaty in 1842]] agreeing to stick to the \"old, established frontiers\", which were left unspecified.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=24}}<ref name=\"Rubin\">The Sino-Indian Border Disputes, by Alfred P.

British commissioners contacted Chinese officials to negotiate the border, who did not show any interest.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=25\u201326}} The British boundary commissioners fixed the southern end of the boundary at [[Pangong Lake]], but regarded the area north of it till the [[Karakoram Pass]] as ''terra incognita''.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=26}}\n\nThe Maharaja of Kashmir and his officials were keenly aware of the trade routes from Ladakh. Starting from [[Leh]], there were two main routes into Central Asia: one passed through the [[Karakoram Pass]] to [[Shahidulla]] at the foot of the [[Kunlun Mountains]] and went on to [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] through the Kilian and Sanju passes; the other went east via the [[Chang Chenmo Valley]], passed the [[Lingzi Tang Plains]] in the Aksai Chin region, and followed the course of the [[Karakash River]] to join the first route at Shahidulla.{{sfn|Warikoo, India's gateway to Central Asia|2009|pp=1\u20132}} The Maharaja regarded Shahidulla as his northern outpost, in effect treating the Kunlun mountains as the boundary of his domains. His British suzerains were sceptical of such an extended boundary because Shahidulla was 79 miles away from the Karakoram pass and the intervening area was uninhabited. Nevertheless, the Maharaja was allowed to treat Shahidulla as his outpost for more than 20 years.<ref>{{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=57}}: \"Shahidulla was occupied by the Dogras almost from the time they conquered Ladakh.\"</ref>{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=48}} quotes a report by [[Ney Elias]] in 1885: \"He [the Wazir] wants the Maharaja to re-occupy Shahidulla in the Karakash valley. Previous to the rebellions in Eastern Turkistan which broke up Chinese rule there in 1863, the Kashmiris had occupied Shahidulla for nearly 20 years. About 1865 they abandoned it, and in 1868 Shaw and Hayward found it occupied by the Andijani (Kokandi) troops of the late Amir Yakub Beg. In 1873\u201374 Sir D. Forsyth recognised the Amir\u2019s ownership, and recommended the Maharaja\u2019s boundary to be drawn to the north of the Karakash valley as shown in the map accompanying the mission report. This I believe has never been accepted by Kashmir, and the boundary has been left an open question.\"}}{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=48,&nbsp;83}}: An India Office (London) memorandum in 1893 stated: \"Shahidulla has hitherto been regarded as the frontier post on the road from Leh to Yarkand. Lord Kimberley the secretary of state would suggest that the Chinese Government at Peking ... should be intimated...that the Indian authorities, acting on behalf of the Kashmir State, will gladly co-operate with the Chinese authorities in Kashgaria in determining the frontier on the road from Leh to Kashgar. Her Majesty\u2019s Government would, however, demur to any attempt being made by the Kashgarian officials to fix the boundary of the Ladakh State on this road without their previous concurrence being obtained.\"}}\n\n[[File:Johnson-journey-ilchi1865-mapa.jpg|thumb|left|[[W.

The boundary, marked with a thin dot-dashed line, agrees with the 1878 British map.]]\nChinese Turkestan regarded the \"northern branch\" of the Kunlun range with the Kilian and Sanju passes as its southern boundary. Thus the Maharaja's claim was uncontested.<ref>{{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=57}}: \"The southern frontier of Chinese Turkestan was similarly undefined... the Chinese 'considered the Kuen-lun mountains (i.e. the branch of them over which are the Kilian and Sanju passes) as their frontier'...\"</ref>{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=58}} quotes Captain [[Francis Younghusband|Younghusband]]'s report of 1889: \"In the former Chinese occupation the Kuen-Lun Mountains (that is the branch of them over which are the Kilian and Sanju Passes) were always recognised as the frontier, and the country to the south belonged to no one in particular. When the Chinese revolt took place and they were driven from Yarkand, the Kashmir State sent a detachment of troops to Shahidullah and built a fort there. Yakub Beg when he came into power at Yarkand sent some troops, who built a fort at Ali Nazar on the Karakash River at the junction of the roads from the Kilian and Sanju Passes. Shortly afterwards the Kashmiris evacuated the Shahidullah fort after occupying it for about three years, and the Andijanis then took possession of it and occupied it till Yakub Beg's death.\"}} After the 1862 [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]], which saw the expulsion of the Chinese from Turkestan, the Maharaja of Kashmir constructed a small fort at Shahidulla in 1864. The fort was most likely supplied from [[Khotan]], whose ruler was now independent and on friendly terms with Kashmir. When the Khotanese ruler was deposed by the Kashgaria strongman [[Yakub Beg]], the Maharaja was forced to abandon his post in 1867. It was then occupied by Yakub Beg's forces until the end of the Dungan Revolt.<ref>{{harvnb|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Van Eekelen, Indian Foreign Policy and the Border Dispute|2013|p=160}}; {{harvnb|Fisher, Rose & Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=65}}; {{harvnb|Palit, War in High Himalaya|1991|p=29}}</ref>\nIn the intervening period, [[W. H. Johnson]] of [[Survey of India]] was commissioned to survey the Aksai Chin region. While in the course of his work, he was \"invited\" by the Khotanese ruler to visit his capital. After returning, Johnson noted that Khotan's border was at Brinjga, in the Kunlun mountains, and the entire the [[Karakash River|Karakash Valley]] was within the territory of Kashmir. The boundary of Kashmir that he drew, stretching from Sanju Pass to the [[Lanak La|eastern edge of Chang Chenmo Valley]] along the Kunlun mountains, is referred to as the \"[[Johnson Line (boundary)|Johnson Line]]\" (or \"Ardagh-Johnson Line\").{{sfn|Fisher, Rose & Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=116}}{{efn|Some commentators state that Johnson's work was \"severely criticised\" as inaccurate. His boundary line was described as \"patently absurd\", and extending further north than the Indian claim. Johnson is said to have been reprimanded by the British Government for crossing into Khotan without permission and he resigned from the Survey.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/><ref name=\"Noorani\"/> Others state that Johnson's bold explorations were highly commended, and he was rehired a year later at a higher salary. The \"invitation\" from the Khotanese ruler was likely a forcible removal, and the ruler was merely seeking British help in warding off Yakub Beg and the Russian Empire.{{sfn|Mehra, John Lall (Book review)|1991|p=149}}}}\n\nAfter the Chinese reconquered Turkestan in 1878, renaming it [[Xinjiang]], they again reverted to their traditional boundary. By now, the Russian Empire was entrenched in Central Asia, and the British were anxious to avoid a common border with the Russians. After creating the [[Wakhan corridor]] as the buffer in the northwest of Kashmir, they wanted the Chinese to fill out the \"no man's land\" between the Karakoram and Kunlun ranges. Under British (and possibly Russian) encouragement, the Chinese occupied the area up to the [[Yarkand River]] valley (called [[Raskam]]), including Shahidulla, by 1890.{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=65\u201366}} They also erected a boundary pillar at the Karakoram pass by about 1892.<ref>{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=73}}; {{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=63}}</ref> These efforts appear half-hearted. A map provided by Hung Ta-chen, a senior Chinese official at [[St. Petersburgh]], in 1893 showed the boundary of Xinjiang up to Raskam. In the east, it was similar to the Johnson line, placing Aksai Chin in Kashmir territory.<ref>{{harvp|Woodman, Himalayan Frontiers|1970|pp=73,&nbsp;78}}: \"Clarke added that a Chinese map drawn by Hung Ta-chen, Minister in St. Petersburg, confirmed the Johnson alignment showing West Aksai Chin as within British (Kashmir) territory.\"</ref>\n\nBy 1892, the British settled on the policy that their preferred boundary for Kashmir was the \"Indus watershed\", i.e., the water-parting from which waters flow into the Indus river system on one side and into the Tarim basin on the other. In the north, this water-parting was along the Karakoram range. In the east, it was more complicated because the [[Chip Chap River]], [[Galwan River]] and the [[Chang Chenmo River]] flow into the Indus whereas the [[Karakash River]] flows into the Tarim basin.{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=52\u201353,&nbsp;60,&nbsp;69,&nbsp;72}} A boundary alignment along this water-parting was defined by the Viceroy [[Lord Elgin]] and communicated to London. The British government in due course proposed it to China via its envoy Sir [[Claude MacDonald]] in 1899. This boundary, which came to be called the [[Macartney\u2013MacDonald Line]], ceded to China the Aksai Chin plains in the northeast, and the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]] in the north. In return, the British wanted China to cede its 'shadowy suzerainty' on [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]].{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=114\u2013115}}{{efn|The so-called Macartney-MacDonald proposal was precipitated by the crisis over [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]], which was theoretically a vassal state of both China and Kashmir. In 1890, the British invaded Hunza and replaced its ruler, and the Chinese remonstrated. The British wanted the Chinese to cede their suzerainty over Hunza and yet grant rights to cultivate lands outside its boundary.

Fire was not exchanged, but Nehru said to the media that the Indian Army had instructions to \"free our territory\" and the troops had been given discretion to use force.<ref name=\"Garver\"/> On 11 September, it was decided that \"all forward posts and patrols were given permission to fire on any armed Chinese who entered Indian territory\".<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/>\n\nThe operation to occupy Thag La was flawed in that Nehru's directives were unclear and it got underway very slowly because of this.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/><ref name=\"Neville_Maxwell\"/> In addition to this, each man had to carry {{convert|35|kg|lb}} over the long trek and this severely slowed down the reaction.<ref name=\"NamkaChu\"/> By the time the Indian battalion reached the point of conflict, Chinese units controlled both banks of the [[Namka Chu]] River.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> On 20 September, Chinese troops threw grenades at Indian troops and a firefight developed, triggering a long series of skirmishes for the rest of September.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/><ref name=\"NamkaChu\"/>\n\nSome Indian troops, including [[John Dalvi|Brigadier Dalvi]] who commanded the forces at Thag La, were also concerned that the territory they were fighting for was not strictly territory that \"we should have been convinced was ours\".<ref name=\"Noorani3\"/> According to [[Neville Maxwell]], even members of the Indian defence ministry were categorically concerned with the validity of the fighting in Thag La.<ref name=\"Neville_Maxwell\"/>\n\nOn 4 October, Kaul assigned some troops to secure regions south of the Thag La Ridge.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> Kaul decided to first secure Yumtso La, a strategically important position, before re-entering the lost Dhola post.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Kaul had then realised that the attack would be desperate and the Indian government tried to stop an escalation into all-out war. Indian troops marching to Thag La had suffered in the previously unexperienced conditions; two [[Gurkha]] soldiers died of [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name=\"NamkaChu\"/>\n\nOn 10 October, an Indian [[Rajput]] patrol of 50 troops to Yumtso La were met by an emplaced Chinese position of some 1,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> Indian troops were in no position for battle, as Yumtso La was 16,000 feet (4,900 m) above sea level and Kaul did not plan on having artillery support for the troops.<ref name=\"NamkaChu\"/> The Chinese troops opened fire on the Indians under their belief that they were north of the McMahon Line. The Indians were surrounded by Chinese positions which used [[mortar fire]]. They managed to hold off the first Chinese assault, inflicting heavy casualties.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/>\n\nAt this point, the Indian troops were in a position to push the Chinese back with mortar and machine gun fire. Brigadier Dalvi opted not to fire, as it would mean decimating the [[Rajput]] who were still in the area of the Chinese regrouping. They helplessly watched the Chinese ready themselves for a second assault.<ref name=\"NamkaChu\"/> In the second Chinese assault, the Indians began their retreat, realising the situation was hopeless. The Indian patrol suffered 25 casualties, and the Chinese 33. The Chinese troops held their fire as the Indians retreated, and then buried the Indian dead with military honours, as witnessed by the retreating soldiers. This was the first occurrence of heavy fighting in the war.<ref name=\"Calvin\" />\n\nThis attack had grave implications for India and Nehru tried to solve the issue, but by 18 October, it was clear that the Chinese were preparing for an attack, with a massive troop buildup.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> A long line of mules and porters had also been observed supporting the buildup and reinforcement of positions south of the Thag La Ridge.<ref name=\"NamkaChu\"/>\n\n==Chinese and Indian preparations==\n\n===Chinese motives===\nTwo of the major factors leading up to China's eventual conflicts with Indian troops were India's stance on the disputed borders and perceived Indian subversion in [[Tibet]]. There was \"a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian efforts to undermine Chinese control of Tibet, Indian efforts which were perceived as having the objective of restoring the pre-1949 status quo ante of Tibet\". The other was \"a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian aggression against Chinese territory along the border\". John W. Garver argues that the first perception was incorrect based on the state of the Indian military and polity in the 1960s. It was, nevertheless a major reason for China's going to war. He argues the Chinese perception of Indian aggression to be \"substantially accurate\".<ref name=\"Garver\"/>\n\nThe CIA's declassified POLO documents reveal contemporary American analysis of Chinese motives during the war. According to this document, \"Chinese apparently were motivated to attack by one primary consideration&nbsp;\u2014 their determination to retain the ground on which PLA forces stood in 1962 and to punish the Indians for trying to take that ground\". In general terms, they tried to show the Indians once and for all that China would not acquiesce in a military \"reoccupation\" policy.  Secondary reasons for the attack were to damage Nehru's prestige by exposing Indian weakness and<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/> to expose as traitorous Khrushchev's policy of supporting Nehru against a Communist country.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nAnother factor which might have affected China's decision for war with India was a perceived need to stop a Soviet-U.S.-India encirclement and isolation of China.<ref name=\"Garver\"/> India's relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and United States were both strong at this time, but the Soviets (and Americans) were preoccupied by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and would not interfere with the Sino-Indian War.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> P. B. Sinha suggests that China waited until October to attack because the timing of the war was exactly in parallel with American actions so as to avoid any chance of American or Soviet involvement. Although American buildup of forces around Cuba occurred on the same day as the first major clash at Dhola, and China's buildup between 10 and 20 October appeared to coincide exactly with the United States establishment of a blockade against Cuba which began 20 October, the Chinese probably prepared for this before they could anticipate what would happen in Cuba.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Another explanation is that the confrontation in the Taiwan Strait had eased by then.\n\nGarver argues that the Chinese correctly assessed Indian border policies, particularly the Forward Policy, as attempts for incremental seizure of Chinese-controlled territory. On Tibet, Garver argues that one of the major factors leading to China's decision for war with India was a common tendency of humans \"to attribute others' behavior to interior motivations, while attributing their own behavior to situational factors\". Studies from China published in the 1990s confirmed that the root cause for China going to war with India was the perceived Indian aggression in Tibet, with the forward policy simply catalysing the Chinese reaction.<ref name=\"Garver\"/>\n\nNeville Maxwell and [[Allen S. Whiting (political scientist)|Allen Whiting]] argue that the Chinese leadership believed they were defending territory that was legitimately Chinese, and which was already under de facto Chinese occupation prior to Indian advances, and regarded the Forward Policy as an Indian attempt at creeping annexation.<ref name=\"Garver\"/> Mao Zedong himself compared the Forward Policy to a strategic advance in [[Xiangqi|Chinese chess]]:\n\n{{quote|Their [India's] continually pushing forward is like crossing the [[Xiangqi#Board|Chu Han boundary]]. What should we do? We can also set out a few pawns, on our side of the river. If they don't then cross over, that\u2019s great. If they do cross, we'll eat them up [chess metaphor meaning to take the opponent's pieces]. Of course, we cannot blindly eat them. Lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans. We must pay attention to the situation.<ref name=\"Garver\"/>}}\n\nIndia claims that the motive for the Forward Policy was to cut off the supply routes for Chinese troops posted in NEFA and Aksai Chin.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> According to the official Indian history, the forward policy was continued because of its initial success, as it claimed that Chinese troops withdrew when they encountered areas already occupied by Indian troops. It also claimed that the Forward Policy was having success in cutting out supply lines of Chinese troops who had advanced South of the McMahon Line, though there was no evidence of such advance before the 1962 war. The Forward Policy rested on the assumption that Chinese forces \"were not likely to use force against any of our posts, even if they were in a position to do so\". No serious re-appraisal of this policy took place even when Chinese forces ceased withdrawing.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Nehru's confidence was probably justified given the difficulty for China to supply the area over the high altitude terrain over 5000&nbsp;km (3000 miles) from the more populated areas of China.\n\nChinese policy toward India, therefore, operated on two seemingly contradictory assumptions in the first half of 1961. On the one hand, the Chinese leaders continued to entertain a hope, although a shrinking one, that some opening for talks would appear. On the other hand, they read Indian statements and actions as clear signs that Nehru wanted to talk only about a Chinese withdrawal. Regarding the hope, they were willing to negotiate and tried to prod Nehru into a similar attitude. Regarding Indian intentions, they began to act politically and to build a rationale based on the assumption that Nehru already had become a lackey of imperialism; for this reason he opposed border talks.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nKrishna Menon is reported to have said that when he arrived in Geneva on 6 June 1961 for an international conference in Laos, Chinese officials in Chen Yi's delegation indicated that Chen might be interested in discussing the border dispute with him. At several private\nmeetings with Menon, Chen avoided any discussion of the dispute and Menon surmised that the Chinese wanted him to broach the matter first. He did not, as he was under instructions from Nehru to avoid taking the initiative, leaving the Chinese with the impression\nthat Nehru was unwilling to show any flexibility.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nIn September, the Chinese took a step toward criticising Nehru openly in their commentary. After citing Indonesian and Burmese press criticism of Nehru by name, the Chinese critiqued his moderate remarks on colonialism (People's Daily Editorial, 9 September): \"Somebody at the Non-Aligned Nations Conference advanced the argument that the era of classical colonialism is gone and dead...contrary to facts.\" This was a distortion of Nehru's remarks but appeared close enough to be credible. On the same day, Chen Yi referred to Nehru by implication at the Bulgarian embassy reception: \"Those who attempted to deny history, ignore reality, and distort the truth and who attempted to divert the Conference from its important object have failed to gain support and were isolated.\" On 10 September, they dropped all circumlocutions and criticised him by name in a China Youth article and NCNA report\u2014the first time in almost two years that they had commented extensively on the Prime Minister.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nBy early 1962, the Chinese leadership began to believe that India's intentions were to launch a massive attack against Chinese troops, and that the Indian leadership wanted a war.<ref name = \"Garver\"/><ref name=\"Calvin\"/> In 1961, the Indian army had been sent into [[Goa]], a small region without any other international borders apart from the Indian one, after [[Portugal]] refused to surrender the [[exclave]] [[colony]] to the Indian Union. Although this action met little to no international protest or opposition, China saw it as an example of India's expansionist nature, especially in light of heated rhetoric from Indian politicians. India's Home Minister declared, \"If the Chinese will not vacate the areas occupied by it, India will have to repeat [[Invasion of Goa|what it did in Goa]]. India will certainly drive out the Chinese forces\",<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> while another member of the Indian Congress Party pronounced, \"India will take steps to end [Chinese] aggression on Indian soil just as it ended Portuguese aggression in Goa\".<ref name = \"Patterson\"/> By mid-1962, it was apparent to the Chinese leadership that negotiations had failed to make any progress, and the Forward Policy was increasingly perceived as a grave threat as [[Delhi]] increasingly sent probes deeper into border areas and cut off Chinese supply lines.<ref name = \"Patterson\"/> Foreign Minister [[Chen Yi (communist)|Marshal Chen Yi]] commented at one high-level meeting, \"Nehru's forward policy is a knife. He wants to put it in our heart. We cannot close our eyes and await death.\"<ref name = \"Garver\"/> The Chinese leadership believed that their restraint on the issue was being perceived by India as weakness, leading to continued provocations, and that a major counterblow was needed to stop perceived Indian aggression.<ref name=\"Garver\"/>\n\nXu Yan, prominent Chinese military historian and professor at the PLA's [[PLA National Defense University|National Defense University]], gives an account of the Chinese leadership's decision to go to war. By late September 1962, the Chinese leadership had begun to reconsider their policy of \"armed coexistence\", which had failed to address their concerns with the forward policy and Tibet, and consider a large, decisive strike.<ref name=\"Garver\"/> On 22 September 1962, the ''[[People's Daily]]'' published an article which claimed that \"the Chinese people were burning with 'great indignation' over the Indian actions on the border and that New Delhi could not 'now say that warning was not served in advance'.\"<ref name=\"Peoples Daily\">''[[People's Daily]]'', 22 September 1962 issue, pp. 1</ref><ref name=\"foia_cia_polo09\">{{citation |title=The Sino-Indian Border Dispute, Section 3: 1961\u201362 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |date=5 May 1964 |url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/CPE/POLO/polo-09.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701042636/http://www.foia.cia.gov/CPE/POLO/polo-09.pdf |archive-date=1 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Military planning===\nThe Indian side was confident war would not be triggered and made little preparations.

[[Lin Biao]] reported that PLA intelligence units had determined that Indian units might assault Chinese positions at Thag La on 10 October (Operation Leghorn).

A main assault would be launched in the eastern sector, which would be coordinated with a smaller assault in the western sector.

He concluded that the opposing Indian troops were among India's best, and to achieve victory would require deploying crack troops and relying on [[force concentration]] to achieve decisive victory.

Some skirmishes also took place at the [[Nathula|Nathula Pass]], which is in the Indian [[Constituent state|state]] of [[Sikkim]] (an Indian [[protectorate]] at that time).

He was categorically concerned about a mutual twenty kilometre (12 mile) withdrawal after \"40 or 60 kilometres (25 or 40 miles) of blatant military aggression\". He wanted the creation of a larger immediate buffer zone and thus resist the possibility of a repeat offensive. Zhou's 4 November reply repeated his 1959 offer to return to the [[McMahon Line]] in NEFA and the Chinese traditionally claimed [[MacDonald Line]] in Aksai Chin. Facing Chinese forces maintaining themselves on Indian soil and trying to avoid political pressure, the Indian parliament announced a national emergency and passed a resolution which stated their intent to \"drive out the aggressors from the sacred soil of India\". The United States and the United Kingdom supported India's response.

This was further triggered by [[Mao Zedong]]'s views that: \"The way to world conquest lies through Havana, Accra, and Calcutta\". Calvin believes that Chinese actions show a \"pattern of conservative aims and limited objectives, rather than expansionism\" and blames this particular conflict on India's provocations towards China. Calvin also expresses that China, in the past, has been adamant to gain control over regions to which it has a \"traditional claim\", which triggered the dispute over NEFA and [[Aksai Chin]] and indeed [[Tibet]]. Calvin's assumption, based on the history of the Cold War and the Domino Effect, assumed that China might ultimately try to regain control of everything that it considers as \"traditionally Chinese\" which in its view includes the entirety of South East Asia.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/>\n\nThe [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration was disturbed by what they considered \"blatant Chinese communist aggression against India\".

[[Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Robert McNamara]] and General [[Maxwell Taylor]] advised the president to use nuclear weapons should the Americans intervene in such a situation. McNamara stated \"Before any substantial commitment to defend India against China is given, we should recognise that in order to carry out that commitment against any substantial Chinese attack, we would have to use nuclear weapons.

Kennedy with a letter from Galbraith dated 9 November 1962.]]\nThe aftermath of the war saw sweeping changes in the Indian military to prepare it for similar conflicts in the future, and placed pressure on Indian prime minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who was seen as responsible for failing to anticipate the Chinese attack on India. Indians reacted with a surge in patriotism and memorials were erected for many of the Indian troops who died in the war. Arguably, the main lesson India learned from the war was the need to strengthen its own defences and a shift from Nehru's foreign policy with China based on his stated concept of \"brotherhood\". Because of India's inability to anticipate Chinese aggression, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] faced harsh criticism from government officials, for having promoted pacifist relations with China.<ref name=\"Neville_Maxwell\"/> Indian President [[Radhakrishnan]] said that Nehru's government was naive and negligent about preparations, and Nehru admitted his failings.<ref name=BlackNovember /> According to Inder Malhotra, a former editor of ''The Times of India'' and a commentator for ''The Indian Express'', Indian politicians invested more effort in removing Defence Minister [[Krishna Menon]] than in actually waging war.<ref name=\"BlackNovember\" /> Krishna Menon's favoritism weakened the Indian Army, and national morale dimmed.<ref name=\"BlackNovember\"/> The public saw the war as a political and military debacle.<ref name=\"BlackNovember\"/> Under American advice (by American envoy [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] who made and ran American policy on the war as all other top policy makers in the US were absorbed in coincident Cuban Missile Crisis<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/whoever-has-seen-aksai-chin-as-i-have-would-want-someone-else-to-have-it/3634/0 |title=Whoever has seen Aksai Chin, as I have, would want someone else to have it |newspaper=Indian Express |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=25 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307023311/http://www.indianexpress.com/news/whoever-has-seen-aksai-chin-as-i-have-would-want-someone-else-to-have-it/3634/0 |archivedate=7 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>) Indians refrained, not according to the best choices available, from using the [[Indian air force]] to beat back the Chinese advances. The CIA later revealed that at that time the Chinese had neither the fuel nor runways long enough for using their air force effectively in Tibet.<ref name=\"BlackNovember\"/> Indians in general became highly sceptical of China and its [[Chinese Army|military]]. Many Indians view the war as a betrayal of India's attempts at establishing a long-standing peace with China and started to question the once popular \"Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai\" (meaning \"Indians and Chinese are brothers\"). The war also put an end to Nehru's earlier hopes that India and China would form a strong Asian Axis to counteract the increasing influence of the [[Cold War]] bloc superpowers.<ref name=\"Garver\"/>\n\nThe unpreparedness of the army was blamed on [[Minister of Defence (India)|Defence Minister]] [[V. K. Krishna Menon|Menon]], who resigned his government post to allow for someone who might modernise India's military further. India's policy of weaponisation via indigenous sources and self-sufficiency was thus cemented. Sensing a weakened army, [[Pakistan]], a close ally of China, began a policy of provocation against India by [[Operation Gibraltar|infiltrating]] [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and ultimately triggering the [[Second Kashmir War]] with India in 1965 and [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971]].

This war united the country as never before. India got 32,000 square miles (8.3 million hectares, 83,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of disputed territory even if it felt that NEFA was hers all along. The new Indian republic had avoided international alignments; by asking for help during the war, India demonstrated its willingness to accept military aid from several sectors. And, finally, India recognised the serious weaknesses in its army. It would more than double its military manpower in the next two years and it would work hard to resolve the military's training and logistic problems to later become [[List of countries by size of armed forces|the second-largest army in the world]].

In late 1967, there were two incidents in which both countries exchanged fire in Sikkim. The first one was dubbed the \"Nathu La incident\", and the other being \"[[Chola incident]]\" in which advancing Chinese forces were forced to withdraw from Sikkim, then a protectorate of India and later a state of India after annexation in 1975. In the [[1987 Sino-Indian skirmish]], both sides showed military restraint and it was a bloodless conflict.

Ahmed bin Said threw 12,000 men under the command of Kandhala bin Saif Al Suwaidi in an attack on Ras Al Khaimah which was met at Buraimi by 14,000 men of the Al Qasimi and [[Na'im]]. They were defeated, leading the garrison at [[Khor Fakkan]], besieged by Ahmed bin Said, to surrender. He went on to take Khasab and then blockaded Ras Al Khaimah, [[Rams (Ras Al Khaimah)|Rams]], Jazirat Al Hamra, Fasht and [[Sharjah]]. This led to all but Ras Al Khaimah suing for peace in 1763. The Sheikhs of Ras Al Khaimah submitted in 1771, but in 1775 revolted and re-took the towns on the West and East coast, consolidating their gains under the weak rule of Sultan bin Ahmed bin Saeed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Arabian Gulf Intelligence|last=|first=|publisher=Oleander Press|year=1985|isbn=9781909349964|location=Cambridge|pages=6-8}}</ref> This longstanding war between the Al Qasimi and Muscat pitted them naturally against Muscat's ally \u2013 Britain.\n\nIn the aftermath of a series of attacks in 1808 off the coast of [[Sindh]] involving 50 Qasimi raiders and following the 1809 monsoon season, the British authorities in India decided to make a significant show of force against the Al Qasimi, in an effort not only to destroy their larger bases and as many ships as could be found, but also to counteract French encouragement of them from their embassies in Persia and Oman.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 5, 1808&ndash;1811|last=James|first=William|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|year=2002|isbn=0-85177-909-3|location=|page=204|chapter=|authorlink=William James (naval historian)|origyear=1827}}</ref> The British mounted the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809, in which the Al Qasimi fleet was largely destroyed.

Ahmed bin Said threw 12,000 men under the command of Kandhala bin Saif Al Suwaidi in an attack on Ras Al Khaimah which was met at Buraimi by 14,000 men of the Al Qasimi and [[Na'im]]. They were defeated, leading the garrison at [[Khor Fakkan]], besieged by Ahmed bin Said, to surrender. He went on to take Khasab and then blockaded Ras Al Khaimah, [[Rams (Ras Al Khaimah)|Rams]], Jazirat Al Hamra, Fasht and [[Sharjah]]. This led to all but Ras Al Khaimah suing for peace in 1763.

United]] and [[United States men's national soccer team|US national team]] striker [[Roy Lassiter]] played for Laredo in their 2\u20131 loss to [[DFW Tornados]], but did not get on the score sheet.<ref>[http://www.uslsoccer.com/stats/2004/1077209.html United Soccer Leagues (USL)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119043358/http://uslsoccer.com/stats/2004/1077209.html |date=2009-01-19 }}</ref> He also played in a 1\u20131 draw against UNAM.\n\n===2005===\nLaredo's first true competitive season was 2005, and the team proved to be a formidable opponent almost immediately. They won their opening game 3\u20130 over [[Austin Lightning]], and followed that with three wins in their next four games, before being brought back down to earth with a bump following a 7\u20130 hammering at the hands of the traditional regional powerhouses, [[El Paso Patriots]]. The Heat rallied to register three more wins in June, including two hugely impressive wins on their trip to Tennessee, with a 5\u20130 thumping of [[Nashville Metros]] and a 5\u20131 drubbing of [[Memphis Express (soccer)|Memphis Express]]. Despite losing three of their last four games down the home stretch, including back-to-back losses away at the [[New Orleans Shell Shockers]], Laredo held off [[Austin Lightning]] to finish second in the Mid-South Division and claim a playoff spot at their first serious attempt. At the Southern Conference playoff tournament, Laredo dispatched Southeast Division champions [[Cocoa Expos]] 2\u20131 in the semifinals, but lost to El Paso in the final. Dionisio Infante was Laredo's top scorer for the season, with 8 goals, while both Hector Vallejo-Medina and Juan Ibarra contributed 5 assists.\n\n===2006===\nLaredo's emergence as a true PDL powerhouse began in 2006. They began their season with a 9-game winning streak, proving to be a dominant force both at home and on the road: they scored an 88th-minute winner to beat [[Austin Lightning]] 4\u20133 on the opening day, enjoyed a comfortable 3\u20130 win over [[DFW Tornados]], came from behind to beat traditional rivals [[El Paso Patriots]] 3\u20132, and beat Austin for a second time, 4\u20131 on the road in mid-June. Laredo's only losses came at the hands of DFW and El Paso, the latter a comfortable 3\u20130 win for the Patriots on their home turf in the final game of the season, but by that time Laredo had already wrapped up their first divisional title by 16 points from the Tornados, and were into the playoffs for the second straight year. They won their conference semifinal 3\u20132 over [[Augusta Fireball]] with two late goals from substitute Arnoldo Presas-Delgado, and secured their first ever conference championship by beating [[Bradenton Academics]] 2\u20131 with an 89th-minute winner from Dionisio Infante. Their first trip to the national stage saw them taking on Eastern Conference champions [[Westchester Flames]]; with yet another dogged performance, Laredo came from two goals down to win 3\u20132 with Dionisio Infante scoring an 89th-minute winner for the second game in a row. The Heat hosted the 2006 PDL Championship Game, which was broadcast live on [[Fox Soccer Channel]], where they faced Central Conference champions [[Michigan Bucks]]. Unfortunately for Laredo, and despite the support of 7,000 home fans, lightning couldn't strike three times, and Michigan held on to win 2\u20131 and take their first PDL title. Nevertheless, reaching the national final was a monumental feat for a second year franchise, and boded well for the future. Hector Vallejo-Medina was Laredo's top scorer, with 7 goals, and Steve Su contributed 6 assists.\n\n===2007===\nLaredo retained their Mid South Division title in style in 2007, losing just two regular season games all year long. Despite never really overwhelming any of their opponents in games, Laredo were dogged and determined, grinding our comfortable 1\u20130 and 2\u20130 wins over their opponents, doing just enough to remain consistent all year. They began the season strongly, with a 3\u20130 win over [[Baton Rouge Capitals]] on the opening day of the season, and despite dropping points to El Paso, New Orleans and Austin, remained at the top end of the divisional standings throughout May. They beat [[DFW Tornados]] 4\u20131 at home on June 1, kick-starting their season into action; they lost just one more game, a tight 1\u20130 decision on the road against [[El Paso Patriots]], but were dominant elsewhere, closing the season with four straight wins and a bizarre 3\u20133 tie with [[Mississippi Brilla]], who fought back from being 3\u20130 down at half time and equalized with an 87th-minute penalty kick! They finished the regular season 8 points clear of El Paso at the top of the Mid South Division standings, and hosted the Southern Conference playoffs for a second year. After comfortably dispatching [[Central Florida Kraze]] 4\u20130 on the conference semifinal, they then beat Southeast Division champions [[Carolina Dynamo]] to retain their Conference championship and book their place in the national Final Four for the second straight year. Their opponents there were Western Conference champs [[Fresno Fuego]], who proved to be dogged competition; Laredo eventually scored an 84th-minute winner through teenager [[Felix Garcia]], and held out for a 1\u20130 win to take their place in the 2007 PDL Championship Game. The game, which Laredo hosted, saw them facing off again against Central Conference champions [[Michigan Bucks]], the first time in PDL history that the same teams had qualified for consecutive championship games. After a tense 0\u20130 tie through regular time and extra time, Laredo sent their 6,640 home fans crazy by winning the penalty shoot-out 4\u20133. [[Felix Garcia]] struck the winning kick past Bucks keeper [[Steve Clark (soccer)|Steve Clark]]. The shootout was notable for the injury to Michigan striker Kenny Uziogwe who, after taking a penalty kick which was saved by Laredo keeper Ryan Cooper, immediately collapsed in agony with cramp; however, when the referee called the penalty back due to Cooper being off his line, Uziogwe was unable to continue, and despite receiving treatment for 10 minutes on the field, had to be substituted during the shoot-out.\n\n===2008===\nAs 2-time PDL Championship finalists and reigning national champions, Laredo were expected to be competitive in 2008, and did not disappoint. They started strongly, with two ties and a win in their opening three games, but were unexpectedly beaten 1\u20130 by expansion team [[Austin Aztex U23]], who proved to be their regular-season nemesis. Laredo stuttered slightly in June, having to come from behind to tie 3\u20133 with [[New Orleans Shell Shockers]], fighting back strongly to register three consecutive three goal victories, but then losing twice in two days to the [[El Paso Patriots]], ensuring that the fight for the playoff spots would be a close one themselves, El Paso and Austin. Their second loss of the season to the Aztex, a 1\u20133 decision in which head coach Israel Collazo was sent off after the final whistle, seemed to light a fire under the Heat, who rallied to finish the regular season with three straight wins. They annihilated [[Houston Leones]] 7\u20130, and beat the [[New Orleans Shell Shockers]] 4\u20130 on the final day with a hat trick from [[Felix Garcia]] to secure second place in the division by one point from El Paso, squeaking into the playoffs by the narrowest of margins. Laredo traveled to Florida for the Southern conference tournament; they beat [[Central Florida Kraze]] 2\u20131 in the semifinal, and exacted sweet revenge over [[Austin Aztex U23]] by beating them 3\u20131 in the conference championship game, thereby securing their third straight title, and their third consecutive trip to the national final four. Their opponents in the semifinal were the surprise Eastern champs, [[Reading Rage]], who they beat 2\u20130 to advance to their third straight PDL Championship Game, and in doing so became the first team in PDL history to achieve such a feat. In the final they faced Central Conference champions [[Thunder Bay Chill]], and despite taking the lead, and despite Thunder Bay having a man sent off, had to settle for a 1\u20131 tie after extra time. Laredo were forced to endure a penalty shootout for the second year in a row; however, unfortunately for their 3,451 fans, Thunder Bay triumphed in the shootout to take the title. Young sensation [[Felix Garcia]] was Laredo's top scorer, with 11 goals (and was also named PDL U19 Player of the Year), while Juan Ibarra contributed 8 assists.\n\n===2009===\nIn the Mid South Division 2009 Season the Laredo Heat finished on top of the table with 7 wins, 1 loss and 8 ties.

Founded in 2004, the team plays in the [[National Premier Soccer League]] (NPSL), the fourth tier of the [[American Soccer Pyramid]]. They were members of the USL [[Premier Development League]] from 2004 to 2015.  The club was on hiatus for the 2016 and 2017 seasons.\n\nThe team plays its home games at the [[Texas A&M International University Soccer Complex]], where they have played since 2008. The team's colors are red, black and white.\n\n==History==\n\n===2004===\nLaredo Heat initially joined the USL Premier Development League in 2004 as an expansion franchise, playing a limited 'exploratory' schedule of eight exhibition games against selected opponents, but only managed two wins, both over the [[Lafayette Swamp Cats (USL)|Lafayette Swamp Cats]], 4\u20130 and 5\u20130, the latter of which featured a hat trick from striker Nelson Mata-Meza. Former [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]], [[D.C.

They won their opening game 3\u20130 over [[Austin Lightning]], and followed that with three wins in their next four games, before being brought back down to earth with a bump following a 7\u20130 hammering at the hands of the traditional regional powerhouses, [[El Paso Patriots]]. The Heat rallied to register three more wins in June, including two hugely impressive wins on their trip to Tennessee, with a 5\u20130 thumping of [[Nashville Metros]] and a 5\u20131 drubbing of [[Memphis Express (soccer)|Memphis Express]]. Despite losing three of their last four games down the home stretch, including back-to-back losses away at the [[New Orleans Shell Shockers]], Laredo held off [[Austin Lightning]] to finish second in the Mid-South Division and claim a playoff spot at their first serious attempt. At the Southern Conference playoff tournament, Laredo dispatched Southeast Division champions [[Cocoa Expos]] 2\u20131 in the semifinals, but lost to El Paso in the final. Dionisio Infante was Laredo's top scorer for the season, with 8 goals, while both Hector Vallejo-Medina and Juan Ibarra contributed 5 assists.\n\n===2006===\nLaredo's emergence as a true PDL powerhouse began in 2006. They began their season with a 9-game winning streak, proving to be a dominant force both at home and on the road: they scored an 88th-minute winner to beat [[Austin Lightning]] 4\u20133 on the opening day, enjoyed a comfortable 3\u20130 win over [[DFW Tornados]], came from behind to beat traditional rivals [[El Paso Patriots]] 3\u20132, and beat Austin for a second time, 4\u20131 on the road in mid-June. Laredo's only losses came at the hands of DFW and El Paso, the latter a comfortable 3\u20130 win for the Patriots on their home turf in the final game of the season, but by that time Laredo had already wrapped up their first divisional title by 16 points from the Tornados, and were into the playoffs for the second straight year. They won their conference semifinal 3\u20132 over [[Augusta Fireball]] with two late goals from substitute Arnoldo Presas-Delgado, and secured their first ever conference championship by beating [[Bradenton Academics]] 2\u20131 with an 89th-minute winner from Dionisio Infante. Their first trip to the national stage saw them taking on Eastern Conference champions [[Westchester Flames]]; with yet another dogged performance, Laredo came from two goals down to win 3\u20132 with Dionisio Infante scoring an 89th-minute winner for the second game in a row. The Heat hosted the 2006 PDL Championship Game, which was broadcast live on [[Fox Soccer Channel]], where they faced Central Conference champions [[Michigan Bucks]]. Unfortunately for Laredo, and despite the support of 7,000 home fans, lightning couldn't strike three times, and Michigan held on to win 2\u20131 and take their first PDL title. Nevertheless, reaching the national final was a monumental feat for a second year franchise, and boded well for the future. Hector Vallejo-Medina was Laredo's top scorer, with 7 goals, and Steve Su contributed 6 assists.\n\n===2007===\nLaredo retained their Mid South Division title in style in 2007, losing just two regular season games all year long. Despite never really overwhelming any of their opponents in games, Laredo were dogged and determined, grinding our comfortable 1\u20130 and 2\u20130 wins over their opponents, doing just enough to remain consistent all year. They began the season strongly, with a 3\u20130 win over [[Baton Rouge Capitals]] on the opening day of the season, and despite dropping points to El Paso, New Orleans and Austin, remained at the top end of the divisional standings throughout May. They beat [[DFW Tornados]] 4\u20131 at home on June 1, kick-starting their season into action; they lost just one more game, a tight 1\u20130 decision on the road against [[El Paso Patriots]], but were dominant elsewhere, closing the season with four straight wins and a bizarre 3\u20133 tie with [[Mississippi Brilla]], who fought back from being 3\u20130 down at half time and equalized with an 87th-minute penalty kick! They finished the regular season 8 points clear of El Paso at the top of the Mid South Division standings, and hosted the Southern Conference playoffs for a second year. After comfortably dispatching [[Central Florida Kraze]] 4\u20130 on the conference semifinal, they then beat Southeast Division champions [[Carolina Dynamo]] to retain their Conference championship and book their place in the national Final Four for the second straight year. Their opponents there were Western Conference champs [[Fresno Fuego]], who proved to be dogged competition; Laredo eventually scored an 84th-minute winner through teenager [[Felix Garcia]], and held out for a 1\u20130 win to take their place in the 2007 PDL Championship Game. The game, which Laredo hosted, saw them facing off again against Central Conference champions [[Michigan Bucks]], the first time in PDL history that the same teams had qualified for consecutive championship games. After a tense 0\u20130 tie through regular time and extra time, Laredo sent their 6,640 home fans crazy by winning the penalty shoot-out 4\u20133. [[Felix Garcia]] struck the winning kick past Bucks keeper [[Steve Clark (soccer)|Steve Clark]]. The shootout was notable for the injury to Michigan striker Kenny Uziogwe who, after taking a penalty kick which was saved by Laredo keeper Ryan Cooper, immediately collapsed in agony with cramp; however, when the referee called the penalty back due to Cooper being off his line, Uziogwe was unable to continue, and despite receiving treatment for 10 minutes on the field, had to be substituted during the shoot-out.\n\n===2008===\nAs 2-time PDL Championship finalists and reigning national champions, Laredo were expected to be competitive in 2008, and did not disappoint. They started strongly, with two ties and a win in their opening three games, but were unexpectedly beaten 1\u20130 by expansion team [[Austin Aztex U23]], who proved to be their regular-season nemesis. Laredo stuttered slightly in June, having to come from behind to tie 3\u20133 with [[New Orleans Shell Shockers]], fighting back strongly to register three consecutive three goal victories, but then losing twice in two days to the [[El Paso Patriots]], ensuring that the fight for the playoff spots would be a close one themselves, El Paso and Austin. Their second loss of the season to the Aztex, a 1\u20133 decision in which head coach Israel Collazo was sent off after the final whistle, seemed to light a fire under the Heat, who rallied to finish the regular season with three straight wins. They annihilated [[Houston Leones]] 7\u20130, and beat the [[New Orleans Shell Shockers]] 4\u20130 on the final day with a hat trick from [[Felix Garcia]] to secure second place in the division by one point from El Paso, squeaking into the playoffs by the narrowest of margins. Laredo traveled to Florida for the Southern conference tournament; they beat [[Central Florida Kraze]] 2\u20131 in the semifinal, and exacted sweet revenge over [[Austin Aztex U23]] by beating them 3\u20131 in the conference championship game, thereby securing their third straight title, and their third consecutive trip to the national final four. Their opponents in the semifinal were the surprise Eastern champs, [[Reading Rage]], who they beat 2\u20130 to advance to their third straight PDL Championship Game, and in doing so became the first team in PDL history to achieve such a feat. In the final they faced Central Conference champions [[Thunder Bay Chill]], and despite taking the lead, and despite Thunder Bay having a man sent off, had to settle for a 1\u20131 tie after extra time. Laredo were forced to endure a penalty shootout for the second year in a row; however, unfortunately for their 3,451 fans, Thunder Bay triumphed in the shootout to take the title. Young sensation [[Felix Garcia]] was Laredo's top scorer, with 11 goals (and was also named PDL U19 Player of the Year), while Juan Ibarra contributed 8 assists.\n\n===2009===\nIn the Mid South Division 2009 Season the Laredo Heat finished on top of the table with 7 wins, 1 loss and 8 ties.
