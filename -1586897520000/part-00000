{"title_page": "List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, 1760\u20131779", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{British legislation before 1801|Great Britain}}\n\nThis is an ''incomplete'' '''list of [[Act of Parliament|Acts]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] for the years 1760&ndash;1779'''.  For Acts passed up until 1707 see [[List of Acts of the Parliament of England]] and [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]].  See also the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland to 1700]] and the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, 1701\u20131800]].\n\nFor Acts passed from 1801 onwards see [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].  For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the [[List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999]], the [[List of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly]], and the [[List of Acts and Measures of the National Assembly for Wales]]; see also the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland]].\n\nThe number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant [[parliamentary session]] was held; thus the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union with Ireland Act 1800]] is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use [[Arabic numeral]]s in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\n\nActs passed by the Parliament of Great Britain did not have a [[short title]]; however, some of these Acts have subsequently been given a short title by Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the [[Short Titles Act 1896]]).\n\nBefore the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]] came into force on 8 April 1793, Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed.  Because of this, the years given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular Act was passed.\n\n==1760\u20131769==\n\n===1760 (1 Geo. 3)===\n\n* [[Civil List Act 1760]] c. 1\n* [[Coinage Duties Act 1760]] c. 16\n* [[Colonial Trade Act 1760]] c. 9\n* [[Commissions and Salaries of Judges Act 1760]] c. 23\n* [[Cornwall Duchy Act 1760]] c. 11\n* [[Courts-martial, East Indies Act 1760]] c. 14\n* [[Game Act 1760]] c. 21\n* [[Grants to George Keith Act 1760]] c. 15\n* [[Importation Act 1760]] c. 4\n* [[Indemnity Act 1760]] c. 12\n* [[Insolvent Debtors Relief Act 1760]] c. 17\n* [[Justices' Qualification Act 1760]] c. 13\n* [[Marine Mutiny Act 1760]] c. 8\n* [[Militia Pay Act 1760]] c. 22\n* [[Mutiny Act 1760]] c. 6\n* [[National Debt Act 1760]] c. 7\n* [[South Sea Company Act 1760]] c. 5\n* [[Supply, etc. Act 1760]] c. 18\n* [[Supply, etc. Act 1760]] c. 19\n* [[Supply, etc. Act 1760]] c. 20\n* [[Taxation Act 1760]] c. 2\n* [[Taxation Act 1760]] c. 3\n* [[Taxation Act 1760]] c. 10\n\n===1761 (2 Geo. 3)===\n\n* [[Beer Act 1761]] c. 14\n* [[Importation Act 1761]] c. 6\n* [[Insolvent Debtors Relief Act 1761]] c. 2\n* [[Land Tax Act 1761]] c. 13\n* [[Marine Mutiny Act 1761]] c. 12\n* [[Mutiny Act 1761]] c. 11\n* [[National Debt Act 1761]] c. 9\n* [[National Debt Act 1761]] c. 10\n* [[Provision for the Queen Act 1761]] c. 1\n* [[Taxation, etc. Act 1761]] c. 3\n* [[Taxation, etc. Act 1761]] c. 4\n* [[Taxation, etc. Act 1761]] c. 5\n* [[Unfunded Debt Act 1761]] c. 7\n* [[Window Duties Act 1761]] c. 8\n\n===1762===\n\n====2 Geo. 3====\n* [[American Merchant Seamen Act 1762]] c. 31\n* [[American Protestant Soldier Naturalization Act 1762]] c. 25\n* [[Court of Session Adjournment Act 1762]] c. 27\n* [[Crown Lands, Forfeited Estates Act 1762]] c. 17\n* [[Deeds and Wills of Papists Act 1762]] c. 26\n* [[Discovery of Longitude at Sea Act 1762]] c. 18\n* [[Fish Carriage Act 1762]] c. 15\n* [[Game Act 1762]] c. 19\n* [[Hampshire, Kent, Sussex Fortifications.

For Acts passed up until 1707 see [[List of Acts of the Parliament of England]] and [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]].  See also the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland to 1700]] and the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, 1701\u20131800]].\n\nFor Acts passed from 1801 onwards see [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].  For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the [[List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999]], the [[List of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly]], and the [[List of Acts and Measures of the National Assembly for Wales]]; see also the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland]].\n\nThe number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant [[parliamentary session]] was held; thus the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union with Ireland Act 1800]] is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use [[Arabic numeral]]s in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\n\nActs passed by the Parliament of Great Britain did not have a [[short title]]; however, some of these Acts have subsequently been given a short title by Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the [[Short Titles Act 1896]]).\n\nBefore the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]] came into force on 8 April 1793, Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed.  Because of this, the years given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular Act was passed.\n\n==1760\u20131769==\n\n===1760 (1 Geo. 3)===\n\n* [[Civil List Act 1760]] c. 1\n* [[Coinage Duties Act 1760]] c. 16\n* [[Colonial Trade Act 1760]] c. 9\n* [[Commissions and Salaries of Judges Act 1760]] c. 23\n* [[Cornwall Duchy Act 1760]] c. 11\n* [[Courts-martial, East Indies Act 1760]] c. 14\n* [[Game Act 1760]] c. 21\n* [[Grants to George Keith Act 1760]] c. 15\n* [[Importation Act 1760]] c. 4\n* [[Indemnity Act 1760]] c. 12\n* [[Insolvent Debtors Relief Act 1760]] c. 17\n* [[Justices' Qualification Act 1760]] c. 13\n* [[Marine Mutiny Act 1760]] c. 8\n* [[Militia Pay Act 1760]] c. 22\n* [[Mutiny Act 1760]] c. 6\n* [[National Debt Act 1760]] c. 7\n* [[South Sea Company Act 1760]] c. 5\n* [[Supply, etc. Act 1760]] c. 18\n* [[Supply, etc. Act 1760]] c. 19\n* [[Supply, etc. Act 1760]] c. 20\n* [[Taxation Act 1760]] c. 2\n* [[Taxation Act 1760]] c. 3\n* [[Taxation Act 1760]] c. 10\n\n===1761 (2 Geo. 3)===\n\n* [[Beer Act 1761]] c. 14\n* [[Importation Act 1761]] c. 6\n* [[Insolvent Debtors Relief Act 1761]] c. 2\n* [[Land Tax Act 1761]] c. 13\n* [[Marine Mutiny Act 1761]] c. 12\n* [[Mutiny Act 1761]] c. 11\n* [[National Debt Act 1761]] c. 9\n* [[National Debt Act 1761]] c. 10\n* [[Provision for the Queen Act 1761]] c. 1\n* [[Taxation, etc. Act 1761]] c. 3\n* [[Taxation, etc. Act 1761]] c. 4\n* [[Taxation, etc. Act 1761]] c. 5\n* [[Unfunded Debt Act 1761]] c. 7\n* [[Window Duties Act 1761]] c. 8\n\n===1762===\n\n====2 Geo. 3====\n* [[American Merchant Seamen Act 1762]] c. 31\n* [[American Protestant Soldier Naturalization Act 1762]] c. 25\n* [[Court of Session Adjournment Act 1762]] c. 27\n* [[Crown Lands, Forfeited Estates Act 1762]] c. 17\n* [[Deeds and Wills of Papists Act 1762]] c. 26\n* [[Discovery of Longitude at Sea Act 1762]] c. 18\n* [[Fish Carriage Act 1762]] c. 15\n* [[Game Act 1762]] c. 19\n* [[Hampshire, Kent, Sussex Fortifications.

Created in 2012 by co-hosts Hanson and [[JonTron|Jon Jafari]], the series centers around its hosts playing video games while adding comedic commentary. After Jafari left the show in 2013 to focus on his own [[YouTube]] webseries, [[Jon Jafari#JonTron|''JonTron'']], he was succeeded by Avidan. The [[YouTube]] channel for ''Game Grumps'' currently operates under [[Jetpak|JETPAK]], a network created by [[Adam Montoya]].<ref name=\"INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT\">{{cite web|url=http://3blackdot.com/influencers/|title=INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT|website=3blackdot.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714020956/http://3blackdot.com/influencers/|archive-date=2017-07-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince Jafari's departure, the channel has expanded to include other hosts, besides the main two, who have floated in and out of the channel over time as a part of spin-off shows. Those include [[Ross O'Donovan]], Barry Kramer, Suzy Berhow, and [[Brian Wecht]], as well as various guest hosts. {{as of|2020|3}}, ''Game Grumps'' has over 5.23 million subscribers and over 5 billion total video views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/GameGrumps|title=GameGrumps|website=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210155034/http://www.youtube.com/user/GameGrumps|archive-date=2013-12-10|url-status=live|access-date=2017-11-21}}</ref> Game Grumps have also developed and published two of their own video games, ''[[Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator]]'' and ''Soviet Jump Game'', as well as writing the [[young adult novel]] ''Ghost Hunters Adventure Club and the Secret of the Grande Chateau''.\n\n==Format==\nEpisodes usually consist of two hosts or more, playing a video game, featuring their commentary, experience with (and opinions of) the chosen game, as well as related and unrelated discussions, along with stories from their lives. Many of the games played on the show are sent in by fans, who mail in games to the Grumps\u2019 PO box in Glendale, California.<ref name=\"5 facts\">{{cite web |url=http://heavy.com/games/2017/08/game-grumps-animated-arin-danny-jontron-good-game-dream-daddy/ |title=Game Grumps: Five Fast Facts You Need to Know |first=Jack |last=Fennimore |publisher=Heavy |date=August 30, 2017 |accessdate=November 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040013/http://heavy.com/games/2017/08/game-grumps-animated-arin-danny-jontron-good-game-dream-daddy/ |archive-date=2017-12-01 |url-status=live }}</ref> The channel typically uploads two or three episodes each day. Lengthier games often result in ongoing series, which continue airing until completion, unless ending early in favor of beginning a new series. Occasionally, the hosts will participate and compete in [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games, as part of their ''Game Grumps VS'' series. Though the episodes usually consist of two or more people, there are some special episodes with Hanson or Avidan alone.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Game Grumps Founders.png|left|thumb|[[Arin Hanson]] (''left, pictured in 2011'') and [[JonTron|Jon Jafari]] (''right, pictured in 2016'') created Game Grumps in 2012 and hosted it together until 2013|alt=]]\n''Game Grumps'' was created by [[JonTron|Jon \"JonTron\" Jafari]] and [[Egoraptor|Arin \"Egoraptor\" Hanson]], and began with a video of the two playing ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' uploaded on July 18, 2012 to video streaming site [[YouTube]].<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> According to Jafari and Hanson, the idea for the show came about when the two were arguing over whether or not the character Wolf from the fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' was too similar to the character Fox in terms of their fighting styles. After animator Ross O\u2019Donovan told the duo about their tendency to be \u201cgrumpy\u201d with each other over video games, Hanson came up with the idea of a [[podcast]] revolving around this concept, though the show ultimately became a video series on YouTube rather than a podcast.<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> In September 2012, Barry Kramer was brought onto the show as an editor.<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> Hanson and Jafari worked on the show together until June 25, 2013, when Jafari announced he would be leaving the show due to desires to focus on [[JonTron|his own show]]. Many fans were upset by Jafari's departure from ''Game Grumps'', with many expressing disappointment in the decision's last-minute announcement, as well as the channel's decision to announce the beginning of ''Steam Train'' on the same day.<ref name=\"INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT\"/> After Jafari's departure, [[Ninja Sex Party]] vocalist [[Dan Avidan]] succeeded him as co-host of the main show. Avidan also joined animator [[Ross O'Donovan]] as co-host of the show ''Steam Train'', where both play [[Personal computer|PC]] games (the title references the retailer [[Steam (software)|Steam]]). This expanded the channel's output to three videos a day: two standard ''Game Grumps'' episodes and a single ''Steam Train'' episode. ''Steam Train'' later expanded to include Hanson as a co-host at times, as well as featuring one of the group's editors, Barry Kramer, and Hanson's wife, Suzy Berhow. The expansion also introduced a new ''Steam Rolled'' series, where four-player games (not necessarily PC games) are played by the group.\n\nIn October 2013, the group began a gameplay series featuring ''[[Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate]]'' on the Polaris YouTube channel, titled ''Hunting Monsters''. A second installment, featuring ''[[Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate]]'', began in February 2015.\n[[File:Game Grumps Kiss.png|left|thumb|The current hosts of Game Grumps, [[Dan Avidan]] (top) and [[Arin Hanson]] (bottom), in 2015]]\nIn December 2013, Kramer and Berhow began hosting ''Table Flip'', where they dress in [[Victorian era|Victorian]]/[[The United States in the 19th century|19th century American]] period clothing<ref>{{cite web|title=18th Century-ish Table Flip Theme? \u2013 Suzy and Barry Game Grumps AMA|url=http://www.polarisgo.com/video/uWcw7LY2Sr7w/search/table+flip/page/0|publisher=Polaris|accessdate=28 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305064847/http://www.polarisgo.com/video/uWcw7LY2Sr7w/search/table+flip/page/0|archive-date=2014-03-05|url-status=live}}</ref> and play [[tabletop game]]s, such as [[card game]]s, [[board game]]s, and [[tile-based game]]s with other YouTube personalities.

Although Abernathy took on editing for most of the series, Kramer continued to edit ''Steam Train''. Since Abernathy's departure from the show in mid-2016, Kramer, Ryan Magee, and Matt Watson have taken on editing duties.\n\nIn January 2015, to celebrate reaching two million subscribers, a new show called ''Grumpcade'' was launched, featuring any combination of co-hosts playing console games. The show also features guest YouTube personalities, including game critics ProJared, The Completionist and [[Markiplier]]. Shortly after, in February 2015, GrumpOut, a channel dedicated to recreational and live-action video projects, was created. In November 2015, Avidan's [[Ninja Sex Party]] bandmate [[Brian Wecht]] officially joined the team, leaving behind his career as a [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]].\n\nThe channel also airs special holiday-themed series, featuring holiday-themed games, including ''Jingle Grumps'' and ''Steam Sleigh'' for Christmas, ''Ghoul Grumps'' and ''Scream Train'' for Halloween, ''Date Grumps'', ''Single Train'' and ''Love Train'' for Valentine's Day, and ''Stout Train'' for St. Patrick's Day.\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that Avidan and Hanson would appear at [[The Improv|Hollywood Improv]] for a special performance of ''Game Grumps Live'' on March 30<ref>{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/701899486491185152| title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-02-27}}</ref> and 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/702676696005128192| title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://hollywood.improv.com/event.cfm?cart&id=440599| title = Game Grumps LIVE| website = hollywood.improv.com| access-date = 2016-02-27| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160301082843/http://hollywood.improv.com/event.cfm?cart&id=440599| archivedate = 2016-03-01}}</ref> Later, in April 2016, it was announced that Avidan and Hanson would appear at Levity Live in [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]], [[New York (state)|New York]] for more performances of ''Game Grumps Live'' on April 29 and 30.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/717388267872591872|title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://nyack.levitylive.com/| title = Levity Live| website = Levity Live| access-date = 2016-04-13| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160412022047/http://nyack.levitylive.com/| archive-date = 2016-04-12| url-status = live}}</ref> ''Game Grumps Live'' has since gone on to become a regularly-touring entity, performing across the United States and Canada in brief regional stints at a time.[[File:Game Grumps members.png|thumb|[[Suzy Berhow]] (left), [[Arin Hanson]] (center, bottom), [[Barry Kramer]] (center, top), and [[Ross O'Donovan]], pictured in 2015, are all members of Game Grumps]]On January 6, 2017, it was announced that the show's middle slot would no longer upload on a consistent schedule.

Created in 2012 by co-hosts Hanson and [[JonTron|Jon Jafari]], the series centers around its hosts playing video games and comedically commentating on them. After Jafari left the show in 2013 to focus on his own [[YouTube]] webseries, [[Jon Jafari#JonTron|''JonTron'']], he was succeeded by Avidan. The [[YouTube]] channel for ''Game Grumps'' currently operates under [[Jetpak|JETPAK]], a network created by [[Adam Montoya]].<ref name=\"INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT\">{{cite web|url=http://3blackdot.com/influencers/|title=INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT|website=3blackdot.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714020956/http://3blackdot.com/influencers/|archive-date=2017-07-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince Jafari's departure, the channel has expanded to include other hosts, besides the main two, who have floated in and out of the channel over time as a part of spin-off shows.

Lengthier games often result in ongoing series, which continue airing until completion, unless ending early in favor of beginning a new series. Occasionally, the hosts will participate and compete in [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games, as part of their ''Game Grumps VS'' series. Though the episodes usually consist of two or more people, there are some special episodes with Hanson or Avidan alone.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Game Grumps Founders.png|left|thumb|[[Arin Hanson]] (''left, pictured in 2011'') and [[JonTron|Jon Jafari]] (''right, pictured in 2016'') created Game Grumps in 2012 and hosted it together until 2013|alt=]]\n''Game Grumps'' was created by [[JonTron|Jon \"JonTron\" Jafari]] and [[Egoraptor|Arin \"Egoraptor\" Hanson]], and began with a video of the two playing ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' uploaded on July 18, 2012 to video streaming site [[YouTube]].<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> According to Jafari and Hanson, the idea for the show came about when the two were arguing over whether or not the character Wolf from the fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' was too similar to the character Fox in terms of their fighting styles. After animator Ross O\u2019Donovan told the duo about their tendency to be \u201cgrumpy\u201d with each other over video games, Hanson came up with the idea of a [[podcast]] revolving around this concept, though the show ultimately became a video series on YouTube rather than a podcast.<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> In September 2012, Barry Kramer was brought onto the show as an editor.<ref name=\"5 facts\" /> Hanson and Jafari worked on the show together until June 25, 2013, when Jafari announced he would be leaving the show due to desires to focus on [[JonTron|his own show]]. Many fans were upset by Jafari's departure from ''Game Grumps'', with many expressing disappointment in the decision's last-minute announcement, as well as the channel's decision to announce the beginning of ''Steam Train'' on the same day.<ref name=\"INFLUENCERS \u2013 3BLACKDOT\"/> After Jafari's departure, [[Ninja Sex Party]] vocalist [[Dan Avidan]] succeeded him as co-host of the main show. Avidan also joined animator [[Ross O'Donovan]] as co-host of the show ''Steam Train'', where both play [[Personal computer|PC]] games (the title references the retailer [[Steam (software)|Steam]]). This expanded the channel's output to three videos a day: two standard ''Game Grumps'' episodes and a single ''Steam Train'' episode. ''Steam Train'' later expanded to include Hanson as a co-host at times, as well as featuring one of the group's editors, Barry Kramer, and Hanson's wife, Suzy Berhow. The expansion also introduced a new ''Steam Rolled'' series, where four-player games (not necessarily PC games) are played by the group.\n\nIn October 2013, the group began a gameplay series featuring ''[[Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate]]'' on the Polaris YouTube channel, titled ''Hunting Monsters''. A second installment, featuring ''[[Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate]]'', began in February 2015.\n[[File:Game Grumps Kiss.png|left|thumb|The current hosts of Game Grumps, [[Dan Avidan]] (top) and [[Arin Hanson]] (bottom), in 2015]]\nIn December 2013, Kramer and Berhow began hosting ''Table Flip'', where they dress in [[Victorian era|Victorian]]/[[The United States in the 19th century|19th century American]] period clothing<ref>{{cite web|title=18th Century-ish Table Flip Theme? \u2013 Suzy and Barry Game Grumps AMA|url=http://www.polarisgo.com/video/uWcw7LY2Sr7w/search/table+flip/page/0|publisher=Polaris|accessdate=28 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305064847/http://www.polarisgo.com/video/uWcw7LY2Sr7w/search/table+flip/page/0|archive-date=2014-03-05|url-status=live}}</ref> and play [[tabletop game]]s, such as [[card game]]s, [[board game]]s, and [[tile-based game]]s with other YouTube personalities.

Although Abernathy took on editing for most of the series, Kramer continued to edit ''Steam Train''. Since Abernathy's departure from the show in mid-2016, Kramer, Ryan Magee, and Matt Watson have taken on editing duties.\n\nIn January 2015, to celebrate reaching two million subscribers, a new show called ''Grumpcade'' was launched, featuring any combination of co-hosts playing console games. The show also features guest YouTube personalities, including game critics ProJared, The Completionist and [[Markiplier]]. Shortly after, in February 2015, GrumpOut, a channel dedicated to recreational and live-action video projects, was created. In November 2015, Avidan's [[Ninja Sex Party]] bandmate [[Brian Wecht]] officially joined the team, leaving behind his career as a [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]].\n\nThe channel also airs special holiday-themed series, featuring holiday-themed games, including ''Jingle Grumps'' and ''Steam Sleigh'' for Christmas, ''Ghoul Grumps'' and ''Scream Train'' for Halloween, ''Date Grumps'', ''Single Train'' and ''Love Train'' for Valentine's Day, and ''Stout Train'' for St. Patrick's Day.\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced that Avidan and Hanson would appear at [[The Improv|Hollywood Improv]] for a special performance of ''Game Grumps Live'' on March 30<ref>{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/701899486491185152| title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-02-27}}</ref> and 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/702676696005128192| title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://hollywood.improv.com/event.cfm?cart&id=440599| title = Game Grumps LIVE| website = hollywood.improv.com| access-date = 2016-02-27| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160301082843/http://hollywood.improv.com/event.cfm?cart&id=440599| archivedate = 2016-03-01}}</ref> Later, in April 2016, it was announced that Avidan and Hanson would appear at Levity Live in [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]], [[New York (state)|New York]] for more performances of ''Game Grumps Live'' on April 29 and 30.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/GameGrumps/status/717388267872591872|title = Game Grumps on Twitter| website = Twitter| access-date = 2016-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://nyack.levitylive.com/| title = Levity Live| website = Levity Live| access-date = 2016-04-13| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160412022047/http://nyack.levitylive.com/| archive-date = 2016-04-12| url-status = live}}</ref> ''Game Grumps Live'' has since gone on to become a regularly-touring entity, performing across the United States and Canada in brief regional stints at a time.[[File:Game Grumps members.png|thumb|[[Suzy Berhow]] (left), [[Arin Hanson]] (center, bottom), [[Barry Kramer]] (center, top), and [[Ross O'Donovan]], pictured in 2015, are all members of Game Grumps]]On January 6, 2017, it was announced that the show's middle slot would no longer upload on a consistent schedule.

{"title_page": "Fear, uncertainty, and doubt", "text_new": "{{short description|Tactic used to influence opinion by disseminating negative, dubious, or false information}}\n{{Redirect|FUD|other uses|Fud (disambiguation){{!}}Fud}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\n'''Fear, uncertainty, and doubt''' (often shortened to '''FUD''') is a [[disinformation]] strategy used in sales, marketing, [[public relations]], politics, cults, and [[propaganda]]. FUD is generally a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and a manifestation of the [[appeal to fear]].\n\nWhile the phrase dates to at least the early 20th&nbsp;century, the present common usage of disinformation related to software, hardware and technology industries generally appeared in the 1970s to describe disinformation in the [[computer hardware]] industry, and has since been used more broadly.\n\n=={{anchor|IBM}}Definition==\nThe term \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt\" appeared as far back as the 1920s,<ref name=\"Yarbrough_1920\"/><ref name=\"Gardner_1926\"/> whereas the similar formulation \"doubts, fears, and uncertainties\" even reaches back to 1693 the least.<ref name=\"Payne_1695\"/><ref name=\"Payne_1708\"/> By 1975, the term was appearing abbreviated as FUD in marketing and sales contexts<ref name=\"Clothes_1975\"/> as well as in [[public relations]]:<ref name=\"LeadRefs000\"/>\n\n{{quote|One of the messages dealt with is FUD&mdash;the fear, uncertainty, and doubt on the part of customer and sales person alike that stifles the approach and greeting.<ref name=\"Clothes_1975\"/>}}\n\nThe abbreviation FUD is also alternatively rendered as \"fear, uncertainty, and disinformation\".<ref name=\"Netlingo_2002\"/>\n\nFUD was first used with its common current technology-related meaning by [[Gene Amdahl]] in 1975, after he left [[International Business Machines|IBM]] to found his own company, [[Amdahl Corporation|Amdahl Corp.]]:<ref name=\"JF\"/>\n\n{{quote|FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering Amdahl products.<ref name=\"JF\"/>}}\n\nThe term has also been attributed to veteran [[Morgan Stanley]] computer analyst Ulrich Weil. \n\nThis usage of FUD to describe disinformation in the [[computer hardware]] industry is said to have led to subsequent popularization of the term.<ref name=\"Elliott000\"/>\n \nAs [[Eric Steven Raymond]] wrote:<ref name=\"JF\"/>\n\n{{quote|The idea, of course, was to persuade buyers to go with safe IBM gear rather than with competitors' equipment. This implicit coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that ''Good Things'' would happen to people who stuck with IBM, but ''Dark Shadows'' loomed over the future of competitors' equipment or software. After 1991, the term has become generalized to refer to any kind of [[disinformation]] used as a competitive weapon.<ref name=\"JF\"/>}}\n\nBy spreading questionable information about the drawbacks of less well-known products, an established company can discourage decision-makers from choosing those products over its own, regardless of the relative ''technical'' merits. This is a recognized phenomenon, epitomized by the traditional axiom of purchasing agents that \"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM equipment\". The aim is to have [[Information technology|IT]] departments buy software they know to be technically inferior because upper management is more likely to [[brand recognition|recognize the brand]].\n\n== Examples ==\n=== Software producers ===\n==== Microsoft ====\nFrom the 1990s onward the term became most often associated with [[Microsoft]]. Roger Irwin said:<ref name=\"Irwin_1998\"/>\n{{quote|Microsoft soon picked up the art of FUD from IBM, and throughout the '80s used FUD as a primary marketing tool, much as IBM had in the previous decade. They ended up out FUD-ing IBM themselves during the [[OS/2]] vs Win3.1 years.}}\n\nIn 1996, [[Caldera, Inc.]] accused Microsoft of several [[anti-competitive practice]]s, including issuing [[vaporware]] announcements, creating FUD, and excluding competitors from participating in [[beta-test program]]s in order to destroy competition in the [[DOS]] market.<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Statement_of_facts\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_Fullstory_Tech\"/>\nOne of the claims was related to having modified [[Windows 3.1]] so that it would not run on [[DR DOS 6.0]] although there were no technical reasons for it not to work.<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Statement_of_facts\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1999_FactRel\"/> This was caused by the so-called [[AARD code]], some [[encrypted]] piece of code, which had been found in a number of Microsoft programs. The code would [[fake (deception)|fake]] nonsensical [[error message]]s if run on DR&nbsp;DOS, like:<ref name=\"Schulman_1993_AARD\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/><ref name=\"Reynolds_1991\"/>\n\n{{quote|Non-Fatal error detected: error #2726<br/>Please contact Windows 3.1 beta support<br/>Press ENTER to exit or C to continue<ref name=\"Schulman_1993_AARD\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/><ref name=\"Reynolds_1991\"/>}}\n\nIf the user chose to press {{keypress|C}}, Windows would continue to run on DR&nbsp;DOS without problems. While it had been already speculated in the industry that the purpose of this code was to create doubts about DR&nbsp;DOS's [[software incompatibility|compatibility]] and thereby destroy the product's [[reputation]],<ref name=\"Schulman_1993_AARD\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/> internal Microsoft memos published as part of the ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' [[antitrust case]] later revealed that the specific focus of these tests was in fact DR&nbsp;DOS.<ref name=\"Lea_1999_Register\"/> At one point, Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] sent a memo to a number of employees, reading\n{{quote|You never sent me a response on the question of what things an app would do that would make it run with [[MS-DOS]] and not run with DR-DOS. Is there [a] feature they have that might get in our way?<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Statement_of_facts\"/><ref name=\"cnet\"/>}} Microsoft Senior Vice President [[Brad Silverberg]] later sent another memo, stating\n{{quote|What the [user] is supposed to do is feel uncomfortable, and when he has bugs, suspect that the problem is DR-DOS and then go out to buy MS-DOS.<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Statement_of_facts\"/><ref name=\"cnet\"/>}} In 2000, Microsoft settled the [[Caldera v. Microsoft|lawsuit]] out-of-court for an undisclosed sum, which in 2009 was revealed to be {{currency|amount=280 million|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=yes}}.<ref name=\"Groklaw_2009_NovellWP\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_Microsoft_2000_Settlement\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2009_Memorandum\"/><ref name=\"Gomes_2000_Settlement\"/>\n\nAt around the same time, the leaked internal Microsoft \"[[Halloween documents]]\" stated \"[[Open source|OSS [Open Source Software]]] is long-term credible\u2026 [therefore] FUD tactics cannot be used to combat it.\"<ref name=\"ESR_Halloween\"/>\nOpen source software, and the [[Linux]] community in particular, are widely perceived as frequent targets of Microsoft's FUD:\n* Statements about the \"[[viral nature]]\"<ref name=\"Microsoft_Viral\"/> of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).\n* Statements that \"\u2026[[FOSS|FOSS [Free and open source software]]] infringes on no fewer than 235 Microsoft [[patent]]s\", before software patent law precedents were even established.<ref name=\"Parloff_2007_1\"/><ref name=\"Parloff_2007_2\"/>\n* Statements that [[Windows Server 2003]] has lower [[total cost of ownership]] (TCO) than Linux, in Microsoft's \"Get-The-Facts\" campaign. It turned out that they were comparing Linux on a very expensive [[IBM mainframe]] to Windows Server 2003 on an [[Intel Xeon]]-based server.<ref name=\"BBC_2004_Ad\"/><ref name=\"CNET_2004_Ad\"/>\n* A 2010 video claimed that [[OpenOffice.org]] had a higher long-term cost of ownership, as well as poor [[interoperability]] with [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft's own office suite]]. The video featured statements such as \"If an open source [[freeware]] solution breaks, who's gonna fix it?\"<ref name=\"Protalinski_2000_OpenOffice\"/><ref name=\"Microoft_2000_OpenOffice\"/>\n\n==== SCO v. IBM ====\n{{Main|SCO v. IBM}}\nThe [[SCO Group]]'s 2003 [[SCO v. IBM|lawsuit against IBM]], funded by [[Microsoft Halloween documents leak|Microsoft]], claiming $5 billion in [[intellectual property]] infringements by the [[free software community]], is an example of FUD, according to IBM, which argued in its counterclaim that SCO was spreading \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt\".<ref name=\"Groklaw_2004_SCO-IBM-1\"/>\n\nMagistrate Judge [[Brooke C. Wells]] wrote (and Judge [[Dale Albert Kimball]] concurred) in her order limiting SCO's claims: \"The court finds SCO's arguments unpersuasive. SCO's arguments are akin to SCO telling IBM, 'sorry, we are not going to tell you what you did wrong because you already know\u2026' SCO was required to disclose in detail what it feels IBM misappropriated\u2026 the court finds it inexcusable that SCO is\u2026 not placing all the details on the table. Certainly if an individual were stopped and accused of [[shoplifting]] after walking out of [[Neiman Marcus]] they would expect to be eventually told what they allegedly stole. It would be absurd for an officer to tell the accused that 'you know what you stole, I'm not telling.' Or, to simply hand the accused individual a catalog of Neiman Marcus' entire inventory and say 'it's in there somewhere, you figure it out.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Groklaw_2004_SCO-IBM-2\"/>\n\nRegarding the matter, [[Darl Charles McBride]], President and CEO of SCO, made the following statements:\n\n# \"IBM has taken our valuable trade secrets and given them away to Linux,\"\n# \"We're finding\u2026 cases where there is line-by-line code in the Linux kernel that is matching up to our [[UnixWare]] code\"\n# \"\u2026unless more companies start licensing SCO's property\u2026 [SCO] may also sue [[Linus Torvalds]]\u2026 for patent infringement.\"\n# \"Both companies [IBM and [[Red Hat]]] have shifted liability to the customer and then taunted us to sue them.\"\n# \"We have the ability to go to users with lawsuits and we will if we have to, 'It would be within SCO Group's rights to order every copy of [[IBM AIX|AIX]] [IBM's proprietary [[UNIX]]] destroyed',\"\n# \"As of Friday, [13] June [2003], we will be done trying to talk to IBM, and we will be talking directly to its customers and going in and auditing them. IBM no longer has the authority to sell or distribute IBM AIX and customers no longer have the right to use AIX software\"\n# \"If you just drag this out in a typical litigation path, where it takes years and years to settle anything, and in the meantime you have all this uncertainty clouding over the market\u2026\"\n# \"Users are running systems that have basically pirated software inside, or stolen software inside of their systems, they have liability.\"<ref name=\"McBride_Show-Person\"/>\n\nSCO stock skyrocketed from under {{currency|amount=3|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}} a share to over {{currency|amount=20|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}} in a matter of weeks in 2003. (It later dropped to around<ref name=\"Yahoo_SCOX\"/> {{currency|amount=1.20|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}}&mdash;then crashed to under 50 cents on 13 August 2007, in the aftermath of a ruling that [[Novell]] owns the UNIX [[copyright]]s.)<ref name=\"AT_SCOX\"/>\n\n==== Apple ====\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s claim that [[Jailbreak (iPhone OS)|iPhone jailbreaking]] could potentially allow hackers to crash [[cell site|cell phone towers]] was described by [[Fred von Lohmann]], a representative of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), as a \"kind of theoretical threat\u2026more FUD than truth\u201d.<ref name=\"Kravets_2009_Apple\"/>\n\n=== Security industry ===\n{{Main|Appeal to fear}}\nFUD is widely recognized as a tactic to promote the sale or implementation of security products and measures. It is possible to find pages describing purely artificial problems. Such pages frequently contain links to the demonstrating source code that does not point to any valid location and sometimes even links that \"will execute malicious code on your machine regardless of current security software\", leading to pages without any executable code.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe drawback to the FUD tactic in this context is that, when the stated or implied threats fail to materialize over time, the customer or decision-maker frequently reacts by withdrawing budgeting or support from future security initiatives.<ref name=\"CXO_2003_FUD\"/>\n\nFUD has also been utilized in [[technical support scam]]s where fake error messages are used to scare unwitting computer users, especially the elderly or computer-illiterate, into paying for a supposed fix for a non-existent problem<ref name=\"unc\">{{cite web |title=Beware of tech support scams |url=http://news.unchealthcare.org/empnews/2017/july-6/beware-of-tech-support-scams |publisher=UNC Health and UNC School of Medicine |accessdate=7 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> to avoid being framed for criminal charges such as unpaid taxes, or in extreme cases, false accusations of illegal acts such as [[child pornography]].<ref name=\"panorama\">{{cite web |title=Panorama - Spying on the Scammers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000fzx2/panorama-spying-on-the-scammers |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Caltex ===\nThe FUD tactic was used by [[Caltex]] Australia in 2003. According to an internal memo, which was subsequently leaked, they wished to use FUD to destabilize franchisee confidence, and thus get a better deal for Caltex. This memo was used as an example of unconscionable behaviour in a [[Australian Senate|Senate]] inquiry. Senior management claimed that it was contrary to and did not reflect company principles.<ref name=\"Lilienthal_2004_Caltex\"/><ref name=\"ABC_2004_Caltex\"/><ref name=\"Benns_2004_Caltex\"/>\n\n=== Clorox ===\nIn 2008, [[Clorox]] was the subject of both consumer and industry criticism for advertising its [[Clorox#Green Works|Green Works]] line of allegedly [[environmentally friendly]] cleaning products using the [[slogan]], \"Finally, Green Works.\"<ref name=\"DeBare_2010_Clorox\"/> The slogan implied both that \"[[Environmentally friendly|green]]\" products manufactured by other companies which had been available to consumers prior to the introduction of Clorox's GreenWorks line had all been ineffective, and also that the new GreenWorks line was at least as effective as Clorox's existing product lines. The intention of this slogan and the associated advertising campaign has been interpreted as appealing to consumers' fears that products from companies with less [[brand recognition]] are less trustworthy or effective. Critics also pointed out that, despite its representation of GreenWorks products as \"green\" in the sense of being less harmful to the environment and/or consumers using them, the products contain a number of ingredients advocates of natural products have long campaigned against the use of in household products due to [[toxicity]] to humans or their environment.<ref name=\"Tennery_2009_Green\"/> All three implicit claims have been disputed, and some of their elements disproven, by environmental groups, consumer-protection groups, and the industry self-regulatory [[Better Business Bureau]].<ref name=\"NAD_2008_Clorox\"/>\n\n== Further reading ==\nWhile common usage of the term \"FUD\" is relatively recent and somewhat limited, the practice of casting unwarranted aspersions upon other persons, products or circumstances to further one's own goals may be as old as humanity; examples in classic literature include [[Iago]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello (Shakespeare)|Othello]]'', and the terms in the \"See also\" section [[#See also|below]] offer many further examples.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|\n* {{annotated link|Agent provocateur}}\n* {{annotated link|Agnotology}}\n* {{annotated link|Culture of fear}}\n* {{annotated link|Denial and deception}}\n* {{annotated link|Dihydrogen monoxide parody}}\n* {{annotated link|Discrediting tactic}}\n* {{annotated link|Dunning\u2013Kruger effect}}\n* {{annotated link|Embrace, extend, and extinguish}} (EEE)\n* {{annotated link|False flag}}\n* {{annotated link|Fearmongering}}\n* {{annotated link|Fnord}}\n* {{annotated link|Hoax}}\n* {{annotated link|Iago}}\n* {{annotated link|Moral panic}}\n* {{annotated link|Obscurantism}}\n* {{annotated link|Perception management}}\n* {{annotated link|Project Fear}}\n* {{annotated link|Propaganda}}\n* {{annotated link|Religious paranoia}}\n* {{annotated link|Scareware}}\n* {{annotated link|Swiftboating}}\n* {{annotated link|Tin foil hat}}\n* {{annotated link|Vaporware}}\n* {{annotated link|Whataboutism}}\n* {{annotated link|Doubt Is Their Product|''Doubt Is Their Product''}} (book)\n* {{annotated link|Merchants of Doubt|''Merchants of Doubt''}} (book)\n* {{annotated link|Merchants of Doubt (film)|''Merchants of Doubt''}} (film)\n}}\n* {{annotated link|Rational ignorance}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Yarbrough_1920\">{{cite book |author-first=Caesar Augustus |author-last=Yarbrough |title=The Roman Catholic Church Challenged in the Discussion of Thirty-two Questions with the Catholic Laymen's Association of Georgia |publisher=The Patriotic Societies of Macon |location=Macon, Georgia, USA |date=1920-05-22 |id=Cl.

false information}}\n{{Redirect|FUD|other uses|Fud (disambiguation){{!}}Fud}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\n'''Fear, uncertainty, and doubt''' (often shortened to '''FUD''') is a [[disinformation]] strategy used in sales, marketing, [[public relations]], politics, cults, and [[propaganda]]. FUD is generally a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and a manifestation of the [[appeal to fear]].\n\nWhile the phrase dates to at least the early 20th&nbsp;century, the present common usage of disinformation related to software, hardware and technology industries generally appeared in the 1970s to describe disinformation in the [[computer hardware]] industry, and has since been used more broadly.\n\n=={{anchor|IBM}}Definition==\nThe term \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt\" appeared as far back as the 1920s,<ref name=\"Yarbrough_1920\"/><ref name=\"Gardner_1926\"/> whereas the similar formulation \"doubts, fears, and uncertainties\" even reaches back to 1693 the least.<ref name=\"Payne_1695\"/><ref name=\"Payne_1708\"/> By 1975, the term was appearing abbreviated as FUD in marketing and sales contexts<ref name=\"Clothes_1975\"/> as well as in [[public relations]]:<ref name=\"LeadRefs000\"/>\n\n{{quote|One of the messages dealt with is FUD&mdash;the fear, uncertainty, and doubt on the part of customer and sales person alike that stifles the approach and greeting.<ref name=\"Clothes_1975\"/>}}\n\nThe abbreviation FUD is also alternatively rendered as \"fear, uncertainty, and disinformation\".<ref name=\"Netlingo_2002\"/>\n\nFUD was first used with its common current technology-related meaning by [[Gene Amdahl]] in 1975, after he left [[International Business Machines|IBM]] to found his own company, [[Amdahl Corporation|Amdahl Corp.]]:<ref name=\"JF\"/>\n\n{{quote|FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering Amdahl products.<ref name=\"JF\"/>}}\n\nThe term has also been attributed to veteran [[Morgan Stanley]] computer analyst Ulrich Weil. \n\nThis usage of FUD to describe disinformation in the [[computer hardware]] industry is said to have led to subsequent popularization of the term.<ref name=\"Elliott000\"/>\n \nAs [[Eric Steven Raymond]] wrote:<ref name=\"JF\"/>\n\n{{quote|The idea, of course, was to persuade buyers to go with safe IBM gear rather than with competitors' equipment. This implicit coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that ''Good Things'' would happen to people who stuck with IBM, but ''Dark Shadows'' loomed over the future of competitors' equipment or software. After 1991, the term has become generalized to refer to any kind of [[disinformation]] used as a competitive weapon.<ref name=\"JF\"/>}}\n\nBy spreading questionable information about the drawbacks of less well-known products, an established company can discourage decision-makers from choosing those products over its own, regardless of the relative ''technical'' merits. This is a recognized phenomenon, epitomized by the traditional axiom of purchasing agents that \"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM equipment\". The aim is to have [[Information technology|IT]] departments buy software they know to be technically inferior because upper management is more likely to [[brand recognition|recognize the brand]].\n\n== Examples ==\n=== Software producers ===\n==== Microsoft ====\nFrom the 1990s onward the term became most often associated with [[Microsoft]]. Roger Irwin said:<ref name=\"Irwin_1998\"/>\n{{quote|Microsoft soon picked up the art of FUD from IBM, and throughout the '80s used FUD as a primary marketing tool, much as IBM had in the previous decade. They ended up out FUD-ing IBM themselves during the [[OS/2]] vs Win3.1 years.}}\n\nIn 1996, [[Caldera, Inc.]] accused Microsoft of several [[anti-competitive practice]]s, including issuing [[vaporware]] announcements, creating FUD, and excluding competitors from participating in [[beta-test program]]s in order to destroy competition in the [[DOS]] market.<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Statement_of_facts\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_Fullstory_Tech\"/>\nOne of the claims was related to having modified [[Windows 3.1]] so that it would not run on [[DR DOS 6.0]] although there were no technical reasons for it not to work.<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Statement_of_facts\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1999_FactRel\"/> This was caused by the so-called [[AARD code]], some [[encrypted]] piece of code, which had been found in a number of Microsoft programs. The code would [[fake (deception)|fake]] nonsensical [[error message]]s if run on DR&nbsp;DOS, like:<ref name=\"Schulman_1993_AARD\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/><ref name=\"Reynolds_1991\"/>\n\n{{quote|Non-Fatal error detected: error #2726<br/>Please contact Windows 3.1 beta support<br/>Press ENTER to exit or C to continue<ref name=\"Schulman_1993_AARD\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/><ref name=\"Reynolds_1991\"/>}}\n\nIf the user chose to press {{keypress|C}}, Windows would continue to run on DR&nbsp;DOS without problems. While it had been already speculated in the industry that the purpose of this code was to create doubts about DR&nbsp;DOS's [[software incompatibility|compatibility]] and thereby destroy the product's [[reputation]],<ref name=\"Schulman_1993_AARD\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/> internal Microsoft memos published as part of the ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' [[antitrust case]] later revealed that the specific focus of these tests was in fact DR&nbsp;DOS.<ref name=\"Lea_1999_Register\"/> At one point, Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] sent a memo to a number of employees, reading\n{{quote|You never sent me a response on the question of what things an app would do that would make it run with [[MS-DOS]] and not run with DR-DOS. Is there [a] feature they have that might get in our way?<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Statement_of_facts\"/><ref name=\"cnet\"/>}} Microsoft Senior Vice President [[Brad Silverberg]] later sent another memo, stating\n{{quote|What the [user] is supposed to do is feel uncomfortable, and when he has bugs, suspect that the problem is DR-DOS and then go out to buy MS-DOS.<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Statement_of_facts\"/><ref name=\"cnet\"/>}} In 2000, Microsoft settled the [[Caldera v. Microsoft|lawsuit]] out-of-court for an undisclosed sum, which in 2009 was revealed to be {{currency|amount=280 million|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=yes}}.<ref name=\"Groklaw_2009_NovellWP\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_Microsoft_2000_Settlement\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2009_Memorandum\"/><ref name=\"Gomes_2000_Settlement\"/>\n\nAt around the same time, the leaked internal Microsoft \"[[Halloween documents]]\" stated \"[[Open source|OSS [Open Source Software]]] is long-term credible\u2026 [therefore] FUD tactics cannot be used to combat it.\"<ref name=\"ESR_Halloween\"/>\nOpen source software, and the [[Linux]] community in particular, are widely perceived as frequent targets of Microsoft's FUD:\n* Statements about the \"[[viral nature]]\"<ref name=\"Microsoft_Viral\"/> of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).\n* Statements that \"\u2026[[FOSS|FOSS [Free and open source software]]] infringes on no fewer than 235 Microsoft [[patent]]s\", before software patent law precedents were even established.<ref name=\"Parloff_2007_1\"/><ref name=\"Parloff_2007_2\"/>\n* Statements that [[Windows Server 2003]] has lower [[total cost of ownership]] (TCO) than Linux, in Microsoft's \"Get-The-Facts\" campaign. It turned out that they were comparing Linux on a very expensive [[IBM mainframe]] to Windows Server 2003 on an [[Intel Xeon]]-based server.<ref name=\"BBC_2004_Ad\"/><ref name=\"CNET_2004_Ad\"/>\n* A 2010 video claimed that [[OpenOffice.org]] had a higher long-term cost of ownership, as well as poor [[interoperability]] with [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft's own office suite]]. The video featured statements such as \"If an open source [[freeware]] solution breaks, who's gonna fix it?\"<ref name=\"Protalinski_2000_OpenOffice\"/><ref name=\"Microoft_2000_OpenOffice\"/>\n\n==== SCO v. IBM ====\n{{Main|SCO v. IBM}}\nThe [[SCO Group]]'s 2003 [[SCO v. IBM|lawsuit against IBM]], funded by [[Microsoft Halloween documents leak|Microsoft]], claiming {{currency|amount=5 billion|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}} in [[intellectual property]] infringements by the [[free software community]], is an example of FUD, according to IBM, which argued in its counterclaim that SCO was spreading \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt\".<ref name=\"Groklaw_2004_SCO-IBM-1\"/>\n\nMagistrate Judge [[Brooke C. Wells]] wrote (and Judge [[Dale Albert Kimball]] concurred) in her order limiting SCO's claims: \"The court finds SCO's arguments unpersuasive. SCO's arguments are akin to SCO telling IBM, 'sorry, we are not going to tell you what you did wrong because you already know\u2026' SCO was required to disclose in detail what it feels IBM misappropriated\u2026 the court finds it inexcusable that SCO is\u2026 not placing all the details on the table. Certainly if an individual were stopped and accused of [[shoplifting]] after walking out of [[Neiman Marcus]] they would expect to be eventually told what they allegedly stole. It would be absurd for an officer to tell the accused that 'you know what you stole, I'm not telling.'

(It later dropped to around<ref name=\"Yahoo_SCOX\"/> {{currency|amount=1.20|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}}&mdash;then crashed to under 50 cents on 13 August 2007, in the aftermath of a ruling that [[Novell]] owns the UNIX [[copyright]]s.)<ref name=\"AT_SCOX\"/>\n\n==== Apple ====\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s claim that [[Jailbreak (iPhone OS)|iPhone jailbreaking]] could potentially allow hackers to crash [[cell site|cell phone towers]] was described by [[Fred von Lohmann]], a representative of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), as a \"kind of theoretical threat\u2026more FUD than truth\u201d.<ref name=\"Kravets_2009_Apple\"/>\n\n=== Security industry ===\n{{Main|Appeal to fear}}\nFUD is widely recognized as a tactic to promote the sale or implementation of security products and measures. It is possible to find pages describing purely artificial problems. Such pages frequently contain links to the demonstrating source code that does not point to any valid location and sometimes even links that \"will execute malicious code on your machine regardless of current security software\", leading to pages without any executable code.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe drawback to the FUD tactic in this context is that, when the stated or implied threats fail to materialize over time, the customer or decision-maker frequently reacts by withdrawing budgeting or support from future security initiatives.<ref name=\"CXO_2003_FUD\"/>\n\nFUD has also been utilized in [[technical support scam]]s where fake error messages are used to scare unwitting computer users, especially the elderly or computer-illiterate, into paying for a supposed fix for a non-existent problem<ref name=\"unc\">{{cite web |title=Beware of tech support scams |url=http://news.unchealthcare.org/empnews/2017/july-6/beware-of-tech-support-scams |publisher=UNC Health and UNC School of Medicine |accessdate=7 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> to avoid being framed for criminal charges such as unpaid taxes, or in extreme cases, false accusations of illegal acts such as [[child pornography]].<ref name=\"panorama\">{{cite web |title=Panorama - Spying on the Scammers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000fzx2/panorama-spying-on-the-scammers |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Caltex ===\nThe FUD tactic was used by [[Caltex]] Australia in 2003. According to an internal memo, which was subsequently leaked, they wished to use FUD to destabilize franchisee confidence, and thus get a better deal for Caltex. This memo was used as an example of unconscionable behaviour in a [[Australian Senate|Senate]] inquiry. Senior management claimed that it was contrary to and did not reflect company principles.<ref name=\"Lilienthal_2004_Caltex\"/><ref name=\"ABC_2004_Caltex\"/><ref name=\"Benns_2004_Caltex\"/>\n\n=== Clorox ===\nIn 2008, [[Clorox]] was the subject of both consumer and industry criticism for advertising its [[Clorox#Green Works|Green Works]] line of allegedly [[environmentally friendly]] cleaning products using the [[slogan]], \"Finally, Green Works.\"<ref name=\"DeBare_2010_Clorox\"/> The slogan implied both that \"[[Environmentally friendly|green]]\" products manufactured by other companies which had been available to consumers prior to the introduction of Clorox's GreenWorks line had all been ineffective, and also that the new GreenWorks line was at least as effective as Clorox's existing product lines. The intention of this slogan and the associated advertising campaign has been interpreted as appealing to consumers' fears that products from companies with less [[brand recognition]] are less trustworthy or effective. Critics also pointed out that, despite its representation of GreenWorks products as \"green\" in the sense of being less harmful to the environment and/or consumers using them, the products contain a number of ingredients advocates of natural products have long campaigned against the use of in household products due to [[toxicity]] to humans or their environment.<ref name=\"Tennery_2009_Green\"/> All three implicit claims have been disputed, and some of their elements disproven, by environmental groups, consumer-protection groups, and the industry self-regulatory [[Better Business Bureau]].<ref name=\"NAD_2008_Clorox\"/>\n\n== Further reading ==\nWhile common usage of the term \"FUD\" is relatively recent and somewhat limited, the practice of casting unwarranted aspersions upon other persons, products or circumstances to further one's own goals may be as old as humanity; examples in classic literature include [[Iago]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello (Shakespeare)|Othello]]'', and the terms in the \"See also\" section [[#See also|below]] offer many further examples.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|\n* {{annotated link|Agent provocateur}}\n* {{annotated link|Agnotology}}\n* {{annotated link|Culture of fear}}\n* {{annotated link|Denial and deception}}\n* {{annotated link|Dihydrogen monoxide parody}}\n* {{annotated link|Discrediting tactic}}\n* {{annotated link|Dunning\u2013Kruger effect}}\n* {{annotated link|Embrace, extend, and extinguish}} (EEE)\n* {{annotated link|False flag}}\n* {{annotated link|Fearmongering}}\n* {{annotated link|Fnord}}\n* {{annotated link|Hoax}}\n* {{annotated link|Iago}}\n* {{annotated link|Moral panic}}\n* {{annotated link|Obscurantism}}\n* {{annotated link|Perception management}}\n* {{annotated link|Project Fear}}\n* {{annotated link|Propaganda}}\n* {{annotated link|Religious paranoia}}\n* {{annotated link|Scareware}}\n* {{annotated link|Swiftboating}}\n* {{annotated link|Tin foil hat}}\n* {{annotated link|Vaporware}}\n* {{annotated link|Whataboutism}}\n* {{annotated link|Doubt Is Their Product|''Doubt Is Their Product''}} (book)\n* {{annotated link|Merchants of Doubt|''Merchants of Doubt''}} (book)\n* {{annotated link|Merchants of Doubt (film)|''Merchants of Doubt''}} (film)\n}}\n* {{annotated link|Rational ignorance}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Yarbrough_1920\">{{cite book |author-first=Caesar Augustus |author-last=Yarbrough |title=The Roman Catholic Church Challenged in the Discussion of Thirty-two Questions with the Catholic Laymen's Association of Georgia |publisher=The Patriotic Societies of Macon |location=Macon, Georgia, USA |date=1920-05-22 |id=Cl.

The screenplay was written by [[Charles Lederer]] (with uncredited input from [[Eric Ambler]], William L. Driscoll, [[Borden Chase]], [[John Gay (screenwriter)|John Gay]] and [[Ben Hecht]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056264/fullcredits|title=Mutiny on the Bounty (1962): Full Cast & Crew|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}</ref> based on the novel ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (novel)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' by [[Charles Nordhoff]] and [[James Norman Hall]]. [[Bronis\u0142aw Kaper]] composed the score.\n\nThe film tells a fictionalized story of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|real-life mutiny]] led by [[Fletcher Christian]] against [[William Bligh]], captain of the [[HMS Bounty|HMAV ''Bounty'']], in 1789. It is the second American film to be based on the novel, the first being ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1935), also produced by MGM.  \n\n''Mutiny on the Bounty'' was the first motion picture filmed in the [[Ultra Panavision 70]] [[widescreen]] process. It was partly shot on location in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].  Panned by critics, the film was a [[box office bomb|box-office bomb]], losing more than $6 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 1787, the ''Bounty'' sets sail from Britain for [[Tahiti]] under the command of Captain William Bligh ([[Trevor Howard]]). His mission is to retrieve a shipload of [[breadfruit]] saplings and transport them to [[Jamaica]]. The government hopes it will thrive and provide a cheap source of food for the slaves.\n\nThe voyage gets off to a difficult start with the discovery that some cheese is missing. Seaman John Mills ([[Richard Harris]]) accuses Bligh, the true pilferer, and Bligh has Mills brutally flogged for showing contempt to his superior officer, to the disgust of his [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] second-in-command, 1st Lieutenant Fletcher Christian ([[Marlon Brando]]). The tone for the months to come is set by Bligh's ominous pronouncement: \"Cruelty with a purpose is not cruelty, it is efficiency.\" Aristocrat Christian is deeply offended by his ambitious captain.\n\nBligh tries to reach Tahiti sooner by attempting the shorter westbound route around [[Cape Horn]], a navigational nightmare. The strategy fails and the ''Bounty'' backtracks eastward, costing the mission much precious time. Singlemindedly, Bligh makes up the lost time by pushing the crew harder and cutting their rations.\n\nWhen the ''Bounty'' reaches her destination, the crew revels in the easygoing life of the tropical paradise \u2014 and in the free-love philosophies of the Tahitian women. Christian himself is smitten with Maimiti ([[Tarita Teriipaia]]), daughter of the Tahitian king. Bligh's agitation is further fueled by the fact that the dormancy period of the breadfruit means more months of delay until the plants can be potted. As departure day nears, three men, including seaman Mills, attempt to desert but are caught by Christian and clapped in irons by Bligh.\n\nOn the voyage to Jamaica, Bligh attempts to bring back twice the number of breadfruit plants to atone for his tardiness, and must reduce the water rations of the crew to water the extra plants. One member of the crew falls from the rigging to his death while attempting to retrieve the drinking ladle. Another assaults Bligh over conditions on the ship and is fatally [[keelhauled]]. Mills taunts Christian after each death, trying to egg him on to challenge Bligh. When a crewman becomes gravely ill from drinking seawater, Christian attempts to give him fresh water, in violation of the Captain's orders. Bligh strikes Christian when he ignores his second order to stop. In response, Christian strikes Bligh. Bligh informs Christian that he will hang for his actions when they reach port. With nothing left to lose, Christian takes command of the ship and sets Bligh and the loyalist members of the crew adrift in the [[longboat]] with navigational equipment, telling them to make for a local island. Bligh decides instead to cross much of the Pacific in order to reach British authorities sooner, He returns to Britain with remarkable speed.\n\nThe military court exonerates Bligh of misdeeds and recommends an expedition to arrest the mutineers and put them on trial, but it also comes to the conclusion that the appointment of Bligh as captain of The Bounty was wrong. In the meantime, Christian sails back to Tahiti to pick up supplies and the girlfriends of the crew. Then they go on to remote [[Pitcairn Island]]\u2014which is marked incorrectly on the charts\u2014to hide from the wrath of the [[Royal Navy]]. However, once on Pitcairn, Christian decides that it is their duty to return to Britain and testify to Bligh's wrongdoing, and he asks his men to sail with him. To prevent this possibility, the men set the ship on fire and Christian is fatally burned while trying to save it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as 1st Lt.

No film resulted. In 1945 [[Casey Wilson]] wrote a script for ''Christian of the Bounty'', which was to star [[Clark Gable]] as [[Fletcher Christian]] and focus on Christian's life on [[Pitcairn Island]].<ref name=\"new\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/11/02/archives/two-studios-plan-a-bounty-mutiny-mgm-and-paramount-race-to-complete.html|title=TWO STUDIOS PLAN A BOUNTY 'MUTINY'; M-G-M and Paramount Race to Complete Productions of Films on Sea Adventure|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 2, 1959|accessdate=July 12, 2018|author=Special to the New York Times|page=39}}</ref> This was never filmed.\n\nIn the 1950s, MGM remade a number of their earlier successes in color and widescreen formats, including ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1952 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]''. They decided to remake ''Mutiny on the Bounty,'' and in 1958 the studio announced that [[Aaron Rosenberg]] would produce the film.  [[Marlon Brando]] was mentioned as a possible star.<ref>{{cite news|title=MGM Wants Brando in 'Mutiny' Remake|last=Hopper |first=Hedda |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 9, 1958 |page=B10}}</ref> \n\n[[Eric Ambler]] was signed to write a script, at $5,000 a week. It was supposed to combine material from the Nordhoff and Hall novels ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' and ''Pitcairn Island.'' MGM also owned the rights to a third book, ''Men Against the Sea'', which dealt with Bligh's boat voyage after the mutiny. <ref name=\"new\"/>\n\nIn 1959, Paramount announced that it would make a rival Bounty film, to be written and directed by [[James Clavell]] and called ''The Mutineers.''  It would focus on the fate of the Muntineers on Pitcairn Island.<ref name=\"new\"/> However, this project was not made.\n\nMarlon Brando eventually signed with MGM, at a fee of $500,000 plus 10% of the profits. [[Carol Reed]] was hired to direct. In order to take full advantage of Technicolor and the widescreen format (shooting in [[Ultra Panavision 70|MGM Camera 65]]), the production was to be filmed on location in [[Tahiti]], with cinematographer [[Robert Surtees (cinematographer)|Robert Surtees]]. The film was set to begin shooting on October15, 1960.

Filming was difficult, in part because the script was being rewritten and Brando was reportedly ad-libbing much of his part. Costs were also high due to the remote location.<ref name=\"marlon\">{{cite news|title=TAHITI WAS PARADISE |date=December 17, 1961 |work=[[The Times of India]] |publisher=[[The Times Group]] |page=A6|id={{ProQuest|744310855}} }}</ref> \n\nHowever Marlon Brando later wrote \"realities surpassed even my fantasies about Tahiti, and I had some of the best times of my life making ''Mutiny on the Bounty''...

Filming halted and the unit returned to Hollywood. MGM demanded that Reed finish the film within 100 days. Reed said he needed 139. The studio fired him. Brando claims in his memoirs that MGM fired Reed because he wanted to make Bligh the hero. <ref>Brando p 270</ref>\n\n===Lewis Milestone===\nReed was replaced by Lewis Milestone, in what would be his last stint directing a theatrical film. \"Reed was used to making his own pictures,\" said Milestone. \"He was not used to producer, studio and star interference. But those of us who have been around Hollywood are like alley cats. We know this style.

Milestone said that for his first two weeks on the film \"Brando behaved himself and I got a lot of stuff done\", such as the arrival of the Bounty at Tahiti. The director says he \"got on beautifully with\" the British actors. \"They were real human beings and I had a lot of fun.\"<ref>Higham p 193</ref>\n\nMilestone says \"the trouble started\" after the first two weeks. He summarised the cause: \"The producer made a number of promises to Marlon Brando which he couldn't keep. It was an impossible situation because, right or wrong, the man simply took charge of everything. You had the option of sitting and watching him or turning your back on him. Neither the producers nor I could do anything about it.\"<ref>Higham p 193</ref>\n\nThe unit returned to Tahiti in April 1961. Filming was plagued by bad weather and script problems. Richard Harris clashed with Brando, and Brando was frequently late to set and difficult while filming.<ref name=\"phil\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=How Richard Harris Told Off Brando|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date= 18 February 1962|page= A4}}</ref> \n\n\"Marlon did not have approval of the story,\" said Milestone. \"But he did have approval of himself. If Brando did not like something, he would just stand in front of the camera and not act. He thought only of himself. At the same time, he was right in many things that he wanted. He is too cerebral to play the part of Mr. Christian the way Clark Gable played it.\"<ref name=\"cost\"/>\n\nMilestone said the script was constantly being rewritten by Charles Lederer on set, with input from Rosenberg, [[Sol Siegel]] and [[Joseph Vogel]], as well as Brando. Milestone said Lederer would often work on the script with Brando in the morning, and shooting would not start until the afternoon. Milestone said \"you had the option of shooting it, but since Marlon Brando was going to supervise it anyway, I waited until someone yelled 'camera' and went off to sit down somewhere and read the paper.\"<ref>Highman p 193</ref>\n\nThe film ended up costing $10 million more than originally expected.<ref name=\"cost\">{{cite news|date=March 25, 1962|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/03/25/archives/hollywood-at-sea-bounty-director-blames-a-timorous-management-for.html|first=Murray|last=Schumach|title=HOLLYWOOD AT SEA; 'Bounty' Director Blames a Timorous Management for Tumultuous Saga|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> Adding to the turmoil of the production's woes, a Tahitian was killed while filming a canoe sequence.\n\n\"I have been in this business a few days but I never saw anything like this,\" said Milestone. \"It was like being in a hurricane on a rudderless ship without a captain. I thought when I took the job that it would be a nice trip. By the time it was finished, I felt as though I had been shanghaied.\"<ref name=\"cost\"/>\n\n\"The big trouble was lack of guts by management at Metro,\" said Milestone. \"Lack of vision. When they realised there was so much trouble with the script they should have stopped the whole damn production.

The screenplay was written by [[Charles Lederer]] (with uncredited input from [[Eric Ambler]], William L. Driscoll, [[Borden Chase]], [[John Gay (screenwriter)|John Gay]] and [[Ben Hecht]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056264/fullcredits|title=Mutiny on the Bounty (1962): Full Cast & Crew|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}</ref> based on the novel ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (novel)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' by [[Charles Nordhoff]] and [[James Norman Hall]]. [[Bronis\u0142aw Kaper]] composed the score.\n\nThe film tells a fictionalized story of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|real-life mutiny]] led by [[Fletcher Christian]] against [[William Bligh]], captain of the [[HMS Bounty|HMAV ''Bounty'']], in 1789. It is the second American film to be based on the novel, the first being ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1935), also produced by MGM.  \n\n''Mutiny on the Bounty'' was the first motion picture filmed in the [[Ultra Panavision 70]] [[widescreen]] process. It was partly shot on location in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].  Panned by critics, the film was a [[box office bomb|box-office bomb]], losing more than $6 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 1787, the ''Bounty'' sets sail from Britain for [[Tahiti]] under the command of Captain William Bligh ([[Trevor Howard]]). His mission is to retrieve a shipload of [[breadfruit]] saplings and transport them to [[Jamaica]]. The governments hopes it will thrive and provide a cheap source of food for the slaves.\n\nThe voyage gets off to a difficult start with the discovery that some cheese is missing. Seaman John Mills ([[Richard Harris]]) accuses Bligh, the true pilferer, and Bligh has Mills brutally flogged for showing contempt to his superior officer, to the disgust of his [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] second-in-command, 1st Lieutenant Fletcher Christian ([[Marlon Brando]]). The tone for the months to come is set by Bligh's ominous pronouncement: \"Cruelty with a purpose is not cruelty, it is efficiency.\" Aristocrat Christian is deeply offended by his ambitious captain.\n\nBligh tries to reach Tahiti sooner by attempting the shorter westbound route around [[Cape Horn]], a navigational nightmare. The strategy fails and the ''Bounty'' backtracks eastward, costing the mission much precious time. Singlemindedly, Bligh makes up the lost time by pushing the crew harder and cutting their rations.\n\nWhen the ''Bounty'' reaches her destination, the crew revels in the easygoing life of the tropical paradise \u2014 and in the free-love philosophies of the Tahitian women. Christian himself is smitten with Maimiti ([[Tarita Teriipaia]]), daughter of the Tahitian king. Bligh's agitation is further fueled by the fact that the dormancy period of the breadfruit means more months of delay until the plants can be potted. As departure day nears, three men, including seaman Mills, attempt to desert but are caught by Christian and clapped in irons by Bligh.\n\nOn the voyage to Jamaica, Bligh attempts to bring back twice the number of breadfruit plants to atone for his tardiness, and must reduce the water rations of the crew to water the extra plants. One member of the crew falls from the rigging to his death while attempting to retrieve the drinking ladle. Another assaults Bligh over conditions on the ship and is fatally [[keelhauled]]. Mills taunts Christian after each death, trying to egg him on to challenge Bligh. When a crewman becomes gravely ill from drinking seawater, Christian attempts to give him fresh water, in violation of the Captain's orders. Bligh strikes Christian when he ignores his second order to stop. In response, Christian strikes Bligh. Bligh informs Christian that he will hang for his actions when they reach port. With nothing left to lose, Christian takes command of the ship and sets Bligh and the loyalist members of the crew adrift in the [[longboat]] with navigational equipment, telling them to make for a local island. Bligh decides instead to cross much of the Pacific in order to reach British authorities sooner, He returns to Britain with remarkable speed.\n\nThe military court exonerates Bligh of misdeeds and recommends an expedition to arrest the mutineers and put them on trial, but it also comes to the conclusion that the appointment of Bligh as captain of The Bounty was wrong. In the meantime, Christian sails back to Tahiti to pick up supplies and the girlfriends of the crew. Then they go on to remote [[Pitcairn Island]]\u2014which is marked incorrectly on the charts\u2014to hide from the wrath of the [[Royal Navy]]. However, once on Pitcairn, Christian decides that it is their duty to return to Britain and testify to Bligh's wrongdoing, and he asks his men to sail with him. To prevent this possibility, the men set the ship on fire and Christian is fatally burned while trying to save it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as 1st Lt.

No film resulted. In 1945 [[Casey Wilson]] wrote a script for ''Christian of the Bounty'', which was to star [[Clark Gable]] as [[Fletcher Christian]] and focus on Christian's life on [[Pitcairn Island]].<ref name=\"new\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/11/02/archives/two-studios-plan-a-bounty-mutiny-mgm-and-paramount-race-to-complete.html|title=TWO STUDIOS PLAN A BOUNTY 'MUTINY'; M-G-M and Paramount Race to Complete Productions of Films on Sea Adventure|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 2, 1959|accessdate=July 12, 2018|author=Special to the New York Times|page=39}}</ref> This was never filmed.\n\nIn the 1950s, MGM remade a number of their earlier successes in color and widescreen formats, including ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1952 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]''. They decided to remake ''Mutiny on the Bounty,'' and in 1958 the studio announced that [[Aaron Rosenberg]] would produce the film.  [[Marlon Brando]] was mentioned as a possible star.<ref>{{cite news|title=MGM Wants Brando in 'Mutiny' Remake|last=Hopper |first=Hedda |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 9, 1958 |page=B10}}</ref> \n\n[[Eric Ambler]] was signed to write a script, at $5,000 a week. It was supposed to combine material from the Nordhoff and Hall novels ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' and ''Pitcairn Island.'' MGM also owned the rights to a third book, ''Men Against the Sea'', which dealt with Bligh's boat voyage after the mutiny. <ref name=\"new\"/>\n\nIn 1959, Paramount announced that it would make a rival Bounty film, to be written and directed by [[James Clavell]] and called ''The Mutineers.''  It would focus on the fate of the Muntineers on Pitcairn Island.<ref name=\"new\"/> However, this project was not made.\n\nMarlon Brando eventually signed with MGM, at a fee of $500,000 plus 10% of the profits. [[Carol Reed]] was hired to direct. In order to take full advantage of Technicolor and the widescreen format (shooting in [[Ultra Panavision 70|MGM Camera 65]]), the production was to be filmed on location in [[Tahiti]], with cinematographer [[Robert Surtees (cinematographer)|Robert Surtees]]. The film was set to begin shooting on October15, 1960.

Filming was difficult, in part because the script was being rewritten and Brando was reportedly ad-libbing much of his part.

Filming halted and the unit returned to Hollywood. MGM demanded that Reed finish the film within 100 days. Reed said he needed 139. The studio fired him. Brando claims in his memoirs that MGM fired Reed because he wanted to make Bligh the hero. <ref>Brando p 270</ref>\n\n===Lewis Milestone===\nReed was replaced by Lewis Milestone, in what would be his last stint directing a theatrical film. \"Reed was used to making his own pictures,\" said Milestone. \"He was not used to producer, studio and star interference. But those of us who have been around Hollywood are like alley cats. We know this style. We know how to survive.\"<ref name=\"cost\"/>\n\nMilestone later said \"I felt it would be an easy assignment because they'd been on it for months and there surely couldn't be much left to do.\" <ref>Higham p 193</ref> However he says he found that they had only shot one seven minute scene, where Trevor Howard issues instructions about obtaining breadfruit.<ref name=\"cost\"/> \n\nFilming resumed in March 1961 at MGM studios. Milestone said that for his first two weeks on the film \"Brando behaved himself and I got a lot of stuff done\", such as the arrival of the Bounty at Tahiti. The director says he \"got on beautifully with\" the British actors. \"They were real human beings and I had a lot of fun.\"<ref>Higham p 193</ref>\n\nMilestone says \"the trouble started\" after the first two weeks. He summarised the cause: \"The producer made a number of promises to Marlon Brando which he couldn't keep. It was an impossible situation because, right or wrong, the man simply took charge of everything. You had the option of sitting and watching him or turning your back on him. Neither the producers nor I could do anything about it.\"<ref>Higham p 193</ref>\n\nThe unit returned to Tahiti in April 1961. Filming was plagued by bad weather and script problems. Richard Harris clashed with Brando, and Brando was frequently late to set and difficult while filming.<ref name=\"phil\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=How Richard Harris Told Off Brando|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date= 18 February 1962|page= A4}}</ref> \n\n\"Marlon did not have approval of the story,\" said Milestone. \"But he did have approval of himself. If Brando did not like something, he would just stand in front of the camera and not act. He thought only of himself. At the same time, he was right in many things that he wanted. He is too cerebral to play the part of Mr. Christian the way Clark Gable played it.\"<ref name=\"cost\"/>\n\nMilestone said the script was constantly being rewritten by Charles Lederer on set, with input from Rosenberg, [[Sol Siegel]] and [[Joseph Vogel]], as well as Brando. Milestone said Lederer would often work on the script with Brando in the morning, and shooting would not start until the afternoon. Milestone said \"you had the option of shooting it, but since Marlon Brando was going to supervise it anyway, I waited until someone yelled 'camera' and went off to sit down somewhere and read the paper.\"<ref>Highman p 193</ref>\n\nThe film ended up costing $10 million more than originally expected.<ref name=\"cost\">{{cite news|date=March 25, 1962|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/03/25/archives/hollywood-at-sea-bounty-director-blames-a-timorous-management-for.html|first=Murray|last=Schumach|title=HOLLYWOOD AT SEA; 'Bounty' Director Blames a Timorous Management for Tumultuous Saga|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> Adding to the turmoil of the production's woes, a Tahitian was killed while filming a canoe sequence.\n\n\"I have been in this business a few days but I never saw anything like this,\" said Milestone. \"It was like being in a hurricane on a rudderless ship without a captain. I thought when I took the job that it would be a nice trip. By the time it was finished, I felt as though I had been shanghaied.\"<ref name=\"cost\"/>\n\n\"The big trouble was lack of guts by management at Metro,\" said Milestone. \"Lack of vision. When they realised there was so much trouble with the script they should have stopped the whole damn production. If they did not like Marlon's behavior they should have told him that he must do as they wished or else they should have taken him out of the picture.

A number of writers, including Brando, pitched ideas. Eventually, [[Billy Wilder]] suggested the ending that was shot.<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/marlonbrando00bosw/page/201 201]|first=Patricia|last=Bosworth|publisher=Thorndike|year=2001|title=Marlon Brando|url=https://archive.org/details/marlonbrando00bosw|url-access=registration}}</ref> Milestone refused to direct it, so  [[George Seaton]] shot Christian's death scene in August 1962.<ref>Liz Is Coming Home; Has Job Waiting for Her\nHopper, Hedda.
