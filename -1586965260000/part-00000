Launched in 1981 on the [[Renault 9]] and [[Renault 11]], it has been the mainstay of Renault's engine lineup through the early 2000s in a succession of increasingly powerful petrol and Diesel variants in [[overhead camshaft]] configurations.  It was also Renault's first production four-valve design.  It is being replaced by the M engine resp.

A G7R petrol and a G8T Diesel variant were in development when Renault announced a merger with [[Volvo]] who was designing its own modular family along the same lines. The group decided to cancel the petrol versions, but diesel production started in 1993 and they were built for nearly two decades, until 2011. Despite the breakdown of the merger in 1993, Renault did use Volvo petrol engines ([[#N|Type N]]) in its mid- and full-size models until the early 2000s.\n\n* G8T/G9T:  2188 cc\n* G9U:      2464 cc\n\n===H===\n{{main article|Nissan HR engine}}\n'''H engines''' summarize two families of gasoline engines, the smaller with a max. cylinder bore of 72.2 mm and a larger family with typically 78 mm bore:\n\n#The smaller family covers 0.8 - 1.33 litres of swept volume and was co-developed by Renault, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan. The largest naturally aspirated version has three cylinders and 1.0L, four cylinder engines are not known without turbocharging. In most cases Renault or Mercedes introduced these engines into their cars. The 1.0 litre H4D is [[Renault Triber|here]] named (Nissan) BR10, but source/origin of this info is unclear. \n\n#The bigger fammily covers 1.0 - 1.6 litres of swept volume and are co-developed by Renault and Nissan with no known involvement from Mercedes-Benz and Mercedes-Benz does not utilize any one of these engines. Engines are mostly naturally aspirated while some versions with turbo or super charging are available. Most engines had been introduced by Nissan. \n\nMultiple usage of the Renault '''H series''' resp. Nissan '''HR''' name plates may cause some confusion because both families offer a three cylinder 1.0L version and another 1.2L version with 3 resp. 4 cylinders. It appears to be that the earlier engine was named HR10 (bore 78mm x 69.7 mm stroke) while the later got HRA0 (72.2 x  83.1) resp. the earlier was named HR12 (78 x 83.6) and the later got HRA2 (72.2 x 73.1). Renault may not suffer from this because they never utilized the bigger three cylinder engines. Nonetheless both families have [[DOHC]] and an aluminium alloy crankcase and cylinder head. For this engine family some of the naming system has been taken over from Nissan: 't' means 'turbo-charged' and 'k' stands for 'kaizen' which means 'change for better' or 'continuous improvement' in Japanese.\n\n* 02/2012- : '''H5Ft''', 1197/1198 cc, turbo-charged petrol engine used on [[Renault Clio#Clio IV|Renault Clio IV]], [[Renault Captur]], [[Renault Kangoo#Kangoo II (2007\u2013present)|Renault Kangoo II]], [[Renault M\u00e9gane#M\u00e9gane III (2008\u20132016)|Renault M\u00e9gane III]], [[Renault M\u00e9gane#M\u00e9gane IV (2016\u2013)|Renault M\u00e9gane IV]], [[Renault Sc\u00e9nic#Sc\u00e9nic III|Renault Sc\u00e9nic III]], [[Renault Sc\u00e9nic#Sc\u00e9nic IV (2016-present)|Renault Sc\u00e9nic IV]], [[Renault Kadjar]], [[Dacia Lodgy]], [[Dacia Dokker]], [[Dacia Duster]]\n\n* 05/2012- : '''H4Bt''', 898 cc, turbo-charged petrol engine used on [[Dacia Sandero|Dacia Sandero II]], [[Dacia Logan|Dacia Logan II]], [[Nissan Micra]], [[Renault Clio#IV|Renault Clio IV]], [[Renault Captur]], [[Renault Twingo|Renault Twingo III]], [[Smart Fortwo]]\n\n* 11/2014- : '''H4D''', 999 cc, n/a petrol engine used on [[Renault Twingo]], [[Renault Triber]]\n* 09/2015- : '''0.8L''', 0.8 litres, n/a petrol engine first (and solely?) seen on [[Renault Kwid]]\n* 05/2018- : '''H5Ht''', 1332 cc, used on [[Mercedes-Benz_A-Class_(W177)|Mercedes A class(W177)]] and other compact cars, Renault Scenic IV, Renault Captur, Renault Megane IV, Renault Clio V, Nissan Qashqai, Renault Kadjar, Dacia Duster, Renault Samsung XM3\n* 04/2020- : '''H4Dt''', 999 cc, turbo-charged petrol engine used on [[Renault Clio]], [[Nissan Almera]]\n\nand:\n\n* late 2008- : '''H4Jt''', 1397 cc, turbo-charged petrol engine used on [[Renault M\u00e9gane]]\n* 04/2009- : '''H4M''', 1598 cc, petrol engine used on [[Renault Samsung SM3]]\n* 03/2010- : '''H4K''', 1498cc, petrol engine used on Renault Duster, Renault Captur\n* 09/2012- : '''H4Mk''', 1598 cc, updated H4M petrol engine used on [[Renault Samsung SM3]]\n\n===J===\n{{main article|Douvrin engine}}\nThe J family (also referred to as the [[Douvrin engine]]) was an all-aluminum [[overhead camshaft]] inline-4 design jointly developed with [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn|PSA]].

A G7R petrol and a G8T Diesel variant were in development when Renault announced a merger with [[Volvo]] who was designing its own modular family along the same lines. The group decided to cancel the petrol versions, but diesel production started in 1993 and they were built for nearly two decades, until 2011. Despite the breakdown of the merger in 1993, Renault did use Volvo petrol engines ([[#N|Type N]]) in its mid- and full-size models until the early 2000s.\n\n* G8T/G9T:  2188 cc\n* G9U:      2464 cc\n\n===H===\n{{main article|Nissan HR engine}}\n'''H engines''' summarize two families of gasoline engines, the smaller with a max. cylinder bore of 72.2 mm and a larger family with typically 78 mm bore:\n\n#The smaller family covers 0.8 - 1.33 litres of swept volume and was co-developed by Renault, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan. The largest naturally aspirated version has three cylinders and 1.0L, four cylinder engines are not known without turbocharging. In most cases Renault or Mercedes introduced these engines into their cars. The 1.0 litre H4D is [[Renault Triber|here]] named (Nissan) BR10, but source/origin of this info is unclear. \n\n#The bigger fammily covers 1.0 - 1.6 litres of swept volume and are co-developed by Renault and Nissan with no known involvement from Mercedes-Benz and Mercedes-Benz does not utilize any one of these engines. Engines are mostly naturally aspirated while some versions with turbo or super charging are available. Most engines had been introduced by Nissan. \n\nMultiple usage of the Renault '''H series''' resp. Nissan '''HR''' name plates may cause some confusion because both families offer a three cylinder 1.0L version and another 1.2L version with 3 resp. 4 cylinders. It appears to be that the earlier engine was named HR10 (bore 78mm x 69.7 mm stroke) while the later got HRA0 (72.2 x  83.1) resp. the earlier was named HR12 (78 x 83.6) and the later got HRA2 (72.2 x 73.1). Renault may not suffer from this because they never utilized the bigger three cylinder engines. Nonetheless both families have [[DOHC]] and an aluminium alloy crankcase and cylinder head. For this engine family some of the naming system has been taken over from Nissan: 't' means 'turbo-charged' and 'k' stands for 'kaizen' which means 'change for better' or 'continuous improvement' in Japanese.\n\n* 02/2012- : '''H5Ft''', 1197/1198 cc, turbo-charged petrol engine used on [[Renault Clio#Clio IV|Renault Clio IV]], [[Renault Captur]], [[Renault Kangoo#Kangoo II (2007\u2013present)|Renault Kangoo II]], [[Renault M\u00e9gane#M\u00e9gane III (2008\u20132016)|Renault M\u00e9gane III]], [[Renault M\u00e9gane#M\u00e9gane IV (2016\u2013)|Renault M\u00e9gane IV]], [[Renault Sc\u00e9nic#Sc\u00e9nic III|Renault Sc\u00e9nic III]], [[Renault Sc\u00e9nic#Sc\u00e9nic IV (2016-present)|Renault Sc\u00e9nic IV]], [[Renault Kadjar]], [[Dacia Lodgy]], [[Dacia Dokker]], [[Dacia Duster]]\n\n* 05/2012- : '''H4Bt''', 898 cc, turbo-charged petrol engine used on [[Dacia Sandero|Dacia Sandero II]], [[Dacia Logan|Dacia Logan II]], [[Nissan Micra]], [[Renault Clio#IV|Renault Clio IV]], [[Renault Captur]], [[Renault Twingo|Renault Twingo III]], [[Smart Fortwo]]\n\n* 11/2014- : '''H4D''', 999 cc, n/a petrol engine used on [[Renault Twingo]], [[Renault Triber]]\n* 09/2015- : '''0.8L''', 0.8 litres, n/a petrol engine first (and solely?) seen on [[Renault Kwid]]\n* 05/2018- : '''H5Ht''', 1332 cc, used on [[Mercedes-Benz_A-Class_(W177)|Mercedes A class(W177)]] and other compact cars, Renault Scenic IV, Renault Captur, Renault Megane IV, Renault Clio V, Nissan Qashqai, Renault Kadjar, Dacia Duster, Renault Samsung XM3\n* 04/2020- : '''H4Dt''', 999 cc, turbo-charged petrol engine used on [[Renault Clio]], [[Nissan Almera]]\n\nand:\n\n* late 2008- : '''H4Jt''', 1397 cc, turbo-charged petrol engine used on [[Renault M\u00e9gane]]\n* 04/2009- : '''H4M''', 1598 cc, petrol engine used on [[Renault Samsung SM3]]\n* 03/2010- : '''H4K''', 1498cc, petrol engine used on Renault Duster, Renault Captur\n* 09/2012- : '''H4Mk''', 1598 cc, updated H4M petrol engine used on [[Renault Samsung SM3]]\n\n===J===\n{{main article|Douvrin engine}}\nThe J family (also referred to as the [[Douvrin engine]]) was an all-aluminum [[overhead camshaft]] inline-4 design jointly developed with [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn|PSA]].

The royalists ousted the Somers Isles Company's Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimingham as their leader.

The Government of Bermuda eventually reached an agreement with the Parliamentarians in England which left the status quo in Bermuda.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Later 17th century===\n[[File:Bermuda Gazette - 12 November 1796.jpg|thumb|right|''Bermuda Gazette'' of 12 November 1796, calling for [[privateer]]ing against Spain and its allies; it has advertisements for crew for two privateer vessels.]]\nIn the 17th century, the Somers Isles Company suppressed shipbuilding, as it needed Bermudians to farm in order for it to generate income from the land. The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the company's charter in 1684, and the company was dissolved.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda\"/>\n\nBermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermudians also vigorously pursued [[whaling]], [[privateering]], and the merchant trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the [[Royal Navy]]. The Bermuda sloop {{HMS|Pickle|1800|6}} carried dispatches of the victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], and news of the death of [[Admiral Lord Nelson|Admiral Nelson]], to England.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Bermuda and the American War of Independence===\nBermuda's ambivalence towards the American rebellion changed in September 1774, when the [[Continental Congress]] resolved to ban trade with Great Britain, Ireland, and the West Indies after 10 September 1775. Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, [[Henry Tucker (President of the Council of Bermuda)|the Tucker Family]] met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]]. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with [[Peyton Randolph]] and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with [[George Washington]].<ref name=Jarvis>{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Michael|title=In the Eye of All Trade|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807872840|pages=385\u2013389}}</ref>\n\nThree American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 1775, 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while Governor [[George James Bruere]] slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda acquired a reputation for disloyalty. Later that year, the British Parliament passed the [[Prohibitory Act]] to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS ''Scorpion'' to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well-established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with [[St. Eustatius]] until 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of privateers.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|389\u2013415}}\n\nIn June 1776, HMS ''Nautilus'' secured the island, followed by {{HMS|Galatea|1776|6}} in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of ''Nautilus'' in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]] refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major [[William Sutherland (British Army officer)|William Sutherland]]. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778\u20131779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combined efforts of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist privateers]], such that famine struck the island in 1779.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|416\u2013427}}\n\nThe death of George Bruere in 1780 turned the governorship over to his son, George Jr., an active loyalist.

After the acknowledgement by the British Government of the independence of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen continental colonies]] (including Virginia and the Carolinas) in 1783, Bermuda was generally grouped regionally by the British Government with [[The Maritimes]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], substantially nearer to Bermuda than is the Caribbean. However, with the confederation of Canada and the Maritimes and their attainment of [[Dominion]] status in the 1860s, the British political, naval and military hierarchy in Bermuda became increasingly separated from that of the Canadian Government (the [[Royal Navy]] headquarters for the [[North America and West Indies Station]] had spent summers at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and winters at Bermuda, but settled at Bermuda year round with the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax]] finally being transferred to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in 1907, and the [[Bermuda Garrison]] had been placed under the military Commander-in-Chief America in New York during the American War of Independence, and had been part of the Nova Scotia Command thereafter, but became the separate ''Bermuda Command'' from the 1860s with the Major-General or Lieutenant-General appointed as Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda also filling the civil role of [[Governor of Bermuda]]), and Bermuda was increasingly perceived by the British Government as in, or at least grouped for convenience with, the British West Indies (although the established [[Church of England]] in Bermuda, which from 1825 to 1839 had been attached to the See of [[Nova Scotia]]) remained part of the [[Diocese of Newfoundland|Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda]] until 1879, when the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop). Newfoundland attained Dominion status in 1907, leaving the nearest other territories to Bermuda that were still within the [[Commonwealth realm|British Realm]] (a term which replaced ''Dominion'' in 1952 as the dominions and many colonies moved towards full political independence) as the British colonies in the [[British West Indies]].\n\n\nBermuda became an associate member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) in July 2003, despite not being in the Caribbean region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-online.org/bdagovt.htm |title= Bermuda Government today |work=Bermuda-Online.org |accessdate =9 July 2010 |quote=In July 2003, Bermuda formally joined the Caribbean Community as an Associate Member (non-voting member), in certain areas but not in others.

For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to [[privateering]] at every opportunity. The Bermuda government maintained a local (infantry) militia and fortified coastal artillery batteries manned by volunteer artillerymen. Bermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targeted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October, 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia and coastal artillery), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's barrier reef, coastal artillery batteries and  militia provided a defence too powerful for the fleet sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the [[Royal Navy]]. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].\n\nDue to its isolated location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] were operating [[Seaplane]] bases on Bermuda.\n\nIn May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.</ref> In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). The US Army established the [[Bermuda Base Command]] in 1941 to co-ordinate its [[USAAF|air]], anti-aircraft, and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] assets during the war. The US Navy operated a [[USN Submarine Base, Ordnance Island, Bermuda|submarine base]] on [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]] from 1942 through 1945.<ref name=\"bermuda-online.org\"/>\n\nConstruction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of {{convert|5.8|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[US Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[US Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.\n\nThe original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a [[seaplane]] base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, [[US Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as [[Naval Facility Bermuda]] (NAVFAC Bermuda), a submarine-detecting [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility in the Tudor Hill area; it was converted from a US Army coast artillery bunker in 1954 and operated until 1995. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nCanada, which had operated a war-time naval base, [[HMCS Somers Isles|HMCS ''Somers Isles'']], on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time.\n\nIn the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Malabar'']], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.\n\n[[File:HMS Ambuscade in Bermuda.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Ambuscade (F172)|HMS ''Ambuscade'']] at the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard in 1988]]]]\nBermudians served in the British armed forces during both [[World War I]] and World War II. After the latter, Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey. When promoted to brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.\n\nToday, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps|naval]] and army cadet corps, is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.\n\nIn early 2020 Bermuda formed the Bermuda Coast Guard. Its 24-hour on-duty service includes search and rescue, counter-narcotics operations, border control, and protection of Bermuda's maritime interests. The Bermuda Coast Guard will interact with the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda Police Service.<ref>https://www.gov.bm/articles/launch-bermuda-coast-guard</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of Bermuda}}\n[[File:Front Street, Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Front Street, Hamilton]]\nBanking and other financial services form the largest sector of the economy at circa 85% of GDP, with tourism being the second largest industry at 5%.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/><ref name=Smithsonian/> Industrial and agriculture activities occur, however these are on a very limited scale and Bermuda is heavily reliant on imports.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/> Living standards are high and as of 2019 Bermuda has the 6th highest GDP per capita in the world.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/>\n\n===Currency===\nIn 1970 the country switched its currency from the [[Bermudian pound]] to the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] at par with the US dollar.

The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single-gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools, which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys' school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s, and in 1996, one of the aided schools became a private school.\n\nPrior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formerly maintained \"white\" schools and both single-sex schools opted to become private schools.

English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] ones.\n\nA second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.\n\nThe first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was ''[[Mary Prince#Publication of The History of Mary Prince|The History of Mary Prince]]'', a [[slave narrative]] by [[Mary Prince]]. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]]. [[Graham Ingham|Ernest Graham Ingham]], an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist [[Brian Burland]] (1931\u2013 2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, [[Angela Barry]] has won critical recognition for her published fiction.\n\n===Arts===\n{{see also|Music of Bermuda}}\nMusic and dance are an important part of Bermudian culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. Local icons, [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], performed calypso music for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''. While calypso appealed more to tourists than to the local residents, [[reggae]] has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrants.\n[[File:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|Gombey dancers from Bermuda at the 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C.]]\nNoted Bermudian musicians include [[tenor|operatic tenor]] Dr. Gary Burgess; jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]]; singer-songwriter and poet, [[Heather Nova]], and her brother [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], reggae musician; classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]]; and more recently, [[dancehall]] artist [[Collie Buddz]].\n\nThe dances of the colourful [[Gombey]] dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001, they performed at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. These Gombey Dancers continue to showcase their work for locals and visitors during the Harbour Nights festival on Bermuda's Front Street every Wednesday evening (during the summer months) and draw very large crowds.\n\nBermuda's early literature was limited to the works of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the islands. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, \"Battle of the Summer Islands\" (1645).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|title=The Battle Of The Summer Islands : Canto 1 \u2013 Poem by Edmund Waller|website=poemhunter.com|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008224321/http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/217/0304.html|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907\u201321), Volume VII.

The cup was contested annually by teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units stationed in Bermuda.]]\n\nMany sports popular today were formalised by British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public schools]] and universities in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the [[British empire]], and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as [[the Football Association]] (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players. The [[Bermuda national football team]] managed to qualify to the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the country's first ever major football competition.\n\nThe professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby football]], and even [[Lawn tennis|tennis]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to [[Yacht racing|sail racing]], founding the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]]). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.\n\n[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a [[One-Day International]] (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual \"Cup Match\" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark ''forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery''. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the ''St. George's Garrison'' (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).<ref>Stranack</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16\u201317 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009.

Football did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the [[Second World War]], though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major-General Sir [[George Bullock (British Army officer)|George Mackworth Bullock]] in 1913. A combined team of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (BMI) defeated {{HMS|Malabar|shore establishment|6}} to win the cup on 21 March 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.<ref>''Bermuda Militia Win Governor's Football Cup''. The Recorder. Page 1. City of Hamilton, Bermuda. 24th of March, 1943.</ref> Bermuda's most prominent footballers are [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Kyle Lightbourne]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Nahki Wells]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team played in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]] but folded in 2013.\n\n[[Sailing]], [[fishing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport\u2013Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref> In December 2013, Bermuda's bid to host the [[2017 America's Cup]] was announced.\n\nAt the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events.

The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the company's charter in 1684, and the company was dissolved.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda\"/>\n\nBermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermudians also vigorously pursued [[whaling]], [[privateering]], and the merchant trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the [[Royal Navy]].

Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, [[Henry Tucker (President of the Council of Bermuda)|the Tucker Family]] met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]]. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with [[Peyton Randolph]] and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with [[George Washington]].<ref name=Jarvis>{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Michael|title=In the Eye of All Trade|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807872840|pages=385\u2013389}}</ref>\n\nThree American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 1775, 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while Governor [[George James Bruere]] slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda acquired a reputation for disloyalty. Later that year, the British Parliament passed the [[Prohibitory Act]] to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS ''Scorpion'' to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well-established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with [[St. Eustatius]] until 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of privateers.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|389\u2013415}}\n\nIn June 1776, HMS ''Nautilus'' secured the island, followed by {{HMS|Galatea|1776|6}} in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of ''Nautilus'' in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]] refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major [[William Sutherland (British Army officer)|William Sutherland]]. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778\u20131779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combined efforts of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist privateers]], such that famine struck the island in 1779.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|416\u2013427}}\n\nThe death of George Bruere in 1780 turned the governorship over to his son, George Jr., an active loyalist. Under his leadership, smuggling was stopped, and the Bermudian colonial government populated with like-minded loyalists. Even Henry Tucker abandoned trading with the United States, because of the presence of many privateers. Loyalist privateers based in Bermuda captured 114 prizes between 1777 and 1781, while 130 were captured in 1782.<ref name=Jarvis/>{{rp|428\u2013433}}\n\n[[The Bermuda Gazette]], Bermuda's first newspaper, began publishing in 1784.<ref name=\"Stark\">{{cite book |last1=Stark |first1=James Henry |title=Stark's Illustrated Bermuda Guide: A Description of Everything on Or about These Places of which the Visitor Or Resident May Desire Information, Including Their History, Inhabitants, Climate, Agriculture, Geology, Government and Resources |date=1897 |publisher=J.H.Stark |location=Bermuda Island (Bermuda Islands) |page=250 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T11qAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA150&q=1784%20bermuda%20stockdale |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"200th\">{{cite web |last1=Rigby |first1=Neil |title=1984 200th Anniversary of Bermuda's first Newspaper and Postal Service |date=26 January 1984 |url=http://www.bermudastamps.co.uk/1984/01/26/200th-anniversary-bermudas-first-newspaper-postal-service/ |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"TBG\">{{cite web |title=The Bermuda gazette |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn89049233/ |publisher=United States Library of Congress |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Devonshire Redoubt (Bermuda).png|thumb|left|An illustration of the Devonshire Redoubt, Bermuda, 1614]]\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], the [[Royal Navy]] began improving the harbours on the Bermudas.

After the acknowledgement by the British Government of the independence of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen continental colonies]] (including Virginia and the Carolinas) in 1783, Bermuda was generally grouped regionally by the British Government with [[The Maritimes]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], substantially nearer to Bermuda than is the Caribbean. However, with the confederation of Canada and the Maritimes and their attainment of [[Dominion]] status in the 1860s, the British political, naval and military hierarchy in Bermuda became increasingly separated from that of the Canadian Government (the [[Royal Navy]] headquarters for the [[North America and West Indies Station]] had spent summers at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and winters at Bermuda, but settled at Bermuda year round with the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax]] finally being transferred to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in 1907, and the [[Bermuda Garrison]] had been placed under the military Commander-in-Chief America in New York during the American War of Independence, and had been part of the Nova Scotia Command thereafter, but became the separate ''Bermuda Command'' from the 1860s with the Major-General or Lieutenant-General appointed as Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda also filling the civil role of [[Governor of Bermuda]]), and Bermuda was increasingly perceived by the British Government as in, or at least grouped for convenience with, the British West Indies (although the established [[Church of England]] in Bermuda, which from 1825 to 1839 had been attached to the See of [[Nova Scotia]]) remained part of the [[Diocese of Newfoundland|Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda]] until 1879, when the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed and a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the Diocese of Newfoundland, but continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop). Newfoundland attained Dominion status in 1907, leaving the nearest other territories to Bermuda that were still within the [[Commonwealth realm|British Realm]] (a term which replaced ''Dominion'' in 1952 as the dominions and many colonies moved towards full political independence) as the British colonies in the [[British West Indies]].\n\n\nBermuda became an associate member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) in July 2003, despite not being in the Caribbean region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-online.org/bdagovt.htm |title= Bermuda Government today |work=Bermuda-Online.org |accessdate =9 July 2010 |quote=In July 2003, Bermuda formally joined the Caribbean Community as an Associate Member (non-voting member), in certain areas but not in others.

For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to [[privateering]] at every opportunity. The Bermuda government maintained a local (infantry) militia and fortified coastal artillery batteries manned by volunteer artillerymen. Bermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targeted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October, 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia and coastal artillery), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's barrier reef, coastal artillery batteries and  militia provided a defence too powerful for the fleet sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the [[Royal Navy]]. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].\n\nDue to its isolated location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] were operating [[Seaplane]] bases on Bermuda.\n\nIn May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.</ref> In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). The US Army established the [[Bermuda Base Command]] in 1941 to co-ordinate its [[USAAF|air]], anti-aircraft, and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] assets during the war. The US Navy operated a [[USN Submarine Base, Ordnance Island, Bermuda|submarine base]] on [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]] from 1942 through 1945.<ref name=\"bermuda-online.org\"/>\n\nConstruction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of {{convert|5.8|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[US Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[US Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.\n\nThe original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a [[seaplane]] base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, [[US Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as [[Naval Facility Bermuda]] (NAVFAC Bermuda), a submarine-detecting [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility in the Tudor Hill area; it was converted from a US Army coast artillery bunker in 1954 and operated until 1995. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nCanada, which had operated a war-time naval base, [[HMCS Somers Isles|HMCS ''Somers Isles'']], on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time.\n\nIn the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Malabar'']], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.\n\n[[File:HMS Ambuscade in Bermuda.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Ambuscade (F172)|HMS ''Ambuscade'']] at the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard in 1988]]]]\nBermudians served in the British armed forces during both [[World War I]] and World War II. After the latter, Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey. When promoted to brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.\n\nToday, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps|naval]] and army cadet corps, is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.\n\nIn early 2020 Bermuda formed the Bermuda Coast Guard. Its 24-hour on-duty service includes search and rescue, counter-narcotics operations, border control, and protection of Bermuda's maritime interests. The Bermuda Coast Guard will interact with the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda Police Service.<ref>https://www.gov.bm/articles/launch-bermuda-coast-guard</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of Bermuda}}\n[[File:Front Street, Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Front Street, Hamilton]]\nBanking and other financial services form the largest sector of the economy at circa 85% of GDP, with tourism being the second largest industry at 5%.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/><ref name=Smithsonian/> Industrial and agriculture activities occur, however these are on a very limited scale and Bermuda is heavily reliant on imports.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/> Living standards are high and as of 2019 Bermuda has the 6th highest GDP per capita in the world.<ref name=\"World Factbook\"/>\n\n===Currency===\nIn 1970 the country switched its currency from the [[Bermudian pound]] to the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] at par with the US dollar.

The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single-gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools, which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys' school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s, and in 1996, one of the aided schools became a private school.\n\nPrior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formerly maintained \"white\" schools and both single-sex schools opted to become private schools.

English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] ones.\n\nA second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.\n\nThe first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was ''[[Mary Prince#Publication of The History of Mary Prince|The History of Mary Prince]]'', a [[slave narrative]] by [[Mary Prince]]. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]]. [[Graham Ingham|Ernest Graham Ingham]], an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist [[Brian Burland]] (1931\u2013 2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, [[Angela Barry]] has won critical recognition for her published fiction.\n\n===Arts===\n{{see also|Music of Bermuda}}\nMusic and dance are an important part of Bermudian culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. Local icons, [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], performed calypso music for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''. While calypso appealed more to tourists than to the local residents, [[reggae]] has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrants.\n[[File:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|Gombey dancers from Bermuda at the 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C.]]\nNoted Bermudian musicians include [[tenor|operatic tenor]] Dr. Gary Burgess; jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]]; singer-songwriter and poet, [[Heather Nova]], and her brother [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], reggae musician; classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]]; and more recently, [[dancehall]] artist [[Collie Buddz]].\n\nThe dances of the colourful [[Gombey]] dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001, they performed at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. These Gombey Dancers continue to showcase their work for locals and visitors during the Harbour Nights festival on Bermuda's Front Street every Wednesday evening (during the summer months) and draw very large crowds.\n\nBermuda's early literature was limited to the works of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the islands. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, \"Battle of the Summer Islands\" (1645).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|title=The Battle Of The Summer Islands : Canto 1 \u2013 Poem by Edmund Waller|website=poemhunter.com|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008224321/http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/217/0304.html|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907\u201321), Volume VII.

The cup was contested annually by teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units stationed in Bermuda.]]\n\nMany sports popular today were formalised by British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public schools]] and universities in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the [[British empire]], and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as [[the Football Association]] (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players. The [[Bermuda national football team]] managed to qualify to the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the country's first ever major football competition.\n\nThe professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby football]], and even [[Lawn tennis|tennis]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to [[Yacht racing|sail racing]], founding the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]]). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.\n\n[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a [[One-Day International]] (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual \"Cup Match\" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark ''forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery''. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the ''St. George's Garrison'' (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).<ref>Stranack</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16\u201317 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009.

Football did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the [[Second World War]], though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major-General Sir [[George Bullock (British Army officer)|George Mackworth Bullock]] in 1913. A combined team of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (BMI) defeated {{HMS|Malabar|shore establishment|6}} to win the cup on 21 March 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.<ref>''Bermuda Militia Win Governor's Football Cup''. The Recorder. Page 1. City of Hamilton, Bermuda. 24th of March, 1943.</ref> Bermuda's most prominent footballers are [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Kyle Lightbourne]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Nahki Wells]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team played in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]] but folded in 2013.\n\n[[Sailing]], [[fishing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport\u2013Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref> In December 2013, Bermuda's bid to host the [[2017 America's Cup]] was announced.\n\nAt the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events.

Their 1970s catalogue included five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (eleven in Canada). The band has sold nearly 30&nbsp;million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as \"gearheads\"<ref>Band bio at www.btorocks.com.</ref> (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\", \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\", \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", and \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\", still receive play on classic-rock stations.\n\nThe original lineup consisted of [[Randy Bachman]] (lead guitar, lead vocals), [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] (bass guitar, lead vocals), [[Tim Bachman]] (guitar, vocals) and [[Robbie Bachman]] (drums). This lineup released two albums in 1973. The second and most commercially successful lineup featured [[Blair Thornton]] (lead guitar), in place of Tim Bachman. This lineup released four albums between 1974 and 1977, including two that reached the Top 5 in the U.S. pop charts, as well as the band's only U.S. No. 1 single (\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\"). Subsequent lineups enjoyed only moderate success.\n\nAfter the band went into a hiatus in 2005, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner reunited in 2009 to tour and collaborate on a [[Bachman & Turner|new album]]. In 2010, they played the halftime show at the [[Grey Cup]] in [[Edmonton]]. The two stopped touring following Turner's amicable retirement in March 2018.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/entertainment/randy-bachman-says-bto-bandmate-fred-turner-will-retire-from-touring-1.3838468 |title=Randy Bachman says BTO bandmate Fred Turner will retire from touring |date=March 11, 2018 |accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn March 29, 2014, the classic ''[[Not Fragile]]'' line-up reunited for the first time since 1991 to mark Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive's induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and participated in performing in a tribute version of \"Takin' Care of Business\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history 1971\u20131973===\nAfter leaving [[The Guess Who]] at the height of that band's success, Randy Bachman recalled being labelled \"a lunatic and a loser\" and that \"nobody wanted to work with me\". The exception was [[Chad Allan (musician)|Chad Allan]], former Guess Who lead singer who had left that band four years before Randy. The two agreed to explore a musical project, and Randy then turned to family.<ref name=Heatley>{{cite web|url= http://www.teamrock.com/features/2014-05-02/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive |title=The Turbulent History of Bachman-Turner Overdrive |last=Heatley|first=Michael |publisher=teamrock.com |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> The result was the band [[Brave Belt]], formed in Winnipeg in 1971 with the additions of Randy's brother [[Robbie Bachman|Robin \"Robbie\" Bachman]] on drums, and Gary Bachman acting as band manager. Brave Belt's self-titled first album, which saw Randy playing both lead guitar and bass, did not sell particularly well. The record label still wanted Brave Belt to tour, so Randy (at the suggestion of [[Neil Young]]) hired fellow Winnipeg bassist/vocalist [[Fred Turner (musician)|C. F. (\"Fred\") Turner]] to perform in the band's scheduled gigs.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\">Gormley, Peter. \"BTO (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive) Frequently Asked Questions\", 7/31/97.</ref>\n\nTurner was soon asked to be a full-time member and sing lead for the recording of ''Brave Belt II'' in 1972. Chad Allan appeared as a vocalist on two ''Brave Belt II'' songs, but left the band shortly after the album's recording. During the tour to support this album, another Bachman sibling, [[Tim Bachman]], was added as a second guitarist because the band had felt their three-piece arrangement was too restrictive.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> ''Brave Belt II'' also failed to achieve any notable chart success, and in mid-1972 their supporting tour was cancelled halfway through. But Turner's influence had started to make itself felt, as he composed five songs for the ''Brave Belt II'' album. ''Brave Belt II'' had a harder, more guitar-heavy sound than its predecessor, complemented by Turner's throaty, powerful voice.<ref>\"Driving Music: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\", article at [http://www.allpar.com allpar.com]</ref>\n\nAccording to Randy Bachman's autobiography, the seeds of the BTO sound were sown at a university gig in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], shortly after Allan's departure. A promoter, disheartened with reactions to Allan's country-flavoured songs, which the band was still playing, decided to sack Brave Belt for the Saturday night show and bring in a more rock-oriented replacement from [[Toronto]]. When that didn't materialize, he begged Brave Belt to stay on and play a set of classic rock cover songs. As the band played songs like \"Proud Mary\", \"Brown Sugar\" and \"All Right Now\", the dance floor filled up and, according to Randy, \"We instantly saw the difference between playing sit-down music people could talk over and playing music they would jump out of their seats and dance to.\"<ref name=Heatley/>\n\nAfter [[Reprise Records]] dropped Brave Belt from their label, Randy Bachman emptied his own bank account to finance another set of recordings with the ''Brave Belt II'' lineup, and began to shop around the next album. Said Randy in 1974, \"I went to A&M, Epic, Atlantic, Columbia, Asylum \u2013 you name it. A week later, I\u2019d get letters saying \u2018Dear Randy, We pass.\u2019 We\u2019re thinking of calling our greatest hits album ''We Pass'' and printing all those refusals on the jacket. I\u2019ve got all 22 of them.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74>{{cite web|url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs178-bachman-turner-overdrive/ |title=Rolling Stone #178: Bachman-Turner Overdrive |website=theuncool.com |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band eventually landed a deal with [[Mercury Records]], one which Randy proclaimed as a pure stroke of luck. In April 1973, Charlie Fach of Mercury Records returned to his office after a trip to France to find a stack of unplayed demo tapes waiting on his desk. Wanting to start completely fresh, he took a trash can and slid all the tapes into it except one which missed the can and fell onto the floor. Fach picked up the tape and noticed Bachman's name on it. He remembered talking to him the previous year and had told Bachman that if he ever put a demo together to send it to him. Coincidentally, Mercury had just lost [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rod Stewart]] to other labels, and Fach was looking for new rock acts to replace them.<ref name=Heatley/> Fach called Bachman, and Randy describes the conversation from there:\n\n{{quote|I could hear \"Gimme Your Money Please\" playing in the background, and that was the first song on the tape. Back then, you sent out two  {{Sfrac|7|1|2}}-inch reels of your album, an A-side and a B-side, and that was side one, cut one. He said, \"Randy, this is fabulous. Is the rest of the album like this?\" And I said, \"Yeah, it's all just good ol', dancing rock-and-roll.\" So he said, \"Well, I have a meeting with my A&R people, but as far as I'm concerned, this is great and I want to sign it.\"<ref>Interview track on ''King Biscuit: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive'', King Biscuit Flower Hour Records</ref>}}\n\nAt this point the band's demo tape was still called ''Brave Belt III''. Fach convinced the band that a brand new name was needed; one that capitalized on the name recognition of the band members. The band had already mulled over using their surnames (\u00e0 la [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]). While on their way back from a gig in [[Toronto]], the group had spotted a copy of a trucker's magazine called ''Overdrive'' while dining at the Colonial Steak House in [[Windsor, Ontario]], run by Colonial Jim Lambros. After this, Turner wrote \"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\" and the initials \"B.T.O.\" on a [[napkin]]. The rest of the band decided the addition of \"[[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\" was the perfect way to describe their music.<ref>\"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive Biography\" at [http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ SongResource.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051317/http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nBTO released their eponymous [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|first album]] in May 1973. The album broke through in the US via border towns such as [[Detroit]]<ref name=\"enotesBTO\">Contemporary Musicians/Bachman-Turner Overdrive bio at [http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/bachman-turner-overdrive-biography enotes.com]</ref> and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and stayed on the charts for many weeks despite lacking a hit single.  The Turner-penned \"Blue Collar\" reached No. 21 on the Canadian RPM charts, but stalled at No. 68 on the US charts. The album's eventual success was very much the result of the band's relentless touring. Reportedly, Fach had agreed to put this album on the Mercury label only if the band would promote it with a heavy concert schedule. Wherever the band was getting significant airplay, Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive immediately travelled there, regardless of the tour routing, to build momentum.\n\nOne such opportunity occurred in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Recalled Fred Turner, \"We got a call from radio station [[KSHE]] that was putting on a benefit. They wanted a band to headline that nobody heard of because the headline acts they had booked got bigger offers and weren't coming. We had the ''BTO I'' album out then, so they at least had something to play and make it look like we were big. They started playing our record every hour, every cut off the album, across six states&nbsp;\u2013 150,000 watts. The record company called and said, 'What the hell's happening? We shipped ten thousand records to St. Louis in one week!' We got there and it was an outdoor drive-in theatre, fifteen to twenty thousand people. The region had been saturated with our album. They didn't know we were Canadian, they just knew the songs. It was incredible.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO>Einarson, John. Booklet insert for the ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive 40th Anniversary'' CD.</ref>\n\nBacked by manager Bruce Allen, the band logged over 300 dates in its first year of existence, and it paid off. ''BTO I'' would later be certified gold in 1974 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\n===Breakthrough and success 1973\u20131976===\nBTO's second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]'', was released in December 1973 and became an enormous hit in the US (peaking at No. 4 in 1974) and their native Canada (peaking at No. 6 on the ''RPM'' albums chart). It was originally to be titled \"Adrenaline Rush\". It also yielded two of their best-known hit singles, \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\" and \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".  While \"Let It Ride\" was BTO's first Top 40 hit in the U.S. (peaking at #23), \"Takin' Care of Business\" would become one of the band's most enduring anthems. Randy had already written the core of \"Takin' Care of Business\" several years earlier as \"White Collar Worker\" while in [[The Guess Who]], but that band had felt it was not their type of song. It reappeared in BTO's repertoire during the supporting gigs for the first album primarily, as Randy put it, \"To give Fred Turner a chance to rest his voice.\" Randy had heard DJ Darryl Burlingham say the day before a gig, \"We're takin' care of business on C-Fox radio\", and he decided to insert the lyrics \"takin' care of business\" into the chorus where \"white collar worker\" previously existed.<ref name=\"RBinterview\">Gary James interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com classicbands.com]</ref>\n\nTim Bachman left the band in early 1974 shortly after the release of ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II''. Randy Bachman had very strong religious beliefs and established rules to be in BTO. Among them was a rule that drugs, alcohol and premarital sex were prohibited on tour, and Tim is alleged to have broken all of these. It is said that he was given opportunities to change his lifestyle and did, at least temporarily. Said Randy in a 1974 ''Rolling Stone'' interview: \"I know from experience what can ruin a good thing. Drugs made the guys in The Guess Who change. They got sloppy. They ruined themselves and their marriages.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74/> Some other accounts state that Tim left because he was getting married and wanted to study record engineering and concert promotion.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> But in a 2002 interview, brother Robbie said, \"He was basically asked to leave. He wasn't BTO caliber [and] it was difficult to rely on him. I guess the band was conflicting with his whole life.\"<ref name=\"Markafterdark\">\"Behind the Four-Wheel Drive\". Mark After Dark interview with Robbie Bachman at [http://www.newyorkwaste.com newyorkwaste.com]</ref>\n\nBTO continued a very busy tour schedule and during the supporting tour for ''BTO II'', Tim was replaced by [[Blair Thornton]]. Thornton had been in the [[Vancouver]]-based band Crosstown Bus, which released one album on MCA records. In September 1974, the first BTO album with the modified line-up, ''[[Not Fragile]]'' (a play on the hit album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' by [[Yes (band)|Yes]]), was released. It became a huge success, reaching No. 1 on both the Canadian and US album charts. It included the No. 1 single \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\"<ref name=\"bill\">{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Hits |isbn=0-8230-8285-7|author=Adam White & Fred Bronson|publisher=Billboard Books|year=1988}}</ref> and [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] favourite \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\". ''Not Fragile'' remains BTO's top-selling non-compilation album, selling eight million copies to date.\n\n1975 found the band engaged in highly successful tours of Europe and the US, wherein BTO was supported by [[Thin Lizzy]], an emerging band also on the Mercury Records label. Said Randy, \"Lizzy were just opening in England, but our label wanted to bust them in the rest of Europe and break them wide open in the States, so we toured with [[Phil Lynott|Phil]] and the boys for seven or eight months.\"<ref name=Heatley/> With management pressure to capitalize on their growing success, BTO quickly recorded ''[[Four Wheel Drive (album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' in May 1975, which included the single \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\". Although reaching no higher than No. 21 on the US charts, \"Hey You\" would become BTO's second No. 1 single on the Canadian ''RPM'' charts. Meanwhile, the album charted in the Top Five in both the US and Canada. \n\nThe band went on to record and release ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]'' in late 1975. This album produced the 1976 Top 40 single \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", which featured a guest appearance by [[Little Richard]] who wailed away on his piano. ''Head On'' also featured the jazzy Randy Bachman composition \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out for #1]]\", which reached #15 on the Adult Contemporary chart. While garnering some airplay on traditional rock stations, it also received fairly heavy rotation on soft rock stations which normally did not play bands like BTO. In between the latter two albums, BTO released their only non-album single \"[[Down to the Line (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Down to the Line]]\". This song would appear on some of the later compilation CD's, as well as on re-issues of the ''Head On'' album in CD format. ''Head On'' would be the last BTO studio album to chart in the US Top 40, peaking at No. 23 in early 1976.\n\nThe first BTO compilation album, ''[[Best of B.T.O. (So Far)]]'', was released in 1976 and featured songs from each of the band's first five studio albums. A single\u2014a re-release of \"Gimme Your Money Please\"\u2014was put out from this album, and it also charted well keeping BTO on both the AM & FM airwaves. Although peaking at only No. 19 on the charts, this compilation album became the best-selling Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album to date, reaching Double Platinum status in the US.<ref name=\"riaa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.org |title=RIAA - Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=riaa.org |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Randy's departure and the new \"BTO\" 1977\u20131979===\n[[File:Bto-1991.jpg|thumb|right|BTO in [[\u00d6rebro]], Sweden, April 1991 <br /> L-R: Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton, Robbie Bachman]]\n''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', BTO's sixth studio album that was recorded in late 1976 and released in February 1977, signalled the end of BTO's most successful line-up. Facing some criticism for the \"sameness\" of the band's songs on the two follow-up albums to ''Not Fragile'', Randy Bachman wanted to update BTO's sound, including adding horns and strings on some songs, but the rest of the band seemed to disagree. Said Fred Turner:\n\n{{quote|Since he (Randy) was funding the whole thing, everything went on his and Mercury's timetable. It finally came to a head for ''Freeways'' when Blair, Rob and myself told Randy we were burnt out, didn't like the songs we were writing, didn't like the songs he was writing, and that we wanted to take some time to regroup {{ndash}} especially since all the other bands were taking a year or two between albums, not doing two a year like we were. Randy told us his songs were fine and forced the album. It ended that version of the band.<ref name=Heatley/>}}\n\nYears later, Randy seemed to agree with Turner, stating, \"Looking at it now, we should have taken four, five, six months off ... live a little, and then come back together with new ideas. In retrospect, that's what a lot of great bands do. And we didn't.\"<ref name=Heatley/> ''Freeways'' only reached #70 on the US pop albums chart and had no charting singles.\n\nRandy Bachman left the group following ''Freeways''. His initial intention was to temporarily disband while he worked on a solo project, \"But it was decided by management it wouldn't work.\" He conceded, \"We also ran out of common interests.\"<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/>\n\nRandy was replaced by bassist [[Jim Clench]], formerly of [[April Wine]]. Bassist Turner moved to rhythm guitar with Thornton becoming the primary lead guitarist. Clench and Turner shared lead vocal duties. Even though this line-up included drummer Robbie Bachman, the band had to record and tour only as \"BTO\" because of an agreement with Randy who wanted to retain the rights to his surname for his solo career.<ref name=\"RBinterview\"/> While Randy kept the rights to the full Bachman name, the remaining band members bought the rights to \"BTO\" and the gear logo.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> The re-structured BTO released ''[[Street Action]]'' in February 1978. The album became a commercial failure, spawning no hit singles.\n\nThe band also released ''[[Rock n' Roll Nights]]'' in March 1979. It was the first BTO album to prominently feature outside songwriters, particularly [[Prism (band)|Prism]]'s [[Jim Vallance]], who also co-produced the album. Vallance had taken over as main producer after Barry Mraz was fired by the band, and would later score huge success in the 80s with [[Bryan Adams]]. But like its predecessor, ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' also sold poorly (an estimated 350,000 copies worldwide). The album did, however, produce a moderately successful single called \"Heartaches\". Written by Turner, it cracked the Top 40 in Canada and reached number 60 on the US charts, making it the first BTO single in three years to chart in the US.<ref>The song was later a hit for [[Anne Murray]], from her ''[[Something to Talk About (album)|Something to Talk About]]'' album (1986).</ref> BTO played this song on [[American Bandstand]] in February 1979 (with producer Vallance guesting on piano), along with another single from the same album called \"[[Jamaica (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Jamaica]]\". Fred Turner and Jim Clench also appeared on ''[[Bryan Adams (album)|Bryan Adams]]''' debut album in 1980 as session musicians.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} (Adams had likewise contributed one song, \"Wastin' Time\", for BTO for the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' album).\n\nOn November 3, 2010, [[Jim Clench]] died in a [[Montreal]] hospital after a battle with stage-four lung cancer.<ref name=\"thestar\">{{cite news|title=April Wine and BTO former bassist Jim Clench dies|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/886479--jim-clench-bassist-with-april-wine-and-bto-dies-at-61|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=TheStar.com|location=Toronto|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC\">{{cite news|title=CBC News \u2013 Music \u2013 April Wine, BTO musician Jim Clench dies|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2010/11/05/jim-clench-obit.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=CBC.ca|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|title=Lives Remembered \u2013 Telegraph \u2013 Jim Clench|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8124442/Lives-Remembered.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|location=London|date=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"obit\">{{cite web|title=The Gazette (Montreal) \u2013 Obituaries|url=http://www.legacy.com/can-montreal/Obituaries.asp?Page=Lifestory&PersonId=146420804|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Legacy.com via MontrealGazette.com}}</ref>\n\n===Disbandment, side projects, and reunions 1979\u20131991===\n\nBTO completed the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' tour in late 1979, and officially disbanded in early 1980. After Randy recorded the solo album ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]'' in 1978, he went on to form the short-lived [[Ironhorse]] in 1979. Ironhorse released two albums, ''Ironhorse'' and ''Everything Is Grey'', before disbanding. Tom Sparks was the vocalist for the first Ironhorse album, along with Randy, but was replaced by Frank Ludwig for the second album in 1980. Sparks reportedly did not like the constant touring and being away from home for such long amounts of time. A reformed version of Ironhorse, renamed as \"Union\", released one album in 1981 entitled ''On Strike''. Fred Turner was a member of Union along with Randy Bachman.\n\nBTO reunited in 1983. Their line-up for their first studio LP in five years (released in 1984) consisted of Randy and Tim Bachman, Fred Turner, joined by former [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]] drummer [[Garry Peterson]] and [[Billy Chapman (musician)|Billy Chapman]], their drum tech, on piano & keyboards. Younger brother Robbie Bachman declined to participate after business and [[trademark]] disagreements with Randy and the others:\n\n{{quote|When Randy wanted to get back together again, I said, \"Okay, let's have a publishing company with the band. Let's all write the tunes. We'll all share equally and there won't be any more animosity.\" He said no, so I got up and left. Blair wasn't asked to rejoin because Randy knew that Blair wouldn't take any crap like Timmy would. They went out and started to use the name BTO within a year and the same trademark that Randy sold to us! So Blair and I sued him and we won. They had to pay us royalties.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/>}}\n\nIn Randy's 2000 autobiography, ''Takin' Care of Business'', he counters that Robbie declined to participate in the reunion when he and Fred refused to share in the publishing royalties of the hit BTO songs Randy and Fred authored.\n\nThe new album, simply (and confusingly) titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|BTO]]'', was released in September 1984 on Charlie Fach's new Compleat label. \"For the Weekend\", a song from this album, was released as a single, along with a companion music video, and dented the US charts at No. 83. It was the first chart appearance by a BTO song in five years, and would also be the last.\n\nIn 1986, they released a live album culled from their 1985 tour called ''[[Live Live Live|Live! Live! Live!]]'' which featured two new tracks, \"Bad News Travels Fast\" and \"Fragile Man\". The latter was actually a studio recording with the audience sound added to it. A studio version of \"Bad News Travels Fast\" was released on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]''. They were the opening band for the new [[Sammy Hagar]]-fronted [[Van Halen]] on their ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. This plum opening slot was done by a trio line-up of Randy, Tim and Garry Peterson (allegedly with some bass parts and Fred's voice provided via tapes) since Fred Turner had been unavailable when the group was first contacted by Van Halen's management.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> Chapman later stepped in as drummer for Peterson after the latter severely injured his leg while playing [[softball]] during the group's downtime on the road.\n\nAfter the Van Halen tour ended, Randy split and Tim kept going briefly as BTO (see line-ups below). The others reluctantly gave him permission to do so to get his way out of debt. Billy Chapman later became the drummer for Randy Bachman's band and drummed on Randy's 1993 solo album Any Road.\n\nIn 1988, the 1974\u201377 ''Not Fragile'' line-up (Randy, Fred, Blair, Robbie) reformed once again, took to the road and recorded an unknown number of songs together. The only song to make it out into the public by this version of the band was a cover of the song \"[[Wooly Bully]]\", which is only available on the ''[[American Boyfriends]]'' movie soundtrack. But by late 1991, Randy Bachman had left the group again. Two explanations exist for this happening. The first, according to Randy Bachman, was that the band agreed to take a break. But at some point the other members decided they wanted to continue doing concerts because the money was too good to pass up. Randy stated they asked him to tour with them but he was working on another project and had to decline. The others then chose to go on as BTO without him. In the second explanation, the other members (particularly Robbie and Blair) have maintained that Randy quit.\n\n===''Trial by Fire'' era (1991\u20132005)===\nRandy Bachman was replaced by [[Randy Murray]] after his last departure from the band in late 1991. (Murray had been in Tim Bachman's 1987\u201388 touring incarnations of BTO.) This reconstituted version of BTO (Murray with Robbie Bachman, Fred Turner and Blair Thornton) proved to be its most enduring as they toured together from 1991 until December 2004. ''[[Trial by Fire: Greatest and Latest]]'' was released in 1996 and was their last album to contain any new material.\n\nThe sibling rivalry between Robbie and Randy that had started with the 1984 reunion album continued during this era. Said Randy in a 1999 interview, \"They said, 'We'll just call ourselves BTO. People will know you're not there.' The problem is when BTO pulls into town, the radio, the press people, call them Bachman-Turner Overdrive. It's like Coke and Coca-Cola, two names that go hand in hand. It kind of gets represented that I'm there and when they play the gig, I clearly am not there. [And] they've got another guy to take my place who unfortunately is named Randy. So there's this inference that I'm there and I'm not there, which is a disservice to the fans.\"<ref>Interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com/RandyBachmanInterview.html classicbands.com]</ref> Replied brother Robbie, \"Randy Murray doesn't fill anyone's shoes. He brings his own.\"<ref>BTO bio at [http://www.canadianbands.com/BTO.html canadianbands.com].</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] voted to induct Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive into the museum. However, the band would have had to play as the ''Not Fragile'' line-up, meaning the inclusion of Randy Bachman to the band for that performance. The current version of BTO at the time declined the invitation unless they could be inducted as \"BTO\" without Randy Bachman playing on stage. The Hall refused and the band was not inducted (the \"classic\" lineup of Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton and Robbie Bachman would eventually be inducted - by astronaut [[Chris Hadfield]] - in 2014).<ref>http://canadianmusichalloffame.ca/inductee/bachman-turner-overdrive/</ref>\n\nIn an interview in 2004, Rob Bachman had stated that BTO was working on nine or ten new songs.<ref>A clip of one song from those recordings, \"Can't Take It with You\", is available along with the interview at [http://www.btorocks.com btorocks.com]</ref> It has been reported from numerous sources that the band could not get a good label to release the project and wanted this album to be distributed and publicized well, unlike what happened to the ''Trial by Fire'' CD. There was also a plan to release a live DVD/CD from a show in 2003 in their hometown of Winnipeg, but thus far this has not happened.\n\n===Hiatus 2005\u20132009===\nSince the last disbandment of the band in 2005, several of their albums have been reissued. The first one to be made available again since the disbandment was ''Freeways'' in 2005, followed by ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II'' in 2006 and ''Four Wheel Drive'' in 2008. ''Brave Belt I'' and ''Brave Belt II'' were re-released on a single CD March 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?r=1&EAN=664140644724&ourl=Brave%2DBelt%2DI%2DBrave%2DBelt%2DII%2FBrave%2DBelt |title=Brave Belt I/Brave Belt II, Brave Belt, Music CD - Barnes & Noble |publisher=Music.barnesandnoble.com |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Rob and Blair have remained very reticent about BTO since late 2004, Rob has been rumoured to state he no longer wishes to play in the band and has hung up his drum sticks.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, Tim Bachman played on stage at one of Randy Bachman's shows, the first time they had played on stage together since 2003. Randy Bachman, who already hosted the successful radio show \"Randy's Vinyl Tap\", was slated to be the host of a new television show called \"Road to Guitar\", which was set to air on the Discovery Channel. He was on tour with Burton Cummings during the summer of 2009, and played dates for the Randy Bachman Band in the United States and Canada for August and September.\n\nRandy Murray still plays occasional shows around the Vancouver area. He is the only ''Trial by Fire''\u2013era member of BTO, besides Fred Turner, to have played shows after the disbandment in January 2005. Like Rob, Murray has also stated he no longer wishes to be in BTO.\n\n===Bachman and Turner reunion 2009\u20132018===\n{{further|Bachman & Turner}}\nDue to the intense interest in a Bachman-Turner reunion, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner announced their reteaming on December 8, 2009 in their hometown of Winnipeg.\n\nInformation on the 2010 Bachman & Turner tour and the new album was provided at their then-new website ''bachmanandturner.com''. As Randy wrote on the site, the project started with his request to Turner that he sing lead on the song, \"Rock 'n Roll Is the Only Way Out\". But after hearing the track with Turner's vocals, Randy asked if his former bandmate could contribute more vocals and some original compositions and offered to put his solo project on hold in favour of a Bachman-Turner album. It morphed into a full-blown collaboration.<ref>Bios at [http://www.bachmanandturner.com bachmanandturner.com].</ref><ref>Randy Bachman interview at [http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/randy-bachman-0611/ gibson.com]</ref>\n\nOn September 12, 2009, the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' had already reported that Randy Bachman and C.F. Turner would reunite to play concert dates in Europe, Canada and the US in 2010 backed by Randy's current band of Marc LaFrance, Mick Dalla-Vee and Brent Howard, billed simply as Bachman & Turner. Some early confirmed tour dates announced were June 2010 at the Sweden Rock Festival and the High Voltage Festival in July 2010 at London UK; the story added that there was also interest from agents as far away as South America and Australia.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams |first=Rob |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/bachman-turner-takin-care-of-business-59119202.html |title=Bachman, Turner takin' care of business |newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe tour and album plans of 'Bachman & Turner' resulted in a lawsuit by Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton regarding ownership of the band name and related trademarks.<ref>Bachman and [[Burton Cummings]] have encountered similar difficulties in relation to the [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]] name, which is owned by original bassist [[Jim Kale]], which has resulted in Bachman & Cummings touring since 2005 as simply Bachman-Cummings rather than The Guess Who; see [[The Guess Who]].</ref> Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton claim that US and Canadian rights in the BTO name and trademark were transferred to Rob Bachman, Blair Thornton and Fred Turner when Randy Bachman commenced a solo career in 1977.<ref>Ownership of rights in relation to the name(s) outside of the United States and Canada are uncertain.</ref><ref>It is unclear whether this claim relates to both \"Bachman-Turner Overdrive\" and \"BTO\", or solely the latter.</ref> Randy Bachman is said to have registered the names \"Bachman-Turner\", \"BTU\", \"Bachman-Turner United\" and \"Bachman-Turner Union\" in both the United States and Canada.<ref>The current status of European or global ownership of the band name(s) and trademarks is uncertain.</ref> These names are said to cause confusion with the names \"Bachman-Turner Overdrive\" and \"BTO\", resulting in potential damages to Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton.<ref>Dan Ferguson, [http://www.bclocalnews.com/surrey_area/surreyleader/news/69028532.html Battle Over Bachman-Turner Overdrive Name] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109204730/http://www.bclocalnews.com/surrey_area/surreyleader/news/69028532.html |date=November 9, 2009 }}; Surrey North Delta Leader, November 3, 2009.</ref> There appeared to be general legal agreement that one could perform under one's own legal names such as \"Bachman & Turner\", so the newly reunited pair were billed as such for the 2010 tour and album.  The band played the halftime show at the 2010 [[Grey Cup]] in [[Edmonton]].\n\nThe rock duo's self-titled album, ''[[Bachman & Turner]]'', was released September 7, 2010 in North America and on September 20, 2010 in Europe.  In November 2010, they performed at the famous Roseland Ballroom in New York City as part of their North American tour. A double live album ([[Live at the Roseland Ballroom, NYC]]) was recorded at that show, which was also filmed and will be released on DVD and Blu-ray later in the year. / Line-up:\nRandy Bachman (guitars, vocals); C.F. Turner (bass, vocals); Marc LaFrance (drums, percussion, vocals); Brent Howard Knudsen (guitars, vocals); Mick Dalla-Vee (guitars, vocals).\n\nCapitalizing on the recent Bachman & Turner album and supporting shows, BTO released another compilation set in 2013: ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive: 40th Anniversary]]''.  It has 26 songs on two CDs. Much of the collection had been released before, but there were four previously unreleased songs, including \"Rough Ride\" from the 1984 ''BTO'' reunion album sessions and \"West Coast Turnaround\" from the 1975 ''Head On'' sessions.<ref name=BTO40th>[https://www.discogs.com/Bachman-Turner-Overdrive-40th-Anniversary-Deluxe-Edition/release/10218353 BachmanTurner Overdrive: 40th Anniversary (Deluxe Edition)] Track listing at discogs.com, retrieved January 3, 2019.</ref> The CD set also features one Brave Belt song (\"Never Comin' Home\"), and eight songs on disc two are from the long out-of-print ''[[B.T.O. Live \u2013 Japan Tour]]'' album from 1976. Disc two also adds live versions of \"Blue Collar\" and \"Give It Time\", recorded at the same Japan concerts but not released on the vinyl edition.<ref name=BTO40th/> On March 10, 2018, Randy Bachman announced that Fred Turner would be retiring from touring.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\"/>\n\n==Impact and influence==\nBTO has been recognized in many music circles for carrying on the torch of guitar-heavy rock and roll at a time when soft rock was dominating the Top 40 charts, and progressive and glam acts were getting an increasing share of FM radio play. As drummer Rob Bachman put it: \"We were basically fans of all kinds of music, but really liked the old kind of rock-and-roll...like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and the funky kinds of rock bands like [[The Rolling Stones|The Stones]]. Luckily for us, [[Creedence Clearwater Revival|Creedence]] had just called it quits, and we came out with three- and four-chord rock-and-roll with Fred Turner's gruff voice. So it was basically this working man's kind of rock-and-roll.\"\n\nA reviewer assesses, however, that critics are divided over BTO's legacy:\n\n{{quote|Dave Marsh noted that the band peaked with ''Not Fragile'', an album that \"seemed to exhaust Bachman's imagination; everything before and since is simply sluggish.\" The band's entry in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock'' acknowledges BTO's limitations, while properly assessing their assets: \"However much it might be open to derision as formula cash-register boogie, BTO's rock is at least dexterously played and arranged, with dynamics reminiscent of mid-period [[Led Zeppelin]].\" For a period during the mid-1970s, BTO enjoyed high sales, steady radio play, and sold out arena shows.<ref name=\"enotesBTO\"/>}}\n\nStated John Einarson, author of the biography ''Randy Bachman: Still Takin' Care of Business'', \"If The Guess Who made Canadian music North American, Bachman-Turner Overdrive made it international, earning gold and platinum records not only in the US and Canada, but in Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, among others.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO/>\n\n[[Stephen King]] derived his [[Richard Bachman]] pen name from Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive when he was listening to the band's song \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\" at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.<ref name=kingbachman>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stephenking.com/faq.html#1.6\n|title=Stephen King FAQ: 'Why did you write books as Richard Bachman?'\n|author=King, Stephen\n|accessdate=December 13, 2006|publisher=StephenKing.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band was featured in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Saddlesore Galactica]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF09 |title=Saddlesore Galactica |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRandy Bachman and Fred Turner also appeared in the 2012 comedy movie ''[[The Campaign (film)|The Campaign]]'', making a cameo performing the song \"Taking Care of Business\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-campaign-set-visit/|title=20 Things to Know from THE CAMPAIGN Set Visit|last=Wampler|first=Scott|date=July 25, 2012|accessdate=January 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" was also the title of a 1990 [[Taking Care of Business (film)|movie]] starring [[Jim Belushi]] as an escaped convict who wins tickets to see the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[World Series]] and finds the [[Filofax]] of businessman [[Charles Grodin]].

However, the pronunciation of {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u0251\u02d0|k|m|\u0259n}} has become widespread, especially on American radio.</ref> often abbreviated as '''BTO''', was a [[Canadian rock]] group from [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], who had a series of hit albums and singles in the 1970s, selling over 7 million albums in that decade alone. Their 1970s catalogue included five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (eleven in Canada). The band has sold nearly 30&nbsp;million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as \"gearheads\"<ref>Band bio at www.btorocks.com.</ref> (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\", \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\", \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", and \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\", still receive play on classic-rock stations.\n\nThe original lineup consisted of [[Randy Bachman]] (lead guitar, lead vocals), [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] (bass guitar, lead vocals), [[Tim Bachman]] (guitar, vocals) and [[Robbie Bachman]] (drums). This lineup released two albums in 1973. The second and most commercially successful lineup featured [[Blair Thornton]] (lead guitar), in place of Tim Bachman. This lineup released four albums between 1974 and 1977, including two that reached the Top 5 in the U.S. pop charts, as well as the band's only U.S. No. 1 single (\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\"). Subsequent lineups enjoyed only moderate success.\n\nAfter the band went into a hiatus in 2005, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner reunited in 2009 to tour and collaborate on a [[Bachman & Turner|new album]]. In 2010, they played the halftime show at the [[Grey Cup]] in [[Edmonton]]. The two stopped touring following Turner's amicable retirement in March 2018.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/entertainment/randy-bachman-says-bto-bandmate-fred-turner-will-retire-from-touring-1.3838468 |title=Randy Bachman says BTO bandmate Fred Turner will retire from touring |date=March 11, 2018 |accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn March 29, 2014, the classic ''[[Not Fragile]]'' line-up reunited for the first time since 1991 to mark Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive's induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and participated in performing in a tribute version of \"Takin' Care of Business\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history 1971\u20131973===\nAfter leaving [[The Guess Who]] at the height of that band's success, Randy Bachman recalled being labelled \"a lunatic and a loser\" and that \"nobody wanted to work with me\". The exception was [[Chad Allan (musician)|Chad Allan]], former Guess Who lead singer who had left that band four years before Randy. The two agreed to explore a musical project, and Randy then turned to family.<ref name=Heatley>{{cite web|url= http://www.teamrock.com/features/2014-05-02/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive |title=The Turbulent History of Bachman-Turner Overdrive |last=Heatley|first=Michael |publisher=teamrock.com |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> The result was the band [[Brave Belt]], formed in Winnipeg in 1971 with the additions of Randy's brother [[Robbie Bachman|Robin \"Robbie\" Bachman]] on drums, and Gary Bachman acting as band manager. Brave Belt's self-titled first album, which saw Randy playing both lead guitar and bass, did not sell particularly well. The record label still wanted Brave Belt to tour, so Randy (at the suggestion of [[Neil Young]]) hired fellow Winnipeg bassist/vocalist [[Fred Turner (musician)|C. F. (\"Fred\") Turner]] to perform in the band's scheduled gigs.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\">Gormley, Peter. \"BTO (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive) Frequently Asked Questions\", 7/31/97.</ref>\n\nTurner was soon asked to be a full-time member and sing lead for the recording of ''Brave Belt II'' in 1972. Chad Allan appeared as a vocalist on two ''Brave Belt II'' songs, but left the band shortly after the album's recording. During the tour to support this album, another Bachman sibling, [[Tim Bachman]], was added as a second guitarist because the band had felt their three-piece arrangement was too restrictive.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> ''Brave Belt II'' also failed to achieve any notable chart success, and in mid-1972 their supporting tour was cancelled halfway through. But Turner's influence had started to make itself felt, as he composed five songs for the ''Brave Belt II'' album. ''Brave Belt II'' had a harder, more guitar-heavy sound than its predecessor, complemented by Turner's throaty, powerful voice.<ref>\"Driving Music: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\", article at [http://www.allpar.com allpar.com]</ref>\n\nAccording to Randy Bachman's autobiography, the seeds of the BTO sound were sown at a university gig in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], shortly after Allan's departure. A promoter, disheartened with reactions to Allan's country-flavoured songs, which the band was still playing, decided to sack Brave Belt for the Saturday night show and bring in a more rock-oriented replacement from [[Toronto]]. When that didn't materialize, he begged Brave Belt to stay on and play a set of classic rock cover songs. As the band played songs like \"Proud Mary\", \"Brown Sugar\" and \"All Right Now\", the dance floor filled up and, according to Randy, \"We instantly saw the difference between playing sit-down music people could talk over and playing music they would jump out of their seats and dance to.\"<ref name=Heatley/>\n\nAfter [[Reprise Records]] dropped Brave Belt from their label, Randy Bachman emptied his own bank account to finance another set of recordings with the ''Brave Belt II'' lineup, and began to shop around the next album. Said Randy in 1974, \"I went to A&M, Epic, Atlantic, Columbia, Asylum \u2013 you name it. A week later, I\u2019d get letters saying \u2018Dear Randy, We pass.\u2019 We\u2019re thinking of calling our greatest hits album ''We Pass'' and printing all those refusals on the jacket. I\u2019ve got all 22 of them.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74>{{cite web|url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs178-bachman-turner-overdrive/ |title=Rolling Stone #178: Bachman-Turner Overdrive |website=theuncool.com |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band eventually landed a deal with [[Mercury Records]], one which Randy proclaimed as a pure stroke of luck. In April 1973, Charlie Fach of Mercury Records returned to his office after a trip to France to find a stack of unplayed demo tapes waiting on his desk. Wanting to start completely fresh, he took a trash can and slid all the tapes into it except one which missed the can and fell onto the floor. Fach picked up the tape and noticed Bachman's name on it. He remembered talking to him the previous year and had told Bachman that if he ever put a demo together to send it to him. Coincidentally, Mercury had just lost [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rod Stewart]] to other labels, and Fach was looking for new rock acts to replace them.<ref name=Heatley/> Fach called Bachman, and Randy describes the conversation from there:\n\n{{quote|I could hear \"Gimme Your Money Please\" playing in the background, and that was the first song on the tape. Back then, you sent out two  {{Sfrac|7|1|2}}-inch reels of your album, an A-side and a B-side, and that was side one, cut one. He said, \"Randy, this is fabulous. Is the rest of the album like this?\" And I said, \"Yeah, it's all just good ol', dancing rock-and-roll.\" So he said, \"Well, I have a meeting with my A&R people, but as far as I'm concerned, this is great and I want to sign it.\"<ref>Interview track on ''King Biscuit: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive'', King Biscuit Flower Hour Records</ref>}}\n\nAt this point the band's demo tape was still called ''Brave Belt III''. Fach convinced the band that a brand new name was needed; one that capitalized on the name recognition of the band members. The band had already mulled over using their surnames (\u00e0 la [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]). While on their way back from a gig in [[Toronto]], the group had spotted a copy of a trucker's magazine called ''Overdrive'' while dining at the Colonial Steak House in [[Windsor, Ontario]], run by Colonial Jim Lambros. After this, Turner wrote \"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\" and the initials \"B.T.O.\" on a [[napkin]]. The rest of the band decided the addition of \"[[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\" was the perfect way to describe their music.<ref>\"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive Biography\" at [http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ SongResource.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051317/http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nBTO released their eponymous [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|first album]] in May 1973. The album broke through in the US via border towns such as [[Detroit]]<ref name=\"enotesBTO\">Contemporary Musicians/Bachman-Turner Overdrive bio at [http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/bachman-turner-overdrive-biography enotes.com]</ref> and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and stayed on the charts for many weeks despite lacking a hit single.  The Turner-penned \"Blue Collar\" reached No. 21 on the Canadian RPM charts, but stalled at No. 68 on the US charts. The album's eventual success was very much the result of the band's relentless touring. Reportedly, Fach had agreed to put this album on the Mercury label only if the band would promote it with a heavy concert schedule. Wherever the band was getting significant airplay, Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive immediately travelled there, regardless of the tour routing, to build momentum.\n\nOne such opportunity occurred in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Recalled Fred Turner, \"We got a call from radio station [[KSHE]] that was putting on a benefit. They wanted a band to headline that nobody heard of because the headline acts they had booked got bigger offers and weren't coming. We had the ''BTO I'' album out then, so they at least had something to play and make it look like we were big. They started playing our record every hour, every cut off the album, across six states&nbsp;\u2013 150,000 watts. The record company called and said, 'What the hell's happening? We shipped ten thousand records to St. Louis in one week!' We got there and it was an outdoor drive-in theatre, fifteen to twenty thousand people. The region had been saturated with our album. They didn't know we were Canadian, they just knew the songs. It was incredible.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO>Einarson, John. Booklet insert for the ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive 40th Anniversary'' CD.</ref>\n\nBacked by manager Bruce Allen, the band logged over 300 dates in its first year of existence, and it paid off. ''BTO I'' would later be certified gold in 1974 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\n===Breakthrough and success 1973\u20131976===\nBTO's second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]'', was released in December 1973 and became an enormous hit in the US (peaking at No. 4 in 1974) and their native Canada (peaking at No. 6 on the ''RPM'' albums chart). It was originally to be titled \"Adrenaline Rush\". It also yielded two of their best-known hit singles, \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\" and \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".  While \"Let It Ride\" was BTO's first Top 40 hit in the U.S. (peaking at #23), \"Takin' Care of Business\" would become one of the band's most enduring anthems. Randy had already written the core of \"Takin' Care of Business\" several years earlier as \"White Collar Worker\" while in [[The Guess Who]], but that band had felt it was not their type of song. It reappeared in BTO's repertoire during the supporting gigs for the first album primarily, as Randy put it, \"To give Fred Turner a chance to rest his voice.\" Randy had heard DJ Darryl Burlingham say the day before a gig, \"We're takin' care of business on C-Fox radio\", and he decided to insert the lyrics \"takin' care of business\" into the chorus where \"white collar worker\" previously existed.<ref name=\"RBinterview\">Gary James interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com classicbands.com]</ref>\n\nTim Bachman left the band in early 1974 shortly after the release of ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II''. Randy Bachman had very strong religious beliefs and established rules to be in BTO. Among them was a rule that drugs, alcohol and premarital sex were prohibited on tour, and Tim is alleged to have broken all of these. It is said that he was given opportunities to change his lifestyle and did, at least temporarily. Said Randy in a 1974 ''Rolling Stone'' interview: \"I know from experience what can ruin a good thing. Drugs made the guys in The Guess Who change. They got sloppy. They ruined themselves and their marriages.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74/> Some other accounts state that Tim left because he was getting married and wanted to study record engineering and concert promotion.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> But in a 2002 interview, brother Robbie said, \"He was basically asked to leave. He wasn't BTO caliber [and] it was difficult to rely on him. I guess the band was conflicting with his whole life.\"<ref name=\"Markafterdark\">\"Behind the Four-Wheel Drive\". Mark After Dark interview with Robbie Bachman at [http://www.newyorkwaste.com newyorkwaste.com]</ref>\n\nBTO continued a very busy tour schedule and during the supporting tour for ''BTO II'', Tim was replaced by [[Blair Thornton]]. Thornton had been in the [[Vancouver]]-based band Crosstown Bus, which released one album on MCA records. In September 1974, the first BTO album with the modified line-up, ''[[Not Fragile]]'' (a play on the hit album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' by [[Yes (band)|Yes]]), was released. It became a huge success, reaching No. 1 on both the Canadian and US album charts. It included the No. 1 single \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\"<ref name=\"bill\">{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Hits |isbn=0-8230-8285-7|author=Adam White & Fred Bronson|publisher=Billboard Books|year=1988}}</ref> and [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] favourite \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\". ''Not Fragile'' remains BTO's top-selling non-compilation album, selling eight million copies to date.\n\nWith management pressure to capitalize on their growing success, BTO quickly recorded ''[[Four Wheel Drive (album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' in May 1975, which included the single \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\". Although reaching no higher than No. 21 on the US charts, \"Hey You\" would become BTO's second No. 1 single on the Canadian ''RPM'' charts. Meanwhile, the album charted in the Top Five in both the US and Canada. ''Four Wheel Drive'''s release was followed by a highly successful tour of Europe and the US, wherein BTO was supported by [[Thin Lizzy]], an emerging band also on the Mercury Records label. Said Randy Bachman, \"Lizzy were just opening in England, but our label wanted to bust them in the rest of Europe and break them wide open in the States, so we toured with [[Phil Lynott|Phil]] and the boys for seven or eight months.\"<ref name=Heatley/>\n\nThe band went on to record and release ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]'' in late 1975. This album produced the 1976 Top 40 single \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", which featured a guest appearance by [[Little Richard]] who wailed away on his piano. ''Head On'' also featured the jazzy Randy Bachman composition \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out for #1]]\", which reached #15 on the Adult Contemporary chart. While garnering some airplay on traditional rock stations, it also received fairly heavy rotation on soft rock stations which normally did not play bands like BTO. In between the latter two albums, BTO released their only non-album single \"[[Down to the Line (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Down to the Line]]\". This song would appear on some of the later compilation CD's, as well as on re-issues of the ''Head On'' album in CD format. ''Head On'' would be the last BTO studio album to chart in the US Top 40, peaking at No. 23 in early 1976.\n\nThe first BTO compilation album, ''[[Best of B.T.O. (So Far)]]'', was released in 1976 and featured songs from each of the band's first five studio albums. A single\u2014a re-release of \"Gimme Your Money Please\"\u2014was put out from this album, and it also charted well keeping BTO on both the AM & FM airwaves. Although peaking at only No. 19 on the charts, this compilation album became the best-selling Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album to date, reaching Double Platinum status in the US.<ref name=\"riaa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.org |title=RIAA - Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=riaa.org |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Randy's departure and the new \"BTO\" 1977\u20131979===\n[[File:Bto-1991.jpg|thumb|right|BTO in [[\u00d6rebro]], Sweden, April 1991 <br /> L-R: Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton, Robbie Bachman]]\n''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', BTO's sixth studio album that was recorded in late 1976 and released in February 1977, signalled the end of BTO's most successful line-up. Facing some criticism for the \"sameness\" of the band's songs on the two follow-up albums to ''Not Fragile'', Randy Bachman wanted to update BTO's sound, including adding horns and strings on some songs, but the rest of the band seemed to disagree. Said Fred Turner:\n\n{{quote|Since he (Randy) was funding the whole thing, everything went on his and Mercury's timetable. It finally came to a head for ''Freeways'' when Blair, Rob and myself told Randy we were burnt out, didn't like the songs we were writing, didn't like the songs he was writing, and that we wanted to take some time to regroup {{ndash}} especially since all the other bands were taking a year or two between albums, not doing two a year like we were. Randy told us his songs were fine and forced the album. It ended that version of the band.<ref name=Heatley/>}}\n\nYears later, Randy seemed to agree with Turner, stating, \"Looking at it now, we should have taken four, five, six months off ... live a little, and then come back together with new ideas. In retrospect, that's what a lot of great bands do. And we didn't.\"<ref name=Heatley/> ''Freeways'' only reached #70 on the US pop albums chart and had no charting singles.\n\nRandy Bachman left the group following ''Freeways''. His initial intention was to temporarily disband while he worked on a solo project, \"But it was decided by management it wouldn't work.\" He conceded, \"We also ran out of common interests.\"<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/>\n\nRandy was replaced by bassist [[Jim Clench]], formerly of [[April Wine]]. Bassist Turner moved to rhythm guitar with Thornton becoming the primary lead guitarist. Clench and Turner shared lead vocal duties. Even though this line-up included drummer Robbie Bachman, the band had to record and tour only as \"BTO\" because of an agreement with Randy who wanted to retain the rights to his surname for his solo career.<ref name=\"RBinterview\"/> While Randy kept the rights to the full Bachman name, the remaining band members bought the rights to \"BTO\" and the gear logo.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> The re-structured BTO released ''[[Street Action]]'' in February 1978. The album became a commercial failure, spawning no hit singles.\n\nThe band also released ''[[Rock n' Roll Nights]]'' in March 1979. It was the first BTO album to prominently feature outside songwriters, particularly [[Prism (band)|Prism]]'s [[Jim Vallance]], who also co-produced the album. Vallance had taken over as main producer after Barry Mraz was fired by the band, and would later score huge success in the 80s with [[Bryan Adams]]. But like its predecessor, ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' also sold poorly (an estimated 350,000 copies worldwide). The album did, however, produce a moderately successful single called \"Heartaches\". Written by Turner, it cracked the Top 40 in Canada and reached number 60 on the US charts, making it the first BTO single in three years to chart in the US.<ref>The song was later a hit for [[Anne Murray]], from her ''[[Something to Talk About (album)|Something to Talk About]]'' album (1986).</ref> BTO played this song on [[American Bandstand]] in February 1979 (with producer Vallance guesting on piano), along with another single from the same album called \"[[Jamaica (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Jamaica]]\". Fred Turner and Jim Clench also appeared on ''[[Bryan Adams (album)|Bryan Adams]]''' debut album in 1980 as session musicians.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} (Adams had likewise contributed one song, \"Wastin' Time\", for BTO for the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' album).\n\nOn November 3, 2010, [[Jim Clench]] died in a [[Montreal]] hospital after a battle with stage-four lung cancer.<ref name=\"thestar\">{{cite news|title=April Wine and BTO former bassist Jim Clench dies|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/886479--jim-clench-bassist-with-april-wine-and-bto-dies-at-61|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=TheStar.com|location=Toronto|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC\">{{cite news|title=CBC News \u2013 Music \u2013 April Wine, BTO musician Jim Clench dies|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2010/11/05/jim-clench-obit.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=CBC.ca|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|title=Lives Remembered \u2013 Telegraph \u2013 Jim Clench|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8124442/Lives-Remembered.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|location=London|date=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"obit\">{{cite web|title=The Gazette (Montreal) \u2013 Obituaries|url=http://www.legacy.com/can-montreal/Obituaries.asp?Page=Lifestory&PersonId=146420804|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Legacy.com via MontrealGazette.com}}</ref>\n\n===Disbandment, side projects, and reunions 1979\u20131991===\n\nBTO completed the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' tour in late 1979, and officially disbanded in early 1980. After Randy recorded the solo album ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]'' in 1978, he went on to form the short-lived [[Ironhorse]] in 1979. Ironhorse released two albums, ''Ironhorse'' and ''Everything Is Grey'', before disbanding. Tom Sparks was the vocalist for the first Ironhorse album, along with Randy, but was replaced by Frank Ludwig for the second album in 1980. Sparks reportedly did not like the constant touring and being away from home for such long amounts of time. A reformed version of Ironhorse, renamed as \"Union\", released one album in 1981 entitled ''On Strike''. Fred Turner was a member of Union along with Randy Bachman.\n\nBTO reunited in 1983. Their line-up for their first studio LP in five years (released in 1984) consisted of Randy and Tim Bachman, Fred Turner, joined by former [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]] drummer [[Garry Peterson]] and [[Billy Chapman (musician)|Billy Chapman]], their drum tech, on piano & keyboards. Younger brother Robbie Bachman declined to participate after business and [[trademark]] disagreements with Randy and the others:\n\n{{quote|When Randy wanted to get back together again, I said, \"Okay, let's have a publishing company with the band. Let's all write the tunes. We'll all share equally and there won't be any more animosity.\" He said no, so I got up and left. Blair wasn't asked to rejoin because Randy knew that Blair wouldn't take any crap like Timmy would. They went out and started to use the name BTO within a year and the same trademark that Randy sold to us! So Blair and I sued him and we won. They had to pay us royalties.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/>}}\n\nIn Randy's 2000 autobiography, ''Takin' Care of Business'', he counters that Robbie declined to participate in the reunion when he and Fred refused to share in the publishing royalties of the hit BTO songs Randy and Fred authored.\n\nThe new album, simply (and confusingly) titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|BTO]]'', was released in September 1984 on Charlie Fach's new Compleat label. \"For the Weekend\", a song from this album, was released as a single, along with a companion music video, and dented the US charts at No. 83. It was the first chart appearance by a BTO song in five years, and would also be the last.\n\nIn 1986, they released a live album culled from their 1985 tour called ''[[Live Live Live|Live! Live! Live!]]'' which featured two new tracks, \"Bad News Travels Fast\" and \"Fragile Man\". The latter was actually a studio recording with the audience sound added to it. A studio version of \"Bad News Travels Fast\" was released on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]''. They were the opening band for the new [[Sammy Hagar]]-fronted [[Van Halen]] on their ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. This plum opening slot was done by a trio line-up of Randy, Tim and Garry Peterson (allegedly with some bass parts and Fred's voice provided via tapes) since Fred Turner had been unavailable when the group was first contacted by Van Halen's management.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> Chapman later stepped in as drummer for Peterson after the latter severely injured his leg while playing [[softball]] during the group's downtime on the road.\n\nAfter the Van Halen tour ended, Randy split and Tim kept going briefly as BTO (see line-ups below). The others reluctantly gave him permission to do so to get his way out of debt. Billy Chapman later became the drummer for Randy Bachman's band and drummed on Randy's 1993 solo album Any Road.\n\nIn 1988, the 1974\u201377 ''Not Fragile'' line-up (Randy, Fred, Blair, Robbie) reformed once again, took to the road and recorded an unknown number of songs together. The only song to make it out into the public by this version of the band was a cover of the song \"[[Wooly Bully]]\", which is only available on the ''[[American Boyfriends]]'' movie soundtrack. But by late 1991, Randy Bachman had left the group again. Two explanations exist for this happening. The first, according to Randy Bachman, was that the band agreed to take a break. But at some point the other members decided they wanted to continue doing concerts because the money was too good to pass up. Randy stated they asked him to tour with them but he was working on another project and had to decline. The others then chose to go on as BTO without him. In the second explanation, the other members (particularly Robbie and Blair) have maintained that Randy quit.\n\n===''Trial by Fire'' era (1991\u20132005)===\nRandy Bachman was replaced by [[Randy Murray]] after his last departure from the band in late 1991. (Murray had been in Tim Bachman's 1987\u201388 touring incarnations of BTO.) This reconstituted version of BTO (Murray with Robbie Bachman, Fred Turner and Blair Thornton) proved to be its most enduring as they toured together from 1991 until December 2004. ''[[Trial by Fire: Greatest and Latest]]'' was released in 1996 and was their last album to contain any new material.\n\nThe sibling rivalry between Robbie and Randy that had started with the 1984 reunion album continued during this era. Said Randy in a 1999 interview, \"They said, 'We'll just call ourselves BTO. People will know you're not there.' The problem is when BTO pulls into town, the radio, the press people, call them Bachman-Turner Overdrive. It's like Coke and Coca-Cola, two names that go hand in hand. It kind of gets represented that I'm there and when they play the gig, I clearly am not there. [And] they've got another guy to take my place who unfortunately is named Randy. So there's this inference that I'm there and I'm not there, which is a disservice to the fans.\"<ref>Interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com/RandyBachmanInterview.html classicbands.com]</ref> Replied brother Robbie, \"Randy Murray doesn't fill anyone's shoes. He brings his own.\"<ref>BTO bio at [http://www.canadianbands.com/BTO.html canadianbands.com].</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] voted to induct Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive into the museum. However, the band would have had to play as the ''Not Fragile'' line-up, meaning the inclusion of Randy Bachman to the band for that performance. The current version of BTO at the time declined the invitation unless they could be inducted as \"BTO\" without Randy Bachman playing on stage. The Hall refused and the band was not inducted (the \"classic\" lineup of Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton and Robbie Bachman would eventually be inducted - by astronaut [[Chris Hadfield]] - in 2014).<ref>http://canadianmusichalloffame.ca/inductee/bachman-turner-overdrive/</ref>\n\nIn an interview in 2004, Rob Bachman had stated that BTO was working on nine or ten new songs.<ref>A clip of one song from those recordings, \"Can't Take It with You\", is available along with the interview at [http://www.btorocks.com btorocks.com]</ref> It has been reported from numerous sources that the band could not get a good label to release the project and wanted this album to be distributed and publicized well, unlike what happened to the ''Trial by Fire'' CD. There was also a plan to release a live DVD/CD from a show in 2003 in their hometown of Winnipeg, but thus far this has not happened.\n\n===Hiatus 2005\u20132009===\nSince the last disbandment of the band in 2005, several of their albums have been reissued. The first one to be made available again since the disbandment was ''Freeways'' in 2005, followed by ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II'' in 2006 and ''Four Wheel Drive'' in 2008. ''Brave Belt I'' and ''Brave Belt II'' were re-released on a single CD March 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?r=1&EAN=664140644724&ourl=Brave%2DBelt%2DI%2DBrave%2DBelt%2DII%2FBrave%2DBelt |title=Brave Belt I/Brave Belt II, Brave Belt, Music CD - Barnes & Noble |publisher=Music.barnesandnoble.com |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Rob and Blair have remained very reticent about BTO since late 2004, Rob has been rumoured to state he no longer wishes to play in the band and has hung up his drum sticks.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, Tim Bachman played on stage at one of Randy Bachman's shows, the first time they had played on stage together since 2003. Randy Bachman, who already hosted the successful radio show \"Randy's Vinyl Tap\", was slated to be the host of a new television show called \"Road to Guitar\", which was set to air on the Discovery Channel. He was on tour with Burton Cummings during the summer of 2009, and played dates for the Randy Bachman Band in the United States and Canada for August and September.\n\nRandy Murray still plays occasional shows around the Vancouver area. He is the only ''Trial by Fire''\u2013era member of BTO, besides Fred Turner, to have played shows after the disbandment in January 2005. Like Rob, Murray has also stated he no longer wishes to be in BTO.\n\n===Bachman and Turner reunion 2009\u20132018===\n{{further|Bachman & Turner}}\nDue to the intense interest in a Bachman-Turner reunion, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner announced their reteaming on December 8, 2009 in their hometown of Winnipeg.\n\nInformation on the 2010 Bachman & Turner tour and the new album was provided at their then-new website ''bachmanandturner.com''. As Randy wrote on the site, the project started with his request to Turner that he sing lead on the song, \"Rock 'n Roll Is the Only Way Out\". But after hearing the track with Turner's vocals, Randy asked if his former bandmate could contribute more vocals and some original compositions and offered to put his solo project on hold in favour of a Bachman-Turner album. It morphed into a full-blown collaboration.<ref>Bios at [http://www.bachmanandturner.com bachmanandturner.com].</ref><ref>Randy Bachman interview at [http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/randy-bachman-0611/ gibson.com]</ref>\n\nOn September 12, 2009, the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' had already reported that Randy Bachman and C.F. Turner would reunite to play concert dates in Europe, Canada and the US in 2010 backed by Randy's current band of Marc LaFrance, Mick Dalla-Vee and Brent Howard, billed simply as Bachman & Turner. Some early confirmed tour dates announced were June 2010 at the Sweden Rock Festival and the High Voltage Festival in July 2010 at London UK; the story added that there was also interest from agents as far away as South America and Australia.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams |first=Rob |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/bachman-turner-takin-care-of-business-59119202.html |title=Bachman, Turner takin' care of business |newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe tour and album plans of 'Bachman & Turner' resulted in a lawsuit by Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton regarding ownership of the band name and related trademarks.<ref>Bachman and [[Burton Cummings]] have encountered similar difficulties in relation to the [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]] name, which is owned by original bassist [[Jim Kale]], which has resulted in Bachman & Cummings touring since 2005 as simply Bachman-Cummings rather than The Guess Who; see [[The Guess Who]].</ref> Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton claim that US and Canadian rights in the BTO name and trademark were transferred to Rob Bachman, Blair Thornton and Fred Turner when Randy Bachman commenced a solo career in 1977.<ref>Ownership of rights in relation to the name(s) outside of the United States and Canada are uncertain.</ref><ref>It is unclear whether this claim relates to both \"Bachman-Turner Overdrive\" and \"BTO\", or solely the latter.</ref> Randy Bachman is said to have registered the names \"Bachman-Turner\", \"BTU\", \"Bachman-Turner United\" and \"Bachman-Turner Union\" in both the United States and Canada.<ref>The current status of European or global ownership of the band name(s) and trademarks is uncertain.</ref> These names are said to cause confusion with the names \"Bachman-Turner Overdrive\" and \"BTO\", resulting in potential damages to Rob Bachman and Blair Thornton.<ref>Dan Ferguson, [http://www.bclocalnews.com/surrey_area/surreyleader/news/69028532.html Battle Over Bachman-Turner Overdrive Name] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109204730/http://www.bclocalnews.com/surrey_area/surreyleader/news/69028532.html |date=November 9, 2009 }}; Surrey North Delta Leader, November 3, 2009.</ref> There appeared to be general legal agreement that one could perform under one's own legal names such as \"Bachman & Turner\", so the newly reunited pair were billed as such for the 2010 tour and album.  The band played the halftime show at the 2010 [[Grey Cup]] in [[Edmonton]].\n\nThe rock duo's self-titled album, ''[[Bachman & Turner]]'', was released September 7, 2010 in North America and on September 20, 2010 in Europe.  In November 2010, they performed at the famous Roseland Ballroom in New York City as part of their North American tour. A double live album ([[Live at the Roseland Ballroom, NYC]]) was recorded at that show, which was also filmed and will be released on DVD and Blu-ray later in the year. / Line-up:\nRandy Bachman (guitars, vocals); C.F. Turner (bass, vocals); Marc LaFrance (drums, percussion, vocals); Brent Howard Knudsen (guitars, vocals); Mick Dalla-Vee (guitars, vocals).\n\nCapitalizing on the recent Bachman & Turner album and supporting shows, BTO released another compilation set in 2013: ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive: 40th Anniversary]]''.  It has 26 songs on two CDs. Much of the collection had been released before, but there were four previously unreleased songs, including \"Rough Ride\" from the 1984 ''BTO'' reunion album sessions and \"West Coast Turnaround\" from the 1975 ''Head On'' sessions.<ref name=BTO40th>[https://www.discogs.com/Bachman-Turner-Overdrive-40th-Anniversary-Deluxe-Edition/release/10218353 BachmanTurner Overdrive: 40th Anniversary (Deluxe Edition)] Track listing at discogs.com, retrieved January 3, 2019.</ref> The CD set also features one Brave Belt song (\"Never Comin' Home\"), and eight songs on disc two are from the long out-of-print ''[[B.T.O.

Disc two also adds live versions of \"Blue Collar\" and \"Give It Time\", recorded at the same Japan concerts but not released on the vinyl edition.<ref name=BTO40th/> On March 10, 2018, Randy Bachman announced that Fred Turner would be retiring from touring.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\"/>\n\n==Impact and influence==\nBTO has been recognized in many music circles for carrying on the torch of guitar-heavy rock and roll at a time when soft rock was dominating the Top 40 charts, and progressive and glam acts were getting an increasing share of FM radio play. As drummer Rob Bachman put it: \"We were basically fans of all kinds of music, but really liked the old kind of rock-and-roll...like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and the funky kinds of rock bands like [[The Rolling Stones|The Stones]]. Luckily for us, [[Creedence Clearwater Revival|Creedence]] had just called it quits, and we came out with three- and four-chord rock-and-roll with Fred Turner's gruff voice. So it was basically this working man's kind of rock-and-roll.\"\n\nA reviewer assesses, however, that critics are divided over BTO's legacy:\n\n{{quote|Dave Marsh noted that the band peaked with ''Not Fragile'', an album that \"seemed to exhaust Bachman's imagination; everything before and since is simply sluggish.\" The band's entry in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock'' acknowledges BTO's limitations, while properly assessing their assets: \"However much it might be open to derision as formula cash-register boogie, BTO's rock is at least dexterously played and arranged, with dynamics reminiscent of mid-period [[Led Zeppelin]].\" For a period during the mid-1970s, BTO enjoyed high sales, steady radio play, and sold out arena shows.<ref name=\"enotesBTO\"/>}}\n\nStated John Einarson, author of the biography ''Randy Bachman: Still Takin' Care of Business'', \"If The Guess Who made Canadian music North American, Bachman-Turner Overdrive made it international, earning gold and platinum records not only in the US and Canada, but in Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, among others.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO/>\n\n[[Stephen King]] derived his [[Richard Bachman]] pen name from Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive when he was listening to the band's song \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\" at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.<ref name=kingbachman>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stephenking.com/faq.html#1.6\n|title=Stephen King FAQ: 'Why did you write books as Richard Bachman?'\n|author=King, Stephen\n|accessdate=December 13, 2006|publisher=StephenKing.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band was featured in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Saddlesore Galactica]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF09 |title=Saddlesore Galactica |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRandy Bachman and Fred Turner also appeared in the 2012 comedy movie ''[[The Campaign (film)|The Campaign]]'', making a cameo performing the song \"Taking Care of Business\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-campaign-set-visit/|title=20 Things to Know from THE CAMPAIGN Set Visit|last=Wampler|first=Scott|date=July 25, 2012|accessdate=January 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" was also the title of a 1990 [[Taking Care of Business (film)|movie]] starring [[Jim Belushi]] as an escaped convict who wins tickets to see the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[World Series]] and finds the [[Filofax]] of businessman [[Charles Grodin]].

The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action. They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style. An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.\n\nIn \"[[The Note (Seinfeld)|The Note]]\", the first episode of season three, the bumper music featured a [[Scat singing|scatting]] female jazz singer who sang a phrase that sounded like \"easy to beat\". Jerry Seinfeld and executive producer Larry David both liked Wolff's additions, and three episodes were produced with this new style music. However, they had neglected to inform NBC and Castle Rock executives of the change, and when the season premiere aired, the executives were surprised and unimpressed, and requested that they return to the original style. The subsequent two episodes were redone, leaving this episode as the only one with additional music elements.<ref>Season 3 DVD: Inside Look of 'The Note'</ref> In the commentary of \"The Note\", Louis-Dreyfus facetiously suggests it was removed because the perceived lyric related closely to the low ratings at the time.<ref>Season 3 DVD: 'The Note' commentary</ref>\n\nIn the final three seasons, the bits were tweaked slightly with more frantic rhythms; a bass guitar was added in addition to the sampled bass from earlier seasons. Throughout the show, the main theme could be restyled in different ways depending on the episode.

Rapid scene-shifts between plot lines bring the stories together. Even though it does not follow a pattern as other sitcoms, the characters' stories variously intertwine in each episode. Despite the separate plot strands, the narratives reveal the creators' \"consistent efforts to maintain the intimacy\" among the small cast of characters.<ref>Gantz, Katherine.

It didn't yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade's previous NBC successes like ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[The Golden Girls]].'' [[Brandon Tartikoff]] was not convinced that the show would work. A Jewish man from New York himself, Tartikoff characterized it as \"Too New York, too Jewish\" (a sentiment which would also lead to the Cosmo character's later surname change from the more Jewish-sounding Kessler to Kramer).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krieger|first=Rosalin|date=October 2003|title=\"Does he actually say the word Jewish?\" \u2013 Jewish representations inSeinfeld|journal=Journal for Cultural Research|volume=7|issue=4|pages=387\u2013404|doi=10.1080/1479758032000165048|issn=1479-7585}}</ref>  Test audiences were even harsher. NBC's practice at the time was to recruit 400 households by phone to ask them to evaluate pilots it aired on an unused channel on its cable system. An NBC research department memo summarized the pilot's performance among the respondents as \"weak\", which [[Warren Littlefield]], then second-in-command in NBC's entertainment division, called \"a dagger to the heart\".<ref name=TVGuide/> Comments included, \"You can't get too excited about two guys going to the laundromat\"; \"Jerry's loser friend George isn't a forceful character\"; \"Jerry needs a stronger supporting cast\"; and \"Why are they interrupting the stand-up for these stupid stories?\"<ref name=S1&2DVD-NAN/> Seinfeld and David didn't see the memo for several years, but after they became aware of it, they hung it in a bathroom on the set. Seinfeld comments, \"We thought, if someone goes in to use this bathroom, this is something they should see. It fits that moment.\"<ref name=TVGuide/>\n\nAround the time the show's pilot was filmed, Castle Rock Entertainment, which produced the show, had also produced another pilot for NBC that featured [[Ann Jillian]] in her almost-similarly eponymous [[Ann Jillian (TV series)|TV series]]. After ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'' tested poorly among audiences, Castle Rock then devoted their focus to Jillian's series, which tested better with audiences and received a full-season order. ''Ann Jillian'' would last only a single season of 13 episodes and would be off the air by the end of 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/seinfeld-finale-at-20-hidden-tales-vault-a-comedians-bizarro-world-1111377 |title='Seinfeld' Finale at 20: Hidden Tales From the Vault of a Comedian's Bizarro World |last=Freeman|first=Marc |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=May 13, 2018 |website=Encyclopedia of Things |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=Castle Rock, which owned the series, had two pilots at NBC that year: Seinfeld and one with Ann Jillian.

Despite the poor test results, Ludwin cancelled one of the [[Bob Hope]] specials budgeted for that season so that the entertainment division had the money to order four more episodes of ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'', which formed the rest of [[Seinfeld (season 1)|the show's first season]] (the series was by then retitled to just ''Seinfeld'');<ref name=TVGuide/><ref>{{cite web|last=Duffy|first=Mike|url=https://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1125seinfeld.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723085248/http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1125seinfeld.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 23, 2012|title=Give thanks for 'The 'Seinfeld' Story'|publisher=azcentral.com|date=November 24, 2004|accessdate=March 19, 2008}}</ref> a move without which ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' columnist [[Phil Rosenthal]] later stated there would be no ''Seinfeld''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-08-21/business/0508210218_1_warren-littlefield-rick-ludwin-head-of-nbc-entertainment |author= Rosenthal, Phil |authorlink= Phil Rosenthal |date= August 21, 2005 |title= NBC executive stands apart by taking stands|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate= September 26, 2012}}</ref> Although this was a very low order number for a new series (the smallest sitcom order in TV history<ref name=S1&2DVD-NAN/>), Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order.<ref name=TVGuide/> The show was renamed simply ''Seinfeld'', but it wouldn't return to the airwaves until May 30, 1990, and it would be another three years before it became a Top 5-rated show. Preston Beckman, who was in charge of NBC's research department at the time, reminisced, \"The show was different. Nobody had seen anything like it. It wasn't unusual for poor-testing shows to get on the air, but it was very rare that they became hits.\"\n\nWhen it was first repeated on July 5, 1990, it received a rating of 13.9/26.

To begin with, the boundary between reality and fiction is frequently blurred: this is illustrated in the central device of having Jerry Seinfeld play the character Jerry Seinfeld. In the show's fourth season, several episodes revolved around the narrative of Jerry and George (whose character is co-creator Larry David's alter ego) pitching 'a show about nothing' based on the everyday life of a stand-up comedian to NBC. The reaction of the fictional NBC executives, by all accounts, mirrored the initial responses of those who eventually commissioned Seinfeld. The fourth season ends with [[The Pilot (Seinfeld)|'The Pilot']], an episode focusing on the casting, taping and screening of the show-within-the-show, ''Jerry''. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.<ref>{{cite web| author = Miller, Nod| title = Applying Insights from Cultural Studies to Adult Education: What Seinfeld Says About the AERC| url = http://www.adulterc.org/Proceedings/1999/99miller.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140624022756/http://www.adulterc.org/Proceedings/1999/99miller.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date = June 24, 2014| publisher = Adult Education Research Conference| accessdate = August 1, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n[[William Irwin (philosopher)|William Irwin]] has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in ''Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing''.

These might be a central feature of a plot (e.g., [[Junior Mints]], [[Twix]], [[Chuckles]], [[Jujyfruits]], bite size [[3 Musketeers (chocolate bar)|Three Musketeers]], [[Snickers]], [[Nestl\u00e9 Chunky]], [[Oh Henry!]], [[Drake's Cakes|Drake's]] Coffee Cake and [[PEZ]]), or an association of candy with a guest character (e.g. [[Oh Henry!]] bars) or simply a conversational aside (e.g., [[Chuckles]], [[Clark Bar]], [[Twinkies]]). A large number of non-candy products were also featured throughout the series.\n\nThe show's creators claim that they weren't engaging in a product placement strategy for commercial gain. One motivation for the use of real-world products, quite unrelated to commercial considerations, is the comedy value of funny-sounding phrases and words. \"I knew I wanted Kramer to think of watching the operation like going to see a movie\", explained ''Seinfeld'' writer/producer Andy Robin in an interview published in ''The Hollywood Reporter''. \"At first, I thought maybe a piece of popcorn falls into the patient. I ran that by my brother, and he said, 'No, Junior Mints are just funnier.'\"<ref>{{cite news|title=A look at some of the biggest hits in movie and TV product placement|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011140335/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 28, 2005|accessdate=November 10, 2007|author=Staff}}</ref>\n\nMany advertisers capitalized on the popularity of ''Seinfeld''. [[American Express]] created a [[webisode]] where Jerry Seinfeld and an animated [[Superman]] (voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]], who played the role of Puddy) starred in its commercial. The makers of the [[Contraceptive sponge|Today Sponge]] created the \"Spongeworthy\" game, on their website, inspired by \"[[The Sponge]]\". An advertisement featured Jason Alexander in a [[Chrysler]] commercial. In this, Alexander acts much like his character George, and his relationship with [[Lee Iacocca]] plays on his George's relationship with Steinbrenner. Similarly, Michael Richards was the focus of a series of advertisements for [[Vodafone]] which ran in Australia where he dressed and acted exactly like Kramer, including the trademark bumbling pratfalls.\n\nIn addition, the show occasionally incorporated fictional products like a [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] brand called \"Hennigan's\" (a [[portmanteau]] of \"[[Hennessy]]\" and \"[[Brannigans]]\") and a [[canned meat]] product called \"Beef-a-reeno\" (a parody of \"[[Chef Boyardee|Beef-a-roni]]\").\n\n==Home media==\n===DVD releases===\n[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released all nine seasons of ''Seinfeld'' on [[DVD]] in Regions 1, 2 and 4 between 2004 and 2007.<ref name=\"TV show region 1\"/> On November 6, 2007, ''Seinfeld: The Complete Series'' was released on DVD.

Almost every show was canceled quickly, usually within the first season. This gave rise to the term ''Seinfeld curse'': the failure of a sitcom starring one of the three, despite the conventional wisdom that each person's ''Seinfeld'' popularity should almost guarantee a strong, built-in audience for the actor's new show. Shows specifically cited regarding the ''Seinfeld curse'' are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's ''[[Watching Ellie]]'', Jason Alexander's ''[[Bob Patterson (TV series)|Bob Patterson]]'' and ''[[Listen Up!

''Seinfeld'' is set predominantly in an apartment building in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]] in New York City.

At times, he appears [[Naivety|na\u00efve]], gullible, and ignorant, and at other times, intelligent, understanding, and well-read; similarly, he is exaggeratedly successful, socially, with his charisma and laid-back personality. This is seen in his success with women and employers. He has been described as a \"hipster doofus\".

The fictional ''Jerry'' was launched in the season four finale, but unlike ''Seinfeld'', it wasn't picked up as a series. ''Jerry'' is one of many examples of [[metafiction]] in the show.

The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action. They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style. An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.\n\nIn \"[[The Note (Seinfeld)|The Note]]\", the first episode of season three, the bumper music featured a [[Scat singing|scatting]] female jazz singer who sang a phrase that sounded like \"easy to beat\". Jerry Seinfeld and executive producer Larry David both liked Wolff's additions, and three episodes were produced with this new style music. However, they had neglected to inform NBC and Castle Rock executives of the change, and when the season premiere aired, the executives were surprised and unimpressed, and requested that they return to the original style. The subsequent two episodes were redone, leaving this episode as the only one with additional music elements.<ref>Season 3 DVD: Inside Look of 'The Note'</ref> In the commentary of \"The Note\", Louis-Dreyfus facetiously suggests it was removed because the perceived lyric related closely to the low ratings at the time.<ref>Season 3 DVD: 'The Note' commentary</ref>\n\nIn the final three seasons, the bits were tweaked slightly with more frantic rhythms; a bass guitar was added in addition to the sampled bass from earlier seasons. Throughout the show, the main theme could be restyled in different ways depending on the episode. For instance, in \"The Betrayal\", part of which takes place in India, the theme is heard played on a [[sitar]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Seinfeld episodes}}\n{{:List of Seinfeld episodes}}\n\n''Seinfeld'' stood out from family and group [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] of its time.

Rapid scene-shifts between plot lines bring the stories together. Even though it does not follow a pattern as other sitcoms, the characters' stories variously intertwine in each episode. Despite the separate plot strands, the narratives reveal the creators' \"consistent efforts to maintain the intimacy\" among the small cast of characters.<ref>Gantz, Katherine.

Another example is Jerry's girlfriend Vanessa, who appears in \"[[The Stake Out (Seinfeld)|The Stake Out]]\" and he ends the relationship when things do not work out in \"[[The Stock Tip]]\". Other examples are Kramer getting his jacket back and Elaine heading the \"Peterman catalog\". [[Larry David]], the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''\u2014David's later comedy series\u2014expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for all but one season in the series.\n\nA major difference between ''Seinfeld'' and sitcoms which preceded it is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous towards the outside world and sometimes one another.

Created by [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Larry David]], developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the buttoning of the top button on one's shirt and the effort by men to properly interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld's apartment.<ref name=TVGuide>Battaglio, Stephen (June 30, 2014). \"'Annoying' 'Disorienting' 'Boring': On ''Seinfeld's'' 25th anniversary an exclusive look at the memo that almost killed the show\".

It didn't yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade's previous NBC successes like ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[The Golden Girls]].'' [[Brandon Tartikoff]] was not convinced that the show would work. A Jewish man from New York himself, Tartikoff characterized it as \"Too New York, too Jewish\" (a sentiment which would also lead to the Cosmo character's later surname change from the more Jewish-sounding Kessler to Kramer).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krieger|first=Rosalin|date=October 2003|title=\"Does he actually say the word Jewish?\" \u2013 Jewish representations inSeinfeld|journal=Journal for Cultural Research|volume=7|issue=4|pages=387\u2013404|doi=10.1080/1479758032000165048|issn=1479-7585}}</ref>  Test audiences were even harsher. NBC's practice at the time was to recruit 400 households by phone to ask them to evaluate pilots it aired on an unused channel on its cable system. An NBC research department memo summarized the pilot's performance among the respondents as \"weak\", which [[Warren Littlefield]], then second-in-command in NBC's entertainment division, called \"a dagger to the heart\".<ref name=TVGuide/> Comments included, \"You can't get too excited about two guys going to the laundromat\"; \"Jerry's loser friend George isn't a forceful character\"; \"Jerry needs a stronger supporting cast\"; and \"Why are they interrupting the stand-up for these stupid stories?\"<ref name=S1&2DVD-NAN/> Seinfeld and David didn't see the memo for several years, but after they became aware of it, they hung it in a bathroom on the set. Seinfeld comments, \"We thought, if someone goes in to use this bathroom, this is something they should see. It fits that moment.\"<ref name=TVGuide/>\n\nAround the time the show's pilot was filmed, Castle Rock Entertainment, which produced the show, had also produced another pilot for NBC that featured [[Ann Jillian]] in her almost-similarly eponymous [[Ann Jillian (TV series)|TV series]]. After ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'' tested poorly among audiences, Castle Rock then devoted their focus to Jillian's series, which tested better with audiences and received a full-season order. ''Ann Jillian'' would last only a single season of 13 episodes and would be off the air by the end of 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/seinfeld-finale-at-20-hidden-tales-vault-a-comedians-bizarro-world-1111377 |title='Seinfeld' Finale at 20: Hidden Tales From the Vault of a Comedian's Bizarro World |last=Freeman|first=Marc |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=May 13, 2018 |website=Encyclopedia of Things |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=Castle Rock, which owned the series, had two pilots at NBC that year: Seinfeld and one with Ann Jillian.

The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'',<ref name=TVGuide/> receiving a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 10.9/19.<ref name=S1&2DVD-NAN/> The ratings didn't exhibit regional skew that Tartikoff predicted, much to the encouragement of the show's supporters. Despite the poor test results, Ludwin cancelled one of the [[Bob Hope]] specials budgeted for that season so that the entertainment division had the money to order four more episodes of ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'', which formed the rest of [[Seinfeld (season 1)|the show's first season]] (the series was by then retitled to just ''Seinfeld'');<ref name=TVGuide/><ref>{{cite web|last=Duffy|first=Mike|url=https://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1125seinfeld.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723085248/http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1125seinfeld.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 23, 2012|title=Give thanks for 'The 'Seinfeld' Story'|publisher=azcentral.com|date=November 24, 2004|accessdate=March 19, 2008}}</ref> a move without which ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' columnist [[Phil Rosenthal]] later stated there would be no ''Seinfeld''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-08-21/business/0508210218_1_warren-littlefield-rick-ludwin-head-of-nbc-entertainment |author= Rosenthal, Phil |authorlink= Phil Rosenthal |date= August 21, 2005 |title= NBC executive stands apart by taking stands|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate= September 26, 2012}}</ref> Although this was a very low order number for a new series (the smallest sitcom order in TV history<ref name=S1&2DVD-NAN/>), Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order.<ref name=TVGuide/> The show was renamed simply ''Seinfeld'', but it wouldn't return to the airwaves until May 30, 1990, and it would be another three years before it became a Top 5-rated show. Preston Beckman, who was in charge of NBC's research department at the time, reminisced, \"The show was different. Nobody had seen anything like it. It wasn't unusual for poor-testing shows to get on the air, but it was very rare that they became hits.\"\n\nWhen it was first repeated on July 5, 1990, it received a rating of 13.9/26. These ratings were high enough to secure a second season.<ref name=\"S1&2DVD-NAN\" /> NBC research showed that the show was popular with young male adults, a demographic sought after by advertisers.

To begin with, the boundary between reality and fiction is frequently blurred: this is illustrated in the central device of having Jerry Seinfeld play the character Jerry Seinfeld. In the show's fourth season, several episodes revolved around the narrative of Jerry and George (whose character is co-creator Larry David's alter ego) pitching 'a show about nothing' based on the everyday life of a stand-up comedian to NBC. The reaction of the fictional NBC executives, by all accounts, mirrored the initial responses of those who eventually commissioned Seinfeld. The fourth season ends with [[The Pilot (Seinfeld)|'The Pilot']], an episode focusing on the casting, taping and screening of the show-within-the-show, ''Jerry''. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.<ref>{{cite web| author = Miller, Nod| title = Applying Insights from Cultural Studies to Adult Education: What Seinfeld Says About the AERC| url = http://www.adulterc.org/Proceedings/1999/99miller.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140624022756/http://www.adulterc.org/Proceedings/1999/99miller.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date = June 24, 2014| publisher = Adult Education Research Conference| accessdate = August 1, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n[[William Irwin (philosopher)|William Irwin]] has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in ''Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing''.

These might be a central feature of a plot (e.g., [[Junior Mints]], [[Twix]], [[Chuckles]], [[Jujyfruits]], bite size [[3 Musketeers (chocolate bar)|Three Musketeers]], [[Snickers]], [[Nestl\u00e9 Chunky]], [[Oh Henry!]], [[Drake's Cakes|Drake's]] Coffee Cake and [[PEZ]]), or an association of candy with a guest character (e.g. [[Oh Henry!]] bars) or simply a conversational aside (e.g., [[Chuckles]], [[Clark Bar]], [[Twinkies]]). A large number of non-candy products were also featured throughout the series.\n\nThe show's creators claim that they weren't engaging in a product placement strategy for commercial gain. One motivation for the use of real-world products, quite unrelated to commercial considerations, is the comedy value of funny-sounding phrases and words. \"I knew I wanted Kramer to think of watching the operation like going to see a movie\", explained ''Seinfeld'' writer/producer Andy Robin in an interview published in ''The Hollywood Reporter''. \"At first, I thought maybe a piece of popcorn falls into the patient. I ran that by my brother, and he said, 'No, Junior Mints are just funnier.'\"<ref>{{cite news|title=A look at some of the biggest hits in movie and TV product placement|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011140335/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 28, 2005|accessdate=November 10, 2007|author=Staff}}</ref>\n\nMany advertisers capitalized on the popularity of ''Seinfeld''. [[American Express]] created a [[webisode]] where Jerry Seinfeld and an animated [[Superman]] (voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]], who played the role of Puddy) starred in its commercial. The makers of the [[Contraceptive sponge|Today Sponge]] created the \"Spongeworthy\" game, on their website, inspired by \"[[The Sponge]]\". An advertisement featured Jason Alexander in a [[Chrysler]] commercial. In this, Alexander acts much like his character George, and his relationship with [[Lee Iacocca]] plays on his George's relationship with Steinbrenner. Similarly, Michael Richards was the focus of a series of advertisements for [[Vodafone]] which ran in Australia where he dressed and acted exactly like Kramer, including the trademark bumbling pratfalls.\n\nIn addition, the show occasionally incorporated fictional products like a [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] brand called \"Hennigan's\" (a [[portmanteau]] of \"[[Hennessy]]\" and \"[[Brannigans]]\") and a [[canned meat]] product called \"Beef-a-reeno\" (a parody of \"[[Chef Boyardee|Beef-a-roni]]\").\n\n==Home media==\n===DVD releases===\n[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released all nine seasons of ''Seinfeld'' on [[DVD]] in Regions 1, 2 and 4 between 2004 and 2007.<ref name=\"TV show region 1\"/> On November 6, 2007, ''Seinfeld: The Complete Series'' was released on DVD.

An Oxford University Cycling Club has been formed\".<ref>''Liverpool Daily Post'', Tuesday, 31 January 1939, p. 12.</ref> it was reported that members of the club had participated in an initial club ride on 29th January. The hope was expressed that Cambridge would follow suit, and that the Varsity races would soon resume. It did not, though, prove possible to organize a challenge race prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], mobilization for which stripped Oxford (and Cambridge) of most of its students and led to the disappearance of the so-recently reconstituted club. \n\nDuring the 1950/51 academic year a small club was once again active, though mainly for the purposes of recreational cycling. In the following year it acquired a handful of keen racing members, among them the ebullient Malcolm Prince (Jesus Coll.) who, with Brian Stackhouse (University Coll.) cycled to London to represent the club at the inaugural meeting of the British Universities' Cycling Union (BUCU). In 1953, the club organized the BUCU 25-mile T.T. championship and later in the same year it competed against the Cambridge University Cycle Racing Club (now CUCC) in a \"3-up\"  team time trial on a \"neutral\" course near [[Whipsnade]]. Cambridge \"rode over\" to win, after the Oxford team suffered mechanical failure.  The club at this time had a single female member, Margaret Wilkinson (Lady Margaret Hall) , while J. B. Leishman (St. John's Coll.), the translator of the poems of [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke,]]<ref>Letter, M. V. Prince to the editor of ''Oxford Today,'' 13 December 1997,  in reply to letter of Peter Hopkins to the same: 'Letters', ''Oxford Today'' 10.1 (Hilary Term 1997).</ref> was persuaded to serve as the obligatory Senior Member. \n\nAfter another brief hiatus, the club was restarted in Michaelmas Term 1957 by Peter Hopkins (Exeter Coll.), Jim Thompson and Bill Speck (both Queen's Coll.), and a formal constitution was drawn up and approved by a large, new membership. The only non-University, associate members allowed by the Proctors were the three senior officers of Oxford City Road Club, in recognition of the city club's friendly disposition to University cyclists.The club immediately joined the [[National Cyclists' Union]] and also became affiliated (for road racing) to the break-away [[British League of Racing Cyclists]]. The club gained its first female members at this time. The first woman to join was\u00a0 Anne Sims (St. Anne\u2019s Coll.) in October 1957, with others soon following. Sunday club-runs became well supported and separate training rides were established. Touring immediately flourished within the club, co-existing happily with the racing imperative,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Michael|title=Re: Cyclists. 200 Years on Two Wheels|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4729-2559-6|location=London|pages=256-7}}</ref> and the first touring weekend took place during the Christmas vacation of 1957\u201358. In 1958, following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter.\n\nIn its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under [[Cycling Time Trials]] (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years. \n\nIn the 1960's and 1970's, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed \u2018club\u2019 cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college \u2018Cuppers\u2019 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only [[Roy Cromack]], then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to-late \u201860s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. \u2018all-rounder\u2019, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trials he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance,\u00a0was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match. \n\nIn the early-to-mid 1970's, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970's, the  racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member, Rolls Royce Junior Research Fellow Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.). Defiantly, it entered teams in \u201c3-up\u201d and \u201c4-up\u201d time-trial \u201cOpen\u201d events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London,\u00a0whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.<ref>\"Varsity Verve\", ''Oxford Mail,'' 12 May 1982.</ref>\n\nIn the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980's by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by [[Dick Poole (cyclist)|Dick Poole]], the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980's. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of\u00a0cycling for sheer enjoyment.\u00a0While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the [[Scholar Gypsy]] affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-280136-8|location=Oxford|pages=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Penny|title=St Hugh\u2019s: One Hundred Years of Women\u2019s Education in Oxford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-07727-4|location=Basingstoke and London|pages=118}}</ref> The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time. \n\n==Inter-university achievements==\nIn 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c8d24e5e-5284-34be-9efc-693894b5b8b4|title=British Universities' Sports Association Records Administrative/Biographical History|last=|first=|date=|website=Jisc Archives Hub|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> 100-mile championship in South Lancashire. Since then, OUCC has been highly successful in competition, particularly in inter-university championships, gaining [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]] / BSSF titles in every type of road racing event; notable winning years being 1990 (Jonathan Atkinson: individual Hill-Climb), 1991 (S.

Jim Henderson was riding for OUCC when he won the first of his five National hill climb titles on Dover's Hill in 1998.  2000 proved to be an outstanding year for the women's team which that year won golds in the BUSA Hill Climb and the [[Cyclo-cross]] race, while achieving overall second place in the track championships.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Will|last2=Jones|first2=Piers|date=2000|title=Sports Review 2000|url=|journal=University of Oxford Sports Review|volume=|pages=7|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni<ref>Notability solely in the context of cycling, including achievements before, during and after membership of the club.</ref>==\n* A.

In 1953, the club organized the BUCU 25-mile T.T. championship and later in the same year it competed against the Cambridge University Cycle Racing Club (now CUCC) in a \"3-up\"  team time trial on a \"neutral\" course near [[Whipsnade]]. Cambridge \"rode over\" to win, after the Oxford team suffered mechanical failure.  The club at this time had a single female member, Margaret Wilkinson (Lady Margaret Hall) , while J. B. Leishman (St. John's Coll.), the translator of the poems of [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke,]]<ref>Letter, M. V. Prince to the editor of ''Oxford Today,'' 13 December 1997,  in reply to letter of Peter Hopkins to the same: 'Letters', ''Oxford Today'' 10.1 (Hilary Term 1997).</ref> was persuaded to serve as the obligatory Senior Member. \n\nAfter another brief hiatus, the club was restarted in Michaelmas Term 1957 by Peter Hopkins (Exeter Coll.), Jim Thompson and Bill Speck (both Queen's Coll.), and a formal constitution was drawn up and approved by a large, new membership. The only non-University, associate members allowed by the Proctors were the three senior officers of Oxford City Road Club, in recognition of the city club's friendly disposition to University cyclists.The club immediately joined the [[National Cyclists' Union]] and also became affiliated (for road racing) to the break-away [[British League of Racing Cyclists]]. The club gained its first female members at this time. The first woman to join was\u00a0 Anne Sims (St. Anne\u2019s Coll.) in October 1957, with others soon following. Sunday club-runs became well supported and separate training rides were established. Touring immediately flourished within the club, co-existing happily with the racing imperative,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Michael|title=Re: Cyclists. 200 Years on Two Wheels|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4729-2559-6|location=London|pages=256-7}}</ref> and the first touring weekend took place during the Christmas vacation of 1957\u201358. In 1958, following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter.\n\nIn its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under [[Cycling Time Trials]] (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years. \n\nIn the 1960's and 1970's, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed \u2018club\u2019 cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college \u2018Cuppers\u2019 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only [[Roy Cromack]], then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to-late \u201860s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. \u2018all-rounder\u2019, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trials he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance,\u00a0was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match. \n\nIn the early-to-mid 1970's, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970's, the  racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member, Rolls Royce Junior Research Fellow Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.). Defiantly, it entered teams in \u201c3-up\u201d and \u201c4-up\u201d time-trial \u201cOpen\u201d events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London,\u00a0whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.<ref>\"Varsity Verve\", ''Oxford Mail,'' 12 May 1982.</ref>\n\nIn the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980's by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by [[Dick Poole (cyclist)|Dick Poole]], the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980's. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of\u00a0cycling for sheer enjoyment.\u00a0While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the [[Scholar Gypsy]] affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-280136-8|location=Oxford|pages=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Penny|title=St Hugh\u2019s: One Hundred Years of Women\u2019s Education in Oxford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-07727-4|location=Basingstoke and London|pages=118}}</ref> The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time. \n\n==Inter-university achievements==\nIn 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c8d24e5e-5284-34be-9efc-693894b5b8b4|title=British Universities' Sports Association Records Administrative/Biographical History|last=|first=|date=|website=Jisc Archives Hub|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> 100-mile championship in South Lancashire.

The per-position fund will grow depending on the amount of new, full-time positions created.
