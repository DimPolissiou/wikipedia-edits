These twelve trials were all held before U.S. military courts, not before the [[International Military Tribunal]], but took place in the same rooms at the [[Palace of Justice (Nuremberg)|Palace of Justice]]. The twelve U.S. trials are collectively known as the \"[[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]]\" or, more formally, as the \"Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals\" (NMT).\n\nThis case is also known as the '''Wilhelmstrasse Trial''', so-named because both the [[Reich Chancellery]] and the [[German Foreign Office]] were located at the [[Wilhelmstrasse]] street in Berlin, which was often used as a [[metonym]] for overall German governmental administration. The defendants in this case were officials of various ''[[Nazi Germany|Reich]]'' ministries, facing various charges for their roles in [[Nazi Germany]] and thus their participation in or [[command responsibility|responsibility]] for the numerous atrocities committed both in Germany and in occupied countries during the war.\n\nThe judges in this case, heard before Military Tribunal VI, were [[William C. Christianson]] (presiding judge) from [[Minnesota]], [[Robert F. Maguire]] from [[Oregon]] and [[Leon W. Powers]] from [[Iowa]]. The Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was [[Telford Taylor]]; the chief prosecutor was [[Robert Kempner]]. The [[indictment]] was filed on 15 November 1947; the hearings lasted from 6 January 1948 until 18 November that year. Five months later, on 11 April 1949, the judges presented their 833-page judgment. Sentences were handed down on 13 April 1949. Of all the twelve trials, this was the one that lasted longest and ended last. Of the 21 defendants [[arraignment|arraigned]], two were acquitted, the other 19 were found guilty on at least one count of their indictments and received prison sentences ranging from three years to 25 years.\n\nThe defendants were indicted on seven counts:\n\nCount 1: [[Crime against peace|Crimes Against Peace]]\n\nCount 2: Taking part in a common plan or conspiracy to commit the aforementioned crimes\n\nCount 3: [[War crimes]]\n\nCount 4: [[Crimes Against Humanity]]\n\nCount 5: War crimes and Crimes Against Humanity through the plundering and spoliation of the [[Occupied Territories]]\n\nCount 6: War crimes and Crimes Against Humanity through the enslavement and deportation of concentration camp prisoners and civilians in the occupied countries for slave labor.\n\nCount 7: Membership in a criminal organization, the NSDAP and the SS.\n\nCount 2 was dropped by the NMT in all trials.\n\n== Defendants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Name\n!align=center|Photo\n!align=\"left\"|Function\n!align=\"left\"|Sentence\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|[[Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker]]\n|[[Image:Ernst Heinrich von Weizs\u00e4cker.jpg|60px]]\n|valign=\"top\"|Permanent [[Secretary of State]] in the ''[[Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt]]'' (Foreign Ministry) under [[Joachim Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] until 1943, then [[ambassador]] to the [[Holy See]]; [[SS]]-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]''.

Neither side had attained significant victory when peace was agreed upon in 1446, and Z\u00fcrich was readmitted to the confederation in 1450.<ref name=\"History of Zurich\">{{cite web |url=http://www.europe-cities.com/en/605/switzerland/zurich/history/period/ |title=History of Z\u00fcrich |work=europe-cities.com |access-date=27 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403174319/http://www.europe-cities.com/en/605/switzerland/zurich/history/period/ |archive-date=3 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Murerplan Zuerich.jpg|thumb|left|The ''{{lang|de|[[Murerplan]]}}'' of 1576]]\n[[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]] started the [[Swiss Reformation]] at the time when he was the main preacher in the 1520s, at the {{lang|de|[[Grossm\u00fcnster]]}}. He lived there from 1484 until his death in 1531. The [[Z\u00fcrich Bible]], based on that of Zwingli, was issued in 1531. The Reformation resulted in major changes in state matters and civil life in Z\u00fcrich, spreading also to a number of other cantons. Several cantons remained Catholic and became the basis of serious conflicts that eventually led to the outbreak of the [[Wars of Kappel]].\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Council of Z\u00fcrich adopted an isolationist attitude, resulting in a second ring of imposing fortifications built in 1624. The [[Thirty Years' War]] which raged across Europe motivated the city to build these walls. The fortifications required a lot of resources, which were taken from subject territories without reaching any agreement. The following revolts were crushed brutally. In 1648, Z\u00fcrich proclaimed itself a republic, shedding its former status of a free imperial city.<ref name=\"History of Zurich\"/> In this time the political system of Z\u00fcrich was an [[oligarchy]] (''{{lang|de|Patriziat}}''): the dominant families of the city were the following ones: Bonstetten, Brun, B\u00fcrkli, Escher vom Glas, Escher vom Luchs, Hirzel, Jori (or von Jori), Kilchsperger, Landenberg, Manesse, Meiss, Meyer von Knonau, M\u00fclner, von Orelli.\n[[File:Bild Zueriputsch1839.jpg|thumb|Fighting on the {{lang|de|[[Paradeplatz]]}} during the {{lang|de|[[Z\u00fcriputsch]]}}]]\nThe [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic Revolution]] of 1798 saw the fall of the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]}}. Z\u00fcrich lost control of the land and its economic privileges, and the city and the canton separated their possessions between 1803\u201305. In 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its urban subjects, following the {{lang|de|[[Z\u00fcriputsch]]}} of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th century were torn down, without ever having been besieged, to allay rural concerns over the city's [[hegemony]]. The [[Treaty of Z\u00fcrich]] between Austria, France, and Sardinia was signed in 1859.<ref>[[New International Encyclopedia]]</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich - Z\u00fcrich Bahnhofplatz - 000006617 1.jpg|thumb|left|{{lang|de|Bahnhofplatz}} in 1900]]\nZ\u00fcrich was the Federal capital for 1839\u201340, and consequently, the victory of the Conservative party there in 1839 caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Z\u00fcrich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845\u201346, Z\u00fcrich took the lead in opposing the [[Sonderbund]] cantons. Following the Sonderbund war and the formation of the Swiss Federal State, Z\u00fcrich voted in favour of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and of 1874. The enormous [[immigration]] from the country districts into the town from the 1830s onwards created an industrial class which, though \"settled\" in the town, did not possess the privileges of [[burghership]], and consequently had no share in the municipal government. First of all in 1860 the town schools, hitherto open to \"settlers\" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years' residence ''ipso facto'' conferred the right of burghership, and in 1893 the eleven outlying districts were incorporated within the town proper.\n\nExtensive developments took place during the 19th century. From 1847, the ''{{lang|de|Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn}}'', the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Z\u00fcrich with [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], putting the {{lang|de|[[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof]]}} at the origin of the [[Swiss Federal Railways|Swiss rail]] network. The present building of the ''{{lang|de|Hauptbahnhof}}'' (the main railway station) dates to 1871. Z\u00fcrich's {{lang|de|[[Bahnhofstrasse]]}} (Station Street) was laid out in 1867, and the [[SIX Swiss Exchange|Z\u00fcrich Stock Exchange]] was founded in 1877. [[Industrialisation]] led to migration into the cities and to rapid population growth, particularly in the suburbs of Z\u00fcrich.\n\nThe {{lang|de|[[Quaianlagen (Z\u00fcrich)|Quaianlagen]]}} are an important milestone in the development of the modern city of Z\u00fcrich, as the construction of the new lake front transformed Z\u00fcrich from a small medieval town on the rivers [[Limmat]] and [[Sihl]] to an attractive modern city on the {{lang|de|Z\u00fcrichsee}} shore, under the guidance of the city engineer [[Arnold B\u00fcrkli]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn 1893, the twelve outlying districts were incorporated into Z\u00fcrich, including Aussersihl, the workman's quarter on the left bank of the Sihl, and additional land was reclaimed from Lake Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/z/zurich_switzerland_capital.html |title=Zurich, Switzerland (Capital) |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 1911 |accessdate=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101084616/http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/z/zurich_switzerland_capital.html |archive-date=1 November 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, eight additional districts in the north and west of Z\u00fcrich were incorporated.\n\nZ\u00fcrich was [[bombings of Switzerland in World War II|accidentally bombed]] during World War II.\n\n===Coat of arms===\n[[File:Z\u00fcrich - Rathaus - Portikus-Details IMG 1112.jpg|thumb|upright|The coat of arms on the [[Z\u00fcrich town hall|Town Hall]]]]\nThe blue and white [[coat of arms]] of Z\u00fcrich is attested from 1389 and was derived from banners with blue and white stripes in use since 1315.

The red ''{{lang|de|Schwenkel}}'' on top of the banner had varying interpretations: For the people of Z\u00fcrich, it was a mark of honour, granted by [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph I]]. Z\u00fcrich's neighbours mocked it as a sign of shame, commemorating the loss of the banner at [[Winterthur]] in 1292.

The [[Sihl]] meets with the Limmat at the end of Platzspitz, which borders the [[Swiss National Museum]]. The Limmat reaches the lowest point of the municipality in [[Oberengstringen]] at {{convert|392|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].\n\n[[File:Zurich area topographic map-en.svg|thumb|left|Topographic map of Z\u00fcrich and surroundings]]\n[[File:Z\u00fcrichsee - Enge - Uetliberg IMG 2193.JPG|thumb|Felsenegg from Lake Z\u00fcrich]]\n[[File:Zurich.JPG|thumb|Z\u00fcrich from Waidberg]]\nOn its west side, the Limmat valley is flanked by the wooded heights of the [[Albis]] chain, which runs along the western border. The [[Uetliberg]] is, with {{convert|869|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the highest elevation of the surrounding area. Its summit can be reached easily by the [[Uetlibergbahn]]. From the platform of the observation tower on the summit, an impressive panorama of the city, the lake, and the Alps can be seen.\n\nThe northeast side of the Limmat valley includes a range of hills, which marks the watershed between the Limmat and the Glatt. From the northwest to the southeast, the height of the mostly wooded knolls generally increases: the Gubrist ({{convert|615|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the H\u00f6nggerberg ({{convert|541|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the [[K\u00e4ferberg]] ({{convert|571|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the [[Z\u00fcrichberg]] ({{convert|676|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the [[Adlisberg]] ({{convert|701|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the [[\u00d6schbrig]] ({{convert|696|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Between the K\u00e4ferberg and the Z\u00fcrichberg is located the saddle of the Milchbuck (about {{convert|470|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), an important passage from the Limmat valley to the Glatt valley.\n\nThe northernmost part of the municipality extends to the plain of the Glatt valley and to the saddle which makes the connection between the Glattal and Furttal. Also, a part of the [[Katzensee]] (nature reserve) and the B\u00fcsisee, both of which are drained by the Katzenbach to Glatt, belong to the city.\n\n===Climate===\nZ\u00fcrich has, depending on the definition used, an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb''), but in the higher areas it is defined as a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb,'' using 0&nbsp;\u00b0C isoterm) with warm summers and four distinct seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=6660&cityname=Z%25FCrich%252C+Zurich%252C+Switzerland&units=|title=Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> Decisive for the climate of Z\u00fcrich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the [[Bise]] (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average.

In addition, the public transport network includes boats on the lake and river, funicular railways and even the [[Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg]] (LAF), a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] between [[Adliswil]] and [[Felsenegg]]. Tickets purchased for a trip are valid on all means of public transportation (train, tram, bus, boat). The [[Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft]] (commonly abbreviated to ZSG) operates passenger vessels on the Limmat and the Lake Z\u00fcrich, connecting surrounding towns between Z\u00fcrich and [[Rapperswil]].\n\n[[File:Bahnhofshalle Zuerich-2.jpg|thumb|left|The busy Hauptbahnhof main hall]]\nZ\u00fcrich is a mixed hub for railways, roads, and air traffic.

Second, cyclists' safety should be improved to lower the overall accident risk. Third, cycling should be established as an everyday means of transport with a special focus on children and young people.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, the city aims to build up a network of distinctive bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes (''Hauptrouten'') for everyday use and comfort routes (''Komfortrouten''), with the latter focussing on leisure cycling. Additional measures such as special ''Velostationen'' providing bike related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the key projects of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]] planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave their bikes throughout the day.<ref>[http://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/mit-dem-velo-in-den-autobahntunnel-1.17516011./ Mit dem Velo in den Autobahntunnel]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung''.

Another Swiss city with a comparable status was [[Geneva]], the so-called ''Protestant Rome'', where [[John Calvin]] and his [[Protestant Reformers]] operated. Z\u00fcrich attracted other influential [[Protestant Reformers]] like [[Heinrich Bullinger]]. Zwingli translated the Bible ([[Z\u00fcrich Bible]]) into the local variety of [[German language|German]] and introduced the Reformation by winning support of the magistrates, the princess abbess [[Katharina von Zimmern]] and the largely peasant population of the [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich]]. The canton unanimously adopted the [[Calvinism|Reformed tradition]] as represented by Zwingli. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants tormented the [[Swiss Confederacy]]. Zwingli died for political and religious reasons by defending the Canton of Z\u00fcrich in the [[Battle of Kappel]]. Bullinger took over his role as the city's spiritual leader.\n\nIn 1970, about 53% of the population were [[Swiss Reformed Church|Swiss Reformed]], while almost 40% were Roman Catholic. Since then both large Swiss churches, the Roman Catholic Church and Swiss Reformed Church, have been constantly losing members, though for the Catholic Church the decrease started 20 years later in around 1990. Nevertheless, for the last twenty years both confessions have been reduced by 10% to the current figures (census 2010): 30% Roman Catholic and 26% Swiss Reformed (organized in [[Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich]]). In 1970, only 2% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants claimed to be not affiliated with any religious confession. In accordance with the loss by the large Swiss churches, the number of people declaring themselves as non-affiliated rose to 17% in the year 2000. In the last ten years, this figure rose to more than 25%. For the group of people, being between 24 and 44 years old, this is as high as one in every third person.<ref name=Etablierte_Kirchen>{{cite web |publisher=Pr\u00e4sidialdepartement der Stadt Z\u00fcrich (Department of the Mayor) |title=Etablierte Kirchen in Bedr\u00e4ngnis |date=18 September 2012 |url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/prd/de/index/statistik/publikationen-angebote/publikationen/webartikel/2012-09-18_Etablierte-Kirchen-in-Bedraengnis.html |author=Simon Villiger |language=de |location=Zurich, Switzerland |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923055342/https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/prd/de/index/statistik/publikationen-angebote/publikationen/webartikel/2012-09-18_Etablierte-Kirchen-in-Bedraengnis.html |archive-date=23 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n5% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants are [[Muslims]], a slight decrease of 1% compared to the year 2000.

The Roman castle remained standing until the 7th century. A [[Carolingian]] castle, built on the site of the Roman castle by the grandson of [[Charlemagne]], [[Louis the German]], is mentioned in 835 (''in castro Turicino iuxta fluvium Lindemaci''). Louis also founded the [[Fraum\u00fcnster]] abbey in 853 for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the [[Benedictine]] convent with the lands of Z\u00fcrich, [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], and the [[Albis]] forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority. In 1045, King [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city.<ref>[http://www.europe-cities.com/en/605/switzerland/zurich/history/period/ Early History of Z\u00fcrich] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403174319/http://www.europe-cities.com/en/605/switzerland/zurich/history/period/ |date=3 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nZ\u00fcrich gained [[Imperial immediacy]] (''{{lang|de|Reichsunmittelbar}}'', becoming an [[Imperial free city]]) in 1218 with the extinction of the main line of the [[House of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringer family]] and attained a status comparable to statehood.

The political power of the convent slowly waned in the 14th century, beginning with the establishment of the ''{{lang|de|Zunftordnung}}'' ([[z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|guild]] laws) in 1336 by [[Rudolf Brun]], who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not nominated by the abbess.\n\nAn important event in the early 14th century was the completion of the [[Manesse Codex]], a key source of medieval German poetry.

Thus, Z\u00fcrich became the fifth member of the Confederacy, which was at that time a loose confederation of ''de facto'' [[cantons of Switzerland|independent states]]. Z\u00fcrich was the presiding canton of the Diet from 1468 to 1519. This authority was the executive council and lawmaking body of the confederacy, from the Middle Ages until the establishment of the [[Switzerland|Swiss federal state]] in 1848. Z\u00fcrich was temporarily expelled from the confederacy in 1440 due to a war with the other member states over the territory of [[Toggenburg]] (the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]]).

He lived there from 1484 until his death in 1531. The [[Z\u00fcrich Bible]], based on that of Zwingli, was issued in 1531. The Reformation resulted in major changes in state matters and civil life in Z\u00fcrich, spreading also to a number of other cantons. Several cantons remained Catholic and became the basis of serious conflicts that eventually led to the outbreak of the [[Wars of Kappel]].\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Council of Z\u00fcrich adopted an isolationist attitude, resulting in a second ring of imposing fortifications built in 1624. The [[Thirty Years' War]] which raged across Europe motivated the city to build these walls. The fortifications required a lot of resources, which were taken from subject territories without reaching any agreement. The following revolts were crushed brutally. In 1648, Z\u00fcrich proclaimed itself a republic, shedding its former status of a free imperial city.<ref name=\"History of Zurich\"/> In this time the political system of Z\u00fcrich was an [[oligarchy]] (''{{lang|de|Patriziat}}''): the dominant families of the city were the following ones: Bonstetten, Brun, B\u00fcrkli, Escher vom Glas, Escher vom Luchs, Hirzel, Jori (or von Jori), Kilchsperger, Landenberg, Manesse, Meiss, Meyer von Knonau, M\u00fclner, von Orelli.\n[[File:Bild Zueriputsch1839.jpg|thumb|Fighting on the {{lang|de|[[Paradeplatz]]}} during the {{lang|de|[[Z\u00fcriputsch]]}}]]\nThe [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic Revolution]] of 1798 saw the fall of the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]}}. Z\u00fcrich lost control of the land and its economic privileges, and the city and the canton separated their possessions between 1803\u201305. In 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its urban subjects, following the {{lang|de|[[Z\u00fcriputsch]]}} of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th century were torn down, without ever having been besieged, to allay rural concerns over the city's [[hegemony]].

But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Z\u00fcrich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845\u201346, Z\u00fcrich took the lead in opposing the [[Sonderbund]] cantons. Following the Sonderbund war and the formation of the Swiss Federal State, Z\u00fcrich voted in favour of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and of 1874. The enormous [[immigration]] from the country districts into the town from the 1830s onwards created an industrial class which, though \"settled\" in the town, did not possess the privileges of [[burghership]], and consequently had no share in the municipal government. First of all in 1860 the town schools, hitherto open to \"settlers\" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years' residence ''ipso facto'' conferred the right of burghership, and in 1893 the eleven outlying districts were incorporated within the town proper.\n\nExtensive developments took place during the 19th century. From 1847, the ''{{lang|de|Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn}}'', the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Z\u00fcrich with [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], putting the {{lang|de|[[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof]]}} at the origin of the [[Swiss Federal Railways|Swiss rail]] network. The present building of the ''{{lang|de|Hauptbahnhof}}'' (the main railway station) dates to 1871. Z\u00fcrich's {{lang|de|[[Bahnhofstrasse]]}} (Station Street) was laid out in 1867, and the [[SIX Swiss Exchange|Z\u00fcrich Stock Exchange]] was founded in 1877. [[Industrialisation]] led to migration into the cities and to rapid population growth, particularly in the suburbs of Z\u00fcrich.\n\nThe {{lang|de|[[Quaianlagen (Z\u00fcrich)|Quaianlagen]]}} are an important milestone in the development of the modern city of Z\u00fcrich, as the construction of the new lake front transformed Z\u00fcrich from a small medieval town on the rivers [[Limmat]] and [[Sihl]] to an attractive modern city on the {{lang|de|Z\u00fcrichsee}} shore, under the guidance of the city engineer [[Arnold B\u00fcrkli]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn 1893, the twelve outlying districts were incorporated into Z\u00fcrich, including Aussersihl, the workman's quarter on the left bank of the Sihl, and additional land was reclaimed from Lake Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/z/zurich_switzerland_capital.html |title=Zurich, Switzerland (Capital) |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 1911 |accessdate=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101084616/http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/z/zurich_switzerland_capital.html |archive-date=1 November 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, eight additional districts in the north and west of Z\u00fcrich were incorporated.\n\nZ\u00fcrich was [[bombings of Switzerland in World War II|accidentally bombed]] during World War II.\n\n===Coat of arms===\n[[File:Z\u00fcrich - Rathaus - Portikus-Details IMG 1112.jpg|thumb|upright|The coat of arms on the [[Z\u00fcrich town hall|Town Hall]]]]\nThe blue and white [[coat of arms]] of Z\u00fcrich is attested from 1389 and was derived from banners with blue and white stripes in use since 1315.

The Alps can be seen from the city center, background to the lake.]]\nZ\u00fcrich is situated at {{convert|408|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] on the lower (northern) end of [[Lake Z\u00fcrich]] (''{{lang|de|Z\u00fcrichsee}}'') about {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us}} north of the [[Alps]], nestling between the wooded hills on the west and east side. The Old Town stretches on both sides of the [[Limmat]], which flows from the lake, running northwards at first and then gradually turning into a curve to the west. The geographic (and historic) centre of the city is the [[Lindenhof hill|Lindenhof]], a small natural hill on the west bank of the Limmat, about {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} north of where the river issues from Lake Z\u00fcrich. Today the incorporated city stretches somewhat beyond the natural confines of the hills and includes some districts to the northeast in the [[Glatt Valley]] (''{{lang|de|Glattal}}'') and to the north in the [[Limmat Valley]] (''{{lang|de|Limmattal}}''). The boundaries of the older city are easy to recognize by the Schanzengraben canal. This artificial watercourse has been used for the construction of the [[Fortifications of Z\u00fcrich|third fortress]] in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n===Topography===\nThe municipality of Z\u00fcrich has an area of {{convert|91.88|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|4.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is made up of Lake Z\u00fcrich. The area includes a section of the northern [[Swiss Plateau]]. The banks of the Limmat constitute the densest part of the city. The river is oriented in the southeast\u2013northwest direction, with the flat valley floor having a width of two to {{convert|2|to|3|km|spell=in|abbr=off}}. The partially channeled and straightened Limmat does not flow in the central part of the valley, but always along its right (northeastern) side. The [[Sihl]] meets with the Limmat at the end of Platzspitz, which borders the [[Swiss National Museum]]. The Limmat reaches the lowest point of the municipality in [[Oberengstringen]] at {{convert|392|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].\n\n[[File:Zurich area topographic map-en.svg|thumb|left|Topographic map of Z\u00fcrich and surroundings]]\n[[File:Z\u00fcrichsee - Enge - Uetliberg IMG 2193.JPG|thumb|Felsenegg from Lake Z\u00fcrich]]\n[[File:Zurich.JPG|thumb|Z\u00fcrich from Waidberg]]\nOn its west side, the Limmat valley is flanked by the wooded heights of the [[Albis]] chain, which runs along the western border. The [[Uetliberg]] is, with {{convert|869|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, the highest elevation of the surrounding area. Its summit can be reached easily by the [[Uetlibergbahn]]. From the platform of the observation tower on the summit, an impressive panorama of the city, the lake, and the Alps can be seen.\n\nThe northeast side of the Limmat valley includes a range of hills, which marks the watershed between the Limmat and the Glatt. From the northwest to the southeast, the height of the mostly wooded knolls generally increases: the Gubrist ({{convert|615|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the H\u00f6nggerberg ({{convert|541|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the [[K\u00e4ferberg]] ({{convert|571|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the [[Z\u00fcrichberg]] ({{convert|676|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the [[Adlisberg]] ({{convert|701|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the [[\u00d6schbrig]] ({{convert|696|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Between the K\u00e4ferberg and the Z\u00fcrichberg is located the saddle of the Milchbuck (about {{convert|470|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), an important passage from the Limmat valley to the Glatt valley.\n\nThe northernmost part of the municipality extends to the plain of the Glatt valley and to the saddle which makes the connection between the Glattal and Furttal. Also, a part of the [[Katzensee]] (nature reserve) and the B\u00fcsisee, both of which are drained by the Katzenbach to Glatt, belong to the city.\n\n===Climate===\nZ\u00fcrich has, depending on the definition used, an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb''), but in the higher areas it is defined as a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb,'' using 0&nbsp;\u00b0C isoterm) with warm summers and four distinct seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=6660&cityname=Z%25FCrich%252C+Zurich%252C+Switzerland&units=|title=Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> Decisive for the climate of Z\u00fcrich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the [[Bise]] (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average.

The [[Z\u00fcrichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft]] (commonly abbreviated to ZSG) operates passenger vessels on the Limmat and the Lake Z\u00fcrich, connecting surrounding towns between Z\u00fcrich and [[Rapperswil]].\n\n[[File:Bahnhofshalle Zuerich-2.jpg|thumb|left|The busy Hauptbahnhof main hall]]\nZ\u00fcrich is a mixed hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof]] (''Z\u00fcrich HB'') is the largest and busiest station in Switzerland and is an important railway hub in Europe. There are between 350,000 and 500,000 commuters daily making use of this central network node \u2013 a significant figure in comparison to Z\u00fcrich's population. With regard to the number of trains daily entering and leaving a single railway station, Z\u00fcrich HB is the world's most frequently served railway station, with 2915 trains every day.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Among the 16 railway stations (and 10 additional train stops) within Z\u00fcrich's city borders, there are five other major passenger railway stations. Three of them belong to the ten most frequented railway stations in Switzerland: [[Z\u00fcrich Stadelhofen railway station|Stadelhofen]], [[Z\u00fcrich Oerlikon railway station|Oerlikon]], [[Z\u00fcrich Altstetten railway station|Altstetten]], [[Z\u00fcrich Hardbr\u00fccke railway station|Hardbr\u00fccke]], and [[Z\u00fcrich Enge railway station|Enge]]. The railway network is mainly operated by the [[Swiss Federal Railways|Swiss Federal Railways (SBB&nbsp;CFF&nbsp;FFS)]], but Z\u00fcrich is also served by major [[EuroCity]] trains from the neighbouring countries and is a destination for both French/Swiss ([[TGV Lyria]]) and German ([[Intercity-Express|ICE]]) high-speed trains, as well as by Austrian [[\u00d6BB|RailJet]].\n\n===Zurich Airport===\n[[Zurich Airport]] is located less than {{convert|10|km|mi|sp=us}} northeast of the city in [[Kloten]]. Zurich Airport has its own railway station, which is located underground. It is directly connected to Z\u00fcrich and most of the major Swiss cities. Zurich Airport is served by more than 60 passenger airlines from around the world. It is also served by one cargo airline and is a hub for [[Swiss International Air Lines]]. There is also an airfield in [[D\u00fcbendorf]].\n\n===Road traffic===\nThe [[A1 (Switzerland)|A1]], [[A3 motorway (Switzerland)|A3]] and [[A4 (Switzerland)|A4]] motorways pass close to Z\u00fcrich. The A1 heads west towards [[Bern]] and [[Geneva]] and eastwards towards [[St. Gallen]]; the A4 leads northwards to [[Schaffhausen]] and southwards to [[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]] connecting with the [[A2 (Switzerland)|A2]] towards [[Chiasso]]; and the A3 heads northwest towards [[Basel]] and southeast along Lake Z\u00fcrich and [[Lake Walen]] towards [[Sargans]].\n\n===Bicycle transport===\nIn 2012, the city council launched a program to improve the city's attractiveness for bicycle traffic. The so-called \"Masterplan Velo\"<ref>[https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/ted/de/index/taz/publikationen_u_broschueren/masterplan_velo.html/ Masterplan Velo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630164124/https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/ted/de/index/taz/publikationen_u_broschueren/masterplan_velo.html |date=30 June 2017 }} Stadt Z\u00fcrich. Retrieved 29 November 2016</ref> is part of the superordinate framework ''Stadtverkehr 2025'' which shapes the future of the different means of transport. Research revealed that infrastructure and the social environment are essential factors in improving a city's appeal to bicycle traffic.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/01441647.2013.860204|title = Promoting Cycling for Transport: Research Needs and Challenges| journal=Transport Reviews| volume=34| pages=4\u201324|year = 2014|last1 = Handy|first1 = Susan| last2=Van Wee| first2=Bert| last3=Kroesen| first3=Maarten}}</ref> Three main goals are specified: First, the [[modal share]] of bicycle traffic should be enhanced to twice the value of 2011 by 2015. Second, cyclists' safety should be improved to lower the overall accident risk. Third, cycling should be established as an everyday means of transport with a special focus on children and young people.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, the city aims to build up a network of distinctive bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes (''Hauptrouten'') for everyday use and comfort routes (''Komfortrouten''), with the latter focussing on leisure cycling. Additional measures such as special ''Velostationen'' providing bike related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the key projects of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]] planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave their bikes throughout the day.<ref>[http://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/mit-dem-velo-in-den-autobahntunnel-1.17516011./ Mit dem Velo in den Autobahntunnel]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung''. Retrieved 29 November 2016</ref> Apart from infrastructural measures, further approaches are planned in the fields of communication, education and administration.\n\nHowever, these efforts cause critique, mainly due to postponing. The institution of the bike tunnel at the main railway station, originally planned for 2016, is currently (2016) delayed to at least 2019.<ref>[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/stadt/Die-Stadt-bremst-Velofahrer-am-HB-aus/story/23770090/ Die Stadt bremst Velofahrer am HB aus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220090645/http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/stadt/Die-Stadt-bremst-Velofahrer-am-HB-aus/story/23770090/ |date=20 December 2016 }} Tagesanzeiger.

However, because of Z\u00fcrich's national importance, and therefore its existing high fluctuation, one can hear all kinds of Swiss German dialects spoken by its inhabitants and commuters. As of the December 2010 census, 69.3% of the population speaks [[Diglossia|diglossic]] [[Swiss German]]/[[Swiss Standard German]] as their mother-tongue at home. Some 22.7% of inhabitants speak [[Standard German]] in their family environment (\"at home\"). Dramatically increasing, according to the last census in 2000, 8.8% now speak English. Italian follows behind at 7.1% of the population then French at 4.5%. Other languages spoken here include: Croatian and Serbian (4.1%), Spanish (3.9%), Portuguese (3.1%) and Albanian (2.3%).

Another Swiss city with a comparable status was [[Geneva]], the so-called ''Protestant Rome'', where [[John Calvin]] and his [[Protestant Reformers]] operated. Z\u00fcrich attracted other influential [[Protestant Reformers]] like [[Heinrich Bullinger]]. Zwingli translated the Bible ([[Z\u00fcrich Bible]]) into the local variety of [[German language|German]] and introduced the Reformation by winning support of the magistrates, the princess abbess [[Katharina von Zimmern]] and the largely peasant population of the [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich]]. The canton unanimously adopted the [[Calvinism|Reformed tradition]] as represented by Zwingli. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants tormented the [[Swiss Confederacy]]. Zwingli died for political and religious reasons by defending the Canton of Z\u00fcrich in the [[Battle of Kappel]]. Bullinger took over his role as the city's spiritual leader.\n\nIn 1970, about 53% of the population were [[Swiss Reformed Church|Swiss Reformed]], while almost 40% were Roman Catholic. Since then both large Swiss churches, the Roman Catholic Church and Swiss Reformed Church, have been constantly losing members, though for the Catholic Church the decrease started 20 years later in around 1990. Nevertheless, for the last twenty years both confessions have been reduced by 10% to the current figures (census 2010): 30% Roman Catholic and 26% Swiss Reformed (organized in [[Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich]]). In 1970, only 2% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants claimed to be not affiliated with any religious confession. In accordance with the loss by the large Swiss churches, the number of people declaring themselves as non-affiliated rose to 17% in the year 2000. In the last ten years, this figure rose to more than 25%. For the group of people, being between 24 and 44 years old, this is as high as one in every third person.<ref name=Etablierte_Kirchen>{{cite web |publisher=Pr\u00e4sidialdepartement der Stadt Z\u00fcrich (Department of the Mayor) |title=Etablierte Kirchen in Bedr\u00e4ngnis |date=18 September 2012 |url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/prd/de/index/statistik/publikationen-angebote/publikationen/webartikel/2012-09-18_Etablierte-Kirchen-in-Bedraengnis.html |author=Simon Villiger |language=de |location=Zurich, Switzerland |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923055342/https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/prd/de/index/statistik/publikationen-angebote/publikationen/webartikel/2012-09-18_Etablierte-Kirchen-in-Bedraengnis.html |archive-date=23 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n5% of Z\u00fcrich's inhabitants are [[Muslims]], a slight decrease of 1% compared to the year 2000.

It consists of decorated sculptures distributed over the city centre, in public places. Past themes have included lions (1986), cows (1998), benches (2003), teddy bears (2005), and huge flower pots (2009). From this originated the concept of the [[CowParade]] that has been featured in other major world cities.\n\nZ\u00fcrich is also the home to several art movements. The [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z\u00fcrich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] where the [[Dada|Dada movement]] was founded in 1916. Constructive [[Art movement]] took also one of the first steps in Z\u00fcrich. Artists like [[Max Bill]], [[Marcel Breuer]], [[Camille Graeser]] or [[Richard Paul Lohse]] had their ateliers in Z\u00fcrich, which became even more important after the takeover of power by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in Germany and [[World War II]].\n\nThe best known traditional holiday in Z\u00fcrich is the [[Sechsel\u00e4uten]] (''S\u00e4chsil\u00fc\u00fcte''), including a parade of the [[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|guilds]] and the burning of \"winter\" in effigy at the [[Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz]].

For the next 80 or 90 years succeeding the banishment of the apostle John to Patmos covering the successive reigns of the emperors [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]] and the two Antonines ([[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]), a golden age of prosperity, union, civil liberty and good government unstained with civil blood unfolded. The agents of this prosperity personified by the rider of the white horse are these five emperors wearing crowns that reigned with absolute authority and power under the guidance of virtue and wisdom, the armies being restrained by their firm and gentle hands.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|129\u2013131,134}}\n\nThis interpretation points out that the bow was preeminently a weapon of the inhabitants of the island of [[Crete]] and not of the Roman Empire in general. The Cretans were renowned for their archery skills. The significance of the rider of the white horse holding a bow indicates the place of origin of the line of emperors ruling during this time. This group of emperors can be classed together under one and the same head and family whose origins were from Crete.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|140,142\u2013144}}\n\nAccording to this interpretation, this period in Roman history, remarkable, both at its commencement and at its close, illustrated the glory of the empire where its limits were extended, though not without occasional wars, which were always uniformly triumphant and successful on the frontiers. The triumphs of the Emperor Trajan, a Roman Alexander, added to the empire [[Dacia]], [[Armenia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and other provinces during the course of the first 20 years of the period, which deepened the impression on the minds of the barbarians of the invincibility of the Roman Empire. Roman war progressed triumphantly into the invader's own territory, and the Parthian war was successfully ended by the total overthrow of those people. Roman conquest is demonstrated even in the most mighty of these wars, the Marcomannic succession of victories under the second Antonine unleashed on the German barbarians, driven into their forests and reduced to Roman submission.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|131\u2013133}}\n\n===As war===\n\nIn some commentaries to Bibles, the white Horseman is said to symbolize (ordinary) War, which may possibly be exercised on righteous grounds in decent manner, hence the white color, but still is devastating. The red Horseman (see below) then rather more specifically symbolizes civil war.<ref>''Herder'' German Bible, Freiburg im Breisgau 2007, p. 1348, annotation to Apc 6,7: \"The four Horsemen of the Apocalypse symbolize various plagues: [1.] War, [2.] Civil War, [3.] famine and inflation, [4.] pestilence and death.\" (translated from German)</ref>\n\n===As infectious disease===\nUnder another interpretation, the first Horseman is called [[Infection|Pestilence]], and is associated with infectious disease and plague. It appears at least as early as 1906, when it is mentioned in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].<ref name=Singer>{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Isidore|title=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, Volume 10|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YLw5AQAAMAAJ|year=1916|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|page=392|author2=Adler, Cyrus|quote=\"...and sees a white horse appear, with a rider holding a bow (representing, probably, Pestilence).\"}}</ref> This particular interpretation is common [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in popular culture|in popular culture references]] to the Four Horsemen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian|title=The A to Z of Fantasy Literature|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0810868296|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHc3XTdJBxQC&pg=PA18|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of this interpretation is unclear. Some translations of the Bible mention \"[[plague (disease)|plague]]\" (e.g. the [[New International Version|NIV]]) or \"pestilence\" (e.g. the [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]]) in connection with the riders in the passage following the introduction of the fourth rider; cf. \"They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.\" ({{bibleverse|Revelation|6:7\u20138|NASB}} NASB).

The sword was a natural, universal badge among the Romans, of the military profession. The apocalyptic figure indicated by the great sword indicated an undue authority and unnatural use of it. Military men in power, whose vocation was war and weapon the sword, rose by it and also fell.

John hears a voice, unidentified but coming from among [[Chronology of Revelation#Vision of Heaven|the four living creatures]], that speaks of the prices of wheat and barley, also saying \"and see thou hurt not the [[olive oil|oil]] and the [[wine]]\". This suggests that the black horse's famine is to drive up the price of grain but leave oil and wine supplies unaffected (though out of reach of the ordinary worker).

The balance during the time of the apostle John's exile in Patmos was commonly a symbol of justice since it was used to weigh out the grains for a set price.

During his reign, he crushed every part of the empire under the weight of his iron scepter. Old as well as new taxes were at the same time levied in the provinces. In the course of this history, the land tax, the taxes for services and the heavy contributions of corn, wine, oil and meat were exacted from the provinces for the use of the court, army and capital.

That furious plague (the [[Plague of Cyprian]]), which raged from the year 250 to the year 265, continued without interruption in every province, city and almost every family in the empire. During a portion of this time, 5000 people died daily in Rome; and many towns that escaped the attacks of barbarians were entirely depopulated.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|193}}\n\nFor a time in the late 260s, the strength of [[Aurelian]] crushed the enemies of Rome, yet after his assassination certain of them revived.<ref name=GibbonV1 />{{rp|246}} While the Goths had been destroyed for almost a century and the Empire reunited, the Sassanid Persians were uncowed in the East and during the following year hosts of central Asian Alani spread themselves over Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia and Galatia, etching their course by the flames of cities and villages they pillaged.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|197}}\n\nAs for the wild beasts of the earth, according to Elliott, it is a well-known law of nature that they quickly occupy the scenes of waste and depopulation\u2014where the reign of man fails and the reign of beasts begins.

In 92 AD, the [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]] attempted to curb excessive growth of grapevines and encourage grain cultivation instead, but there was major popular backlash against this effort, and it was abandoned.

The signs of the approaching end of the world are likened to birth pains, indicating that they would occur more frequently and with greater intensity the nearer the event of Christ's return. With this perspective the horsemen represent the rise of false religions, false prophets and false messiahs; the increase of wars and rumours of wars; the escalation of natural disasters and famines; and the growth of persecution, martyrdom, betrayal and loss of faith.\n\nAccording to [[Anatoly Fomenko]], the Book of Revelation is largely [[astrological]] in nature.

For the next 80 or 90 years succeeding the banishment of the apostle John to Patmos covering the successive reigns of the emperors [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]] and the two Antonines ([[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]), a golden age of prosperity, union, civil liberty and good government unstained with civil blood unfolded.

The Cretans were renowned for their archery skills. The significance of the rider of the white horse holding a bow indicates the place of origin of the line of emperors ruling during this time. This group of emperors can be classed together under one and the same head and family whose origins were from Crete.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|140,142\u2013144}}\n\nAccording to this interpretation, this period in Roman history, remarkable, both at its commencement and at its close, illustrated the glory of the empire where its limits were extended, though not without occasional wars, which were always uniformly triumphant and successful on the frontiers. The triumphs of the Emperor Trajan, a Roman Alexander, added to the empire [[Dacia]], [[Armenia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and other provinces during the course of the first 20 years of the period, which deepened the impression on the minds of the barbarians of the invincibility of the Roman Empire. Roman war progressed triumphantly into the invader's own territory, and the Parthian war was successfully ended by the total overthrow of those people. Roman conquest is demonstrated even in the most mighty of these wars, the Marcomannic succession of victories under the second Antonine unleashed on the German barbarians, driven into their forests and reduced to Roman submission.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|131\u2013133}}\n\n===As war===\n\nIn some commentaries to Bibles, the white Horseman is said to symbolize (ordinary) War, which may possibly be exercised on righteous grounds in decent manner, hence the white color, but still is devastating. The red Horseman (see below) then rather more specifically symbolizes civil war.<ref>''Herder'' German Bible, Freiburg im Breisgau 2007, p. 1348, annotation to Apc 6,7: \"The four Horsemen of the Apocalypse symbolize various plagues: [1.] War, [2.] Civil War, [3.] famine and inflation, [4.] pestilence and death.\" (translated from German)</ref>\n\n===As infectious disease===\nUnder another interpretation, the first Horseman is called [[Infection|Pestilence]], and is associated with infectious disease and plague.

Some translations of the Bible mention \"[[plague (disease)|plague]]\" (e.g. the [[New International Version|NIV]]) or \"pestilence\" (e.g. the [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]]) in connection with the riders in the passage following the introduction of the fourth rider; cf. \"They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.\" ({{bibleverse|Revelation|6:7\u20138|NASB}} NASB).

The sword was a natural, universal badge among the Romans, of the military profession. The apocalyptic figure indicated by the great sword indicated an undue authority and unnatural use of it. Military men in power, whose vocation was war and weapon the sword, rose by it and also fell.

This suggests that the black horse's famine is to drive up the price of grain but leave oil and wine supplies unaffected (though out of reach of the ordinary worker).

The balance during the time of the apostle John's exile in Patmos was commonly a symbol of justice since it was used to weigh out the grains for a set price.

During the reign of Emperor [[Caracalla]], whose sentiments were very different from the [[Antonines]] being inattentive, or rather averse, to the welfare of the people, he found himself under the necessity of gratifying the greed and excessive lifestyle which he had excited in the Army. During his reign, he crushed every part of the empire under the weight of his iron scepter. Old as well as new taxes were at the same time levied in the provinces. In the course of this history, the land tax, the taxes for services and the heavy contributions of corn, wine, oil and meat were exacted from the provinces for the use of the court, army and capital.

This tyrant, stimulated by the insatiable desires of the soldiers, attacked the public property at length. Every city of the empire was destined to purchase corn for the multitudes as well as supply expenses for the games.

That furious plague (the [[Plague of Cyprian]]), which raged from the year 250 to the year 265, continued without interruption in every province, city and almost every family in the empire.

Elliott, the first seal, as revealed to John by the angel, was to signify what was to happen soon after John seeing the visions in Patmos and that the second, third and fourth seals in like manner were to have commencing dates each in chronological sequence following the preceding seal. Its general subject is the decline and fall, after a previous prosperous era, of the Empire of Heathen Rome.

In 92 AD, the [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]] attempted to curb excessive growth of grapevines and encourage grain cultivation instead, but there was major popular backlash against this effort, and it was abandoned. Famine's mission to make wheat and barley scarce but \"hurt not the oil and the wine\" could be an allusion to this episode.<ref name=LMorris /><ref name=SJCase /> The red horse and its rider, who take peace from the earth, might represent the prevalence of civil strife at the time Revelation was written; internecine conflict ran rampant in the Roman Empire during and just prior to the 1st century AD.<ref name=RMounce /><ref name=LMorris />\n\n===LDS interpretation===\nMembers of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] believe their first prophet, [[Joseph Smith]], revealed that the book described by John \"contains the revealed will, mysteries, and the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence\" and that the seals describe these things for the seven thousand years of the Earth's temporal existence, each seal representing 1,000 years.<ref name=\"lds_dc_77\">LDS [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77.6-7 Doctrine and Covenants, Section 77, verses 6 and 7]</ref>\n\nAbout the first seal and the white horse, LDS [[Apostle]] [[Bruce R.

The signs of the approaching end of the world are likened to birth pains, indicating that they would occur more frequently and with greater intensity the nearer the event of Christ's return. With this perspective the horsemen represent the rise of false religions, false prophets and false messiahs; the increase of wars and rumours of wars; the escalation of natural disasters and famines; and the growth of persecution, martyrdom, betrayal and loss of faith.\n\nAccording to [[Anatoly Fomenko]], the Book of Revelation is largely [[astrological]] in nature. The 'Four Horsemen' represent the [[planets]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].

More than 15 movies were made or claimed to be made from Wright's stories, including [[Gary Cooper]]'s first major movie, ''[[The Winning of Barbara Worth]]'' (1926)<ref name=FleetingFame/> and the [[John Wayne]] film ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills (film)|The Shepherd of the Hills]]'' (1941).\n\n==Early life==\nWright was born in [[Rome, New York]], to Alma Watson and William A. Wright. In his autobiography, ''To My Sons'', Wright reports that his father, a former Civil War lieutenant and lifetime alcoholic, dragged \"his wife and children from place to place, existing from hand to mouth, sinking deeper and deeper, as the years passed, into the slough of wretched poverty.\"\n\nHis mother, on the other hand, paid close attention to the children, taught them moral principles and read to them from the Bible, Shakespeare, ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and ''[[Hiawatha]]''. From his mother Wright learned to appreciate the beauties of nature. When a neighbor taught young Wright to draw and paint, his mother nourished his artistic talents.\n\nWhen Wright was 11, his mother died and his father abandoned the children. For the remainder of his childhood, Wright lived with various relatives or strangers, mostly in Ohio. He found odd jobs here and there, frequently sleeping under bridges or in haystacks. In his late teens he found regular employment painting both works of art and houses. After two years of what Wright called \"pre-preparation\" education at [[Hiram College]] in [[Hiram, Ohio]], Wright became a minister for the Christian Church ([[Disciples of Christ]]) in [[Pierce City, Missouri]].\n\nHe said, \"As I have told you, after that first year of my disillusionment at Hiram College, I never deliberately, with malice aforethought, set out to be a preacher. I did not seek the job with the Pierce City Church, the job found me.\" 'To My Sons', pg. 204. Other churches he pastored were located in [[Pittsburg, Kansas]]; Forest Avenue in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Lebanon, Missouri]]; and [[Redlands, California]].\n\n==Writing and preaching career==\nIn 1902, while pastoring the Christian Church in [[Pittsburg, Kansas]], he wrote a melodramatic story, entitled ''[[That Printer of Udell's]]'', which he intended to read to his congregation, one chapter per week, at successive Sunday night meetings. But before he read it to his congregation, the story was published in serial form in ''The Christian Century'', his denomination's official journal.\n\nWright despised the magazine version so much that he \"hid the poor mutilated corpse in the bottom of the least used drawer of my desk and moved on to other things\" (To My Sons, p.&nbsp;213). Yet parishioners enjoyed the story so much that they encouraged him to publish it in book form, which he did. But it was Wright's second novel, ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills (novel)|The Shepherd of the Hills]]'', published in 1907 and set in [[Branson, Missouri]], that established him as a best-selling author. That book also attracted a growing stream of tourists to the little-known town of Branson, resulting in its becoming a major tourist destination.\n\nIn 1905 Wright accepted the position of pastor at the Christian Church in Lebanon, Missouri. Wright remained there until 1907 when he accepted another pastoral position in California. In that same year, after the success of ''The Shepherd of the Hills'' (his first book to sell one million copies), Wright resigned as pastor of the Redlands, California, Christian Church, moved to a ranch near [[El Centro, California]], and devoted the rest of his life to writing popular stories. In 1911, he published his most popular book, ''The Winning of Barbara Worth'', a historical novel set in the [[Imperial Valley]] of southeastern California.\n\n==Themes and later work==\nWright was motivated to leave the ministry because he realized he could make more money writing fiction. In most of his novels, beginning with ''That Printer of Udell's'', he attacked the [[hypocrisy]] and impractical nature of popular churches. To Wright, hard work, integrity and concrete efforts to aid people in need were far more important than church doctrines or sermons.\n\nIn 1909, pastors across America were incensed by his third book, ''The Calling of Dan Matthews'', which told the story of a young preacher who, like Wright, resigned from the ministry in order to retain his integrity. The story included the town of Corinth, which was obviously that of Lebanon, Missouri. Several townspeople from Lebanon were highly disappointed in the novel and called it disgraceful. In 1910 [[Alexander Corkey]] wrote a novel that countered Wright's message.\n\nIn ''The Victory of Allen Rutledge: A Tale of the Middle West'', another young pastor in another midwestern town, faces moral challenges similar to those faced by Wright's hero. But in Corkey's book the pastor takes a courageous stand for principle, reforms the church and remains in the ministry. Though Wright's book quickly sold a million copies, Corkey's remained largely unknown.\n\nWright never responded to his critics, except to say that he never intended to create great literature, only to minister to ordinary people.\n\n==Personal life==\nHarold Bell Wright married Frances Long in 1899 and they divorced in 1920. They had three children from this marriage: Gilbert Munger Wright (b. March 17, 1901, d. April 25, 1966), Paul Williams Wright (b. 1902, d. June 3, 1928, from an undetermined illness), and Norman Hall Wright (b. January 8, 1910, d. July 21, 2001). Wright married Winifred Mary Potter Duncan on August 5, 1920 and remained married to her until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=M3zsPnPgUlUC&dat=19171215&printsec=frontpage|title=Nevada Daily Mail, Dec 15, 1917}}</ref>  He also maintained a home in [[Palm Springs, California]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Japenga|first=Ann|title=The Gospel of Barbara Worth|journal=[[Desert Magazine]]|date=February 2004|volume=3|issue=2|page=178|quote=It's not well-known that Barbara Worth's creator had a house here in Palm Springs.}}</ref>\n\n==Later life and death==\nFrom 1914 to about 1933 Wright lived mostly in [[Tucson, Arizona]].  Wright's land on Tucson's east side became the Harold Bell Wright Estates subdivision and the streets bear names of some of his fictional characters and book titles such as Printer Udell, Barbara Worth, Shepherd Hills, Brian Kent, and Marta Hillgrove.

To make comparisons possible, Mott defines a bestseller as a book with sales equal to one percent of the US population.\n\nHis ranking:\n# [[Charles Dickens]], 16 bestsellers;\n# [[Erle Stanley Gardner]], seven;\n# [[Sir Walter Scott]], six; and\n# [[James Fenimore Cooper]], [[Gene Stratton Porter]], and Harold Bell Wright, five each.\n\nScott and Dickens were not American authors, and Gardner's successes came later than Wright's. By Mott's reckoning Harold Bell Wright was one of only three American authors to write five best sellers from the arrival of the pilgrims in America through the first quarter of the 20th century. And Wright's total book sales were higher than Cooper and Porter. No American beat, or quite matched, Harold Bell Wright's record until Erle Stanley Gardner, whose career peaked 30 years after Wright's.\n\n==Literary criticism==\nWright's biographer, [[Lawrence V. Tagg]] (''Harold Bell Wright: Storyteller to America'', Westernlore Press, 1986), gathered a collection of contemporary attacks on Wright.\n\n[[Owen Wister]]\u2019s comments are representative: \u201cI doubt if the present hour furnishes any happier symbols [of the quack novel] than we have in Mr. Wright [and ''The Eyes of the World''].

It is,\u201d Wister says, \u201cstale, distorted, a sham, a puddle of words,\u201d and \u201ca mess of mildewed pap.\u201d It was also number one on the Publisher's Weekly bestseller list for 1914. In 1946, [[Irvin Harlow Hart]] wrote, \"Harold Bell Wright supplied more negative data on the literary quality of the taste of the fiction reading public than any other author.

More than 15 movies were made or claimed to be made from Wright's stories, including [[Gary Cooper]]'s first major movie, ''[[The Winning of Barbara Worth]]'' (1926)<ref name=FleetingFame/> and the [[John Wayne]] film ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills (film)|The Shepherd of the Hills]]'' (1941).\n\n==Early life==\nWright was born in [[Rome, New York]], to Alma Watson and William A. Wright. In his autobiography, ''To My Sons'', Wright reports that his father, a former Civil War lieutenant and lifetime alcoholic, dragged \"his wife and children from place to place, existing from hand to mouth, sinking deeper and deeper, as the years passed, into the slough of wretched poverty.\" \n\nHis mother, on the other hand, paid close attention to the children, taught them moral principles and read to them from the Bible, Shakespeare, ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and ''[[Hiawatha]]''. From his mother Wright learned to appreciate the beauties of nature. When a neighbor taught young Wright to draw and paint, his mother nourished his artistic talents.\n\nWhen Wright was 11, his mother died and his father abandoned the children. For the remainder of his childhood, Wright lived with various relatives or strangers, mostly in Ohio. He found odd jobs here and there, frequently sleeping under bridges or in haystacks. In his late teens he found regular employment painting both works of art and houses. After two years of what Wright called \"pre-preparation\" education at [[Hiram College]] in [[Hiram, Ohio]], Wright became a minister for the Christian Church ([[Disciples of Christ]]) in [[Pierce City, Missouri]]. \n\nHe said, \"As I have told you, after that first year of my disillusionment at Hiram College, I never deliberately, with malice aforethought, set out to be a preacher. I did not seek the job with the Pierce City Church, the job found me.\" 'To My Sons', pg. 204. Other churches he pastored were located in [[Pittsburg, Kansas]]; Forest Avenue in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Lebanon, Missouri]]; and [[Redlands, California]].\n\n==Writing and preaching career==\nIn 1902, while pastoring the Christian Church in [[Pittsburg, Kansas]], he wrote a melodramatic story, entitled ''[[That Printer of Udell's]]'', which he intended to read to his congregation, one chapter per week, at successive Sunday night meetings. But before he read it to his congregation, the story was published in serial form in ''The Christian Century'', his denomination's official journal. \n\nWright despised the magazine version so much that he \"hid the poor mutilated corpse in the bottom of the least used drawer of my desk and moved on to other things\" (To My Sons, p.&nbsp;213). Yet parishioners enjoyed the story so much that they encouraged him to publish it in book form, which he did. But it was Wright's second novel, ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills]]'', published in 1907 and set in [[Branson, Missouri]], that established him as a best-selling author. That book also attracted a growing stream of tourists to the little-known town of Branson, resulting in its becoming a major tourist destination.\n\nIn 1905 Wright accepted the position of pastor at the Christian Church in Lebanon, Missouri. Wright remained there until 1907 when he accepted another pastoral position in California. In that same year, after the success of ''The Shepherd of the Hills'' (his first book to sell one million copies), Wright resigned as pastor of the Redlands, California, Christian Church, moved to a ranch near [[El Centro, California]], and devoted the rest of his life to writing popular stories. In 1911, he published his most popular book, ''The Winning of Barbara Worth'', a historical novel set in the [[Imperial Valley]] of southeastern California.\n\n==Themes and later work==\nWright was motivated to leave the ministry because he realized he could make more money writing fiction. In most of his novels, beginning with ''That Printer of Udell's'', he attacked the [[hypocrisy]] and impractical nature of popular churches. To Wright, hard work, integrity and concrete efforts to aid people in need were far more important than church doctrines or sermons.\n\nIn 1909, pastors across America were incensed by his third book, ''The Calling of Dan Matthews'', which told the story of a young preacher who, like Wright, resigned from the ministry in order to retain his integrity. The story included the town of Corinth, which was obviously that of Lebanon, Missouri. Several townspeople from Lebanon were highly disappointed in the novel and called it disgraceful. In 1910 [[Alexander Corkey]] wrote a novel that countered Wright's message. \n\nIn ''The Victory of Allen Rutledge: A Tale of the Middle West'', another young pastor in another midwestern town, faces moral challenges similar to those faced by Wright's hero. But in Corkey's book the pastor takes a courageous stand for principle, reforms the church and remains in the ministry. Though Wright's book quickly sold a million copies, Corkey's remained largely unknown.\n\nWright never responded to his critics, except to say that he never intended to create great literature, only to minister to ordinary people.\n\n==Personal life==\nHarold Bell Wright married Frances Long in 1899 and they divorced in 1920. They had three children from this marriage: Gilbert Munger Wright (b. March 17, 1901, d. April 25, 1966), Paul Williams Wright (b. 1902, d. June 3, 1928, from an undetermined illness), and Norman Hall Wright (b. January 8, 1910, d. July 21, 2001). Wright married Winifred Mary Potter Duncan on August 5, 1920 and remained married to her until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=M3zsPnPgUlUC&dat=19171215&printsec=frontpage|title=Nevada Daily Mail, Dec 15, 1917}}</ref>  He also maintained a home in [[Palm Springs, California]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Japenga|first=Ann|title=The Gospel of Barbara Worth|journal=[[Desert Magazine]]|date=February 2004|volume=3|issue=2|page=178|quote=It's not well-known that Barbara Worth's creator had a house here in Palm Springs.}}</ref>\n\n==Later life and death==\nFrom 1914 to about 1933 Wright lived mostly in [[Tucson, Arizona]].  Wright's land on Tucson's east side became the Harold Bell Wright Estates subdivision and the streets bear names of some of his fictional characters and book titles such as Printer Udell, Barbara Worth, Shepherd Hills, Brian Kent, and Marta Hillgrove. A small city park in the neighborhood is named for him.

To make comparisons possible, Mott defines a bestseller as a book with sales equal to one percent of the US population.\n\nHis ranking:\n# [[Charles Dickens]], 16 bestsellers;\n# [[Erle Stanley Gardner]], seven;\n# [[Sir Walter Scott]], six; and\n# [[James Fenimore Cooper]], [[Gene Stratton Porter]], and Harold Bell Wright, five each.\n\nScott and Dickens were not American authors, and Gardner's successes came later than Wright's. By Mott's reckoning Harold Bell Wright was one of only three American authors to write five best sellers from the arrival of the pilgrims in America through the first quarter of the 20th century. And Wright's total book sales were higher than Cooper and Porter. No American beat, or quite matched, Harold Bell Wright's record until Erle Stanley Gardner, whose career peaked 30 years after Wright's.\n\n==Literary criticism==\nWright's biographer, [[Lawrence V. Tagg]] (''Harold Bell Wright: Storyteller to America'', Westernlore Press, 1986), gathered a collection of contemporary attacks on Wright.\n\n[[Owen Wister]]\u2019s comments are representative: \u201cI doubt if the present hour furnishes any happier symbols [of the quack novel] than we have in Mr. Wright [and ''The Eyes of the World'']. It gathers into its four hundred and sixty pages all the elements ...of the quack-novel. It is,\u201d Wister says, \u201cstale, distorted, a sham, a puddle of words,\u201d and \u201ca mess of mildewed pap.\u201d It was also number one on the Publisher's Weekly bestseller list for 1914. In 1946, [[Irvin Harlow Hart]] wrote, \"Harold Bell Wright supplied more negative data on the literary quality of the taste of the fiction reading public than any other author. No critic has ever damned Wright with even the faintest praise.\" (Hundred Leading Authors, p.&nbsp;287)\n\n''[[Wonder Stories]]'' panned Wright's only [[science fiction]] novel, ''The Devil's Highway'', in 1932, saying \"If not for the mawkish sentimentality, and endless moralizing of this book, it might have been an interesting piece of work\".<ref>\"Book Review\", ''Wonder Stories'', July 1932, pp.190-191</ref>  ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', however, found the novel \"a very creditable attempt at combining two almost incompatible conceptions: The psychic and the physical\" and concluded that ''The Devil's Highway'' \"is quite enjoyable, as it is logical and exceedingly well written\".<ref>\"In the Realm of Books\", June 1932, ''Amazing Stories'', p.280</ref>\n\n==Published works==\n* ''[[That Printer of Udell's]]'' Book Supply Company, 1902\u201303\n* ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills]]'' Book Supply Company, 1907, illustrated by Frank G.

An agreement was reached between December 1979 and January 1980, with production scheduled for the Termini Imerese Autobianchi di Desio plants.<ref name=\"tribe1\"/>\n\nOn February 26, 1980, Fiat presented the Panda to President [[Sandro Pertini]], in the gardens of Rome's [[Quirinal Palace]], and the car officially debuted in Geneva on March 5th \u2014 carrying the ''Panda'' name. \n\nIn the two months following the Geneva motor show, Fiat received over 70,000 orders for the Panda.\n\n===Design===\nItaldesign's work highlighted utilitarian practicality throughout the design. Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Seat covers, door trim could be removed and washed. Likewise, the dashboard used a padded, washable fabric supported by a simple tube, creating a long, flexible storage pocket. \n\nLuigi Maglione, Fiat's marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock-up was missing. Fiat's new CEO, Nicola Tufarelli clarified that the rustic interiors were in fact the final design, ready for launch.<ref name=\"stampa01\">{{cite web\n |title        = Forty years of Panda: the secret stories of the Fiat city car\n |publisher    = La Stampa\n |author       =\n |date         = October 12, 2019\n |url          = https://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastampa.it%2Fmotori%2Fattualita%2F2020%2F02%2F25%2Fnews%2Fl-alfa-romeo-torna-a-pomigliano-d-arco-produrra-la-tonale-dal-2021-1.38516408}}</ref>\n\nWith an overall aerodynamic coefficient, despite the blocky shape, better than the [[Fiat 127]]'s,<ref name=\"stampa01\"/> the first Pandas featured a recess in the adjacent bodywork rather than door handles;<ref name=\"tribe1\"/> and completely flat glass in all windows \u2014 weighing less and making them inexpensive to manufacture, as well as easy to replace and interchangeable left to right.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Likewise, the dashboard used a padded, washable fabric supported by a simple tube, creating a long, flexible storage pocket. \n\nLuigi Maglione, Fiat's marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock-up was missing.

A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!
