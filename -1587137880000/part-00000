They are rowed over four evenings at the end of term in July. There are usually three boats entered per house. On the fourth evening there are prizes for the leaders of the chart and the Leadbitter Cup for the boat which has made the most bumps over the four nights. The event is marshalled by senior rowers and rowing prefects, usually masters. The crew training is mainly pupil driven, though in preparation for [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]] the school's First VIII rowers often do not take part, and therefore the boats are composed of other rowers and some non-rowers. Previously, races were run every day until there were no more bumps (i.e. until they were nominally in speed order). This historical set-up could lead to weeks of racing and it was therefore abandoned in favour of a four-day version more than 100 years ago. Otherwise, it is only [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] that continue to have bumps. Shrewsbury and Eton both race bumps in fours whilst Oxford and Cambridge race in eights.\n\n=== Running ===\nThe Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt (RSSH or \"the Hunt\") is the oldest cross-country club in the world, with written records (the Hound Books) going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Roger|date=December 1998|title=On the Scent of History|journal=Running Times|page=28}}</ref> The sport of \"the Hunt\" or \"the Hounds\", now known as a [[Paper Chase (game)|Paper Chase]], was formalised at the school around 1800. Two runners (the \"foxes\") made a trail with paper shreds and after a set time they would be pursued by the other runners (the \"hounds\"). The club officers are the Huntsman and Senior and Junior Whips.

They are rowed over four evenings at the end of term in July. There are usually three boats entered per house. On the fourth evening there are prizes for the leaders of the chart and the Leadbitter Cup for the boat which has made the most bumps over the four nights. The event is marshalled by senior rowers and rowing prefects, usually masters. The crew training is mainly pupil driven, though in preparation for [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]] the school's First VIII rowers often do not take part, and therefore the boats are composed of other rowers and some non-rowers. Previously, races were run every day until there were no more bumps (i.e. until they were nominally in speed order). This historical set-up could lead to weeks of racing and it was therefore abandoned in favour of a four-day version more than 100 years ago. Otherwise, it is only [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] that continue to have bumps. Shrewsbury and Eton both race bumps in fours whilst Oxford and Cambridge race in eights.\n\n=== Running ===\nThe Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt (RSSH or \"the Hunt\") is the oldest cross-country club in the world, with written records (the Hound Books) going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Roger|date=December 1998|title=On the Scent of History|journal=Running Times|page=28}}</ref> The sport of \"the Hunt\" or \"the Hounds\", now known as a [[Paper Chase (game)|Paper Chase]], was formalised at the school around 1800. Two runners (the \"foxes\") made a trail with paper shreds and after a set time they would be pursued by the other runners (the \"hounds\"). The club officers are the Huntsman and Senior and Junior Whips.

The Fire responded by using its attacking forces to find an equalizer, but failed to break the Wizards defense and goalkeeper [[Tony Meola]], who made ten saves in the final.

Previously this action was permitted as long as the leaper or hurdler did not land on other players.\n* Include in the definition of a \"defenseless player\" receivers tracking the quarterback or looking back for the ball, including inside the legal contact (5 yards from the line of scrimmage) zone.\n* Egregious hits to the head (similar to the \"targeting\" rule in NCAA football) will cause the player to risk immediate disqualification.\n* The replay control center will make the final ruling on reviewed plays instead of the game referee, although the referee can still provide input on reviewable plays.\n* The sideline replay monitor (the \"hood\") will be eliminated and replaced with a tablet on the field for the referee to review with the replay control center.\n* [[Crackback]] blocks are now prohibited by a backfield player in motion, even if he is not more than two yards outside the [[tackle box (American football)|tackle box]] when the ball is snapped.\n* Make permanent the rule that players who commit two certain types of unsportsmanlike conduct penalties (throwing punches/forearms/kicking, even if they do not connect, directing abusive, threatening, or insulting language toward opponents, teammates, game officials or league officials, and using baiting or taunting acts or words that may engender ill will between teams) in the same game risk automatic disqualification.\n* Extend for a second season the change in the touchback spot after a kickoff or safety free kick to the 25-yard line.\n* Make illegal actions that would conserve time penalized by the option for a 10-second runoff inside of the two-minute warning of each half or overtime (previously this only applied in the final minute of each half or overtime).\n* If a team commits multiple fouls on the same down with the intent of manipulating the game clock, the team will be penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct and the game clock will be reset.

One particular scenario the league sought to eliminate is the \"double-up,\" in which a network cuts to a commercial after a scoring play, then airs the kickoff, and again goes to commercial before play from scrimmage resumes. Under the proposal, the league will allow networks to cut to commercial during [[instant replay]] reviews, which it had not been allowed to do before. Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the changes are being made in an attempt to consolidate downtime between the actual game play so that there are fewer and less noticeable interruptions; he does not expect the changes to have an appreciable impact on the real-time length of a game, which currently clocks in at slightly over three hours.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/03/22/roger-goodell-plans-to-speed-up-pace-nfl-games-2017/99491048/#|title=Exclusive: Roger Goodell says changes coming to quicken NFL games in 2017|work=USA Today|first=Tom|last=Pelissero|date=March 24, 2017|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe NFL has also, as a trial, lifted its ban on the broadcast of commercials for [[distilled spirits]] during its telecasts.

Previously this action was permitted as long as the leaper or hurdler did not land on other players.\n* Include in the definition of a \"defenseless player\" receivers tracking the quarterback or looking back for the ball, including inside the legal contact (5 yards from the line of scrimmage) zone.\n* Egregious hits to the head (similar to the \"targeting\" rule in NCAA football) will cause the player to risk immediate disqualification.\n* The replay control center will make the final ruling on reviewed plays instead of the game referee, although the referee can still provide input on reviewable plays.\n* The sideline replay monitor (the \"hood\") will be eliminated and replaced with a tablet on the field for the referee to review with the replay control center.\n* [[Crackback]] blocks are now prohibited by a backfield player in motion, even if he is not more than two yards outside the [[tackle box (American football)|tackle box]] when the ball is snapped.\n* Make permanent the rule that players who commit two certain types of unsportsmanlike conduct penalties (throwing punches/forearms/kicking, even if they do not connect, directing abusive, threatening, or insulting language toward opponents, teammates, game officials or league officials, and using baiting or taunting acts or words that may engender ill will between teams) in the same game risk automatic disqualification.\n* Extend for a second season the change in the touchback spot after a kickoff or safety free kick to the 25-yard line.\n* Make illegal actions that would conserve time penalized by the option for a 10-second runoff inside of the two-minute warning of each half or overtime (previously this only applied in the final minute of each half or overtime).\n* If a team commits multiple fouls on the same down with the intent of manipulating the game clock, the team will be penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct and the game clock will be reset. This change was made in response to both the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Baltimore Ravens]] employing this strategy by intentionally holding the defensive players to allow the game clock to run down or run out (in the case of the Ravens' game vs. the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]) during the previous season. A team may NOT be disqualified if it is their second unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against them.\n* In response to the move of [[Sarah Thomas (American football official)|Sarah Thomas]] from line judge to head linesman for the 2017 season, the NFL renamed the officiating position of the head linesman to \"down judge\".\n\nThe following rule changes were approved for the 2017 NFL season at the NFL Spring League meeting on May 23, 2017:<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Jeanna|title=NFL voted on rule changes for the 2017 season, and we graded each one|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/5/23/15681012/nfl-rule-changes-2017-grades-touchdown-celebrations-shorter-overtime|website=SBNation.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|date=May 23, 2017}}</ref>\n* Overtime has been shortened from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for preseason and regular season games.

One particular scenario the league sought to eliminate is the \"double-up,\" in which a network cuts to a commercial after a scoring play, then airs the kickoff, and again goes to commercial before play from scrimmage resumes. Under the proposal, the league will allow networks to cut to commercial during [[instant replay]] reviews, which it had not been allowed to do before. Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the changes are being made in an attempt to consolidate downtime between the actual game play so that there are fewer and less noticeable interruptions; he does not expect the changes to have an appreciable impact on the real-time length of a game, which currently clocks in at slightly over three hours.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/03/22/roger-goodell-plans-to-speed-up-pace-nfl-games-2017/99491048/#|title=Exclusive: Roger Goodell says changes coming to quicken NFL games in 2017|work=USA Today|first=Tom|last=Pelissero|date=March 24, 2017|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe NFL has also, as a trial, lifted its ban on the broadcast of commercials for [[distilled spirits]] during its telecasts. However, they are subject to restrictions; a maximum of four liquor ads may be broadcast per-game, along with two per-pregame and postgame show. These ads may not contain football-related themes or target underage viewers, and must contain a \"prominent social responsibility message\".<ref name=\"br-liqour\">{{cite web|title=NFL to Allow Liquor Advertising During Games Next Season|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2713387-nfl-to-allow-liquor-advertising-during-games-next-season|website=Bleacher Report|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"wsj-liquorads\">{{cite web|title=NFL Adds Liquor to Menu of Advertisers|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfl-adds-liquor-to-menu-of-advertisers-1496441710|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n===Personnel changes===\n[[Tony Romo]], who announced his retirement as a player on April 4, 2017, joined CBS, where he replaced [[Phil Simms]] as lead color commentator.
