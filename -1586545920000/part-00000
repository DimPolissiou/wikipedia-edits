She was directed by husband [[John Derek]] in ''[[Fantasies (film)|Fantasies]]'', ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (both 1981), ''[[Bolero (1984 film)|Bolero]]'' (1984) and ''[[Ghosts Can't Do It]]'' (1989), all of which received negative reviews. A widow since 1998, she lives with actor [[John Corbett]]. Now in semi-retirement, she makes occasional film, television, and documentary appearances.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nDerek was born Mary Cathleen Collins in [[Long Beach, California]]. Her father, Paul Collins, was a [[Hobie Cat]] executive, and her mother, Norma (n\u00e9e White), was a make-up artist and hairdresser to [[Ann-Margret]]. Collins' parents divorced, and her mother married American [[stunt performer]] [[Bobby Bass]].\n\nCollins attended [[Narbonne High School]] and George S. Patton Continuation School, both in [[Harbor City, California]]. She remarked in a 1985 interview on ''Late Night with David Letterman'':\n\n{{quote|quote=I was 16 when I quit high school. I didn't really mean to quit. I spent about a month going to the beach surfing and sunbathing while I was supposed to be in school: when I got caught, my mom was furious.

Not long after the two started dating, Derek divorced his wife, actress [[Linda Evans]]. The couple moved to Germany, where John Derek would not be subject to prosecution under California [[statutory rape]] laws because Collins was under the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]].\n\nIn 1973 John Derek began production on a film entitled ''[[Fantasies (film)|Fantasies]]'', a low-budget, English-language romantic drama starring Collins and several unknown German actors. The film was shot over a 10-day period in Greece. In an effort to capitalize on Collins' beauty, Derek worked into the film several risqu\u00e9 scenes, including brief nudity. John Derek twice re-edited the film in an effort to sell it to major studios. The film remained unreleased until 1981, at which time it received negative notices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Young Bo Derek In 'Fantasies'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/07/movies/young-bo-derek-in-fantasies.html?mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-11-07|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nCollins and John Derek married on June 10, 1976; she was 19 and he 49.

Derek's appearance in a dream sequence, racing towards Moore in a flimsy flesh-colored swimsuit, launched her status as a mainstream sex symbol. This sequence and Derek\u2019s cornrow hairstyle in the film have often been parodied. ''10'' was a critical and financial success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 1979 Movies at the Domestic Box Office|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-1979|publisher=Nash Information Services LLC|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''10,'' Derek was cast in ''[[A Change of Seasons (film)|A Change of Seasons]]'' (1980), a dramatic-comedy film that featured [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. Derek played a college student who has an affair with her older, married professor. ''A Change of Seasons'' was only a moderate box-office success, with critics reviewing it and Derek's performance unfavorably (\"The only appealing performance is Miss MacLaine's\").<ref>{{cite web|title='Change of Seasons,' Bo Derek vs. Miss MacLaine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03EED71638F93AA25751C1A966948260&mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1980-12-19|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980 Derek photographed Bo twice for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine; she was featured again in the magazine in 1981, 1984, and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 50 Hottest Celebrities Who've Posed For Playboy|url=http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/02/the-50-hottest-celebrities-whove-posed-for-playboy/|publisher=Complex Media Inc.|date=2013-02-23|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nDerek appeared in [[MGM|MGM's]] [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1981), her first leading role in a mainstream Hollywood film. Directed by her husband, the film dealt little with [[Tarzan]] and instead focused on Derek's character of [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Parker]], and specifically on Derek's physical attributes. Several scenes of Derek wearing revealing outfits were featured, along with nude scenes of Derek being bathed and body-painted. Prior to the film's release MGM and the film's distributor, [[United Artists]], were sued by the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] estate over the name of the film, as Derek's role and body overshadowed the story of Tarzan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bo Derek Takes To The Jungle To Bring 'Tarzan' Back Alive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/movies/bo-derek-takes-to-the-jungle-to-bring-tarzan-back-alive.html?pagewanted=all&mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-07-19|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> Although the film received negative reviews from many critics, ''Tarzan, the Ape Man'' became a box-office success, making over $35 million in ticket sales and becoming the [[1981 in film|15th highest-grossing film of 1981]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&p=.htm|title=1981 Yearly Box Office Results \u2013 Box Office Mojo|author=|date=|work=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> For her performance, Derek shared the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]] with [[Faye Dunaway]], the latter for her starring role as [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]''.\n\nDerek starred in ''[[Bolero (1984 film)|Bolero]]'' (1984). Again directed by John Derek, the film explored the female protagonist's sexual awakening, and her journey around the world to find an ideal first lover to take her virginity. Its sexual nature, along with its substantial use of nudity, resulted in the film receiving an [[X rating]], usually reserved for [[pornographic]] or extremely violent horror films. Critical reviews for ''Bolero'', including Derek's performance, were negative (\"[Bo Derek] would be a lot more appealing if she tried less assiduously to please\"),<ref>{{cite web|title=Film: Bo Derek in 'Bolero'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/01/movies/film-bo-derek-in-bolero.html?mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1984-09-01|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> and the film failed to recoup its production costs.<ref>{{cite web|title=1984 Yearly Box Office Results|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1984|publisher=IMDb.com Inc.|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> For her performance in ''Bolero'' Derek won her second [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]].

The final collaboration of Derek with her husband as director, ''Ghosts Can't Do It'' was a failure both critically (a \"cinematic abomination\")<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghosts Can't Do It|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/ghosts-cant-do-it-v19688|publisher=Allmovie|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> and financially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Movie Sucks|url=http://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/your-movie-sucks/|publisher=ultimatemovierankings.com|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> For her performance in ''Ghosts Can't Do It'', during which she delivered such lines as \"You have my heart...how can I live without my heart,\" Derek won her third [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]].

She was directed by husband [[John Derek]] in ''[[Fantasies (film)|Fantasies]]'', ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (both 1981), ''[[Bolero (1984 film)|Bolero]]'' (1984) and ''[[Ghosts Can't Do It]]'' (1989), all of which received negative reviews. A widow since 1998, she lives with actor [[John Corbett]]. Now in semi-retirement, she makes occasional film, television, and documentary appearances.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nDerek was born Mary Cathleen Collins in [[Long Beach, California]]. Her father, Paul Collins, was a [[Hobie Cat]] executive, and her mother, Norma (n\u00e9e White), was a make-up artist and hairdresser to [[Ann-Margret]]. Collins' parents divorced, and her mother married American [[stunt performer]] [[Bobby Bass]].\n\nCollins attended [[Narbonne High School]] and George S. Patton Continuation School, both in [[Harbor City, California]]. She remarked in a 1985 interview on ''Late Night with David Letterman'':\n\n{{quote|quote=I was 16 when I quit high school. I didn't really mean to quit. I spent about a month going to the beach surfing and sunbathing while I was supposed to be in school: when I got caught, my mom was furious.

Not long after the two started dating, Derek divorced his wife, actress [[Linda Evans]]. The couple moved to Germany, where John Derek would not be subject to prosecution under California [[statutory rape]] laws because Collins was under the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]].\n\nIn 1973 John Derek began production on a film entitled ''[[Fantasies (film)|Fantasies]]'', a low-budget, English-language romantic drama starring Collins and several unknown German actors. The film was shot over a 10-day period in Greece. In an effort to capitalize on Collins' beauty, Derek worked into the film several risqu\u00e9 scenes, including brief nudity. John Derek twice re-edited the film in an effort to sell it to major studios. The film remained unreleased until 1981, at which time it received negative notices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Young Bo Derek In 'Fantasies'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/07/movies/young-bo-derek-in-fantasies.html?mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-11-07|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nCollins and John Derek married on June 10, 1976; she was 19 and he 49.

Derek's appearance in a dream sequence, racing towards Moore in a flimsy flesh-colored swimsuit, launched her status as a mainstream sex symbol. This sequence and Derek\u2019s cornrow hairstyle in the film have often been parodied. ''10'' was a critical and financial success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 1979 Movies at the Domestic Box Office|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-1979|publisher=Nash Information Services LLC|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''10,'' Derek was cast in ''[[A Change of Seasons (film)|A Change of Seasons]]'' (1980), a dramatic-comedy film that featured [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. Derek played a college student who has an affair with her older, married professor. ''A Change of Seasons'' was only a moderate box-office success, with critics reviewing it and Derek's performance unfavorably (\"The only appealing performance is Miss MacLaine's\").<ref>{{cite web|title='Change of Seasons,' Bo Derek vs. Miss MacLaine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03EED71638F93AA25751C1A966948260&mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1980-12-19|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980 Derek photographed Bo twice for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine; she was featured again in the magazine in 1981, 1984, and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 50 Hottest Celebrities Who've Posed For Playboy|url=http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/02/the-50-hottest-celebrities-whove-posed-for-playboy/|publisher=Complex Media Inc.|date=2013-02-23|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nDerek appeared in [[MGM|MGM's]] [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] ''[[Tarzan, the Ape Man (1981 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1981), her first leading role in a mainstream Hollywood film. Directed by her husband, the film dealt little with [[Tarzan]] and instead focused on Derek's character of [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Parker]], and specifically on Derek's physical attributes. Several scenes of Derek wearing revealing outfits were featured, along with nude scenes of Derek being bathed and body-painted. Prior to the film's release MGM and the film's distributor, [[United Artists]], were sued by the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] estate over the name of the film, as Derek's role and body overshadowed the story of Tarzan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bo Derek Takes To The Jungle To Bring 'Tarzan' Back Alive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/movies/bo-derek-takes-to-the-jungle-to-bring-tarzan-back-alive.html?pagewanted=all&mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-07-19|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> Although the film received negative reviews from many critics, ''Tarzan, the Ape Man'' became a box-office success, making over $35 million in ticket sales and becoming the [[1981 in film|15th highest-grossing film of 1981]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&p=.htm|title=1981 Yearly Box Office Results \u2013 Box Office Mojo|author=|date=|work=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> For her performance, Derek shared the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]] with [[Faye Dunaway]], the latter for her starring role as [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]''.\n\nDerek starred in ''[[Bolero (1984 film)|Bolero]]'' (1984). Again directed by John Derek, the film explored the female protagonist's sexual awakening, and her journey around the world to find an ideal first lover to take her virginity. Its sexual nature, along with its substantial use of nudity, resulted in the film receiving an [[X rating]], usually reserved for [[pornographic]] or extremely violent horror films. Critical reviews for ''Bolero'', including Derek's performance, were negative (\"[Bo Derek] would be a lot more appealing if she tried less assiduously to please\"),<ref>{{cite web|title=Film: Bo Derek in 'Bolero'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/01/movies/film-bo-derek-in-bolero.html?mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1984-09-01|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> and the film failed to recoup its production costs.<ref>{{cite web|title=1984 Yearly Box Office Results|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1984|publisher=IMDb.com Inc.|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> For her performance in ''Bolero'' Derek won her second [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]].

The final collaboration of Derek with her husband as director, ''Ghosts Can't Do It'' was a failure both critically (a \"cinematic abomination\")<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghosts Can't Do It|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/ghosts-cant-do-it-v19688|publisher=Allmovie|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> and financially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Movie Sucks|url=http://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/your-movie-sucks/|publisher=ultimatemovierankings.com|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> For her performance in ''Ghosts Can't Do It'', during which she delivered such lines as \"You have my heart...how can I live without my heart,\" Derek won her third [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]].

In 1995 Derek appeared in the comedy film ''[[Tommy Boy]]''. For that performance Derek was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress]] but ultimately lost to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the latter's performance in ''[[Four Rooms]]''.\n\nIn 1998 Derek guest-starred on four episodes of ''[[Wind on Water]].'' In 1999 she appeared on ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', and in the early 2000s she had guest roles on the shows ''[[Family Law (TV series)|Family Law]]'', ''[[Queen of Swords (TV series)|Queen of Swords]]'', ''[[Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place]],'' ''[[Lucky (TV series)|Lucky]]'', ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]'', and ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''.\n\nAt the [[20th Golden Raspberry Awards]] in 2000, Derek was nominated for Worst Actress of the Century, sharing the nomination with Madonna (the eventual winner), [[Brooke Shields]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]], and [[Pia Zadora]].\n\nDerek appeared in several more feature films during the 2000s, including ''[[Frozen with Fear]]'' (2000), ''[[The Master of Disguise]]'' (2002), for which she received her second [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress]] nomination, and ''[[Malibu's Most Wanted]]'' (2003). In 2006 Derek starred in 40 episodes of the 65-episode [[telenovela]] series ''[[Fashion House]]''.

The [[Reconquista]] against [[Al Andalus]] (ending in 1492), the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (1478) and the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|expulsion of Jews]] (1492) were highly relevant in the union of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] under the ''[[Catholic Monarchs]]'' [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando]] (1492), followed by the persecution and eventual [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] in 1609. The [[Counter-Reformation]] (1563\u20131648) was especially strong in Spain and the Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, thus keeping Islam, Judaism, Protestantism and [[Enlightenment in Spain|parts of the Enlightenment]] at bay for most of its history.\n\n=== Antiquity and late Antiquity ===\n{{VT|History of Early Christianity|History of the Catholic Church|Constantine the Great and Christianity|Visigothic Kingdom|Councils of Toledo}}\n[[Image:Le Temple de Diane vue lat\u00e9rale et frontale.JPG|thumb|left|The rebuilt [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] temple of Diana in [[Emerita Augusta|M\u00e9rida]]]]\nBefore Christianity, there were multiple beliefs in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] including local [[Iberians|Iberian]], [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] religions, as well as the [[Hellenistic religion|Greco]]-[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].\n \nAccording to [[Historia Compostelana|a medieval legend]], the [[James, son of Zebedee|apostle James]] was the first to spread Christianity in the [[Hispania|Roman Iberian Peninsula]]. There is no factual evidence of this{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} but he later became the [[patron saint]] of Spaniards and Portuguese, originating the [[Camino de Santiago|Way of St James]]. According to [[Romans 15]], [[Paul the Apostle]] also intended to visit Hispania; tradition has that he did and founded the [[:es:Di\u00f3cesis de \u00c9cija|Diocese of \u00c9cija]], but there is no evidence of this either.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Other later myths include the [[Seven Apostolic Men]].\n\nThere is some archaeological evidence of Christianity slowly penetrating the Peninsula from Rome and [[Mauretania|Roman Mauretania]] via major cities and ports, especially [[Tarraco|Tarragona]], since the early [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]]. The [[:ca:Necr\u00f2polis paleocristiana de Tarragona|Paleo-Christian Necropolis of Tarragona]], with 2,050 discovered tombs, dates back to the second half of the 3rd century. Saints like [[Eulalia of M\u00e9rida]] or [[Eulalia of Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[:Category:Saints from Hispania|many others]] are believed to have been martyred during the [[Decian persecution|Decian]] or [[Diocletianic Persecution]]s ([[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd]]\u2013early [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th]] centuries). [[Bishop]]s like [[:es:Bas\u00edlides de Astorga|Bas\u00edlides of Astorga]], [[:es:Marcial de M\u00e9rida|Marcial of M\u00e9rida]] or the influential [[Hosius of Corduba]] were active in the same period.\n\n[[Theodosius I]] issued decrees that effectively made [[Nicene Christianity]] the official [[state church of the Roman Empire]].,<ref>''Cf. decree, infra''.</ref><ref name=\"EdictOfThessolonica\">\"Edict of Thessalonica\": See Codex Theodosianus XVI.1.2</ref> This Christianity was already an early form of Catholicism.\n[[Image:SanPedroNave1.jpg|thumb|The 7th-century Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]]]]\nAs [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] declined, [[Migration Period|Germanic tribes invaded]] most of the lands of the former empire.

The [[Visigoths#Visigothic kingdom in Hispania|Visigothic Kingdom]] established its capital in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]; it reached its high point during the reign of [[Leovigild]] (568-586). Visigothic rule led to a brief expansion of [[Arianism]] in Spain, however the native population remained staunchly Catholic.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 587 [[Reccared]], the Visigothic king at Toledo, converted to Catholicism  and launched a movement to unify doctrine. The Council of Lerida in 546 constrained the clergy and extended the power of law over them under the blessings of Rome. The multiple [[Councils of Toledo]] definitively established what would be later known as the Catholic Church in Spain and contributed to define Catholicism elsewhere.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{VT|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Reconquista}}\nBy the early 8th century, the Visigothic kingdom had fragmented and the fragments were in disarray, bankrupt and willing to accept external help to fight each other. In 711 an [[Arab]] raiding party led by [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], then defeated the Visigothic king [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Tariq's commander, [[Musa bin Nusair]], then landed with substantial reinforcements. Taking advantage of the Visigoths' infighting, by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula, establishing Islamic rule until 1492. \n[[Image:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]] turned church after the [[Reconquista]].]]\nDuring this period the number of Muslims increased greatly through the migration of Arabs and Berbers, and the conversion of local Christians to Islam (known as [[Muladi]]s or Muwalladun) with the latter forming the majority of the Islamic-ruled area by the end of the 10th century. Most Christians who remained adopted Arabic culture, and these Arabized Christians became known as [[Mozarabs]]. While under the status of ''[[dhimmi]]s'' the Christian and Jewish subjects had to pay higher taxes than Muslims and could not hold positions of power over Muslims.\n\nThe era of Muslim rule before 1055 is often considered a \"Golden Age\" for the Jews as Jewish intellectual and spiritual life flourished in Spain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sephardim|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|author=Rebecca Weiner|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html}}</ref> Only in the northern fringes of the peninsula did Christians remain under Christian rule.

Christianity and the Catholic Church helped shape the re-establishment of European rule over Iberia.\n[[File:01 Antequera, Andalusia, Spain.jpg|thumb|[[:es:Real Colegiata de Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor|Royal Collegiate Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor]] in [[Antequera]], [[Andalusia]]]]\nAfter centuries of the [[Reconquista]], in which Christian Spaniards fought to drive out the [[Moors|Muslims]], King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] established the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1478, a religious purge of Muslim and Jewish thought and practice, from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]], the last Muslim redoubt, was eventually reconquered on January 2, 1492, 781 years after Tariq's first landing.\n\n=== Modern period ===\nIn the Early Modern Period, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity. Spain carried Catholicism to the New World and to the Philippines, but the Spanish kings insisted on independence from papal \"interference\"\u2014bishops in the Spanish domains were forbidden to report to the Pope except through the Spanish crown. In the 18th century, Spanish rulers drew further from the papacy, banishing the [[Jesuits]] from their empire in 1767. The Spanish authorities abolished the Inquisition in the 1830s, but even after that, [[religious freedom]] was denied in practice, if not in theory.\n\n=== Concordat of 1851 ===\nCatholicism became the state religion in 1851, when the Spanish government signed a [[Concordat]] with the [[Holy See]] that committed [[Madrid]] to pay the salaries of the clergy and to subsidize other expenses of the Roman Catholic Church as a compensation for the seizure of church property in the ''[[Desamortizaci\u00f3n de Mendiz\u00e1bal]]'' of 1835-1837. This pact was renounced in 1931, when the secular constitution of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] imposed a series of anticlerical measures that threatened the Church's hegemony in Spain, provoking the Church's support for the [[Francisco Franco]] uprising five years later.<ref name=\"LOCprof2\">Text used in this cited section originally came from: [http://rs6.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html Spain Country Study] from the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.\n</ref> In the ensuing [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], alleged communists and anarchists in Republican areas killed about [[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|7,000 priests]], the majority murdered between July and December 1936.

During the Franco years, Roman Catholicism was the only religion to have legal status; other worship services could not be advertised, and no other religion could own property or publish books. The Government not only continued to pay priests' salaries and to subsidize the Church, it also assisted in the reconstruction of church buildings damaged by the war. Laws were passed abolishing divorce and civil marriages as well as banning abortion and the sale of contraceptives. Homosexuality and all other forms of sexual permissiveness were also banned.  Catholic religious instruction was mandatory, even in public schools. Franco secured in return the right to name Roman Catholic bishops in Spain, as well as veto power over appointments of clergy down to the parish priest level.\n\nIn 1953 this close cooperation was formalized in a [[Concordat of 1953|new Concordat]] with the Vatican that granted the church an extraordinary set of privileges: mandatory canonical marriages for all Catholics; exemption from government taxation; subsidies for new building construction; censorship of materials the Church deemed offensive; the right to establish universities, to operate radio stations, and to publish newspapers and magazines; protection from police intrusion into church properties; and exemption of military service.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nThe proclamation of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in favor of religious freedom in 1965 provided more rights to other religious denominations in Spain. In the late 1960s, the Vatican attempted to reform the Church in Spain by appointing interim, or acting, bishops, thereby circumventing Franco's stranglehold on the country's clergy. Many young priests, under foreign influence, became [[worker priest]]s and participated in anti-regime agitation. Many of them ended as leftist politicians, with some imprisoned in the [[Concordat prison]] reserved for priest prisoners. In 1966, the Franco regime passed a law that freed other religions from many of the earlier restrictions, but the law also reaffirmed the privileges of the Catholic Church. Any attempt to revise the 1953 Concordat met Franco's rigid resistance.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\n===Separation of church and state since 1978===\n[[Image:Vicente Enrique y Taranc\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal [[Vicente Enrique y Taranc\u00f3n]] adopted a democratic stance and was decisive in separating church from state in Spain.<ref name=tarancon1>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/11/20/sociedad/1195513202_850215.html|title=El cardenal Taranc\u00f3n lo intent\u00f3 en 1971 |publisher= [[El Pa\u00eds]] |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2018-04-08| quote=Sin Taranc\u00f3n y su grupo de colaboradores, apoyados en todo momento por el papa Pablo VI, la transici\u00f3n desde el nacionalcatolicismo hacia la democracia hubiera sido imposible. | language=Spanish}}</ref> As a result, he received continuous death threats from hardline Francoists, including far-right Catholics, until democracy was well established; \"\u00a1Taranc\u00f3n al pared\u00f3n!\" ''(Taranc\u00f3n to the execution wall!)'' was a common slogan.<ref name=tarancon2>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2012/01/22/domingo/1327207955_850215.html|title=La rabia de Taranc\u00f3n |publisher= [[El Pa\u00eds]] |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2018-04-08| language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=tarancon3>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/09/13/sociedad/1189634413_850215.html|title=El cardenal que hizo llorar a Franco |publisher= [[El Pa\u00eds]] |date=2012-01-22 |accessdate=2018-04-08| language=Spanish}}</ref>]]\nIn 1976, however, King [[Juan Carlos de Borbon]] unilaterally renounced the right to name the bishops; later that year, Madrid and the Vatican signed a new accord that restored to the church its right to name bishops, and the Church agreed to a revised Concordat that entailed a gradual financial [[separation of church and state]]. Church property not used for religious purposes was henceforth to be subject to taxation, and over a period of years the Church's reliance on state subsidies was to be gradually reduced. The timetable for this reduction was not adhered to, however, and the church continued to receive the public subsidy through 1987 (US$110 million in that year alone).<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIt took the new [[1978 Spanish Constitution]] to confirm the right of Spaniards to religious freedom and to begin the process of disestablishing Catholicism as the state religion. The drafters of the Constitution tried to deal with the intense controversy surrounding state support of the Church, but they were not entirely successful. The initial draft of the Constitution did not even mention the Church, which was included almost as an afterthought and only after intense pressure from the church's leadership. Article 16 disestablishes Roman Catholicism as the official religion and provides that religious liberty for non-Catholics is a state-protected legal right, thereby replacing the policy of limited toleration of non-Catholic religious practices. The article further states, however, that: \"The public authorities shall take the religious beliefs of Spanish society into account and shall maintain the consequent relations of cooperation with the Catholic Church and the other confessions.\" In addition, Article 27 also aroused controversy by appearing to pledge continuing government subsidies for private, Church-affiliated schools. These schools were sharply criticized by Spanish Socialists for having created and perpetuated a class-based, separate, and unequal school system. The Constitution, however, includes no affirmation that the majority of Spaniards are Catholics or that the state should take into account the teachings of Catholicism.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> The Constitution declares Spain a \"non-confessional\" state, however it is not a ''[[la\u00efque]]'' (secular) state like [[Catholic Church in France|France]] or [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Mexico]].\n\nGovernment financial aid to the Catholic Church was a difficult and contentious issue. The Church argued that, in return for the subsidy, the state had received the social, health, and educational services of tens of thousands of priests and nuns who fulfilled vital functions that the state itself could not have performed at that time. Nevertheless, the revised Concordat was supposed to replace direct state aid to the church with a scheme that would allow taxpayers to designate a certain portion of their taxes to be diverted directly to the Church. Through 1985, taxpayers were allowed to deduct up to 10 percent from their taxable income for donations to the Catholic Church. Partly because of the protests against this arrangement from representatives of Spain's other religious groups and even from some Catholics, the tax laws were changed in 2007 so that taxpayers could choose between giving 0.52 percent of their income tax to the church and allocating it to the government's welfare and culture budgets. For three years, the government would continue to give the Church a gradually reduced subsidy, but after that the church would have to subsist on its own resources. The government would continue, however, its program of subsidizing Catholic schools, which in 1987 cost the Spanish taxpayers about US$300 million exclusive of the salaries of teachers, which were paid directly by the Ministry of Education and Science.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIn a population of about 39 million at the beginning of [[Spanish transition to democracy|Transition]] (begun in November 1975), the number of non-Catholics was probably no more than 300,000. About 290,000 of these were of other Christian faiths, including several Protestant denominations, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Spain|Mormons]]. The number of Jews in Spain was estimated at about 13,000 in the\n[[Murcia Jewish community]]. More than 19 out of every 20 Spaniards were baptized Catholics; about 60 percent of them attended Mass; about 30 percent of the baptized Catholics did so regularly, although this figure declined to about 20 percent in the larger cities. In 1979, about 97 percent of all marriages were performed according to the Catholic rite. A 1982 report by the church claimed that 82 percent of all children born the preceding year had been baptized in the church.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nNevertheless, there were forces at work bringing about fundamental changes in the place of the church in society. One such force was the improvement in the economic fortunes of the great majority of Spaniards, making society more [[materialistic]] and less religious. Another force was the massive shift in population from farm and village to the growing urban centers, where the church had less influence over the values of its members. These changes were transforming the way Spaniards defined their religious identity.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nBeing a Catholic in Spain had less and less to do with regular attendance at [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] and more to do with the routine observance of important rituals such as baptism, marriage, and burial of the dead. A 1980 survey revealed that, although 82 percent of Spaniards were believers in Catholicism, very few considered themselves to be very good practitioners of the faith. In the case of the youth of the country, even smaller percentages believed themselves to be \"very good\" or \"practicing\" Catholics.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIn contrast to an earlier era, when rejection of the church went along with education, in the late 1980s studies showed that the more educated a person was, the more likely he or she was to be a practicing Catholic. This new acceptance of the church was due partly to the church's new self-restraint in politics. In a significant change from the pre-Civil War era, the church had accepted the need for the separation of religion and the state, and it had even discouraged the creation of a Christian Democratic party in the country.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n[[Image:Presidente de Espa\u00f1a Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero en el Senado en marzo de 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]], an openly agnostic<ref name=ZAPATERO>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2008/06/29/domingo/1214711557_850215.html|title=\"'Miembras' abri\u00f3 el debate.

Although the Socialist leadership professed [[agnosticism]], according to surveys between 40 and 45 percent of the party's rank-and-file members held religious beliefs, and more than 70 percent of these professed to be Catholics. Among those entering the party after Franco's death, about half considered themselves Catholic.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nOne important indicator of the changes taking place in the role of the church was the reduction in the number of Spaniards in Holy Orders. In 1984 the country had more than 22,000 parish priests, nearly 10,000 ordained monks, and nearly 75,000 nuns. These numbers concealed a troubling reality, however. More than 70 percent of the diocesan clergy was between the ages of 35 and 65; the average age of the clergy in 1982 was 49 years. At the upper end of the age range, the low numbers reflected the impact of the Civil War, in which more than 4,000 parish priests died. At the lower end, the scarcity of younger priests reflected the general crisis in vocations throughout the world, which began to be felt in the 1960s. Its effects were felt very acutely in Spain. The crisis was seen in the decline in the number of young men joining the priesthood and in the increase in the number of priests leaving Holy Orders. The number of [[Seminary|seminarians]] in Spain fell from more than 9,000 in the 1950s to only 1,500 in 1979, even though it rose slightly in 1982 to about 1,700.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> In 2008, there were just 1,221 students in these theological schools.<ref name=SEMINARISTAS09>{{cite web|url=http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/seminarios/2009/Estadisticas.pdf|title=Estad\u00edsticas \"D\u00eda del Seminario\" 2009, Conferencia Episcopal Espa\u00f1ola|accessdate=2009-03-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530002400/http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/seminarios/2009/Estadisticas.pdf|archivedate=2009-05-30}}</ref>\n\nChanges in the social meaning of religious vocations were perhaps part of the problem; having a priest in the family no longer seemed to spark the kind of pride that family members would have felt in the past. The principal reason in most cases, though, was the church's continued ban on marriage for priests. Previously, the crisis was not particularly serious because of the age distribution of the clergy. As the twentieth century neared an end, however, a serious imbalance appeared between those entering the priesthood and those leaving it. The effects of this crisis were already visible in the decline in the number of parish priests in Spain\u2014from 23,620 in 1979 to just over 22,000 by 1983<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> and 19,307 in 2005.<ref name=\"ESTADISTICA2005\" /> New ordinations also dropped 19% from 241 in 1998 to 196 in 2008, with all-time record lows of 168 priests out of 45 million Spaniards taking their vows in 2007.<ref name=\"SEMINARISTAS09\" /><ref name=ESTADISTICA2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastoral-vocacional.org/acontecimientos_vocacionales/estadis2007MA.html|title=Acontecimientos Vocacionales, estad\u00edstica de seminarios mayores 2007.

Opus Dei, a worldwide lay religious body, did not adhere to any particular political philosophy. Its founder, [[Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer y Albas]], stated that the organization was nonpolitical. The organization was founded in 1928 as a reaction to the increasing secularization of Spain's universities, and higher education continued to be one of the institute's foremost priorities. Despite its public commitment to a nonpolitical stance, Opus Dei members rose to occupy key positions in the Franco r\u00e9gime, especially in the field of economic policy-making in the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Opus Dei members dominated the group of liberal technocrats who engineered the opening of Spain's [[Autarky|autarchic economy]] after 1957. After the 1973 assassination of Prime Minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] (often rumored to be an Opus Dei member), however, the influence of the institute declined sharply. The secrecy of the order and its activities and the power of its myth helped it maintain its strong position of influence in Spain; but there was little doubt that, compared with the 1950s and the 1960s, Opus Dei had fallen from being one of the country's chief political organizations to being simply one among many such groups competing for power in an open and pluralist society.<ref name=LOCprof>{{cite book |last1=Solsten |first1=Eric |last2=Meditz |first2=Sandra |date=1990 |title=Spain: A Country Study |url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.spaincountrystud00sols_0/ |location= |publisher=United States [[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division |page=115 |isbn=9780160285509 |lccn=90006127}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nAn important number of Latin American immigrants, who are usually strong Catholic practitioners, have helped the Catholic Church to recover part of the attendance that regular Masses (Sunday Mass) used to have in the sixties and seventies and that was lost in the eighties among native Spaniards.\n\nSince 2003, the involvement of the Catholic Church in political affairs, through special groups such as [[Opus Dei]], the [[Neocatechumenal Way]] or the [[Legion of Christ]], especially personated through important politicians in the right-wing People's Party, has increased again. Old and new media, which are property of the Church, such as the [[Cadena COPE|COPE]] radio network or [[:es:Trece (canal de televisi\u00f3n)|13 TV]], have also contributed to this new involvement in politics by their own admission.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Un informe de la Iglesia califica a 13TV de \"culturalmente pobre\", af\u00edn al PP y para \"la tercera edad\"|url=http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/encargado-denuncia-television-eminentemente-definida_0_518998732.html|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher = eldiario.es|language=es}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://bluper.elespanol.com/noticias/iglesia-califica-13tv-afin-pp-culturalmente-pobre|title=La Iglesia califica a 13 TV como af\u00edn al PP y para \"la tercera edad\" {{!}} Bluper|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher = bluper.elespanol.com|language=es}}</ref> The Church is no longer seen as a neutral and independent institution in political affairs and it is generally aligned with the opinion and politics of the People's Party.

The [[Reconquista]] against [[Al Andalus]] (ending in 1492), the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (1478) and the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|expulsion of Jews]] (1492) were highly relevant in the union of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] under the ''[[Catholic Monarchs]]'' [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando]] (1492), followed by the persecution and eventual [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] in 1609. The [[Counter-Reformation]] (1563\u20131648) was especially strong in Spain and the Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, thus keeping Islam, Judaism, Protestantism and [[Enlightenment in Spain|parts of the Enlightenment]] at bay for most of its history.\n\n=== Antiquity and late Antiquity ===\n{{VT|History of Early Christianity|History of the Catholic Church|Constantine the Great and Christianity|Visigothic Kingdom|Councils of Toledo}}\n[[Image:Le Temple de Diane vue lat\u00e9rale et frontale.JPG|thumb|left|The rebuilt [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] temple of Diana in [[Emerita Augusta|M\u00e9rida]]]]\nBefore Christianity, there were multiple beliefs in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] including local [[Iberians|Iberian]], [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] religions, as well as the [[Hellenistic religion|Greco]]-[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].\n \nAccording to [[Historia Compostelana|a medieval legend]], the [[James, son of Zebedee|apostle James]] was the first to spread Christianity in the [[Hispania|Roman Iberian Peninsula]].

According to [[Romans 15]], [[Paul the Apostle]] also intended to visit Hispania; tradition has that he did and founded the [[:es:Di\u00f3cesis de \u00c9cija|Diocese of \u00c9cija]], but there is no evidence of this either.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Other later myths include the [[Seven Apostolic Men]].\n\nThere is some archaeological evidence of Christianity slowly penetrating the Peninsula from Rome and [[Mauretania|Roman Mauretania]] via major cities and ports, especially [[Tarraco|Tarragona]], since the early [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]]. The [[:ca:Necr\u00f2polis paleocristiana de Tarragona|Paleo-Christian Necropolis of Tarragona]], with 2,050 discovered tombs, dates back to the second half of the 3rd century. Saints like [[Eulalia of M\u00e9rida]] or [[Eulalia of Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[:Category:Saints from Hispania|many others]] are believed to have been martyred during the [[Decian persecution|Decian]] or [[Diocletianic Persecution]]s ([[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd]]\u2013early [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th]] centuries). [[Bishop]]s like [[:es:Bas\u00edlides de Astorga|Bas\u00edlides of Astorga]], [[:es:Marcial de M\u00e9rida|Marcial of M\u00e9rida]] or the influential [[Hosius of Corduba]] were active in the same period.\n\n[[Theodosius I]] issued decrees that effectively made [[Nicene Christianity]] the official [[state church of the Roman Empire]].,<ref>''Cf. decree, infra''.</ref><ref name=\"EdictOfThessolonica\">\"Edict of Thessalonica\": See Codex Theodosianus XVI.1.2</ref> This Christianity was already an early form of Catholicism.\n[[Image:SanPedroNave1.jpg|thumb|The 7th-century Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]]]]\nAs [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] declined, [[Migration Period|Germanic tribes invaded]] most of the lands of the former empire.

The [[Visigoths#Visigothic kingdom in Hispania|Visigothic Kingdom]] established its capital in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]; it reached its high point during the reign of [[Leovigild]] (568-586). Visigothic rule led to a brief expansion of [[Arianism]] in Spain, however the native population remained staunchly Catholic.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 587 [[Reccared]], the Visigothic king at Toledo, converted to Catholicism  and launched a movement to unify doctrine. The Council of Lerida in 546 constrained the clergy and extended the power of law over them under the blessings of Rome. The multiple [[Councils of Toledo]] definitively established what would be later known as the Catholic Church in Spain and contributed to define Catholicism elsewhere.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{VT|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Reconquista}}\nBy the early 8th century, the Visigothic kingdom had fragmented and the fragments were in disarray, bankrupt and willing to accept external help to fight each other. In 711 an [[Arab]] raiding party led by [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], then defeated the Visigothic king [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Tariq's commander, [[Musa bin Nusair]], then landed with substantial reinforcements. Taking advantage of the Visigoths' infighting, by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula, establishing Islamic rule until 1492. \n[[Image:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]] turned church after the [[Reconquista]].]]\nDuring this period the number of Muslims increased greatly through the migration of Arabs and Berbers, and the conversion of local Christians to Islam (known as [[Muladi]]s or Muwalladun) with the latter forming the majority of the Islamic-ruled area by the end of the 10th century. Most Christians who remained adopted Arabic culture, and these Arabized Christians became known as [[Mozarabs]]. While under the status of ''[[dhimmi]]s'' the Christian and Jewish subjects had to pay higher taxes than Muslims and could not hold positions of power over Muslims.\n\nThe era of Muslim rule before 1055 is often considered a \"Golden Age\" for the Jews as Jewish intellectual and spiritual life flourished in Spain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sephardim|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|author=Rebecca Weiner|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html}}</ref> Only in the northern fringes of the peninsula did Christians remain under Christian rule.

In 1147, when the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] took control of Muslim Andalusian territories, they reversed the earlier tolerant attitude and treated Christians harshly. Faced with the choice of death, conversion, or emigration, many [[Jews]] and Christians emigrated.<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/IntergroupTO/JewishMuslim/Almohads.htm The Almohads] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213223723/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/IntergroupTO/JewishMuslim/Almohads.htm |date=2009-02-13 }}\n</ref> Christianity provided the cultural and religious cement that helped bind together those who rose up against the Moors and sought to drive them out. Christianity and the Catholic Church helped shape the re-establishment of European rule over Iberia.\n[[File:01 Antequera, Andalusia, Spain.jpg|thumb|[[:es:Real Colegiata de Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor|Royal Collegiate Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor]] in [[Antequera]], [[Andalusia]]]]\nAfter centuries of the [[Reconquista]], in which Christian Spaniards fought to drive out the [[Moors|Muslims]], King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] established the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1478, a religious purge of Muslim and Jewish thought and practice, from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]], the last Muslim redoubt, was eventually reconquered on January 2, 1492, 781 years after Tariq's first landing.\n\n=== Modern period ===\nIn the Early Modern Period, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity. Spain carried Catholicism to the New World and to the Philippines, but the Spanish kings insisted on independence from papal \"interference\"\u2014bishops in the Spanish domains were forbidden to report to the Pope except through the Spanish crown. In the 18th century, Spanish rulers drew further from the papacy, banishing the [[Jesuits]] from their empire in 1767. The Spanish authorities abolished the Inquisition in the 1830s, but even after that, [[religious freedom]] was denied in practice, if not in theory.\n\n=== Concordat of 1851 ===\nCatholicism became the state religion in 1851, when the Spanish government signed a [[Concordat]] with the [[Holy See]] that committed [[Madrid]] to pay the salaries of the clergy and to subsidize other expenses of the Roman Catholic Church as a compensation for the seizure of church property in the ''[[Desamortizaci\u00f3n de Mendiz\u00e1bal]]'' of 1835-1837. This pact was renounced in 1931, when the secular constitution of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] imposed a series of anticlerical measures that threatened the Church's hegemony in Spain, provoking the Church's support for the [[Francisco Franco]] uprising five years later.<ref name=\"LOCprof2\">Text used in this cited section originally came from: [http://rs6.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html Spain Country Study] from the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.\n</ref> In the ensuing [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], alleged communists and anarchists in Republican areas killed about [[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|7,000 priests]], the majority murdered between July and December 1936.

During the Franco years, Roman Catholicism was the only religion to have legal status; other worship services could not be advertised, and no other religion could own property or publish books. The Government not only continued to pay priests' salaries and to subsidize the Church, it also assisted in the reconstruction of church buildings damaged by the war. Laws were passed abolishing divorce and civil marriages as well as banning abortion and the sale of contraceptives. Homosexuality and all other forms of sexual permissiveness were also banned.  Catholic religious instruction was mandatory, even in public schools. Franco secured in return the right to name Roman Catholic bishops in Spain, as well as veto power over appointments of clergy down to the parish priest level.\n\nIn 1953 this close cooperation was formalized in a [[Concordat of 1953|new Concordat]] with the Vatican that granted the church an extraordinary set of privileges: mandatory canonical marriages for all Catholics; exemption from government taxation; subsidies for new building construction; censorship of materials the Church deemed offensive; the right to establish universities, to operate radio stations, and to publish newspapers and magazines; protection from police intrusion into church properties; and exemption of military service.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nThe proclamation of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in favor of religious freedom in 1965 provided more rights to other religious denominations in Spain. In the late 1960s, the Vatican attempted to reform the Church in Spain by appointing interim, or acting, bishops, thereby circumventing Franco's stranglehold on the country's clergy. Many young priests, under foreign influence, became [[worker priest]]s and participated in anti-regime agitation. Many of them ended as leftist politicians, with some imprisoned in the [[Concordat prison]] reserved for priest prisoners. In 1966, the Franco regime passed a law that freed other religions from many of the earlier restrictions, but the law also reaffirmed the privileges of the Catholic Church. Any attempt to revise the 1953 Concordat met Franco's rigid resistance.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\n===Separation of church and state since 1978===\n[[Image:Vicente Enrique y Taranc\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal [[Vicente Enrique y Taranc\u00f3n]] adopted a democratic stance and was decisive in separating church from state in Spain.<ref name=tarancon1>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/11/20/sociedad/1195513202_850215.html|title=El cardenal Taranc\u00f3n lo intent\u00f3 en 1971 |publisher= [[El Pa\u00eds]] |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2018-04-08| quote=Sin Taranc\u00f3n y su grupo de colaboradores, apoyados en todo momento por el papa Pablo VI, la transici\u00f3n desde el nacionalcatolicismo hacia la democracia hubiera sido imposible. | language=Spanish}}</ref> As a result, he received continuous death threats from hardline Francoists, including far-right Catholics, until democracy was well established; \"\u00a1Taranc\u00f3n al pared\u00f3n!\" ''(Taranc\u00f3n to the execution wall!)'' was a common slogan.<ref name=tarancon2>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2012/01/22/domingo/1327207955_850215.html|title=La rabia de Taranc\u00f3n |publisher= [[El Pa\u00eds]] |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2018-04-08| language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=tarancon3>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/09/13/sociedad/1189634413_850215.html|title=El cardenal que hizo llorar a Franco |publisher= [[El Pa\u00eds]] |date=2012-01-22 |accessdate=2018-04-08| language=Spanish}}</ref>]]\nIn 1976, however, King [[Juan Carlos de Borbon]] unilaterally renounced the right to name the bishops; later that year, Madrid and the Vatican signed a new accord that restored to the church its right to name bishops, and the Church agreed to a revised Concordat that entailed a gradual financial [[separation of church and state]]. Church property not used for religious purposes was henceforth to be subject to taxation, and over a period of years the Church's reliance on state subsidies was to be gradually reduced. The timetable for this reduction was not adhered to, however, and the church continued to receive the public subsidy through 1987 (US$110 million in that year alone).<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIt took the new [[1978 Spanish Constitution]] to confirm the right of Spaniards to religious freedom and to begin the process of disestablishing Catholicism as the state religion. The drafters of the Constitution tried to deal with the intense controversy surrounding state support of the Church, but they were not entirely successful. The initial draft of the Constitution did not even mention the Church, which was included almost as an afterthought and only after intense pressure from the church's leadership. Article 16 disestablishes Roman Catholicism as the official religion and provides that religious liberty for non-Catholics is a state-protected legal right, thereby replacing the policy of limited toleration of non-Catholic religious practices. The article further states, however, that: \"The public authorities shall take the religious beliefs of Spanish society into account and shall maintain the consequent relations of cooperation with the Catholic Church and the other confessions.\" In addition, Article 27 also aroused controversy by appearing to pledge continuing government subsidies for private, Church-affiliated schools. These schools were sharply criticized by Spanish Socialists for having created and perpetuated a class-based, separate, and unequal school system. The Constitution, however, includes no affirmation that the majority of Spaniards are Catholics or that the state should take into account the teachings of Catholicism.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> The Constitution declares Spain a \"non-confessional\" state, however it is not a ''[[la\u00efque]]'' (secular) state like [[Catholic Church in France|France]] or [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Mexico]].\n\nGovernment financial aid to the Catholic Church was a difficult and contentious issue. The Church argued that, in return for the subsidy, the state had received the social, health, and educational services of tens of thousands of priests and nuns who fulfilled vital functions that the state itself could not have performed at that time. Nevertheless, the revised Concordat was supposed to replace direct state aid to the church with a scheme that would allow taxpayers to designate a certain portion of their taxes to be diverted directly to the Church. Through 1985, taxpayers were allowed to deduct up to 10 percent from their taxable income for donations to the Catholic Church. Partly because of the protests against this arrangement from representatives of Spain's other religious groups and even from some Catholics, the tax laws were changed in 2007 so that taxpayers could choose between giving 0.52 percent of their income tax to the church and allocating it to the government's welfare and culture budgets. For three years, the government would continue to give the Church a gradually reduced subsidy, but after that the church would have to subsist on its own resources. The government would continue, however, its program of subsidizing Catholic schools, which in 1987 cost the Spanish taxpayers about US$300 million exclusive of the salaries of teachers, which were paid directly by the Ministry of Education and Science.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIn a population of about 39 million at the beginning of [[Spanish transition to democracy|Transition]] (begun in November 1975), the number of non-Catholics was probably no more than 300,000. About 290,000 of these were of other Christian faiths, including several Protestant denominations, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Spain|Mormons]]. The number of Jews in Spain was estimated at about 13,000 in the\n[[Murcia Jewish community]]. More than 19 out of every 20 Spaniards were baptized Catholics; about 60 percent of them attended Mass; about 30 percent of the baptized Catholics did so regularly, although this figure declined to about 20 percent in the larger cities. In 1979, about 97 percent of all marriages were performed according to the Catholic rite. A 1982 report by the church claimed that 82 percent of all children born the preceding year had been baptized in the church.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nNevertheless, there were forces at work bringing about fundamental changes in the place of the church in society. One such force was the improvement in the economic fortunes of the great majority of Spaniards, making society more [[materialistic]] and less religious. Another force was the massive shift in population from farm and village to the growing urban centers, where the church had less influence over the values of its members. These changes were transforming the way Spaniards defined their religious identity.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nBeing a Catholic in Spain had less and less to do with regular attendance at [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] and more to do with the routine observance of important rituals such as baptism, marriage, and burial of the dead. A 1980 survey revealed that, although 82 percent of Spaniards were believers in Catholicism, very few considered themselves to be very good practitioners of the faith. In the case of the youth of the country, even smaller percentages believed themselves to be \"very good\" or \"practicing\" Catholics.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIn contrast to an earlier era, when rejection of the church went along with education, in the late 1980s studies showed that the more educated a person was, the more likely he or she was to be a practicing Catholic. This new acceptance of the church was due partly to the church's new self-restraint in politics. In a significant change from the pre-Civil War era, the church had accepted the need for the separation of religion and the state, and it had even discouraged the creation of a Christian Democratic party in the country.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n[[Image:Presidente de Espa\u00f1a Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero en el Senado en marzo de 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]], an openly agnostic<ref name=ZAPATERO>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2008/06/29/domingo/1214711557_850215.html|title=\"'Miembras' abri\u00f3 el debate.

Although the Socialist leadership professed [[agnosticism]], according to surveys between 40 and 45 percent of the party's rank-and-file members held religious beliefs, and more than 70 percent of these professed to be Catholics. Among those entering the party after Franco's death, about half considered themselves Catholic.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nOne important indicator of the changes taking place in the role of the church was the reduction in the number of Spaniards in Holy Orders. In 1984 the country had more than 22,000 parish priests, nearly 10,000 ordained monks, and nearly 75,000 nuns. These numbers concealed a troubling reality, however. More than 70 percent of the diocesan clergy was between the ages of 35 and 65; the average age of the clergy in 1982 was 49 years. At the upper end of the age range, the low numbers reflected the impact of the Civil War, in which more than 4,000 parish priests died. At the lower end, the scarcity of younger priests reflected the general crisis in vocations throughout the world, which began to be felt in the 1960s. Its effects were felt very acutely in Spain. The crisis was seen in the decline in the number of young men joining the priesthood and in the increase in the number of priests leaving Holy Orders. The number of [[Seminary|seminarians]] in Spain fell from more than 9,000 in the 1950s to only 1,500 in 1979, even though it rose slightly in 1982 to about 1,700.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> In 2008, there were just 1,221 students in these theological schools.<ref name=SEMINARISTAS09>{{cite web|url=http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/seminarios/2009/Estadisticas.pdf|title=Estad\u00edsticas \"D\u00eda del Seminario\" 2009, Conferencia Episcopal Espa\u00f1ola|accessdate=2009-03-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530002400/http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/seminarios/2009/Estadisticas.pdf|archivedate=2009-05-30}}</ref>\n\nChanges in the social meaning of religious vocations were perhaps part of the problem; having a priest in the family no longer seemed to spark the kind of pride that family members would have felt in the past. The principal reason in most cases, though, was the church's continued ban on marriage for priests. Previously, the crisis was not particularly serious because of the age distribution of the clergy. As the twentieth century neared an end, however, a serious imbalance appeared between those entering the priesthood and those leaving it. The effects of this crisis were already visible in the decline in the number of parish priests in Spain\u2014from 23,620 in 1979 to just over 22,000 by 1983<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> and 19,307 in 2005.<ref name=\"ESTADISTICA2005\" /> New ordinations also dropped 19% from 241 in 1998 to 196 in 2008, with all-time record lows of 168 priests out of 45 million Spaniards taking their vows in 2007.<ref name=\"SEMINARISTAS09\" /><ref name=ESTADISTICA2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastoral-vocacional.org/acontecimientos_vocacionales/estadis2007MA.html|title=Acontecimientos Vocacionales, estad\u00edstica de seminarios mayores 2007.

Opus Dei, a worldwide lay religious body, did not adhere to any particular political philosophy. Its founder, [[Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer y Albas]], stated that the organization was nonpolitical. The organization was founded in 1928 as a reaction to the increasing secularization of Spain's universities, and higher education continued to be one of the institute's foremost priorities. Despite its public commitment to a nonpolitical stance, Opus Dei members rose to occupy key positions in the Franco r\u00e9gime, especially in the field of economic policy-making in the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Opus Dei members dominated the group of liberal technocrats who engineered the opening of Spain's [[Autarky|autarchic economy]] after 1957. After the 1973 assassination of Prime Minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] (often rumored to be an Opus Dei member), however, the influence of the institute declined sharply. The secrecy of the order and its activities and the power of its myth helped it maintain its strong position of influence in Spain; but there was little doubt that, compared with the 1950s and the 1960s, Opus Dei had fallen from being one of the country's chief political organizations to being simply one among many such groups competing for power in an open and pluralist society.<ref name=LOCprof>{{cite book |last1=Solsten |first1=Eric |last2=Meditz |first2=Sandra |date=1990 |title=Spain: A Country Study |url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.spaincountrystud00sols_0/ |location= |publisher=United States [[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division |page=115 |isbn=9780160285509 |lccn=90006127}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nAn important number of Latin American immigrants, who are usually strong Catholic practitioners, have helped the Catholic Church to recover part of the attendance that regular Masses (Sunday Mass) used to have in the sixties and seventies and that was lost in the eighties among native Spaniards.\n\nSince 2003, the involvement of the Catholic Church in political affairs, through special groups such as [[Opus Dei]], the [[Neocatechumenal Way]] or the [[Legion of Christ]], especially personated through important politicians in the right-wing People's Party, has increased again. Old and new media, which are property of the Church, such as the [[Cadena COPE|COPE]] radio network or [[:es:Trece (canal de televisi\u00f3n)|13 TV]], have also contributed to this new involvement in politics by their own admission.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Un informe de la Iglesia califica a 13TV de \"culturalmente pobre\", af\u00edn al PP y para \"la tercera edad\"|url=http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/encargado-denuncia-television-eminentemente-definida_0_518998732.html|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher = eldiario.es|language=es}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://bluper.elespanol.com/noticias/iglesia-califica-13tv-afin-pp-culturalmente-pobre|title=La Iglesia califica a 13 TV como af\u00edn al PP y para \"la tercera edad\" {{!}} Bluper|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher = bluper.elespanol.com|language=es}}</ref> The Church is no longer seen as a neutral and independent institution in political affairs and it is generally aligned with the opinion and politics of the People's Party.

His grandfather was a poor scholar from [[County Tyrone]] and made his way down to Tara to take part in the [[1798 Rising]].<ref name=mc>http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/1916centenary/articles/2016/05/06/4119365-the-1916-series-kilskyre-remembers-brian-ohiggins/</ref> He was educated at the Kilskyre National School for ten years from 1886 before becoming a draper's apprentice at nearby Clonmellon. He was also in this period he began to contribute articles for local newspapers and publish poetry in the [[Meath Chronicle]]. He moved to Dublin in 1901 as a teenager to work as a barman and during his time there he joined the O'Growney Branch of the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and Saint Finians Hurling Club.<ref name=nhs>http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=brian-o-higgins</ref> His health declined in 1903 and he returned to live in his native Meath. It was during his recuperation at home that he co-founded the local hurling club, whose grounds were later named in his memory (P\u00e1irc U\u00ed hUig\u00edn).\n\nO'Higgins was present at the first annual convention of the National Council of Sinn F\u00e9in on 28 November 1905, and wrote its first party anthem entitled 'Sinn F\u00e9in Amh\u00e1in'. The song was sung at all gatherings of the organisation for a number of years.\n\nAfter attending an Irish-language summer college at Ballingeary, Co. Cork, O'Higgins received a language teacher's certificate in 1906 and began work as a m\u00fainteoir taistil (travelling teacher) for the Gaelic League. During this time he founded Col\u00e1iste U\u00ed Chomhraidhe, an Irish language college in Carrigaholt, [[County Clare]].<ref>http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/songs/cmc/a_stor_mo_chroi_oconway.htm</ref> He became a good friend of [[Patrick Pearse|P\u00e1draig Pearse]], after they first met in 1906.\n\nBrian na Banban first published his poetry in book form in 1907 as The Voice of Banba: Songs and Recitations for Young Ireland. Some of O'Higgins' work is anodyne and sentimental stuff, as per his Christmas Stories and Sketches (1917), Hearts of Gold (1918) and Songs of the Sacred Heart (1921). These works were commended by the [[Bishop of Killaloe]], the Sinn F\u00e9in-supporting Michael Fogarty, as being 'full of simple and profound religious feeling'.\n\nO'Higgins' poem \"[[:wikisource:Who is Ireland's Enemy?|Who is Ireland's Enemy?]]\", was first published in September 1914 in  ''[[Irish Freedom]]'', in an edition entitled ''Germany Is Not Ireland's Enemy''; it became popular during the [[1918 Irish conscription crisis]]. According to Christopher M. Kennedy,  the poem was \"perhaps the most blatant example of using past wrongs committed by England to keep the old hatreds alive\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Genesis of the Rising, 1912\u20131916: A Transformation of Nationalist Opinion|last=Kennedy|first=Christopher M.|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=1433105004|ref=harv|p=99}}</ref>\n\n==Republican activity==\n\nO'Higgins was a founding member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913, which organised to work for Irish independence. On Easter Monday of 1916 he was in a group of Volunteers who were held at 41 Parnell Square as reserves, on account of their age, health or physical condition. This group was called to the GPO at six o'clock that evening. He was put on guard duty at the main entrance to the GPO and he later served under Quartermaster Michael Staines. He assisted in the evacuation of the wounded from the GPO on Friday evening and spent the night in a shed off Moore Street. He was deported to [[Stafford Gaol]] on May 1 and interned in [[Frongoch internment camp]] until February 1917.<ref name=nhs/>\n\nIn May 1918 he was arrested and deported to Birmingham Jail, and was elected Sinn F\u00e9in candidate for West Clare during the 1918 General Election.<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Brian-O'Higgins.D.1919-01-21/|title=Brian O'Higgins|work=Oireachtas Members Database|access-date=11 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and instead assembled in [[Dublin]] as a revolutionary parliament called [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]. He was involved in the establishment of the [[D\u00e1il Courts|Republican courts]] in [[County Clare]].<ref name=mc/>\n\nO'Higgins was re-elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) at the [[1921 Irish elections|1921]], [[1922 Irish general election|1922]] and [[1923 Irish general election|1923]] elections.\n\nHe opposed the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and [[Anglo-Irish Treaty D\u00e1il vote|voted against]] it. During the [[Irish Civil War]], he was imprisoned in Oriel House, Mountjoy Jail and Tintown and went on hunger strike for twenty five days.<ref name=mc/>\n\nHe resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in in 1934<ref name=mc/> along with [[Mary MacSwiney]] in protest against the election of [[Michael O'Flanagan|Fr. Michael O'Flanagan]] as President citing that O'Flanagan had a state job and was \"on the pay-roll of a usurping government\".<ref name=pob>{{cite web |url=https://brianofbanba.wordpress.com/2018/05/10/compromise-and-confusion/ |language=English |title=Compromise and Confusion by Brian O\u2019Higgins |work=brianofbanba.wordpress.com}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1938, O'Higgins was one of a group of seven people, who had been elected to the [[Second D\u00e1il]] in 1921, who met with the [[IRA Army Council]] under [[Se\u00e1n Russell]]. At this meeting, the seven signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann to the Army Council. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the [[Irish Republic]] and, on this basis, the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in justified their rejection of the states of the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] and political [[abstentionism]] from their parliamentary institutions.\n\nToday, the dissident terrorist organisation [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]] claim to be the heirs of this legitimacy and believe to be the legitimate continuation of the original [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] or ''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann''.<ref>{{cite book | last = van Engeland | first = Anisseh | authorlink = | title = From Terrorism to Politics (Ethics and Global Politics) | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]] | year = 2008 | page = 55 | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-7546-4990-8}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nFrom the late 1920s he ran a successful business publishing greeting cards, calendars and devotional materials decorated with Celtic designs and O'Higgins' own verses.\n\nFollowing the suppression of [[An Phoblacht]] in 1937, he founded and edited the [[Wolfe Tone Weekly]] from 1937\u20131939 until it was also banned by the Free State Government. From 1932 to 1962 he published the [[Wolfe Tone Annual]], from his business at 56 Parnell Square, Dublin. This popular series of volumes gave popular accounts of episodes in Irish history from a republican viewpoint and he intended to cheer and inspire those true to 'the Separatist Idea and devoted to the vindication of all those who have sacrificed themselves for the full Independence and Gaelicisation of Ireland'. O'Higgins wrote numerous ballads and poems about Ireland throughout his life time.

His grandfather was a poor scholar from [[County Tyrone]] and made his way down to Tara to take part in the [[1798 Rising]].<ref name=mc>http://www.meathchronicle.ie/news/1916centenary/articles/2016/05/06/4119365-the-1916-series-kilskyre-remembers-brian-ohiggins/</ref> He was educated at the Kilskyre National School for ten years from 1886 before becoming a draper's apprentice at nearby Clonmellon. He was also in this period he began to contribute articles for local newspapers and publish poetry in the [[Meath Chronicle]]. He moved to Dublin in 1901 as a teenager to work as a barman and during his time there he joined the O'Growney Branch of the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and Saint Finians Hurling Club.<ref name=nhs>http://www.navanhistory.ie/index.php?page=brian-o-higgins</ref> His health declined in 1903 and he returned to live in his native Meath. It was during his recuperation at home that he co-founded the local hurling club, whose grounds were later named in his memory (P\u00e1irc U\u00ed hUig\u00edn).\n\nO'Higgins was present at the first annual convention of the National Council of Sinn F\u00e9in on 28 November 1905, and wrote its first party anthem entitled 'Sinn F\u00e9in Amh\u00e1in'. The song was sung at all gatherings of the organisation for a number of years.\n\nAfter attending an Irish-language summer college at Ballingeary, Co. Cork, O'Higgins received a language teacher's certificate in 1906 and began work as a m\u00fainteoir taistil (travelling teacher) for the Gaelic League. During this time he founded Col\u00e1iste U\u00ed Chomhraidhe, an Irish language college in Carrigaholt, [[County Clare]].<ref>http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/songs/cmc/a_stor_mo_chroi_oconway.htm</ref> He became a good friend of [[Patrick Pearse|P\u00e1draig Pearse]], after they first met in 1906.\n\nBrian na Banban first published his poetry in book form in 1907 as The Voice of Banba: Songs and Recitations for Young Ireland. Some of O'Higgins' work is anodyne and sentimental stuff, as per his Christmas Stories and Sketches (1917), Hearts of Gold (1918) and Songs of the Sacred Heart (1921). These works were commended by the [[Bishop of Killaloe]], the Sinn F\u00e9in-supporting Michael Fogarty, as being 'full of simple and profound religious feeling'.\n\nO'Higgins' poem \"[[:wikisource:Who is Ireland's Enemy?|Who is Ireland's Enemy?]]\", was first published in September 1914 in  ''[[Irish Freedom]]'', in an edition entitled ''Germany Is Not Ireland's Enemy''; it became popular during the [[1918 Irish conscription crisis]]. According to Christopher M. Kennedy,  the poem was \"perhaps the most blatant example of using past wrongs committed by England to keep the old hatreds alive\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Genesis of the Rising, 1912\u20131916: A Transformation of Nationalist Opinion|last=Kennedy|first=Christopher M.|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=1433105004|ref=harv|p=99}}</ref>\n\n==Republican activity==\n\nO'Higgins was a founding member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913, which organised to work for Irish independence. On Easter Monday of 1916 he was in a group of Volunteers who were held at 41 Parnell Square as reserves, on account of their age, health or physical condition. This group was called to the GPO at six o'clock that evening. He was put on guard duty at the main entrance to the GPO and he later served under Quartermaster Michael Staines. He assisted in the evacuation of the wounded from the GPO on Friday evening and spent the night in a shed off Moore Street. He was deported to [[Stafford Gaol]] on May 1 and interned in [[Frongoch internment camp]] until February 1917.<ref name=nhs/>\n\nIn May 1918 he was arrested and deported to Birmingham Jail, and was elected Sinn F\u00e9in candidate for West Clare during the 1918 General Election.<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Brian-O'Higgins.D.1919-01-21/|title=Brian O'Higgins|work=Oireachtas Members Database|access-date=11 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and instead assembled in [[Dublin]] as a revolutionary parliament called [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]. He was involved in the establishment of the [[D\u00e1il Courts|Republican courts]] in [[County Clare]].<ref name=mc/>\n\nO'Higgins was re-elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) at the [[1921 Irish elections|1921]], [[1922 Irish general election|1922]] and [[1923 Irish general election|1923]] elections.\n\nHe opposed the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and [[Anglo-Irish Treaty D\u00e1il vote|voted against]] it. During the [[Irish Civil War]], he was imprisoned in Oriel House, Mountjoy Jail and Tintown and went on hunger strike for twenty five days.<ref name=mc/>\n\nHe resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in in 1934<ref name=mc/> along with [[Mary MacSwiney]] in protest against the election of [[Michael O'Flanagan|Fr. Michael O'Flanagan]] as President citing that O'Flanagan had a state job and was \"on the pay-roll of a usurping government\".<ref name=pob>{{cite web |url=https://brianofbanba.wordpress.com/2018/05/10/compromise-and-confusion/ |language=English |title=Compromise and Confusion by Brian O\u2019Higgins |work=brianofbanba.wordpress.com}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1938, O'Higgins was one of a group of seven people, who had been elected to the [[Second D\u00e1il]] in 1921, who met with the [[IRA Army Council]] under [[Se\u00e1n Russell]]. At this meeting, the seven signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann to the Army Council. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the [[Irish Republic]] and, on this basis, the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in justified their rejection of the states of the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] and political [[abstentionism]] from their parliamentary institutions.\n\nToday, the dissident terrorist organisation [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]] claim to be the heirs of this legitimacy and believe to be the legitimate continuation of the original [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] or ''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann''.<ref>{{cite book | last = van Engeland | first = Anisseh | authorlink = | title = From Terrorism to Politics (Ethics and Global Politics) | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]] | year = 2008 | page = 55 | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-7546-4990-8}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nFrom the late 1920s he ran a successful business publishing greeting cards, calendars and devotional materials decorated with Celtic designs and O'Higgins' own verses.\n\nFollowing the suppression of [[An Phoblacht]] in 1937, he founded and edited the [[Wolfe Tone Weekly]] from 1937\u20131939 until it was also banned by the Free State Government. From 1932 to 1962 he published the [[Wolfe Tone Annual]], from his business at 56 Parnell Square, Dublin. This popular series of volumes gave popular accounts of episodes in Irish history from a republican viewpoint and he intended to cheer and inspire those true to 'the Separatist Idea and devoted to the vindication of all those who have sacrificed themselves for the full Independence and Gaelicisation of Ireland'. O'Higgins wrote numerous ballads and poems about Ireland throughout his life time. Many are still sung at Feiseanna and Fleadh Ceoils.\n\nHe was a devout Catholic and was heavily critical of those who tried to link the Republican struggle with socialism and communism. Several of his children became Catholic priests.\n\n==Death==\n\nO'Higgins died while praying in Saint Anthony's Church in Clontarf, on 10 March 1963 <ref name=brianofbanbha>{{cite web |url=https://brianofbanba.wordpress.com/2018/05/10/brian-ohiggins-an-uncompromising-patriot/ |language=English |title=Brian O\u2019Higgins \u2013 An Uncompromising Patriot |work=brianofbanba.wordpress.com}}</ref>.

The cars were painted with liveries reflecting the races that did not allow tobacco and alcohol sponsors (e.g. [[1994 German Grand Prix]]).\n\nIt had 3D texture mapping and [[SVGA|SVGA graphics]],<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page iv.</ref> as well as an early 3D physics [[game engine|engine]].<ref name=\"gsreview\" /> A large community of GP2 enthusiasts formed following the game's release. ''Grand Prix 2'' is recognized as one of the definitive racing simulations of its era.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\nThe game is a simulation of the 1994 Formula One season<ref name=\"MicroProse 1996. Page 1\">MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 1.</ref> with all 16<ref name=\"MicroProse 1996. Page 1\"/> circuits from the 1994 season and 28 drivers in their 14 teams. Unlike the real 1994 season, where teams changed drivers and sponsorship liveries repeatedly, the game has a consistent driver list and set of liveries throughout, which reflects that of the [[1994 German Grand Prix]]. As a result, [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Roland Ratzenberger]], who both [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|were killed]] during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix are not present in the game. The liveries for each of the cars are also based on their appearance at the 1994 German Grand Prix, where all teams ran non-tobacco livery. It includes all parts of a Formula One weekend, including practice, qualifying and racing. It also included a championship mode which simulated the entire season.\n\nThere was no \"arcade\" mode in Grand Prix II, per se, but it included the ability to turn on and off such things as indestructibility. There were seven major functions called \"driving aids\" that could be turned on or off:<ref name=\"manualpage20\">MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 20.</ref> steering help, braking help, automatic turn-around (has the car face forward after a crash), indestructibility, racing line help, [[automatic gearbox|automatic shifting]] and [[traction control system|traction control]].<ref name=\"manualpage20\"/> The game had five levels of difficulty one could choose from, and the higher the level, the less options for driving aids one could turn on or off.<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 21.</ref>\n\nThere also is a \"Quickrace\" function that lets the player jump into a race without having to go through the perfunctory qualifying session.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The quickrace option was customizable, allowing a player to race as many laps as desired and allow the player to set their grid position.<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 25.</ref>\n\nThe player selects the car they will drive among the 28 seats available, supplanting the driver who originally raced in that vehicle.\n\nThe game had multiple camera angles, including a simulated TV coverage angle. A player can control his or her car from any of them, but the primary angle used was the first-person cockpit angle.\n\nThe cars can be customizable in myriad ways through the setup function. Car setups could be modified to high detail with a high degree of accuracy and attention to detail.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nUsually people raced as single player.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The game also offered multiplayer and modem-linked gaming.<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 105.</ref>\n\nA race can be played in turns, with different players driving different cars in the race.<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 109.</ref> Gameplay in this mode has one player at a time driving their car in the race. Instead of a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] game,  [[AI|The computer]] simulates the driving for the other players' cars when they are not being controlled by one of the players waiting their turn.\n\nThe game also featured a [[Instant replay|replay]] function and [[save game]] feature.<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 37.</ref> The replay function showed the last ~30 seconds of racing and included the ability to save replays. It did not include an edit function.\n\nThe save game feature allowed players to save their progress in the game\n\nThe game also replicated engine, gearbox and electronic failures. This meant cars not only could crash, but also have flames or smoke shoot out of the backs of their cars from engine failure, to which they raced around the circuit damaged for a limited time before parking at the side of the road or in the pits.

In a time when the gaming industry had become dominated by development teams, it was a rare instance of an essentially one-man-project.<ref name=\"NGen21\"/>\n\nIt was the first<ref name=\"gsreview\" /> serious racing simulation programmed with all three axes in it\u2014i.e. the ability for vehicles to get airborne in the game. (1990's ''[[Stunts (video game)|Stunts]]'' and ''[[Stunt Driver]]'' featured this ability, but were not racing simulations of a series.) However, GP2 lacked the feature of having a car flip over entirely, which not yet was seen in hardcore racing simulations. In some cases, the game would crash if the car was about to overturn. Microsoft's ''[[Monster Truck Madness]]'' (1996), simulating [[monster truck|monster truck racing]], may have been the first to have that feature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIt included more extensive physics and included [[texture mapping|image mapping]] over the 3D model of the car to show vehicle liveries, a feature that emerged in racing simulations with [[Papyrus Design Group]]'s 1993 ''[[IndyCar Racing]]''.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| rev6 = ''PC Games'' \n| rev6Score = B+<ref name=pcgamesrev>{{cite magazine | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970207065724/http://www.pcgamesmag.com/games/Oct96/grandprix1096.html | url=http://www.pcgamesmag.com:80/games/Oct96/grandprix1096.html | title=''Grand Prix II'' | magazine=PC Games | author=Olafson, Peter | date=October 1996 | archivedate=February 7, 1997 | url-status=dead | access-date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nFollowing ''Grand Prix 2''{{'}}s release in July 1996,<ref name=mill1 /> its global sales reached 500,000 copies in September.<ref name=500k>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970606045547/http://www.next-generation.com/news/092196f.html | url=http://www.next-generation.com:80/news/092196f.html | title=Happy Spectrum Hits Million Mark | date=September 21, 1996 | author=Staff | archivedate=June 6, 1997 | work=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] | url-status=dead | access-date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref> This number rose to 750,000 copies by mid-January 1997, driven in large part by European purchases.<ref name=mill1>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970615020125/http://www.cdmag.com/news/0115971.html | url=http://www.cdmag.com:80/news/0115971.html | title=Ch-ching - Westwood cashes in | author=Bauman, Steve | date=January 15, 1997 | work=[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]] | archivedate=June 15, 1997 | url-status=dead | access-date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref> In August 1998, the game received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD),<ref name=vud1998>{{cite press release | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000713050154/http://www.vud.de/infopres/cebit98.htm | url=http://www.vud.de:80/infopres/cebit98.htm | title=Uhr TCM Hannover \u2013 ein gl\u00e4nzender Event auf der CebitHome | date=August 26, 1998 | publisher=Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland | archivedate=July 13, 2000 | language=German | url-status=dead | access-date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref> indicating sales of at least 200,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.<ref name=vudgoldplat>{{cite press release | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030110014620/http://www.vud.de/presse/november2002.php3 | url=http://www.vud.de:80/presse/november2002.php3 | title=VUD Sales Awards: November 2002 | publisher=Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland | archivedate=January 10, 2003 | language=German | url-status=dead | access-date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref> ''Grand Prix 2'' sold 1.5 million copies worldwide by late 2000.

It was made under an official FIA license<ref>{{cite web|title=Grip the Wheel, Rev the Engine and Take on the World's Toughest Courses in World Circuit Racing's Grand Prix II\u2122 from Microprose|url=http://grandprix2.de/nostal/presse.html|accessdate=20 August 2017|date=July 23, 1996}}</ref> that featured the [[Formula One]] [[1994 Formula One season|1994]] season, with all of the circuits, teams, drivers and cars. The cars were painted with liveries reflecting the races that did not allow tobacco and alcohol sponsors (e.g. [[1994 German Grand Prix]]).\n\nIt had 3D texture mapping and [[SVGA|SVGA graphics]],<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page iv.</ref> as well as an early 3D physics [[game engine|engine]].<ref name=\"gsreview\" /> A large community of GP2 enthusiasts formed following the game's release. ''Grand Prix 2'' is recognized as one of the definitive racing simulations of its era.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\nThe game is a simulation of the 1994 Formula One season<ref name=\"MicroProse 1996. Page 1\">MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 1.</ref> with all 16<ref name=\"MicroProse 1996. Page 1\"/> circuits from the 1994 season and 28 drivers in their 14 teams. Unlike the real 1994 season, where teams changed drivers and sponsorship liveries repeatedly, the game has a consistent driver list and set of liveries throughout, which reflects that of the [[1994 German Grand Prix]]. As a result, [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Roland Ratzenberger]], who both [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|were killed]] during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix are not present in the game. The liveries for each of the cars are also based on their appearance at the 1994 German Grand Prix, where all teams ran non-tobacco livery. It includes all parts of a Formula One weekend, including practice, qualifying and racing. It also included a championship mode which simulated the entire season.\n\nThere was no \"arcade\" mode in Grand Prix II, per se, but it included the ability to turn on and off such things as indestructibility. There were seven major functions called \"driving aids\" that could be turned on or off:<ref name=\"manualpage20\">MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 20.</ref> steering help, braking help, automatic turn-around (has the car face forward after a crash), indestructibility, racing line help, [[automatic gearbox|automatic shifting]] and [[traction control system|traction control]].<ref name=\"manualpage20\"/> The game had five levels of difficulty one could choose from, and the higher the level, the less options for driving aids one could turn on or off.<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 21.</ref>\n\nThere also is a \"Quickrace\" function that lets the player jump into a race without having to go through the perfunctory qualifying session.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The quickrace option was customizable, allowing a player to race as many laps as desired and allow the player to set their grid position.<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 25.</ref>\n\nThe player selects the car they will drive among the 28 seats available, supplanting the driver who originally raced in that vehicle.\n\nThe game had multiple camera angles, including a simulated TV coverage angle. A player can control his or her car from any of them, but the primary angle used was the first-person cockpit angle.\n\nThe cars can be customizable in myriad ways through the setup function. Car setups could be modified to high detail with a high degree of accuracy and attention to detail.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nUsually people raced as single player.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The game also offered multiplayer and modem-linked gaming.<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 105.</ref>\n\nA race can be played in turns, with different players driving different cars in the race.<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 109.</ref> Gameplay in this mode has one player at a time driving their car in the race. Instead of a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] game,  [[AI|The computer]] simulates the driving for the other players' cars when they are not being controlled by one of the players waiting their turn.\n\nThe game also featured a [[Instant replay|replay]] function and [[save game]] feature.<ref>MicroProse. Grand Prix II Reference Manual (game manual). First Printing, June 1996. U.S. edition. Page 37.</ref> The replay function showed the last ~30 seconds of racing and included the ability to save replays. It did not include an edit function.\n\nThe save game feature allowed players to save their progress in the game\n\nThe game also replicated engine, gearbox and electronic failures. This meant cars not only could crash, but also have flames or smoke shoot out of the backs of their cars from engine failure, to which they raced around the circuit damaged for a limited time before parking at the side of the road or in the pits. This was the first to simulate visual car failures; as in 1989's ''[[Indianapolis 500: The Simulation]]'' cars fell out of the race but went to the pits and parked permanently when a car failure was present.\n\n''Grand Prix II'' did not include wet weather conditions.<ref>http://www.simracingworld.com/content/51-grand-prix-3-review/3/  SimRacingWorld - [[Grand Prix 3]] review</ref> There also was the lack of a 'black flag' system replicating Formula One regulation penalties for course cutting, instead slowing the car down for a limited period of time if the course is cut through.\n\n===Teams and drivers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n!

In a time when the gaming industry had become dominated by development teams, it was a rare instance of an essentially one-man-project.<ref name=\"NGen21\"/>\n\nIt was the first<ref name=\"gsreview\" /> serious racing simulation programmed with all three axes in it\u2014i.e. the ability for vehicles to get airborne in the game. (1990's ''[[Stunts (video game)|Stunts]]'' and ''[[Stunt Driver]]'' featured this ability, but were not racing simulations of a series.) However, GP2 lacked the feature of having a car flip over entirely, which not yet was seen in hardcore racing simulations. In some cases, the game would crash if the car was about to overturn. Microsoft's ''[[Monster Truck Madness]]'' (1996), simulating [[monster truck|monster truck racing]], may have been the first to have that feature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIt included more extensive physics and included [[texture mapping|image mapping]] over the 3D model of the car to show vehicle liveries, a feature that emerged in racing simulations with [[Papyrus Design Group]]'s 1993 ''[[IndyCar Racing]]''.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| rev6 = ''PC Games'' \n| rev6Score = B+<ref name=pcgamesrev>{{cite magazine | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970207065724/http://www.pcgamesmag.com/games/Oct96/grandprix1096.html | url=http://www.pcgamesmag.com:80/games/Oct96/grandprix1096.html | title=''Grand Prix II'' | magazine=PC Games | author=Olafson, Peter | date=October 1996 | archivedate=February 7, 1997 | url-status=dead | access-date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nFollowing ''Grand Prix 2''{{'}}s release in July 1996,<ref name=mill1 /> its global sales reached 500,000 copies in September.<ref name=500k>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970606045547/http://www.next-generation.com/news/092196f.html | url=http://www.next-generation.com:80/news/092196f.html | title=Happy Spectrum Hits Million Mark | date=September 21, 1996 | author=Staff | archivedate=June 6, 1997 | work=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] | url-status=dead | access-date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref> This number rose to 750,000 copies by mid-January 1997, driven in large part by European purchases.<ref name=mill1>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970615020125/http://www.cdmag.com/news/0115971.html | url=http://www.cdmag.com:80/news/0115971.html | title=Ch-ching - Westwood cashes in | author=Bauman, Steve | date=January 15, 1997 | work=[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]] | archivedate=June 15, 1997 | url-status=dead | access-date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref> In August 1998, the game received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD),<ref name=vud1998>{{cite press release | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000713050154/http://www.vud.de/infopres/cebit98.htm | url=http://www.vud.de:80/infopres/cebit98.htm | title=Uhr TCM Hannover \u2013 ein gl\u00e4nzender Event auf der CebitHome | date=August 26, 1998 | publisher=Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland | archivedate=July 13, 2000 | language=German | url-status=dead | access-date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref> indicating sales of at least 200,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.<ref name=vudgoldplat>{{cite press release | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030110014620/http://www.vud.de/presse/november2002.php3 | url=http://www.vud.de:80/presse/november2002.php3 | title=VUD Sales Awards: November 2002 | publisher=Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland | archivedate=January 10, 2003 | language=German | url-status=dead | access-date=January 1, 2020 }}</ref> ''Grand Prix 2'' sold 1.5 million copies worldwide by late 2000.
