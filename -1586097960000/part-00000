They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in Udbodhan magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation. \n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur. The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math. \n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women\u2019s Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]]<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992), 48</ref>, [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]]<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009), p.20</ref>, [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]]. \n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created. \n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]]. Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion. \n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission\u2019s main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two centres run the Ramakrishna Mission for women, the Matri Bhavan (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Women\u2019s Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. \n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the Sister Nivedita Girls School to the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math\u2019s emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen. \n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973)<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref>.

''TerrorVision'' was made by [[Empire International Pictures]], the production company owned by Charles Band prior to Full Moon, and was released in February 1986.\n\nThe story follows an alien creature sent to Earth, which ends up inside a household where three kids must take care of it to prevent it from going into a hungry rampage.  While not a critical and commercial success, it later developed as a [[cult film]], particularly a \"[[so bad it's good]]\" film.\n\n==Plot==\nOn an alien planet named Pluton, an alien garbage disposal converts a monstrous mutant called a Hungry Beast into energy and beams it into space. Meanwhile, on Earth, the Putterman family is getting satellite television, courtesy of a temperamental [[DIY]] satellite antenna. The reception is poor at first, but suddenly strengthens when a bolt of the alien energy hits the dish.\n\nSherman Putterman and his ex-military, survivalist grandfather set out to enjoy a night of horror films [[Horror host|hosted]] by the buxom Medusa. Meanwhile, Sherman's parents go out to meet some [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]] and his sister Suzy goes out with her rocker boyfriend O.D. Sherman and his grandfather eventually fall asleep, but are awakened when the Hungry Beast materializes out of the TV and eats the grandfather. Sherman's parents later arrive along with swingers Cherry and Spiro. Despite Sherman's plea, his mother locks him in the fallout shelter so he will not ruin their evening.\n\nSherman tries calling the police, but they take him to be a prank caller. He also calls Medusa, but she dismisses him as a psychotic. Later, the Beast travels through the television into the house's sex-themed \"Pleasure Dome\", eats Cherry, and imitates her to lure Spiro. Sherman's parents also get eaten after they discover the remains of the swingers. Sherman uses some [[plastic explosive]] to break out of the bunker as O.D. and his sister arrive.\n\nSherman's sister doesn't believe his story about a monster, and when they check their parents' room, they find imitations of them, their grandfather and the swingers. Soon after though, they encounter the Beast in another room. It chases after them, but relents at the sight of O.D.'s [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] paraphernalia, which he finds appealing due to its resemblance of his caretaker's gloves. They then discover that they can subdue the Beast with food and television, and teach it a few words such as \"TV\", \"music\" and their names. They consider using the Beast for profit, and call Medusa in the hope of securing a TV appearance. She is initially dismissive, but shows interest when they promise to hold a party.\n\nHowever, the Beast becomes enraged and eats O.D. when its alien captor appears on the TV to warn the earthlings that they must destroy their television equipment to prevent the Beast from spreading. A police officer arrives to arrest Sherman for the prank calls only to be eaten by the Beast. Sherman breaks all the TVs he can find, and eventually the Pluton alien captor appears through the television to exterminate the Beast. Medusa arrives at the house and kills the Pluton Alien, mistakenly believing that he is in fact the Beast that Sherman and Suzy have described to her. When the real monster arrives, it sucks the group of three into its mouth with a powerful gust of air.\n\nThe next morning, Medusa's [[chauffeur]] is woken up by a crude imitation of his employer hiding in the back seat of his car, demanding to be taken to the TV station.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chad Allen (actor)|Chad Allen]] as Sherman Putterman\n* [[Diane Franklin]] as Suzy Putterman\n* [[Mary Woronov]] as Raquel Putterman\n* [[Gerrit Graham]] as Stanley Putterman\n* [[Bert Remsen]] as Grampa Putterman\n* [[Jon Gries]] as O.D.\n* Jennifer Richards as Medusa\n* [[Alejandro Rey]] as Spiro\n* Randi Brooks as Cherry\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Hungry Beast Alien (voice)\n* Ian Patrick Williams as Officer Nutky \n* Sonny Carl Davis as Norton\n* William Paulson as Pluthar\n* John Leamer as the Chauffeur\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack to the film was originally released on vinyl by [[Restless Records]] in 1986.

Mike's longtime girlfriend, Sylvia ([[Eva Longoria]]), a young attorney, is \"on the warpath\" over his failure to get a job (his previous job was [[outsourcing|outsourced]]) and she encourages Jim to help Mike hand out resumes.  After being denied a position in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] for failing the psychological profile, Jim gets drunk with Mike.\n\nThe two visit Jim's ex-girlfriend, but when her current boyfriend shows up, a fight ensues in which the boyfriend is backed up by a group of friends. Jim is able to get the upper hand and when Mike produces a gun, they subdue the men and rob them of their possessions, including [[marijuana]] and a [[handgun]] which they later decide to sell. Jim later leaves messages on Mike's answering machine with several different voices, pretending to be companies responding to his resume.\n\nThe next day, Jim goes to visit Mike and finds Sylvia in a good mood due to the fake callbacks. Jim and Mike go to a \"paisa\" bar to try to sell the gun, but leave after their potential buyer is killed. Mike is horrified, but Jim is strangely excited by witnessing death again.\n\nWhen Mike arrives back home drunk, Sylvia is upset, so Mike plays back the [[answering machine]], unaware that his friend didn't hang up early enough and his voice is heard on the tape. Sylvia is enraged and throws Mike out. He stays at Jim's place. Jim gets shortlisted for a position with the [[Department of Homeland Security]], but, after cheating to pass a [[urine test]], he fails a [[polygraph]] test due to a question about his drug use. The only hope left for him is a government agent working out of [[Colombia]], who appreciates Jim's ability to \"get things done\"; Jim eventually accepts the position but is warned that he must not marry a foreigner. Jim is told to report to [[FLETC]] in a few days. Meanwhile, Mike gets a job with a company managed by an old friend.\n\nMike goes to visit Sylvia and tells her that he has a job for real. She calms down and the two make love. Impatient, Jim goes inside and tells Sylvia that Mike is coming to Mexico with him for the weekend, as it is their last chance to hang out. Sylvia is angry and against the idea, but Mike decides to go with Jim and Marta to Mexico.\n\nIn Mexico, the trio attend a big party where Marta reveals she is pregnant, and Jim responds violently, threatening to punch her in the stomach and shoot her in the head.\n\nOn the way back, Jim reveals that he is transporting 20 kilos of marijuana. When Mike protests, Jim pulls a gun on him, flashing back, before breaking down in tears, horrified at what he is becoming. Mike, filled with pity for his friend, agrees to accompany Jim to the deal. When they arrive, they realize one of the buyers was the same man they had earlier robbed and beaten, the boyfriend of Jim's old flame.\n\nHostility ensues with both Jim and the other gang members pulling out guns, resulting in the other man's death. The other members of the buying party plead for their lives, but Jim kills them while suffering flashbacks. While Jim and Mike are escaping in the car, a man comes from the house and shoots at the car with an [[Armsel Striker]]; Jim is hit in the back and face and subsequently [[paralysis|paralyzed]].\n\nHe urges Mike to \"step up\" and shoot him, thus ending his suffering. After some hesitation, Mike and Jim say their goodbyes and Mike ends up killing Jim. The film ends with Mike returning to Sylvia. They embrace together as Mike breaks down crying.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Jim Davis\n* [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]] as Mike Alonzo\n* [[Eva Longoria]] as Sylvia\n* [[Tammy Trull]] as Marta\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Darrell\n* Samantha Esteban as Letty\n* Tania Verafield as Patty\n* [[Noel Gugliemi]] as Flaco\n* Chaka Forman as Toussant\n* Adriana Millan as Rita\n* C\u00e9sar Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez as Listo\n* Blue Mesquita as Leo\n* [[Craig Ricci Shaynak]] as Gillespie\n* Michael Monks as Agent Hollenbreck\n* [[J.K.

The film stars [[Christian Bale]] and [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]], and was written and directed by [[David Ayer]], who wrote the script for the [[Academy Award]]-winning 2001 film ''[[Training Day]]''. The film was distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and Bauer Martinez Entertainment. Ayer says that the film's characters are largely based on the people he knew when he lived in South Central.\n\n==Plot==\nJim Davis ([[Christian Bale]]) is a former [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Ranger]] who suffers from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Jim has a Mexican girlfriend, Marta ([[Tammy Trull]]), whom he is determined to marry and bring into the United States to start a life together. With this in mind, Jim returns to [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]].\n\nIn Los Angeles, Jim meets up with his best friend Mike Alonzo ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]). Mike's longtime girlfriend, Sylvia ([[Eva Longoria]]), a young attorney, is \"on the warpath\" over his failure to get a job (his previous job was [[outsourcing|outsourced]]) and she encourages Jim to help Mike hand out resumes.

He was one of the founding members of the band [[The Gun Club (band)|The Gun Club]], and also released material as a solo artist.\n\n==Biography==\n===1970s===\nJeffrey Lee Pierce was born June 27, 1958 in Montebello, California. As a teenager, Pierce moved from El Monte, a working-class industrial suburb east of Los Angeles, to Granada Hills, at the time a white working- and middle-class suburb in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Pierce attended Granada Hills High School, where he participated in the drama program, acting in plays and writing several of his own brief experimental theater pieces. Pierce started learning guitar at age 10.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography |url=http://www.jeffreyleepierce.com/Site/Biography.html |website=Jeffreyleepierce.com |accessdate=15 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nPierce's early musical interests were towards glam and progressive rock, particularly bands such as [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], and [[Roxy Music]]. During the mid-70s, after attending a concert by [[Bob Marley]], Pierce became deeply engrossed in [[reggae]], being as much fascinated by Marley's shamanistic presence as by his music. He later traveled to Jamaica, meeting with Winston Rodney aka [[Burning Spear]] and others, but also \u201cgot beat up there too\u201d as Pierce recalled in an interview.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sylviesimmons.com/jeffrey-lee-piece/|title=Jeffrey Lee Pierce|website=Sylviesimmons.com|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> He returned feeling unsure about the future role of reggae in US music. Pierce was also very taken with [[Debbie Harry]], becoming President of the West Coast Blondie fan club and bleaching his hair like hers. His infatuation with reggae overlapped with the emergence of punk rock and Pierce became a fixture on the Hollywood scene as a contributor to ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'' fanzine, writing not only on the obvious contemporary punk phase but also about 1930's blues, 1950's rockabilly and a reggae section under the name 'Ranking Jeffrey Lea', securing an interview with Bob Marley. By the late '70s Pierce was himself playing as a musician. He later quipped he had the idea that being in a band was a way to get free drinks bought for him by music business reps. Around this time Pierce met L.A. musician Phast Phreddie Patterson, whose vast record collection and knowledge of American roots music added to the eager Pierce's musical education. While his later interest in American blues was presaged by his devotion to reggae, his love for the more theatrical, complex sounds of glam and prog. rock showed up in his support for the [[No Wave]] movement in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|title=PREACHIN' THE BLUES|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/gunclub.html|work=Perfect Sound Forever|publisher=Perfect Sound Forever|accessdate=May 7, 2012|author=Stevo Olende|date=January 2002}}</ref>\n\nPierce was disappointed by the swift decline of punk rock into strict formality, and also began to feel that his beloved Reggae was ultimately an import; seeking music with the authenticity and simplicity of Reggae but more deeply rooted in his own American history and culture, he became influenced and inspired by the [[Delta blues]], developing extensive knowledge of the genre. Throughout his career Pierce was supportive and encouraging of unique talent, and he encouraged Powers to play guitar and develop his own unique sound and style, recruiting him to form the band Creeping Ritual. Creeping Ritual eventually evolved into the Gun Club, with the addition of drummer Terry Graham and guitarist Rob Ritter.\n\nIn the early stages of his career, Pierce was supported by longtime friend [[Debbie Harry]] of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], who was convinced of his potential as a musician and artist. He originally met Harry, as well as [[Chris Stein]] (also of Blondie), through his position as the president of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s U.S. fan club.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===1980s===\nThe Gun Club's debut album, ''[[Fire of Love]]'' featured the songs \"Sex Beat\" and \"She's Like Heroin to Me\". The Gun Club applied a southern-swamp inspired voodoo sensibility and a punk wildness to their fundamentally bluesy style, derived from one- and two-chord Delta blues artists, such as [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Charley Patton]] and [[Son House]].<ref>{{cite web|title=For the Love of Jeffrey|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/gunclubfireoflove.html|work=PERFECT SOUND FOREVER|publisher=PERFECT SOUND FOREVER|accessdate=May 7, 2012|author=Jay Hinman|format=Article|date=January 2002}}</ref> The album contains a version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Preachin' Blues\" and the love song \"Promise Me\". In July 2014, Australian musician Spencer P. Jones explained that the blues influence in Pierce's music was largely the result of the songwriter's access to the record collection of [[Canned Heat]] frontman [[Bob Hite]]: \"Jeffrey was really lucky he met Bob Hite from Canned Heat before Bob died ... He was allowed to come over and pick out ten albums from Bob Hite's massive blues record collection when he was dying.\"<ref name=\"Leng\" />\n\nThe follow-up album, ''[[Miami (Gun Club album)|Miami]]'', was produced by Stein,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Gun Club Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-gun-club-p4414/biography|work=All Music|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=May 7, 2012|author=Denise Sullivan|format=Article}}</ref> and features renditions of \"Devil in the Woods,\" \"Sleeping in Blood City\" and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s \"Run Through the Jungle.\" Bored of interviewers and critics, who seemed only to want a replication of the debut album, Pierce stated that he preferred ''Miami'' and dismissed ''Fire of Love'': \"I can't even remember making it. What can you say about a record that you cut for 2500 bucks in 48 hours, on speed? It was just punk rock.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/111704-jack-on-fire-jeffrey-lee-pierce-19581996-2496085263.html?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2?rebelltitem=2|title=Returning to the supposedly troublesome 'Miami'|date=September 22, 2009|website=PopMatters.com}}</ref>\n\nSeptember 1983, as The Gun Club prepared for their first (and only) Australian tour, two band members quit at Los Angeles airport before departure, due to financial concerns over payment and ongoing exasperation with Pierce's mercurial behavior.

The period from 1982 to 1984 were characterized by shifting line-up changes, with various band members testifying that Pierce's unpredictable personality and excessive drug use made him difficult to work with.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn 1985 Pierce lived in London, United Kingdom (U.K.), where he recorded a solo album named ''Wildweed''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wildweed/id499785200 |title=iTunes \u2013 Music \u2013 Wildweed by Jeffrey Lee Pierce |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=June 27, 1958 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref> The album contained the love song \"From Temptation to You\".\n\nA reformed Gun Club then recorded 1987's ''Mother Juno'', produced by the Cocteau Twin's [[Robin Guthrie]] that featured songs such as \"Thunderhead\" and \"Araby\" and The Breaking Hands. Pierce later said in relation to the album: \"We envisioned an album that sounded like ocean waves.\"\n\n===1990s===\nPierce's autobiography, ''Go Tell The Mountain'', goes into some detail about the personal turmoil he experienced during the late 1980s and early 1990s. His health had been poor for some time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The final Gun Club album, 1993's ''Lucky Jim'', includes the song \"Idiot Waltz\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Gun-Club-Lucky-Jim/master/26371 |title=Gun Club, The \u2013 Lucky Jim at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref> Another album from that period is ''Ramblin' Jeffrey Lee and Cypress Grove with Willie Love''; the recording mainly consists of cover versions of blues artists such as [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], and [[Skip James]].\n\nIn late 1993 Pierce spent time with [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] during the recording period of the Bad Seeds' album ''[[Let Love In (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album)|Let Love In]]''. [[Mick Harvey]], a former Bad Seeds member, recalled, \"He was sat on the couch during much of the recording ... He'd come almost every day and just sit on the couch and then he'd come out to dinner with us and just mumble away. He was very hard work. He was very unusual and a very unique guy.\" \nIn May 1994, Pierce joined the band on-stage during the \"Let Love In\" European tour <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds/1994/muziekcentrum-vredenburg-utrecht-netherlands-bd8e11e.html|title=Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds Setlist at Muziekcentrum Vredenburg, Utrecht|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref> culminating in the UK at Shepherds Bush Empire, to singing a cover of the Johnny cash / Bob Dylan song \"Wanted Man\".

The hospital turned him away saying, there's nothing we can do for him, his liver's shut down, he's dying. After this, I get a call from him; he was up in Utah and he sounded normal.

But Jeffrey did make efforts to stay on top of all that sort of stuff. But I think it was very difficult for him ... Jeffrey very often didn\u2019t make sense. That was part of his charm. Jeffrey was full of digressions. I think that was very much part of his character. Jeffrey digressed a lot.

Guitarist, bass player and photographer Romi Mori was Pierce's longest romantic partner and a member of the second incarnation of his band The Gun Club, making a significant musical contribution to the band's sound. Perhaps the longest lasting influence on Pierce was Debbie Harry, lead singer of the band Blondie, for whom he had a strong admiration. Pierce was president of the Blondie fan club, and often professed his admiration for her. Harry contributed backing vocals on the album ''Miami'' under the pseudonym D.H. Lawrence, and was a longtime mentor and supporter of Pierce. Texacala Jones noted that Pierce used to carry a handwritten note from Harry in his wallet that had instructions on how she dyed her hair, including the types of products she used. According to Jones, the note was \"written out in beautiful handwriting and 'with love, Debbie' at the bottom\" and was Pierce's \"most prized possession\".<ref name=\"Leng\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{The Gun Club}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pierce, Jeffrey Lee}}\n[[Category:1958 births]]\n[[Category:1996 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from El Monte, California]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American punk rock musicians]]\n[[Category:American indie rock musicians]]\n[[Category:American musicians of Mexican descent]]\n[[Category:Punk blues musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:People from Granada Hills, Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n[[Category:Hispanic and Latino American musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Montebello, California]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2016}}\n\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| honorific-prefix    =\n| name                =Jeffrey Lee Pierce\n| image       =Jeffrey Lee Pierce cropped.jpg\n| caption          = Pierce, seen performing live with [[The Gun Club]] in 1985.\n| birth_date       ={{birth date|1958|6|27}}\n| birth_place      = [[Montebello, California]], U.S.\n| death_date       ={{death date and age|1996|3|31|1958|6|27}}\n| death_place      = [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, U.S.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/02/arts/jeffrey-lee-pierce-rock-musician-37.html |title=Jeffrey Lee Pierce, Rock Musician, 37 \u2013 New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=April 2, 1996 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Pierre Perrone |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-jeffrey-lee-pierce-1304132.html |title=Obituary: Jeffrey Lee Pierce \u2013 People \u2013 News |publisher=The Independent |date=April 10, 1996 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Jeffrey Lee Pierce''' (June 27, 1958 \u2013 March 31, 1996) was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist and author. He was one of the founding members of the band [[The Gun Club (band)|The Gun Club]], and also released material as a solo artist.\n\n==Biography==\n===1970s===\nJeffrey Lee Pierce was born June 27, 1958 in Montebello, California. As a teenager, Pierce moved from El Monte, a working-class industrial suburb east of Los Angeles, to Granada Hills, at the time a white working- and middle-class suburb in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Pierce attended Granada Hills High School, where he participated in the drama program, acting in plays and writing several of his own brief experimental theater pieces. Pierce started learning guitar at age 10.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography |url=http://www.jeffreyleepierce.com/Site/Biography.html |website=Jeffreyleepierce.com |accessdate=15 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nPierce's early musical interests were towards glam and progressive rock, particularly bands such as [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], and [[Roxy Music]]. During the mid-70s, after attending a concert by [[Bob Marley]], Pierce became deeply engrossed in [[reggae]], being as much fascinated by Marley's shamanistic presence as by his music. He later traveled to Jamaica, meeting with Winston Rodney aka [[Burning Spear]] and others, but also \u201cgot beat up there too\u201d as Pierce recalled in an interview.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sylviesimmons.com/jeffrey-lee-piece/|title=Jeffrey Lee Pierce|website=Sylviesimmons.com|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> He returned feeling unsure about the future role of reggae in US music. Pierce was also very taken with [[Debbie Harry]], becoming President of the West Coast Blondie fan club and bleaching his hair like hers. His infatuation with reggae overlapped with the emergence of punk rock and Pierce became a fixture on the Hollywood scene as a contributor to ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'' fanzine, writing not only on the obvious contemporary punk phase but also about 1930's blues, 1950's rockabilly and a reggae section under the name 'Ranking Jeffrey Lea', securing an interview with Bob Marley. By the late '70s Pierce was himself playing as a musician. He later quipped he had the idea that being in a band was a way to get free drinks bought for him by music business reps. Around this time Pierce met L.A. musician Phast Phreddie Patterson, whose vast record collection and knowledge of American roots music added to the eager Pierce's musical education. While his later interest in American blues was presaged by his devotion to reggae, his love for the more theatrical, complex sounds of glam and prog. rock showed up in his support for the [[No Wave]] movement in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|title=PREACHIN' THE BLUES|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/gunclub.html|work=Perfect Sound Forever|publisher=Perfect Sound Forever|accessdate=May 7, 2012|author=Stevo Olende|date=January 2002}}</ref>\n\nPierce found himself disappointed by the swift decline of punk rock into strict formality, and his sense that reggae was ultimately a foreign import. Seeking music with the authenticity and simplicity of reggae but more deeply rooted in American history and culture, he became influenced and inspired by the [[Delta blues]], developing extensive knowledge of the genre. Throughout his career Pierce was supportive and encouraging of unique talent, and he encouraged Powers to play guitar and develop his own unique sound and style, recruiting him to form the band Creeping Ritual. Creeping Ritual eventually evolved into the Gun Club, with the addition of drummer Terry Graham and guitarist Rob Ritter.\n\nIn the early stages of his career, Pierce was supported by longtime friend [[Debbie Harry]] of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], who was convinced of his potential as a musician and artist. He originally met Harry, as well as [[Chris Stein]] (also of Blondie), through his position as the president of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s U.S. fan club.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===1980s===\nThe Gun Club's debut album, ''[[Fire of Love]]'' featured the songs \"Sex Beat\" and \"She's Like Heroin to Me\". The Gun Club applied a southern-swamp inspired voodoo sensibility and a punk wildness to their fundamentally bluesy style, derived from one- and two-chord Delta blues artists, such as [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Charley Patton]] and [[Son House]].<ref>{{cite web|title=For the Love of Jeffrey|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/gunclubfireoflove.html|work=PERFECT SOUND FOREVER|publisher=PERFECT SOUND FOREVER|accessdate=May 7, 2012|author=Jay Hinman|format=Article|date=January 2002}}</ref> The album contains a version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Preachin' Blues\" and the love song \"Promise Me\". In July 2014, Australian musician Spencer P. Jones explained that the blues influence in Pierce's music was largely the result of the songwriter's access to the record collection of [[Canned Heat]] frontman [[Bob Hite]]: \"Jeffrey was really lucky he met Bob Hite from Canned Heat before Bob died ... He was allowed to come over and pick out ten albums from Bob Hite's massive blues record collection when he was dying.\"<ref name=\"Leng\" />\n\nThe follow-up album, ''[[Miami (Gun Club album)|Miami]]'', was produced by Stein,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Gun Club Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-gun-club-p4414/biography|work=All Music|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=May 7, 2012|author=Denise Sullivan|format=Article}}</ref> and features renditions of \"Devil in the Woods,\" \"Sleeping in Blood City\" and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s \"Run Through the Jungle.\" Bored of interviewers and critics, who seemed only to want a replication of the debut album, Pierce stated that he preferred ''Miami'' and dismissed ''Fire of Love'': \"I can't even remember making it. What can you say about a record that you cut for 2500 bucks in 48 hours, on speed? It was just punk rock.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/111704-jack-on-fire-jeffrey-lee-pierce-19581996-2496085263.html?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2?rebelltitem=2|title=Returning to the supposedly troublesome 'Miami'|date=September 22, 2009|website=PopMatters.com}}</ref>\n\nSeptember 1983, as The Gun Club prepared for their first (and only) Australian tour, two band members quit at Los Angeles airport before departure, due to financial concerns over payment and ongoing exasperation with Pierce's mercurial behavior.

The period from 1982 to 1984 were characterized by shifting line-up changes, with various band members testifying that Pierce's unpredictable personality and excessive drug use made him difficult to work with.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn 1985 Pierce lived in London, United Kingdom (U.K.), where he recorded a solo album named ''Wildweed''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wildweed/id499785200 |title=iTunes \u2013 Music \u2013 Wildweed by Jeffrey Lee Pierce |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=June 27, 1958 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref> The album contained the love song \"From Temptation to You\".\n\nA reformed Gun Club then recorded 1987's ''Mother Juno'', produced by the Cocteau Twin's [[Robin Guthrie]] that featured songs such as \"Thunderhead\" and \"Araby\" and The Breaking Hands. Pierce later said in relation to the album: \"We envisioned an album that sounded like ocean waves.\"\n\n===1990s===\nPierce's autobiography, ''Go Tell The Mountain'', goes into some detail about the personal turmoil he experienced during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

[[Mick Harvey]], a former Bad Seeds member, recalled, \"He was sat on the couch during much of the recording ... He'd come almost every day and just sit on the couch and then he'd come out to dinner with us and just mumble away. He was very hard work. He was very unusual and a very unique guy.\" \nIn May 1994, Pierce joined the band on-stage during the \"Let Love In\" European tour <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds/1994/muziekcentrum-vredenburg-utrecht-netherlands-bd8e11e.html|title=Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds Setlist at Muziekcentrum Vredenburg, Utrecht|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref> culminating in the UK at Shepherds Bush Empire, to singing a cover of the Johnny cash / Bob Dylan song \"Wanted Man\".

He seemed in really good health\u2014sometimes he wasn't in such good health, sometimes he could barely walk because he was so fucked up. When he came back from Japan, he left me a couple of messages on my answering machine. He sounded completely out of his mind, though not like he was drunk. It was strange, like he'd gone crazy; finally I got hold of someone, and she told me Jeffrey had come back, that he'd been drinking while he was gone, his liver had poisoned his system, and he was experiencing dementia. The hospital turned him away saying, there's nothing we can do for him, his liver's shut down, he's dying. After this, I get a call from him; he was up in Utah and he sounded normal. And I said, what the hell, man, everyone's saying you're going to die. And he said, they always say that.

His pallor, you know. He was physically suffering. And then he went to Japan. I think he got involved in some kind of relief work ... Helping earthquake victims.

His obsessions crawled all over him. But in Jeffrey\u2019s world, sometimes it was very inspiring and illuminating and other times it was painful and depressing. But Jeffrey did make efforts to stay on top of all that sort of stuff. But I think it was very difficult for him ... Jeffrey very often didn\u2019t make sense. That was part of his charm. Jeffrey was full of digressions. I think that was very much part of his character. Jeffrey digressed a lot. One minute he\u2019d be talking about the fall of Saigon and the next minute he\u2019d be talking about the size of a dinosaur\u2019s brain. But I didn\u2019t care I was just happy somebody was talking to me. You just kind of sat back and nodded and listened ... But Jeffrey, a beautiful thing about Jeffrey was that he was able to move outside that and connect on some other level to people \u2026 I mean, things like with Luke, my kid, and stuff like that. He genuinely cared about other people. He was very genuine. And you know, I loved him very much. And I think he was a great songwriter. And had a great unique voice.

Pierce was always supportive and encouraging of musical aspirations and talents in others, including his romantic partners. One of Pierce's early relationships, singer Texacala Jones, was initially encouraged and supported by Pierce, and together they formed the band Tex and the Horseheads, with Pierce providing arrangements of traditional songs and playing guitar in some of their initial performances. Guitarist, bass player and photographer Romi Mori was Pierce's longest romantic partner and a member of the second incarnation of his band The Gun Club, making a significant musical contribution to the band's sound. Perhaps the longest lasting influence on Pierce was Debbie Harry, lead singer of the band Blondie, for whom he had a strong admiration. Pierce was president of the Blondie fan club, and often professed his admiration for her. Harry contributed backing vocals on the album ''Miami'' under the pseudonym D.H. Lawrence, and was a longtime mentor and supporter of Pierce. Texacala Jones noted that Pierce used to carry a handwritten note from Harry in his wallet that had instructions on how she dyed her hair, including the types of products she used. According to Jones, the note was \"written out in beautiful handwriting and 'with love, Debbie' at the bottom\" and was Pierce's \"most prized possession\".<ref name=\"Leng\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{The Gun Club}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pierce, Jeffrey Lee}}\n[[Category:1958 births]]\n[[Category:1996 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from El Monte, California]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American punk rock musicians]]\n[[Category:American indie rock musicians]]\n[[Category:American musicians of Mexican descent]]\n[[Category:Punk blues musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]\n[[Category:People from Granada Hills, Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:20th-century male singers]]\n[[Category:Hispanic and Latino American musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Montebello, California]]\n", "name_user": "AmyMoosey", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1970s:flow better", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Lee_Pierce"}
