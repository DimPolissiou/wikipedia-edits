She was constructed by [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] at [[Saint-Nazaire]].\n\n''Guichen'' first steamed from Saint-Nazaire to undergo [[sea trials]] out of [[Toulon]]. In September 1903 she carried President [[\u00c9mile Loubet]] to Britain for an official visit. In 1913 she was converted into a [[training ship]] for [[boatswain]]s at [[Brest, France|Brest]]. She was in the [[English Channel|Channel]] at the start of the [[First World War]], but in 1915 she was transferred to the 3rd blockading squadron off [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]]. In September, under Captain Joseph Brisson, she helped evacuate [[Musa Dagh Resistance|Armenian resistors from Musa Dagh]] after one of her crew spotted an Armenian flag flying over the fortress. She conveyed her refugees to [[Port Said]].

In 1919 she was sent to the [[Black Sea]] as part of the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]], where she suffered a mutiny, led by [[Charles Tillon]] (future leader of the [[Communist Party of France]]), on 26 June 1919.<ref>Marcel Monribot, Charles Tillon and Virgile Vuillemin, [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/revhist/backiss/vol8/no2/blacksea.html \"The Black Sea Revolt\"] ''Revolutionary History'' '''8''', 2 (2002), trans. by [[Ian Birchall]], originally published as \"Les mutineries de la Mer Noire 1919\u20131969\" in ''Les Cahiers de Mai'' (1969).</ref> She was retired in 1921, and condemned and sold at Brest in 1922.\n\n==Design==\n\n===Characteristics===\n\n''Guichen'' was {{cvt|133|m|ftin}} [[long between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|16.96|m|ftin}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{cvt|7.49|m|ftin}}.

He is also a guest lecturer and masterclass presenter on sample replay production, sound engineering, DJ culture, sampling and the music industry to [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Master of Arts|MA]] students at [[Leeds Beckett University]], UK. Guest Speaker on panel discussions at the [[New Music Seminar]] in New York, June 2015. His productions have been featured on hits for [[Diplo]], [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[The Prodigy]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[David_Penn_(DJ)|David Penn]], [[Jess Glynne]], [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[CamelPhat]], [[Swedish House Mafia]] and many other notable pop and dance music artists.\n\n== First recordings ==\nStarting his musical career as a London club [[DJ]] at the age of 15 (playing [[disco]]/[[Soul music|soul]]/[[funk]]/[[Electro music|electro]] until a transition to [[house music]] in 1986), Summers became a UK recording artist and studio engineer in 1989 with his involvement on the underground [[Rave music|rave]] track \"Meltdown\" by Quartz. Following a dispute over ownership and royalties of \"Meltdown\" between Summers and the other two Quartz members, Summers decided to release his own first solo work \"Melt Your Body\" - which was moderately based upon \"Meltdown\", made in retaliation by Summers after the dispute. By January 1990, \"Melt Your Body\" had outsold \"Meltdown\" by 3:1, it entered the UK top 100 sales chart, and in recognition of this, Summers was firmly established as a promising new UK dance music producer.\n \t\nDue to big responses from playing his own tracks whilst DJing, Summers signed a two-single deal with Island Records' offshoot urban dance label [[4th & Broadway]], in May 1990. The first single \"Party Children\" just missed the UK top 75,<ref name=\"chartstats\">[https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ Mark Summers] at OfficialCharts.com</ref> whereas the second single \"Summers Magic\" climbed up the UK chart to peak at number 27, in January 1991.<ref name=\"chartstats\" /> \"Summers Magic\" gained instant recognition as the first ever dance track to heavily feature a sample of music from a children's TV theme tune, in this case the BBC's ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]''.\n\nThe hardcore/breakbeat/techno driven kids' TV sampling phenomenon of \"Summers Magic\" seemingly provided inspiration for many other artists, including [[the Prodigy]] (also from East London/Essex), with their first single \"[[Charly (song)|Charly]]\". Before entering the UK national charts, some rave followers believed \"Charly\" was possibly the work of Mark Summers and his follow-up to \"Summers Magic\". The Prodigy's track eventually charted in July 1991, almost 7 months following the ground-breaking \"Summers Magic\". \"Summers Magic\" was later to appear in the opening of the 2013 comedy film, [[The World's End (film)|''The World's End'']] (starring [[Simon Pegg]]), although it does not appear on the soundtrack album. During 1991-93, Summers produced and remixed tracks mainly in the musical styles first labelled as \"[[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]]\" and \"[[Jungle music|jungle]]\", which later morphed itself into the breakbeat-driven music genre now commonly known as \"[[drum and bass]]\".\n\n== Artist productions ==\nMoving on from \"rave\" and revisiting his preferred style of house music, Summers released six singles on the Hoochie Coochie label (1993\u201396) with fellow DJs Ben Howard and Dave Malone. During this time, he was hired as a sound engineer to work in the studios of Air Lyndhurst/Chrysalis Music (now [[Air Studios]]), co-owned by Beatles producer [[Sir George Martin]]. Summers became the head studio producer within less than 3 months. He went on to produce and remix Chrysalis Music artists, and also for the offshoot dance label Tuch Wood/Tuchwood Records, co-owned by DJ-producer Dave Lee ([[Joey Negro]]). By the end of 1995, Summers had gained an immense sound production status to add to his post-DJ and dance artist qualifications, including recording and production work with notable artists such as [[Malcolm McLaren]], [[Mica Paris]], [[Jocelyn Brown]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Ashley Beedle]], [[X-Press 2]], [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]] and [[Kylie Minogue]], amongst many others. Summers worked within various (mainly dance) music styles and genres, from [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] to house, [[Trance music|trance]] to drum and bass and even pop and rock, using his extensive DJ experience as the basis for his knowledge and technical skills acquired from Air Studios in different types of music production.\n\n== Scorccio Records ==\nFully inspired by 1970s disco, '80s hip hop and '90s house music, in 1996 Mark Summers launched his own label, Scorccio Records (pronounced \"scor-chee-oh\"), with releases that combined elements of those three music genres from the past three decades. The first release was the disco rapped \"Inferno\" - under Mark's pseudonym [[Souvlaki]]. \"Inferno\" reached top 20 in the UK national chart via the [[PolyGram]] offshoot label Wonderboy (coincidentally, it was also their 1st single release), and \"Inferno\" also appeared on the 1.5 million selling [[Ministry of Sound]] ''Annual 2'' album mixed by [[Boy George]], becoming a worldwide hit via international licensing. Using the label credit of \"Scorccio Remix\", the mixing skills and popularity of the \"fired-up sound\" Mark Summers produced instantly pushed [[JT Playaz]] to a UK number 1 dance chart position with \"Just Playin\", and the follow-up \"Let's Get Down\". Major label remix work followed, including remixes for [[Perfecto Records|Perfecto]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[EMI]], [[Telstar]] and [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]. Success from the release of over 40 Scorccio tracks and remixes on various dance compilations and singles created a huge fan base for Scorccio, most notably in Japan. Key to success was Mark Summers using up to 10 different pseudonyms for his artist name, one of the most popular and often used being Ultimate Heights. [[Sony PlayStation 2]] and [[Konami]] have tracks and remixes by Scorccio featured on their popular ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' (DDR) console and arcade series of music video games. ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Extreme (2004 video game)|Dance Dance Revolution Extreme]]'' featuring \"Highs Off U\" by 4 REEEL (produced and mixed by Summers), was the winner of the [[Video Music Awards]] in 2005 on [[MTV]] for * [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video Game Soundtrack|Best Video Game Soundtrack]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/v/news_feature_vma_noms05/vma05list_flat.jhtml \n |title=2005 MTV Video Music Awards Nominees \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926191951/http://www.mtv.com/bands/v/news_feature_vma_noms05/vma05list_flat.jhtml \n |archivedate=2015-09-26 \n}}</ref>\n\n== Sample replays ==\nThe Scorccio release of \"Inferno\" in July 1996 originally featured a sample of [[Dan Hartman|Dan Hartman's]] \"Relight My Fire\", which Summers was told by PolyGram (prior to their release) that the sample either had to be replayed, or that he should pay for the mechanical sample clearance ($15,000 USD). Avoiding financial loss, Summers decided to replay the sample, the first time he had ever undertaken such a challenge. Summers was determined to make the sample replay as close sounding as possible, and upon first hearing the replayed version PolyGram/Wonderboy believed Summers had simply re-EQ'd the original sample, until he played them all the separate stem parts to prove it had been fully recreated (including a 4 piece string section overdubbed numerous times). Since then, every Scorccio-related release has had replayed and/or revocalled samples.\n\nQuickly establishing the world's first ever sample replay service, in 1996 Mark Summers took his venture into the next stage by working for a large number of major and independent music labels, DJs, producers and recording artists. [[Ministry of Sound]], [[Defected]], [[Positiva]], Universal, [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], [[Sony-BMG]] (amongst others), soon became regular clients of Scorccio sample replays. In 2004, Positiva released \"[[Lola's Theme]]\" by [[the Shapeshifters]], which featured a Scorccio replay of Johnnie Taylor's \"What About My Love\". The song went from being hugely popular in clubs to gaining a #1 national chart position in the UK, Italy and Germany, followed by a #1 spot on the U.S. Hot Airplay Charts. The following year (2005) saw Michael Gray's \"[[The Weekend (Michael Gray song)|The Weekend]]\" reach #7 in the UK and #1 in Italy, featuring distinctive keyboard riffs played by Summers (initially based upon a re-edited 1980s electro track). Other notable replays have included: \"People Hold On\", \"Blue Monday\", \"Love to Love You Baby\", \"Love Sensation\", and \"One More Time\".\n\nIn 2009, Summers replayed \"Street Player\" (originally by [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]) for the U.S. ''Billboard'' #2 hit \"[[I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)]]\" by [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. The Scorccio replay of \"Street Player\" has since become the most successful usage of any sample replay in history, due to the number of sales and media plays of the Pitbull song worldwide. With over 400 million hits to date on [[YouTube]], the song is now ranked as the third most viewed electronic dance music video in history.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Another successful sample recreation in September 2010 was produced by Summers for the U.S. Hot Dance 100 #1 artist Duck Sauce, with \"[[Barbra Streisand (song)|Barbra Streisand]]\" featuring a Scorccio sample replay of the 1979 [[Boney M]] song \"[[El Lute / Gotta Go Home|Gotta Go Home]]\". The song reached #1 in dance charts worldwide.\n\nSummers replayed four samples on the album ''[[The Day Is My Enemy]]'' by English [[electronic music]] group [[the Prodigy]], two decades after both Summers and the Prodigy had first appeared on the UK rave scene. The album was released on 30 March 2015 and immediately charted at number one in the UK, officially certified by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] with a Gold disc for sales in excess of 200,000 copies. It was released by Three Six Zero Music/[[Warner Bros.

The original recording is a track from ''[[The Wiz (soundtrack)|The Wiz]]'' (1978), produced by [[Quincy Jones]] and featuring the vocals of both [[Diana Ross]] and [[Michael Jackson]].\n\nBy September 2019 Mark Summers had produced over 2,000 sample replays for Scorccio, and during that same year 4 tracks featuring his production works had reached number 1 on [[Beatport|Beatport's]] Top 100 chart; [[Fatboy Slim]] \"[[Praise You]]\" (Purple Disco Machine Remix), Roberto Surace [[Joys (song)|\"Joys\"]], Matt Sassari \"Put A Record On\" and Martin Ikin \"Hooked\". \n\nDue to his vast number of successful productions spanning over 25 years, Summers is now widely recognised by the music industry as one of the most prolific and most important contributors to dance music throughout the World.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n*2000: ''Number One'' - Billie Godfrey (JVC, Japan)\n*2001: ''Scorccio Super Hit Mix'' (Toshiba-EMI, Japan)\n*2003: ''Exotica - Chill-Out Paradise Vol. 1'' (Scorccio)\n*2008: ''Dreamy'' - Dreemtime (Dreemtime)\n\n===Singles===\n*1989: \"Melt Your Body\" - Mark Summers : (SMR / Hillbilly House, U.S.)\n*1990: \"Party Children / Wicked in Mombassa\" - Mark Summers : (4th & Broadway)\n*1990: \"Bass / Confused About?\" - Next Century : (Next Century)\n*1990: \"The Force\" - 50K : (white label)\n*1991: \"Summers Magic\" - Mark Summers : (4th & Broadway)\n*1991: \"Don't Cha Know\" - Niteflyte : (Desire)\n*1993: ''Overdubb EP'' - Unit-E : (Contagious)\n*1993: \"Eruption / Ruffplate\" - Overdubb : (Impact)\n*1993: \"Take Control\" - Interface : (Tuch Wood Records TUCW008)\n** A Wood Side 1.

He is also a guest lecturer and masterclass presenter on sample replay production, sound engineering, DJ culture, sampling and the music industry to [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Master of Arts|MA]] students at [[Leeds Beckett University]], UK. Guest Speaker on panel discussions at the [[New Music Seminar]] in New York, June 2015. His productions have been featured on hits for [[Diplo]], [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[The Prodigy]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[David_Penn_(DJ)|David Penn]], [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]], [[Steve Aoki]], [[CamelPhat]], [[Swedish House Mafia]] and many other notable pop and dance music artists.\n\n== First recordings ==\nStarting his musical career as a London club [[DJ]] at the age of 15 (playing [[disco]]/[[Soul music|soul]]/[[funk]]/[[Electro music|electro]] until a transition to [[house music]] in 1986), Summers became a UK recording artist and studio engineer in 1989 with his involvement on the underground [[Rave music|rave]] track \"Meltdown\" by Quartz. Following a dispute over ownership and royalties of \"Meltdown\" between Summers and the other two Quartz members, Summers decided to release his own first solo work \"Melt Your Body\" - which was moderately based upon \"Meltdown\", made in retaliation by Summers after the dispute. By January 1990, \"Melt Your Body\" had outsold \"Meltdown\" by 3:1, it entered the UK top 100 sales chart, and in recognition of this, Summers was firmly established as a promising new UK dance music producer.\n \t\nDue to big responses from playing his own tracks whilst DJing, Summers signed a two-single deal with Island Records' offshoot urban dance label [[4th & Broadway]], in May 1990. The first single \"Party Children\" just missed the UK top 75,<ref name=\"chartstats\">[https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ Mark Summers] at OfficialCharts.com</ref> whereas the second single \"Summers Magic\" climbed up the UK chart to peak at number 27, in January 1991.<ref name=\"chartstats\" /> \"Summers Magic\" gained instant recognition as the first ever dance track to heavily feature a sample of music from a children's TV theme tune, in this case the BBC's ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]''.\n\nThe hardcore/breakbeat/techno driven kids' TV sampling phenomenon of \"Summers Magic\" seemingly provided inspiration for many other artists, including [[the Prodigy]] (also from East London/Essex), with their first single \"[[Charly (song)|Charly]]\". Before entering the UK national charts, some rave followers believed \"Charly\" was possibly the work of Mark Summers and his follow-up to \"Summers Magic\". The Prodigy's track eventually charted in July 1991, almost 7 months following the ground-breaking \"Summers Magic\". \"Summers Magic\" was later to appear in the opening of the 2013 comedy film, [[The World's End (film)|''The World's End'']] (starring [[Simon Pegg]]), although it does not appear on the soundtrack album. During 1991-93, Summers produced and remixed tracks mainly in the musical styles first labelled as \"[[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]]\" and \"[[Jungle music|jungle]]\", which later morphed itself into the breakbeat-driven music genre now commonly known as \"[[drum and bass]]\".\n\n== Artist productions ==\nMoving on from \"rave\" and revisiting his preferred style of house music, Summers released six singles on the Hoochie Coochie label (1993\u201396) with fellow DJs Ben Howard and Dave Malone. During this time, he was hired as a sound engineer to work in the studios of Air Lyndhurst/Chrysalis Music (now [[Air Studios]]), co-owned by Beatles producer [[Sir George Martin]]. Summers became the head studio producer within less than 3 months. He went on to produce and remix Chrysalis Music artists, and also for the offshoot dance label Tuch Wood/Tuchwood Records, co-owned by DJ-producer Dave Lee ([[Joey Negro]]). By the end of 1995, Summers had gained an immense sound production status to add to his post-DJ and dance artist qualifications, including recording and production work with notable artists such as [[Malcolm McLaren]], [[Mica Paris]], [[Jocelyn Brown]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Ashley Beedle]], [[X-Press 2]], [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]] and [[Kylie Minogue]], amongst many others. Summers worked within various (mainly dance) music styles and genres, from [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] to house, [[Trance music|trance]] to drum and bass and even pop and rock, using his extensive DJ experience as the basis for his knowledge and technical skills acquired from Air Studios in different types of music production.\n\n== Scorccio Records ==\nFully inspired by 1970s disco, '80s hip hop and '90s house music, in 1996 Mark Summers launched his own label, Scorccio Records (pronounced \"scor-chee-oh\"), with releases that combined elements of those three music genres from the past three decades. The first release was the disco rapped \"Inferno\" - under Mark's pseudonym [[Souvlaki]]. \"Inferno\" reached top 20 in the UK national chart via the [[PolyGram]] offshoot label Wonderboy (coincidentally, it was also their 1st single release), and \"Inferno\" also appeared on the 1.5 million selling [[Ministry of Sound]] ''Annual 2'' album mixed by [[Boy George]], becoming a worldwide hit via international licensing. Using the label credit of \"Scorccio Remix\", the mixing skills and popularity of the \"fired-up sound\" Mark Summers produced instantly pushed [[JT Playaz]] to a UK number 1 dance chart position with \"Just Playin\", and the follow-up \"Let's Get Down\". Major label remix work followed, including remixes for [[Perfecto Records|Perfecto]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[EMI]], [[Telstar]] and [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]. Success from the release of over 40 Scorccio tracks and remixes on various dance compilations and singles created a huge fan base for Scorccio, most notably in Japan. Key to success was Mark Summers using up to 10 different pseudonyms for his artist name, one of the most popular and often used being Ultimate Heights. [[Sony PlayStation 2]] and [[Konami]] have tracks and remixes by Scorccio featured on their popular ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' (DDR) console and arcade series of music video games. ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Extreme (2004 video game)|Dance Dance Revolution Extreme]]'' featuring \"Highs Off U\" by 4 REEEL (produced and mixed by Summers), was the winner of the [[Video Music Awards]] in 2005 on [[MTV]] for * [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video Game Soundtrack|Best Video Game Soundtrack]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/v/news_feature_vma_noms05/vma05list_flat.jhtml \n |title=2005 MTV Video Music Awards Nominees \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926191951/http://www.mtv.com/bands/v/news_feature_vma_noms05/vma05list_flat.jhtml \n |archivedate=2015-09-26 \n}}</ref>\n\n== Sample replays ==\nThe Scorccio release of \"Inferno\" in July 1996 originally featured a sample of [[Dan Hartman|Dan Hartman's]] \"Relight My Fire\", which Summers was told by PolyGram (prior to their release) that the sample either had to be replayed, or that he should pay for the mechanical sample clearance ($15,000 USD). Avoiding financial loss, Summers decided to replay the sample, the first time he had ever undertaken such a challenge. Summers was determined to make the sample replay as close sounding as possible, and upon first hearing the replayed version PolyGram/Wonderboy believed Summers had simply re-EQ'd the original sample, until he played them all the separate stem parts to prove it had been fully recreated (including a 4 piece string section overdubbed numerous times). Since then, every Scorccio-related release has had replayed and/or revocalled samples.\n\nQuickly establishing the world's first ever sample replay service, in 1996 Mark Summers took his venture into the next stage by working for a large number of major and independent music labels, DJs, producers and recording artists. [[Ministry of Sound]], [[Defected]], [[Positiva]], Universal, [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], [[Sony-BMG]] (amongst others), soon became regular clients of Scorccio sample replays. In 2004, Positiva released \"[[Lola's Theme]]\" by [[the Shapeshifters]], which featured a Scorccio replay of Johnnie Taylor's \"What About My Love\". The song went from being hugely popular in clubs to gaining a #1 national chart position in the UK, Italy and Germany, followed by a #1 spot on the U.S. Hot Airplay Charts. The following year (2005) saw Michael Gray's \"[[The Weekend (Michael Gray song)|The Weekend]]\" reach #7 in the UK and #1 in Italy, featuring distinctive keyboard riffs played by Summers (initially based upon a re-edited 1980s electro track). Other notable replays have included: \"People Hold On\", \"Blue Monday\", \"Love to Love You Baby\", \"Love Sensation\", and \"One More Time\".\n\nIn 2009, Summers replayed \"Street Player\" (originally by [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]) for the U.S. ''Billboard'' #2 hit \"[[I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)]]\" by [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. The Scorccio replay of \"Street Player\" has since become the most successful usage of any sample replay in history, due to the number of sales and media plays of the Pitbull song worldwide. With over 400 million hits to date on [[YouTube]], the song is now ranked as the third most viewed electronic dance music video in history.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Another successful sample recreation in September 2010 was produced by Summers for the U.S. Hot Dance 100 #1 artist Duck Sauce, with \"[[Barbra Streisand (song)|Barbra Streisand]]\" featuring a Scorccio sample replay of the 1979 [[Boney M]] song \"[[El Lute / Gotta Go Home|Gotta Go Home]]\". The song reached #1 in dance charts worldwide.\n\nSummers replayed four samples on the album ''[[The Day Is My Enemy]]'' by English [[electronic music]] group [[the Prodigy]], two decades after both Summers and the Prodigy had first appeared on the UK rave scene. The album was released on 30 March 2015 and immediately charted at number one in the UK, officially certified by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] with a Gold disc for sales in excess of 200,000 copies. It was released by Three Six Zero Music/[[Warner Bros.

Taiko continue to be used in the religious music of [[Buddhism]] and [[Shint\u014d]].  In the past players were holy men, who played only at special occasions and in small groups, but in time secular men (rarely women) also played the taiko in semi-religious festivals such as the [[bon dance]].\n\nModern ensemble taiko is said{{by whom?|date=February 2020}} to have been invented by [[Daihachi Oguchi]] in 1951.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.hiryu-project.com/daihachi.html |title= Archived copy |access-date= 2016-05-08 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160722054923/http://www.hiryu-project.com/daihachi.html |archive-date= 2016-07-22 |url-status= live }}</ref>  A [[jazz]] drummer, Oguchi incorporated his musical background into large ensembles, which he had also designed.  His energetic style made his group popular throughout Japan, and made the [[Hokuriku region]] a center for taiko music.  Musical groups to arise from this wave of popularity included [[Oedo Sukeroku Daiko]], with [[Seido Kobayashi]].  1969 saw a group called [[Ondekoza |Za Ondekoza]] founded by Tagayasu Den; Za Ondekoza gathered together young performers who innovated a new [[roots revival]] version of taiko, which was used as a way of life in communal [[lifestyle (disambiguation) | lifestyle]]s.  During the 1970s the Japanese government allocated funds to preserve Japanese culture, and many community taiko groups formed.  Later in the century, taiko groups spread across the world, especially to the [[United States]]. The [[video game]] ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'' is based around taiko. One example of a modern Taiko band is [[Gocoo]] (founded in 1997).\n\n===Min'y\u014d folk music===\n\n[[File:Geishashamisen053.jpg |thumb|left|A Japanese folkswoman with her [[shamisen]], 1904]]\n\n{{main|Min'y\u014d}}\nJapanese folk songs (''min'y\u014d'') can be grouped and classified in many ways but it is often convenient to think of four main categories:\n \n* [[work song]]s\n* religious songs (such as [[sato kagura]], a form of [[Shintoist]] music)\n* songs used for gatherings such as weddings, funerals, and festivals ([[matsuri]], especially [[Obon]])\n* children's songs ([[warabe uta]])\n\nIn [[min'y\u014d]], three-stringed [[lute]] known as the [[shamisen]], [[taiko]] drums, and a bamboo flute called [[shakuhachi]] typically accompany the singers.<ref name=\"malm.1963\">{{citation | title = Nagauta: The Heart of Kabuki Music | author = Malm, William P. | place = Westport, Conn. | publisher = Greenwood Press  | date = 1963| hdl = 2027/mdp.39015007996476 }}</ref> Other instruments that could accompany include a transverse flute known as the [[shinobue]], a bell known as [[kane (musical instrument) |kane]], a hand drum called the [[tsuzumi]], and/or a 13-stringed zither known as the [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]]. In [[Okinawa]] the main instrument is the [[sanshin]]. These are traditional Japanese instruments, but modern instrumentation, such as [[electric guitars]] and [[synthesizer]]s, is also used in this day and age, when [[enka]] singers cover traditional [[min'y\u014d]] songs ([[enka]] being a Japanese music genre all its own).<ref name=\"Hughes 2008\">\n{{cite book\n|last= Hughes|first= David W.\n|title= Traditional folk song in modern Japan: sources, sentiment and society\n|year=2008|publisher=Global Oriental Ltd|location= Folkestone, UK\n|isbn= 978-1-905246-65-6\n}}\n</ref>\n\nTerms often heard when speaking about [[min'y\u014d]] are ondo, bushi, bon uta, and [[Lullaby |komori uta]]. An ondo generally describes any folk song with a distinctive swing that may be heard as 2/4 time [[rhythm]] (though performers usually do not group beats). The typical folk song heard at [[Obon]] festival dances will most likely be an ondo. A bushi is a song with a distinctive melody. Its very name, which is pronounced \"bushi\" in compounds, means \"melody\" or \"rhythm\".  The word is rarely used on its own, but is usually prefixed by a term referring to occupation, location, personal name or the like.  Bon uta, as the name describes, are songs for [[Obon]], the lantern festival of the dead. [[Komori uta]] are children's lullabies. The names of min'yo songs often include descriptive term, usually at the end. For example: Tokyo Ondo, Kushimoto Bushi, Hokkai Bon Uta, and Itsuki no Komoriuta.\n\nMany of these songs include extra stress on certain syllables as well as pitched shouts ([[kakegoe]]). Kakegoe are generally shouts of cheer but in [[min'y\u014d]], they are often included as parts of choruses. There are many [[kakegoe]], though they vary from region to region. In [[Okinawa min'y\u014d| Okinawa Min'y\u014d]], for example, one will hear the common \"ha iya sasa!\"  In mainland Japan, however, one will be more likely to hear \"a yoisho!,\" \"sate!,\" or \"a sore!\" Others include \"a donto koi!,\" and \"dokoisho!\"\n\nRecently a [[guild]]-based system known as the [[iemoto]] system has been applied{{by whom?|date=February 2020}} to some forms of min'y\u014d; it is called{{fragment|date=February 2020}}.  This system originally developed for transmitting classical genres such as [[nagauta]], shakuhachi, or koto music, but since it proved profitable to teachers and was supported by students who wished to obtain certificates of proficiency and artist's names continues to spread to genres such as min'y\u014d, [[Tsugaru-jamisen]] and other forms of music that were traditionally transmitted more informally.  Today some min'y\u014d are passed on in such pseudo-family organizations and long [[apprentice]]ships are common.\n\nSee also [[Ainu music]] of north Japan.\n\n===Okinawan folk music===\n\n{{Main|Ryukyuan music}}\n[[Umui]], religious songs, [[shima uta]], dance songs, and, especially [[kach\u0101sh\u012b]], lively celebratory music, were all popular.\n\nOkinawan folk music differs from mainland Japanese folk music in several ways.\n\nFirst, Okinawan folk music is often accompanied by the [[sanshin]], whereas in mainland Japan the [[shamisen]] accompanies instead.  Other Okinawan instruments include the [[Sanba (musical instrument) |sanba]] (which produce a clicking sound similar to that of [[castanets]]), [[taiko]] and a sharp [[Wolf-whistling |finger whistling]] called {{nihongo|''yubi-bue''|\u6307\u7b1b}}.\n\nSecond, tonality. A [[pentatonic scale]], which coincides with the [[major pentatonic scale]] of Western musical disciplines, is often heard in [[min'y\u014d]] from the main islands of Japan, see [[miny\u014d scale]]. In this pentatonic scale the [[subdominant]] and [[leading tone]] (scale degrees 4 and 7 of the Western [[major scale]]) are omitted, resulting in a musical scale with no [[half step]]s between each note. (Do, Re, Mi, So, La in [[solfeggio]], or scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6). Okinawan min'y\u014d, however, is characterized by scales that include the half-steps omitted in the aforementioned pentatonic scale, when analyzed in the Western discipline of music. In fact, the most common scale used in Okinawan min'y\u014d includes scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\n===Traditional instruments===\n{{main|Traditional Japanese musical instruments}}\n* [[Biwa]] (\u7435\u7436)\n* [[Fue]] (\u7b1b)\n* [[Hichiriki]] (\u7bf3\u7be5)\u3000\n* [[Hocchiku]] (\u6cd5\u7af9)\n* [[Hy\u014dshigi]] (\u62cd\u5b50\u6728)\n* [[Kane (instrument)|Kane]] (\u9418)\n* [[Kakko (instrument)|Kakko]] (\u97a8\u9f13)\n* [[Koky\u016b]] (\u80e1\u5f13)\n* [[Koto (instrument)|Koto]] (\u7434)\n* [[Erhu|Niko]] (\u4e8c\u80e1)\n* Okawa (AKA [[\u014ctsuzumi]]) (\u5927\u9f13)\n* [[ryuteki|Ry\u016bteki]] (\u7adc\u7b1b)\n* [[Sanshin]] (\u4e09\u7dda)\n* [[Shakuhachi]] (bamboo flute) (\u5c3a\u516b)\n* [[Shamisen]] (\u4e09\u5473\u7dda)\n* [[Shime-Daiko]] (\u7de0\u592a\u9f13)\n* [[Shinobue]] (\u7be0\u7b1b)\n* [[Sh\u014d (instrument)|Sh\u014d]] (\u7b19)\n* [[Suikinkutsu]] (water zither) (\u6c34\u7434\u7a9f)\n* [[Taiko]] (i.e. [[Wadaiko]]) \u592a\u9f13\uff5e\u548c\u592a\u9f13\n* [[Tsuzumi]] (\u9f13) (AKA Kotsuzumi)\n\n==Arrival of Western music==\n\n===Traditional pop music===\n{{main|Ry\u016bk\u014dka|Kay\u014dkyoku|Enka}}\nAfter the [[Meiji Restoration]] introduced Western musical instruction, a bureaucrat named [[Izawa Shuji]] compiled songs like \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\" and commissioned songs using a [[pentatonic]] melody.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}} Western music, especially military marches, soon became popular in Japan.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}} Two major forms of music that developed during this period were [[shoka (music)|shoka]], which was composed to bring western music to schools, and [[gunka]], which are [[march (music)|military marches]] with some Japanese elements.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}}\n\nAs Japan moved towards representative [[democracy]] in the late 19th century, leaders hired singers to sell copies of songs that aired their messages, since the leaders themselves were usually prohibited from speaking in public.

United's first international performance took place in Los Angeles at the metal festival \"Foundations Forum\" in September 1995 and had few albums released in North America. Formed in the mid 1980s, [[Doom (Japanese band)|Doom]] played a gig in the United States in October 1988 at CBGB, and was active until 2000 when disbanded.\n\nThe first bands to play [[black metal]] music were [[Sabbat (Japanese band)|Sabbat]], who is still active, and [[Bellzlleb]], who was active until the early 1990s. Another notable acts are [[Sigh (band)|Sigh]], [[Abigail(band)|Abigail]], and [[Gallhammer]].\n\n[[Doom metal]] has also gained an audience in Japan. The two best-known Japanese doom metal acts are [[Church of Misery]] and [[Boris (band)|Boris]], both of whom have gained considerable popularity outside the country.\n\n====Metalcore====\nIn the 2000s, Japanese metalcore bands such as Toyko's [[Crystal Lake (band)|Crystal Lake]], Nagoya natives [[Coldrain]] and [[Deathgaze]], Kobe's [[Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas]], and Osaka's [[Crossfaith]] have formed.\n\n===Hip hop===\n{{main|Japanese hip hop}}\nHip-hop is a newer form of music on the Japanese music scene.  Many felt it was a trend that would immediately pass.  However, the genre has lasted for many years and is still thriving.  In fact, rappers in Japan did not achieve the success of hip-hop artists in other countries until the late 1980s.  This was mainly due to the music world's belief that \"Japanese sentences were not capable of forming the rhyming effect that was contained in American rappers' songs.\"<ref>Kinney, Caleb. \"Hip-hop influences Japanese Culture. http://www.lightonline.org/articles/chiphopjapan.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509064724/http://www.lightonline.org/articles/chiphopjapan.html |date=2015-05-09 }}</ref> There is a certain, well-defined structure to the music industry called \"The Pyramid Structure of a Music Scene\". As [[Ian Condry]] notes, \"viewing a music scene in terms of a pyramid provides a more nuanced understanding of how to interpret the significance of different levels and kinds of success.\"<ref>Condry, Ian. \"Hip-Hop Japan\". Durham and London, Duke University Press, 102.</ref> The levels are as follows (from lowest to highest): fans and potential artists, performing artists, recording artists (indies), major label artists, and mega-hit stars. These different levels can be clearly seen at a [[genba]], or nightclub. Different \"families\" of rappers perform on stage. A family is essentially a collection of rap groups that are usually headed by one of the more famous Tokyo acts, which also include a number of proteges.<ref name=\"Ref-2\">Condry, Ian. \"A History of Japanese Hip-Hop: Street Dance, Club Scene, Pop Market.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 237, Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2001.</ref> They are important because they are \"the key to understanding stylistic differences between groups.\"<ref name=\"Ref-2\"/> Hip-hop fans in the audience are the ones in control of the night club. They are the judges who determine the winners in rap battles on stage. An example of this can be seen with the battle between rap artists [[Dabo]] (a major label artist) and [[Kan (musician)|Kan]] (an indie artist). Kan challenged Dabo to a battle on stage while Dabo was mid-performance. Another important part of night clubs was displayed at this time. It showed \"the openness of the scene and the fluidity of boundaries in clubs.\"<ref>Condry, Ian. \"Hip-Hop Japan\".

Influenced by disco, impressionistic and 20th century classical composition, jazz/fusion pop, new wave and technopop artists such as [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Telex (band)|Telex]], these artists were commercial yet uncompromising.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}} Ryuichi Sakamoto claims that \"to me, making pop music is not a compromise because I enjoy doing it\". The artists that fall under the banner of technopop in Japan are as loose as those that do so in the West, thus new wave bands such as [[P-Model]] and [[Plastics (band)|The Plastics]] fall under the category alongside the symphonic techno arrangements of [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. The popularity of this music meant that many popular artists of the 1970s that previously were known for acoustic music turned to techno production, such as [[Taeko Onuki]] and [[Akiko Yano]], and idol producers began employing electronic arrangements for new singers in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}} In the 1990s, [[Denki Groove]] and [[Capsule (band)|Capsule]] formed and have been mainstays of the Japanese electronica scene. Today, newer artists such as [[Polysics]] pay explicit homage to this era of Japanese popular (and in some cases underground or difficult to obtain) music.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}} [[Capsule (band)|Capsule]]'s [[Yasutaka Nakata]] has also been involved behind the scenes of popular electropop acts [[Perfume (Japanese band)|Perfume]] and [[Kyary Pamyu Pamyu]], both of which have had success domestically and internationally; Kyary in particular has been dubbed the \"Kawaii Harajuku Ambassador\" for her visibility internationally.\n\n===Roots music===\nIn the late 1980s, [[Traditional music|roots bands]] like [[Shang Shang Typhoon]] and [[The Boom]] became popular.  Okinawan roots bands like [[Nenes]] and [[Kina (band)|Kina]] were also commercially and critically successful.  This led to the second wave of Okinawan music, led by the sudden success of [[Rinken Band]]. A new wave of bands followed, including the comebacks of Champluse and Kina, as led by [[Kikusuimaru Kawachiya]]; very similar to [[kawachi ondo]] is [[Tadamaru Sakuragawa]]'s [[goshu ondo]].\n\n===Latin, reggae and ska music===\n{{Further|Japanese reggae|Japanese ska}}\nOther forms of music from [[Indonesia]], [[Jamaica]] and elsewhere were assimilated. African [[soukous]] and Latin music, like [[Orquesta de la Luz|Orquesta de la Luz (\u30aa\u30eb\u30b1\u30b9\u30bf\u30fb\u30c7\u30fb\u30e9\u30fb\u30eb\u30b9)]], was popular as was Jamaican [[reggae]] and [[ska]], exemplified by [[Mice Teeth]], [[Mute Beat]], [[La-ppisch]], [[Home Grown (Japanese Band)|Home Grown]] and [[Ska Flames]], [[Determinations (band)|Determinations]], and [[Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra]].\n\n===Noise music===\n{{main|Japanoise}}\nAnother recognized music form from Japan is [[noise music]].

Notable composers of Japanese theme music include [[Joe Hisaishi]], [[Michiru Oshima]], [[Yoko Kanno]], [[Toshihiko Sahashi]], [[Yuki Kajiura]], [[K\u014dtar\u014d Nakagawa]], [[Shunsuke Kikuchi]] and [[Yuki Hayashi (composer)|Yuki Hayashi]].\n\n=== Game music ===\n{{see also|Video game music|Chiptune|Bitpop|Nintendocore}}\n[[File:Nobuo Uematsu.jpg|thumb|234x234px|[[Nobuo Uematsu]], composer for the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game series]]\nWhen the first electronic games were sold, they only had rudimentary [[Chip music|sound chips]] with which to produce music. As the technology advanced, the quality of sound and music these game machines could produce increased dramatically. The first game to take credit for its music was ''[[Xevious]]'', also noteworthy for its deeply (at that time) constructed stories. Though many games have had beautiful music to accompany their gameplay, one of the most important games in the history of the video game music is ''[[Dragon Quest]]''. [[Koichi Sugiyama]], a composer who was known for his music for various anime and TV shows, including ''[[Cyborg 009]]'' and a feature film of ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'', got involved in the project out of pure curiosity and proved that games can have serious soundtracks. Until his involvement, music and sounds were often neglected in the development of video games and programmers with little musical knowledge were forced to write the soundtracks as well. Undaunted by technological limits, Sugiyama worked with only 8 part polyphony to create a soundtrack that would not tire the player despite hours and hours of gameplay.\n\nAnother well-known author of video game music is [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. Uematsu's earlier compositions for the game series, ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', on [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] (Nintendo Entertainment System in America), are being arranged for full orchestral score. In 2003, he took his rock-based tunes from their original MIDI format and created [[The Black Mages]].\n\n[[Yasunori Mitsuda]] is the composer of music for such games as ''[[Xenogears]]'', ''[[Xenosaga Episode I]]'', ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', and ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''.\n\n[[Koji Kondo]], the sound manager for [[Nintendo]], is also prominent on the Japanese game music scene. He is best known for his [[The Legend of Zelda series|''Zelda'']] and [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'']] themes.\n\n[[Jun Senoue]] is well known for composing music for [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']]. He also is the main guitarist of [[Crush 40]], who is known for creating the theme songs to ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog]]'', and ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]'', as well as providing music to other [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic'']] games.\n\n[[Motoi Sakuraba]] is another well-known video game composer. He is known for composing the ''[[Tales (video game series)|Tales of series]]'', ''[[Dark Souls]]'', ''[[Eternal Sonata]]'', ''[[Star Ocean]]'', ''[[Valkyrie Profile]]'', ''[[Golden Sun]]'', and the ''[[Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean|Baten Kaitos]]'' games, as well as numerous [[Mario sports games]].\n\n[[Yuzo Koshiro]] is also noted for his work with games, having composed electronic music-influenced soundtracks for games like ''[[Revenge of Shinobi]]'' and the ''[[Streets of Rage]]'' series.\n\nThe [[techno]]/[[trance music]] production group [[I've Sound]] has made a name for themselves first by making themes for [[eroge]] computer games, and then by breaking into the [[anime]] scene by composing themes for them. Unlike others, this group was able to find fans in other parts of the world through their eroge and anime themes.\n\nToday, game soundtracks are sold on CD, as well on digitally on websites such as [[iTunes]]. Famous singers like [[Hikaru Utada]], [[Nana Mizuki]] and [[BoA]] sometimes sing songs for games as well, and this is also seen as a way for singers to make a names for themselves.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[All-Japan Band Association]]\n* [[Buddhist music]]\n* [[Chindonya]]\n* [[Oricon]]\n* [[Shibuya-kei]]\n* [[Shint\u014d music]]\n* [[Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra]]\n* [[List of musical artists from Japan]]\n* [[List of Japanese hip hop musicians]]\n* [[List of J-pop artists]]\n* [[In scale]]\n* [[Voice acting in Japan]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation\n| title = Japanese Music and Musical Instruments\n| author = [[William P.

[[China| Chinese]] influences followed, but the instrument and its music remained uniquely Japanese.<ref>History of Taiko [http://aitech.ac.jp/~inomoto/ino/taiko/] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220060149/http://aitech.ac.jp/~inomoto/ino/taiko/ |date=2008-12-20 }} \"\u9f13\u3068\u592a\u9f13\u306e\u306a\u304c\u308c\" - \u4e2d\u56fd\u306e\u5510\u304b\u3089\u308f\u304c\u56fd\u306b\u5165\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f\u3044\u308d\u3093\u306a\u592a\u9f13\u304c\u3001\u6642\u4ee3\u3068\u5171\u306b\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u5909\u9077\u3057\u3066\u304d\u305f\u304b\u3092\u5404\u7a2e\u306e\u8cc7\u6599\u304b\u3089\u307e\u3068\u3081\u308b\u3068\u3001\u6b21\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002</ref>  Taiko drums during this period were used during battle to intimidate the enemy and to communicate commands.  Taiko continue to be used in the religious music of [[Buddhism]] and [[Shint\u014d]].  In the past players were holy men, who played only at special occasions and in small groups, but in time secular men (rarely women) also played the taiko in semi-religious festivals such as the [[bon dance]].\n\nModern ensemble taiko is said{{by whom?|date=February 2020}} to have been invented by [[Daihachi Oguchi]] in 1951.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.hiryu-project.com/daihachi.html |title= Archived copy |access-date= 2016-05-08 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160722054923/http://www.hiryu-project.com/daihachi.html |archive-date= 2016-07-22 |url-status= live }}</ref>  A [[jazz]] drummer, Oguchi incorporated his musical background into large ensembles, which he had also designed.  His energetic style made his group popular throughout Japan, and made the [[Hokuriku region]] a center for taiko music.  Musical groups to arise from this wave of popularity included [[Oedo Sukeroku Daiko]], with [[Seido Kobayashi]].  1969 saw a group called [[Ondekoza |Za Ondekoza]] founded by Tagayasu Den; Za Ondekoza gathered together young performers who innovated a new [[roots revival]] version of taiko, which was used as a way of life in communal [[lifestyle (disambiguation) | lifestyle]]s.  During the 1970s the Japanese government allocated funds to preserve Japanese culture, and many community taiko groups formed.  Later in the century, taiko groups spread across the world, especially to the [[United States]]. The [[video game]] ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'' is based around taiko. One example of a modern Taiko band is [[Gocoo]] (founded in 1997).\n\n===Min'y\u014d folk music===\n\n[[File:Geishashamisen053.jpg |thumb|left|A Japanese folkswoman with her [[shamisen]], 1904]]\n\n{{main|Min'y\u014d}}\nJapanese folk songs (''min'y\u014d'') can be grouped and classified in many ways but it is often convenient to think of four main categories:\n \n* [[work song]]s\n* religious songs (such as [[sato kagura]], a form of [[Shintoist]] music)\n* songs used for gatherings such as weddings, funerals, and festivals ([[matsuri]], especially [[Obon]])\n* children's songs ([[warabe uta]])\n\nIn [[min'y\u014d]], three-stringed [[lute]] known as the [[shamisen]], [[taiko]] drums, and a bamboo flute called [[shakuhachi]] typically accompany the singers.<ref name=\"malm.1963\">{{citation | title = Nagauta: The Heart of Kabuki Music | author = Malm, William P. | place = Westport, Conn. | publisher = Greenwood Press  | date = 1963| hdl = 2027/mdp.39015007996476 }}</ref> Other instruments that could accompany include a transverse flute known as the [[shinobue]], a bell known as [[kane (musical instrument) |kane]], a hand drum called the [[tsuzumi]], and/or a 13-stringed zither known as the [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]]. In [[Okinawa]] the main instrument is the [[sanshin]]. These are traditional Japanese instruments, but modern instrumentation, such as [[electric guitars]] and [[synthesizer]]s, is also used in this day and age, when [[enka]] singers cover traditional [[min'y\u014d]] songs ([[enka]] being a Japanese music genre all its own).<ref name=\"Hughes 2008\">\n{{cite book\n|last= Hughes|first= David W.\n|title= Traditional folk song in modern Japan: sources, sentiment and society\n|year=2008|publisher=Global Oriental Ltd|location= Folkestone, UK\n|isbn= 978-1-905246-65-6\n}}\n</ref>\n\nTerms often heard when speaking about [[min'y\u014d]] are ondo, bushi, bon uta, and [[Lullaby |komori uta]]. An ondo generally describes any folk song with a distinctive swing that may be heard as 2/4 time [[rhythm]] (though performers usually do not group beats). The typical folk song heard at [[Obon]] festival dances will most likely be an ondo. A bushi is a song with a distinctive melody. Its very name, which is pronounced \"bushi\" in compounds, means \"melody\" or \"rhythm\".  The word is rarely used on its own, but is usually prefixed by a term referring to occupation, location, personal name or the like.  Bon uta, as the name describes, are songs for [[Obon]], the lantern festival of the dead. [[Komori uta]] are children's lullabies. The names of min'yo songs often include descriptive term, usually at the end. For example: Tokyo Ondo, Kushimoto Bushi, Hokkai Bon Uta, and Itsuki no Komoriuta.\n\nMany of these songs include extra stress on certain syllables as well as pitched shouts ([[kakegoe]]). Kakegoe are generally shouts of cheer but in [[min'y\u014d]], they are often included as parts of choruses. There are many [[kakegoe]], though they vary from region to region. In [[Okinawa min'y\u014d| Okinawa Min'y\u014d]], for example, one will hear the common \"ha iya sasa!\"  In mainland Japan, however, one will be more likely to hear \"a yoisho!,\" \"sate!,\" or \"a sore!\" Others include \"a donto koi!,\" and \"dokoisho!\"\n\nRecently a [[guild]]-based system known as the [[iemoto]] system has been applied{{by whom?|date=February 2020}} to some forms of min'y\u014d; it is called{{fragment|date=February 2020}}.  This system originally developed for transmitting classical genres such as [[nagauta]], shakuhachi, or koto music, but since it proved profitable to teachers and was supported by students who wished to obtain certificates of proficiency and artist's names continues to spread to genres such as min'y\u014d, [[Tsugaru-jamisen]] and other forms of music that were traditionally transmitted more informally.  Today some min'y\u014d are passed on in such pseudo-family organizations and long [[apprentice]]ships are common.\n\nSee also [[Ainu music]] of north Japan.\n\n===Okinawan folk music===\n\n{{Main|Ryukyuan music}}\n[[Umui]], religious songs, [[shima uta]], dance songs, and, especially [[kach\u0101sh\u012b]], lively celebratory music, were all popular.\n\nOkinawan folk music differs from mainland Japanese folk music in several ways.\n\nFirst, Okinawan folk music is often accompanied by the [[sanshin]], whereas in mainland Japan the [[shamisen]] accompanies instead.  Other Okinawan instruments include the [[Sanba (musical instrument) |sanba]] (which produce a clicking sound similar to that of [[castanets]]), [[taiko]] and a sharp [[Wolf-whistling |finger whistling]] called {{nihongo|''yubi-bue''|\u6307\u7b1b}}.\n\nSecond, tonality. A [[pentatonic scale]], which coincides with the [[major pentatonic scale]] of Western musical disciplines, is often heard in [[min'y\u014d]] from the main islands of Japan, see [[miny\u014d scale]]. In this pentatonic scale the [[subdominant]] and [[leading tone]] (scale degrees 4 and 7 of the Western [[major scale]]) are omitted, resulting in a musical scale with no [[half step]]s between each note. (Do, Re, Mi, So, La in [[solfeggio]], or scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6). Okinawan min'y\u014d, however, is characterized by scales that include the half-steps omitted in the aforementioned pentatonic scale, when analyzed in the Western discipline of music. In fact, the most common scale used in Okinawan min'y\u014d includes scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\n===Traditional instruments===\n{{main|Traditional Japanese musical instruments}}\n* [[Biwa]] (\u7435\u7436)\n* [[Fue]] (\u7b1b)\n* [[Hichiriki]] (\u7bf3\u7be5)\u3000\n* [[Hocchiku]] (\u6cd5\u7af9)\n* [[Hy\u014dshigi]] (\u62cd\u5b50\u6728)\n* [[Kane (instrument)|Kane]] (\u9418)\n* [[Kakko (instrument)|Kakko]] (\u97a8\u9f13)\n* [[Koky\u016b]] (\u80e1\u5f13)\n* [[Koto (instrument)|Koto]] (\u7434)\n* [[Erhu|Niko]] (\u4e8c\u80e1)\n* Okawa (AKA [[\u014ctsuzumi]]) (\u5927\u9f13)\n* [[ryuteki|Ry\u016bteki]] (\u7adc\u7b1b)\n* [[Sanshin]] (\u4e09\u7dda)\n* [[Shakuhachi]] (bamboo flute) (\u5c3a\u516b)\n* [[Shamisen]] (\u4e09\u5473\u7dda)\n* [[Shime-Daiko]] (\u7de0\u592a\u9f13)\n* [[Shinobue]] (\u7be0\u7b1b)\n* [[Sh\u014d (instrument)|Sh\u014d]] (\u7b19)\n* [[Suikinkutsu]] (water zither) (\u6c34\u7434\u7a9f)\n* [[Taiko]] (i.e. [[Wadaiko]]) \u592a\u9f13\uff5e\u548c\u592a\u9f13\n* [[Tsuzumi]] (\u9f13) (AKA Kotsuzumi)\n\n==Arrival of Western music==\n\n===Traditional pop music===\n{{main|Ry\u016bk\u014dka|Kay\u014dkyoku|Enka}}\nAfter the [[Meiji Restoration]] introduced Western musical instruction, a bureaucrat named [[Izawa Shuji]] compiled songs like \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\" and commissioned songs using a [[pentatonic]] melody.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}} Western music, especially military marches, soon became popular in Japan.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}} Two major forms of music that developed during this period were [[shoka (music)|shoka]], which was composed to bring western music to schools, and [[gunka]], which are [[march (music)|military marches]] with some Japanese elements.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}}\n\nAs Japan moved towards representative [[democracy]] in the late 19th century, leaders hired singers to sell copies of songs that aired their messages, since the leaders themselves were usually prohibited from speaking in public.

On returning to Japan in 1879, Isawa formed the Ongaku-Torishirabe-Gakari (Music Investigation Agency), a national research center for Western music; it was later renamed the [[Tokyo Music School]] (T\u00f4ky\u00f4 ongaku gakk\u00f4).

United's first international performance took place in Los Angeles at the metal festival \"Foundations Forum\" in September 1995 and had few albums released in North America. Formed in the mid 1980s, [[Doom (Japanese band)|Doom]] played a gig in the United States in October 1988 at CBGB, and was active until 2000 when disbanded.\n\nThe first bands to play [[black metal]] music were [[Sabbat (Japanese band)|Sabbat]], who is still active, and [[Bellzlleb]], who was active until the early 1990s. Another notable acts are [[Sigh (band)|Sigh]], [[Abigail(band)|Abigail]], and [[Gallhammer]].\n\n[[Doom metal]] has also gained an audience in Japan. The two best-known Japanese doom metal acts are [[Church of Misery]] and [[Boris (band)|Boris]], both of whom have gained considerable popularity outside the country.\n\n====Metalcore====\nIn the 2000s, Japanese metalcore bands such as Toyko's [[Crystal Lake (band)|Crystal Lake]], Nagoya natives [[Coldrain]] and [[Deathgaze]], Kobe's [[Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas]], and Osaka's [[Crossfaith]] have formed.\n\n===Hip hop===\n{{main|Japanese hip hop}}\nHip-hop is a newer form of music on the Japanese music scene.  Many felt it was a trend that would immediately pass.  However, the genre has lasted for many years and is still thriving.  In fact, rappers in Japan did not achieve the success of hip-hop artists in other countries until the late 1980s.  This was mainly due to the music world's belief that \"Japanese sentences were not capable of forming the rhyming effect that was contained in American rappers' songs.\"<ref>Kinney, Caleb. \"Hip-hop influences Japanese Culture. http://www.lightonline.org/articles/chiphopjapan.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509064724/http://www.lightonline.org/articles/chiphopjapan.html |date=2015-05-09 }}</ref> There is a certain, well-defined structure to the music industry called \"The Pyramid Structure of a Music Scene\". As [[Ian Condry]] notes, \"viewing a music scene in terms of a pyramid provides a more nuanced understanding of how to interpret the significance of different levels and kinds of success.\"<ref>Condry, Ian. \"Hip-Hop Japan\". Durham and London, Duke University Press, 102.</ref> The levels are as follows (from lowest to highest): fans and potential artists, performing artists, recording artists (indies), major label artists, and mega-hit stars. These different levels can be clearly seen at a [[genba]], or nightclub. Different \"families\" of rappers perform on stage. A family is essentially a collection of rap groups that are usually headed by one of the more famous Tokyo acts, which also include a number of proteges.<ref name=\"Ref-2\">Condry, Ian. \"A History of Japanese Hip-Hop: Street Dance, Club Scene, Pop Market.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 237, Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2001.</ref> They are important because they are \"the key to understanding stylistic differences between groups.\"<ref name=\"Ref-2\"/> Hip-hop fans in the audience are the ones in control of the night club. They are the judges who determine the winners in rap battles on stage. An example of this can be seen with the battle between rap artists [[Dabo]] (a major label artist) and [[Kan (musician)|Kan]] (an indie artist). Kan challenged Dabo to a battle on stage while Dabo was mid-performance. Another important part of night clubs was displayed at this time. It showed \"the openness of the scene and the fluidity of boundaries in clubs.\"<ref>Condry, Ian. \"Hip-Hop Japan\".

Influenced by disco, impressionistic and 20th century classical composition, jazz/fusion pop, new wave and technopop artists such as [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Telex (band)|Telex]], these artists were commercial yet uncompromising.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}} Ryuichi Sakamoto claims that \"to me, making pop music is not a compromise because I enjoy doing it\". The artists that fall under the banner of technopop in Japan are as loose as those that do so in the West, thus new wave bands such as [[P-Model]] and [[Plastics (band)|The Plastics]] fall under the category alongside the symphonic techno arrangements of [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. The popularity of this music meant that many popular artists of the 1970s that previously were known for acoustic music turned to techno production, such as [[Taeko Onuki]] and [[Akiko Yano]], and idol producers began employing electronic arrangements for new singers in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}} In the 1990s, [[Denki Groove]] and [[Capsule (band)|Capsule]] formed and have been mainstays of the Japanese electronica scene. Today, newer artists such as [[Polysics]] pay explicit homage to this era of Japanese popular (and in some cases underground or difficult to obtain) music.{{Citation needed|date = November 2009}} [[Capsule (band)|Capsule]]'s [[Yasutaka Nakata]] has also been involved behind the scenes of popular electropop acts [[Perfume (Japanese band)|Perfume]] and [[Kyary Pamyu Pamyu]], both of which have had success domestically and internationally; Kyary in particular has been dubbed the \"Kawaii Harajuku Ambassador\" for her visibility internationally.\n\n===Roots music===\nIn the late 1980s, [[Traditional music|roots bands]] like [[Shang Shang Typhoon]] and [[The Boom]] became popular.  Okinawan roots bands like [[Nenes]] and [[Kina (band)|Kina]] were also commercially and critically successful.  This led to the second wave of Okinawan music, led by the sudden success of [[Rinken Band]]. A new wave of bands followed, including the comebacks of Champluse and Kina, as led by [[Kikusuimaru Kawachiya]]; very similar to [[kawachi ondo]] is [[Tadamaru Sakuragawa]]'s [[goshu ondo]].\n\n===Latin, reggae and ska music===\n{{Further|Japanese reggae|Japanese ska}}\nOther forms of music from [[Indonesia]], [[Jamaica]] and elsewhere were assimilated. African [[soukous]] and Latin music, like [[Orquesta de la Luz|Orquesta de la Luz (\u30aa\u30eb\u30b1\u30b9\u30bf\u30fb\u30c7\u30fb\u30e9\u30fb\u30eb\u30b9)]], was popular as was Jamaican [[reggae]] and [[ska]], exemplified by [[Mice Teeth]], [[Mute Beat]], [[La-ppisch]], [[Home Grown (Japanese Band)|Home Grown]] and [[Ska Flames]], [[Determinations (band)|Determinations]], and [[Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra]].\n\n===Noise music===\n{{main|Japanoise}}\nAnother recognized music form from Japan is [[noise music]].

As the technology advanced, the quality of sound and music these game machines could produce increased dramatically. The first game to take credit for its music was ''[[Xevious]]'', also noteworthy for its deeply (at that time) constructed stories. Though many games have had beautiful music to accompany their gameplay, one of the most important games in the history of the video game music is ''[[Dragon Quest]]''. [[Koichi Sugiyama]], a composer who was known for his music for various anime and TV shows, including ''[[Cyborg 009]]'' and a feature film of ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'', got involved in the project out of pure curiosity and proved that games can have serious soundtracks. Until his involvement, music and sounds were often neglected in the development of video games and programmers with little musical knowledge were forced to write the soundtracks as well. Undaunted by technological limits, Sugiyama worked with only 8 part polyphony to create a soundtrack that would not tire the player despite hours and hours of gameplay.\n\nAnother well-known author of video game music is [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. Uematsu's earlier compositions for the game series, ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', on [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] (Nintendo Entertainment System in America), are being arranged for full orchestral score. In 2003, he took his rock-based tunes from their original MIDI format and created [[The Black Mages]].\n\n[[Yasunori Mitsuda]] is the composer of music for such games as ''[[Xenogears]]'', ''[[Xenosaga Episode I]]'', ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', and ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''.\n\n[[Koji Kondo]], the sound manager for [[Nintendo]], is also prominent on the Japanese game music scene. He is best known for his [[The Legend of Zelda series|''Zelda'']] and [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'']] themes.\n\n[[Jun Senoue]] is well known for composing music for [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']]. He also is the main guitarist of [[Crush 40]], who is known for creating the theme songs to ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog]]'', and ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]'', as well as providing music to other [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic'']] games.\n\n[[Motoi Sakuraba]] is another well-known video game composer. He is known for composing the ''[[Tales (video game series)|Tales of series]]'', ''[[Dark Souls]]'', ''[[Eternal Sonata]]'', ''[[Star Ocean]]'', ''[[Valkyrie Profile]]'', ''[[Golden Sun]]'', and the ''[[Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean|Baten Kaitos]]'' games, as well as numerous [[Mario sports games]].\n\n[[Yuzo Koshiro]] is also noted for his work with games, having composed electronic music-influenced soundtracks for games like ''[[Revenge of Shinobi]]'' and the ''[[Streets of Rage]]'' series.\n\nThe [[techno]]/[[trance music]] production group [[I've Sound]] has made a name for themselves first by making themes for [[eroge]] computer games, and then by breaking into the [[anime]] scene by composing themes for them. Unlike others, this group was able to find fans in other parts of the world through their eroge and anime themes.\n\nToday, game soundtracks are sold on CD, as well on digitally on websites such as [[iTunes]]. Famous singers like [[Hikaru Utada]], [[Nana Mizuki]] and [[BoA]] sometimes sing songs for games as well, and this is also seen as a way for singers to make a names for themselves.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[All-Japan Band Association]]\n* [[Buddhist music]]\n* [[Chindonya]]\n* [[Oricon]]\n* [[Shibuya-kei]]\n* [[Shint\u014d music]]\n* [[Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra]]\n* [[List of musical artists from Japan]]\n* [[List of Japanese hip hop musicians]]\n* [[List of J-pop artists]]\n* [[In scale]]\n* [[Voice acting in Japan]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation\n| title = Japanese Music and Musical Instruments\n| author = [[William P.

The jobs are represented as tongue-in-cheek approximations of real occupations: \"[[Auto mechanic|Auto Mechanic]]\", \"[[Chef|Gourmet Chef]]\", \"[[Convenience store|Store Clerk]]\" and \"[[White-collar worker|Office Worker]]\". Accompanied by a computer character who provides exposition and instructions, players perform tasks associated with that occupation, some realistic and others comical. For example, in the \"Office Worker\" simulation, players engage in activities like evaluating new employees and transferring calls, but are also called upon to eat [[doughnut]]s, share photos at the water cooler, and participate in other office tasks.\n\nUsing the motion controllers of the HTC Vive, Oculus Touch or [[PlayStation Move]], depending on the platform, to represent their hands, players interact with the virtual environment similarly to how they would in real life. Most objects within the player's reach can be interacted with - many can be picked up and manipulated, while fixed objects such as keyboards and appliances will have buttons, levers, or dials that the player can utilize. After completing a certain amount of This is the best game ever baby tasks, the player is offered to go back to the museum or continue interacting with the environment. Once the player completes all four job simulations, they're offered a variety of modifiers that change the physics of the gameplay.\n\nThe player is often afforded a large amount of creative freedom in how they complete a task. For example, when cooking pizza in the chef simulation, players can choose any ingredient they can reach, such as bacon, eggs, apples, or cookies to use as pizza toppings. When performing car repairs in the auto-mechanic simulation, players can choose what style of parts to use as replacements (for example, when replacing a flat tire, the player can choose from any of 9 available tire styles) and are allowed to perform repairs and replacements that aren't requested by the customer. The player is also free to mess around with the various objects in their reach, such as throwing things in trash cans or at robots, eating food lying around or taking the sunglasses off a customer.\n\nMuch of the game's humor comes from both [[Parody|stereotypical and exaggerated]] situations in the jobs performed: as a chef, the player is asked to bribe a [[food critic]] and navigate around the particular allergies of an underage customer having a birthday; as a car mechanic, the boss instructs the player to sabotage cars or strip a car for parts.

The jobs are represented as tongue-in-cheek approximations of real occupations: \"[[Auto mechanic|Auto Mechanic]]\", \"[[Chef|Gourmet Chef]]\", \"[[Convenience store|Store Clerk]]\" and \"[[White-collar worker|Office Worker]]\". Accompanied by a computer character who provides exposition and instructions, players perform tasks associated with that occupation, some realistic and others comical. For example, in the \"Office Worker\" simulation, players engage in activities like evaluating new employees and transferring calls, but are also called upon to eat [[doughnut]]s, share photos at the water cooler, and participate in other office tasks.\n\nUsing the motion controllers of the HTC Vive, Oculus Touch or [[PlayStation Move]], depending on the platform, to represent their hands, players interact with the virtual environment similarly to how they would in real life. Most objects within the player's reach can be interacted with - many can be picked up and manipulated, while fixed objects such as keyboards and appliances will have buttons, levers, or dials that the player can utilize. After completing a certain amount of tasks, the player is offered to go back to the museum or continue interacting with the environment. Once the player completes all four job simulations, they're offered a variety of modifiers that change the physics of the gameplay.\n\nThe player is often afforded a large amount of creative freedom in how they complete a task. For example, when cooking pizza in the chef simulation, players can choose any ingredient they can reach, such as bacon, eggs, apples, or cookies to use as pizza toppings. When performing car repairs in the auto-mechanic simulation, players can choose what style of parts to use as replacements (for example, when replacing a flat tire, the player can choose from any of 9 available tire styles) and are allowed to perform repairs and replacements that aren't requested by the customer. The player is also free to mess around with the various objects in their reach, such as throwing things in trash cans or at robots, eating food lying around or taking the sunglasses off a customer.\n\nMuch of the game's humor comes from both [[Parody|stereotypical and exaggerated]] situations in the jobs performed: as a chef, the player is asked to bribe a [[food critic]] and navigate around the particular allergies of an underage customer having a birthday; as a car mechanic, the boss instructs the player to sabotage cars or strip a car for parts.
