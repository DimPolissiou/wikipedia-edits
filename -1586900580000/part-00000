However, university officials were able to find a loophole: by adding some rooms for gun and weapons storage, construction of the building was able to continue under the guise of an \"armory.\"\n\nAllen Fieldhouse was dedicated on March 1, 1955,<ref name=tnwetem/><ref name=fbaln/> a ten-point victory over [[Sunflower Showdown|rival]] [[Kansas State Wilcats men's basketball|Kansas State]].<ref name=bigin>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pdlFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w-cMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6675%2C3746224 |work=Lawrence Daily Journal-World |location=(Kansas) |last=Mayer |first=Bill |title=Jays present Phog big one after coach 'absents' self |date=March 2, 1955 |page=15}}</ref> Renovations have included minor seating expansions in 1986 and 1994, as well as [[accessibility]] upgrades in 1999 to modernize concession stands and restroom facilities, and to install an elevator in the south end. Handicapped seating was moved courtside behind both baskets in 2001.\n\nThe concourse was originally an indoor track. At times the Fieldhouse has been home to men's and [[women's basketball]], indoor [[track and field]], [[volleyball]], and practice facilities for the [[American football]] and [[softball]] teams. Since additional facilities were constructed to accommodate many of those needs, it is now used primarily for basketball.\n\n[[Max Falkenstien]] was a stalwart figure in the radio booth, working every home game in Allen Fieldhouse from its construction to his retirement in 2006, 51 years later.\n\nRenovations completed in 2005 include a thorough cleaning of the exterior, and the creation of a new Booth Family Hall of Athletics facility on the east side of the Fieldhouse, funded by [[David G. Booth]] and his family. Interior renovations include a new hardwood court, new windows, and a multimillion-dollar video board and sound system. After 2006, new banners for the retired jerseys and conference and national championships were installed.\n\nRenovations completed in 2009 include an expansion of the Booth Family Hall of Athletics and the creation of a donor atrium, as well as improved concessions, wider concourses, and restroom upgrades. The building also received brand new locker rooms, training rooms, film rooms, and player lounges. A pedestrian bridge connecting the Fieldhouse to the existing facility parking garage was also constructed. The improvements cost approximately $7.8 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Allen Fieldhouse Sporting New Look|first=Gary|last=Bedore|url=http://www2.kusports.com/news/2009/oct/15/allen-fieldhouse-sporting-new-look/?mens_basketball|work=KU Sports|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=October 15, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023084603/http://www2.kusports.com/news/2009/oct/15/allen-fieldhouse-sporting-new-look/?mens_basketball|archivedate=October 23, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2010, the Booth family announced they had purchased the founding document of the game of basketball, Dr. Naismith's original 13 Rules of Basketball.

During Ted Owens' coaching period (1964\u201383), the capacity was reduced to 15,200 to improve fire code-mandated egress routes. It was raised to 15,800 in the 1986 offseason, and since 1993, its official capacity has been 16,300. Of these seats, 4,000 are dedicated to KU students, with most of the remainder taken by season-ticket-holding members of the Williams Educational Fund, the fundraising arm of KU Athletics, named after Lawrence banker Dick Williams and his sons, Skipper and Odd.<ref>{{cite news|title=Programs Help Fans Score Seating Points|first=Dave|last=Ranney|url=http://www.kusports.com/news/seatingplan/story/110758|newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=March 19, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417224510/http://www.kusports.com/news/seatingplan/story/110758|archivedate=April 17, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The largest crowd in Allen Fieldhouse for a basketball game was 17,228 on March 1, 1955, when the building was dedicated. Barring another expansion of seating, it is unlikely this record will ever be broken as fire codes have forced KU to strictly enforce the building's capacity since the mid-1980s.\n\n==Banners==\nIn lieu of retiring numbers, banners hang on the south wall of the fieldhouse to honor former players including [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Clyde Lovellette]], [[Jo Jo White]], [[Danny Manning]], [[Paul Pierce]], [[Lynette Woodard]], [[Drew Gooden]], [[Nick Collison]], and [[Kirk Hinrich]], among others.  The banners display the player's surname over his/her number, but the numbers themselves are reused.  There is also a banner to honor [[Max Falkenstien]], a former Jayhawks radio announcer, who was given the \"number\" 60 to commemorate his 60 years of service to the university. To date he is the only non-athlete to be so honored at Allen Fieldhouse. The east and west rafters are devoted to KU's multiple Final Fours and conference championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kusports.com/news/2006/mar/02/falkenstien_has_jersey_unfurled/?mens_basketball|title=Falkenstien has 'jersey' unfurled|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717044331/http://www2.kusports.com/news/2006/mar/02/falkenstien_has_jersey_unfurled/?mens_basketball|archivedate=July 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the north wall hang banners for KU's five national championships: their two championships awarded by the [[Helms Athletic Foundation|Helms Foundation]] for KU's 1922 and 1923 seasons, as well as their three NCAA tournament titles in [[1952 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1952]], [[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1988]], and [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]].\n\nAbove these championship banners hangs a banner reading \"Pay Heed, All Who Enter: Beware of the Phog\", in reference to the intimidating atmosphere and the team's home court dominance.  The original \"Pay Heed\" banner was constructed out of dormitory shower curtains by a group of KU students before a late-season game against the [[Duke men's basketball|Duke Blue Devils]] in 1988 and is now on display in the Booth Family Hall of Athletics museum. The slogan was inspired in part by advertisements for the 1980s horror movie [[The Fog]]. It hung on the north wall until 1999, by which time it had deteriorated to the point where it was about to fall.<ref name=\"Pay Heed\">{{cite news|last1=Newell|first1=Jesse|title=The story behind KU\u2019s \u2018Beware of the Phog\u2019 banner ... from the men who created it|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article194617979.html|accessdate=January 15, 2018|work=Kansas City Star|date=January 13, 2018|language=en}}</ref>  The university replaced the banner with a much more regular-looking design, which met with negative reaction from the public.

However, university officials were able to find a loophole: by adding some rooms for gun and weapons storage, construction of the building was able to continue under the guise of an \"armory.\"\n\nAllen Field House was dedicated on March 1, 1955,<ref name=tnwetem/><ref name=fbaln/> a ten-point victory over [[Sunflower Showdown|rival]] [[Kansas State Wilcats men's basketball|Kansas State]].<ref name=bigin>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pdlFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w-cMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6675%2C3746224 |work=Lawrence Daily Journal-World |location=(Kansas) |last=Mayer |first=Bill |title=Jays present Phog big one after coach 'absents' self |date=March 2, 1955 |page=15}}</ref> Renovations have included minor seating expansions in 1986 and 1994, as well as [[accessibility]] upgrades in 1999 to modernize concession stands and restroom facilities, and to install an elevator in the south end. Handicapped seating was moved courtside behind both baskets in 2001.\n\nThe concourse was originally an indoor track. At times the Field House has been home to men's and [[women's basketball]], indoor [[track and field]], [[volleyball]], and practice facilities for the [[American football]] and [[softball]] teams. Since additional facilities were constructed to accommodate many of those needs, it is now used primarily for basketball.\n\n[[Max Falkenstien]] was a stalwart figure in the radio booth, working every home game in Allen Field House from its construction to his retirement in 2006, 51 years later.\n\nRenovations completed in 2005 include a thorough cleaning of the exterior, and the creation of a new Booth Family Hall of Athletics facility on the east side of the Field House, funded by [[David G. Booth]] and his family. Interior renovations include a new hardwood court, new windows, and a multimillion-dollar video board and sound system. After 2006, new banners for the retired jerseys and conference and national championships were installed.\n\nRenovations completed in 2009 include an expansion of the Booth Family Hall of Athletics and the creation of a donor atrium, as well as improved concessions, wider concourses, and restroom upgrades. The building also received brand new locker rooms, training rooms, film rooms, and player lounges. A pedestrian bridge connecting the Field House to the existing facility parking garage was also constructed. The improvements cost approximately $7.8 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Allen Fieldhouse Sporting New Look|first=Gary|last=Bedore|url=http://www2.kusports.com/news/2009/oct/15/allen-fieldhouse-sporting-new-look/?mens_basketball|work=KU Sports|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=October 15, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023084603/http://www2.kusports.com/news/2009/oct/15/allen-fieldhouse-sporting-new-look/?mens_basketball|archivedate=October 23, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2010, the Booth family announced they had purchased the founding document of the game of basketball, Dr. Naismith's original 13 Rules of Basketball.

During Ted Owens' coaching period (1964\u201383), the capacity was reduced to 15,200 to improve fire code-mandated egress routes. It was raised to 15,800 in the 1986 offseason, and since 1993, its official capacity has been 16,300. Of these seats, 4,000 are dedicated to KU students, with most of the remainder taken by season-ticket-holding members of the Williams Educational Fund, the fundraising arm of KU Athletics, named after Lawrence banker Dick Williams and his sons, Skipper and Odd.<ref>{{cite news|title=Programs Help Fans Score Seating Points|first=Dave|last=Ranney|url=http://www.kusports.com/news/seatingplan/story/110758|newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=March 19, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417224510/http://www.kusports.com/news/seatingplan/story/110758|archivedate=April 17, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The largest crowd in Allen Field House for a basketball game was 17,228 on March 1, 1955, when the building was dedicated. Barring another expansion of seating, it is unlikely this record will ever be broken as fire codes have forced KU to strictly enforce the building's capacity since the mid-1980s.\n\n==Banners==\nIn lieu of retiring numbers, banners hang on the south wall of the fieldhouse to honor former players including [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Clyde Lovellette]], [[Jo Jo White]], [[Danny Manning]], [[Paul Pierce]], [[Lynette Woodard]], [[Drew Gooden]], [[Nick Collison]], and [[Kirk Hinrich]], among others.  The banners display the player's surname over his/her number, but the numbers themselves are reused.  There is also a banner to honor [[Max Falkenstien]], a former Jayhawks radio announcer, who was given the \"number\" 60 to commemorate his 60 years of service to the university. To date he is the only non-athlete to be so honored at Allen Field House. The east and west rafters are devoted to KU's multiple Final Fours and conference championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kusports.com/news/2006/mar/02/falkenstien_has_jersey_unfurled/?mens_basketball|title=Falkenstien has 'jersey' unfurled|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717044331/http://www2.kusports.com/news/2006/mar/02/falkenstien_has_jersey_unfurled/?mens_basketball|archivedate=July 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the north wall hang banners for KU's five national championships: their two championships awarded by the [[Helms Athletic Foundation|Helms Foundation]] for KU's 1922 and 1923 seasons, as well as their three NCAA tournament titles in [[1952 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1952]], [[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1988]], and [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]].\n\nAbove these championship banners hangs a banner reading \"Pay Heed, All Who Enter: Beware of the Phog\", in reference to the intimidating atmosphere and the team's home court dominance.  The original \"Pay Heed\" banner was constructed out of dormitory shower curtains by a group of KU students before a late-season game against the [[Duke men's basketball|Duke Blue Devils]] in 1988 and is now on display in the Booth Family Hall of Athletics museum. The slogan was inspired in part by advertisements for the 1980s horror movie [[The Fog]]. It hung on the north wall until 1999, by which time it had deteriorated to the point where it was about to fall.<ref name=\"Pay Heed\">{{cite news|last1=Newell|first1=Jesse|title=The story behind KU\u2019s \u2018Beware of the Phog\u2019 banner ... from the men who created it|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article194617979.html|accessdate=January 15, 2018|work=Kansas City Star|date=January 13, 2018|language=en}}</ref>  The university replaced the banner with a much more regular-looking design, which met with negative reaction from the public.

They are prized as household [[pet]]s and [[companion parrot]]s throughout the world and are relatively easy to breed. As a caged bird, cockatiels are second in popularity only to the [[budgerigar]].<ref name=\"ausmus\">{{cite web |url=http://birdsinbackyards.net/species/Nymphicus-hollandicus |title=Factsheets:Cockatiel |accessdate=2008-08-30 |publisher=[[Australian Museum]] }}</ref>\n\nThe cockatiel is the only member of the [[genus]] '''''Nymphicus'''''. It was previously considered a crested parrot or small cockatoo; however, more recent molecular studies have assigned it to its own subfamily, ''Nymphicinae''. It is, therefore, now classified as the smallest of the [[Cacatuidae]] (cockatoo family). Cockatiels are native to Australia, favouring the Australian wetlands, scrublands, and bushlands.\n\n== Taxonomy and etymology ==\nOriginally described by Scottish writer and naturalist [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1793 as ''Psittacus hollandicus'', the cockatiel (or cockateel)  was moved to its own genus, ''Nymphicus'', by [[Johann Georg Wagler|Wagler]] in 1832.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Assis | first=V.D.L. | last2=Carvalho | first2=T.S.G. | last3=Pereira | first3=V.M. | last4=Freitas | first4=R.T.F. | last5=Saad | first5=C.E.P. | last6=Costa | first6=A.C. | last7=Silva | first7=A.A.A. | last8=Assis | first8=V.D.L. | last9=Carvalho | first9=T.S.G. | last10=Pereira | first10=V.M. | last11=Freitas | first11=R.T.F. | last12=Saad | first12=C.E.P. | last13=Costa | first13=A.C. | last14=Silva | first14=A.A.A. | title=Environmental enrichment on the behavior and welfare of cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) | journal=Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterin\u00e1ria e Zootecnia | volume=68 | issue=3 | date=1990-01-06 | issn=0102-0935 | doi=10.1590/1678-4162-8747 | pages=562\u2013570 | ref=harv }}</ref> Its genus name reflects the experience of one of the earliest groups of [[Europe]]ans to see the birds in their native [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]; the travellers thought the birds were so beautiful that they named them after mythical [[nymphs]]. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''hollandicus'' refers to [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], a historic name for Australia.\n\nIts biological relationships were for a long time uncertain; it is now placed in a [[monotypic]] [[subfamily]] Nymphicinae, but was sometimes in the past classified among the [[Platycercinae]], the broad-tailed parrots. This issue was settled with molecular studies. A 1984 study of protein allozymes signalled its closer relationship to cockatoos than to parrots,<ref name=adams1984>{{cite journal|year=1984|title=Biochemical systematics of the Australian cockatoos (Psittaciformes: Cacatuinae)|journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |volume=32|issue=3|pages=363\u201377|doi=10.1071/ZO9840363|last1=Adams|first1= M|last2=Baverstock|first2=PR|last3=Saunders|first3=DA|last4=Schodde|first4=R|last5=Smith|first5=GT}}</ref> and [[mtDNA|mitochondrial]] 12S [[rRNA]] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data<ref>Brown, D.M. & Toft, C.A.

Doctoral work, Graduate School of Environmental Earth Science, Hokkaido University, Japan.</ref>\n\nThe cockatiel is now biologically classified as a genuine member of [[Cacatuidae]] on account of sharing all of the cockatoo family's biological features, namely, the erectile crest, a [[gallbladder]], [[powder down]], suppressed cloudy-layer (which precludes the display of blue and green structural colours), and facial feathers covering the sides of the beak, all of which are rarely found outside the family Cacatuidae.  This biological relation to other cockatoos is further supported by the existence of at least one documented case of a successful [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a cockatiel and a [[galah]], another cockatoo species.<ref>https://www.talkingbirds.com.au/world-firsts/galatiel-php/world-first-galah-breeds-with-cockatiel</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Brehms Tierleben Cockatiels.jpg|thumb|left|1927 [[Brehms Tierleben]] painting]]\nThe cockatiel's distinctive erectile [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] expresses the animal's emotional state. The crest is dramatically vertical when the cockatiel is startled or excited, gently oblique in its neutral or relaxed state, and flattened close to the head when the animal is angry or defensive. The crest is also held flat but protrudes outward in the back when the cockatiel is trying to appear alluring or flirtatious. In contrast to most cockatoos, the cockatiel has long tail feathers roughly making up half of its total length. At {{convert|30|to|33|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, the cockatiel is the smallest of the cockatoos which are generally larger at between {{convert|30|and|60|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Nymphicus hollandicus -perching on wires -Australia-6a.jpg|thumb|Wild cockatiels, Australia]]\nThe \"normal grey\" or \"wild-type\" cockatiel's plumage is primarily grey with prominent white flashes on the outer edges of each wing. The face of the male is yellow or white, while the face of the female is primarily grey or light grey, and both sexes feature a round orange area on both ears, often referred to as \"cheddar cheeks\". This orange colouration is generally vibrant in adult males, and often quite muted in females. Visual sexing is often possible with this variant of the bird.\n\nCockatiels are relatively vocal birds, the calls of the male being more varied than that of the female. Cockatiels can be taught to sing specific melodies and speak many words and phrases. \n\n=== Sexual dimorphism ===\nAll wild cockatiel chicks and juveniles look female, and are virtually indistinguishable from the time of hatching until their first [[moulting]]. They display horizontal yellow stripes or bars on the [[ventral]] surface of their tail feathers, yellow spots on the ventral surface of the primary flight feathers of their wings, a grey coloured crest and face, and a dull orange patch on each of their cheeks.\n\nAdult cockatiels are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], though to a lesser degree than many other avian species. This is only evident after the first moulting, typically occurring about six to nine months after hatching: the male loses the white or yellow barring and spots on the underside of his tail feathers and wings. The grey feathers on his cheeks and crest are replaced by bright yellow feathers, while the orange cheek patch becomes brighter and more distinct. The face and crest of the female will typically remain mostly grey, though also with an orange cheek patch. Additionally, the female commonly retains the horizontal barring on the underside of her tail feathers.\n\nThe colour in cockatiels is derived from two [[pigment]]s: [[melanin]] (which provides the grey colour in the feathers, eyes, beak, and feet), and [[lipochrome]]s (which provide the yellow colour on the face and tail and the orange colour of the cheek patch). The grey colour of the melanin overrides the yellow and orange of the lipochromes when both are present.\n\nThe melanin content decreases in the face of the males as they mature, allowing the yellow and orange lipochromes to be more visible, while an increase in melanin content in the tail causes the disappearance of the horizontal yellow tail bars.\n\nIn addition to these visible characteristics, the vocalisation of adult males is typically louder and more complex than that of females.\n\n=== Colour mutations ===\n{{Main|Cockatiel colour genetics}}\n[[File:Tiel kiss.png|thumb|Two different-coloured male cockatiels]]\n[[File:Daisy Flower Lutino Cockatiel.jpg|thumb|Female Lutino cockatiel]]\nWorldwide there are currently 22 cockatiel colour [[mutation]]s established in [[aviculture]], of which eight are exclusive to Australia. Mutations in captivity have emerged in various colours, some quite different from those observed in nature. Wild cockatiels are grey with visible differences between males and females. Male grey cockatiels typically have yellow heads while the female has a grey head. Juveniles tend to look like females with pinker beaks. The pied mutation first appeared in California in 1949. This mutation is a blotch of colour on an otherwise solid-coloured bird. For example, this may appear as a grey blotch on a yellow cockatiel.\n\nLutino colouration was first seen in 1958. These birds lack the grey of their wild counterparts and are white to soft yellow. This is a popular colour; due to inbreeding, these cockatiels often have a small bald patch behind their crests. The cinnamon mutation, first seen in the 1950s, is very similar in appearance to the grey; however, these birds have a warmer, browner colouring. Pearling was first seen in 1967. This is seen as a feather of one colour with a different coloured edge, such as grey feathers with yellow tips. This distinctive pattern is on a bird's wings or back. The albino colour mutation is a lack of pigment. These birds are white with red eyes. Fallow cockatiels first appeared sometime in the 1970s. This mutation shows as a bird with cinnamon colouring with yellow sections. Other mutations include emerald/olive, dominant and recessive silver, and mutations exclusive to Australia: Australian fallow, faded (west coast silver), dilute/pastel silver (east coast silver), silver spangle (edged dilute), platinum, suffused (Australian olive), and pewter. Other mutations, such as face altering mutations, include whiteface, pastelface, dominant yellow cheek, sex-linked yellow cheek, gold cheek, creamface, and the Australian yellow cheek.\n\nCockatiel colour mutations can become even more complex as one bird can have multiple colour mutations. For example, a yellow lutino cockatiel may have pearling \u2013 white spots on its back and wings. This is a double mutation. An example of a quadruple mutation would be cinnamon cockatiel with yellowface colouring with pearling and pied markings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/completebookofco00grin|url-access=registration|title=The Complete Book of Cockatiels|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-87605-178-8|last1=Grindol|first1=Diane|date=1998-07-20}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Nymphicus hollandicus MWNH 0584.JPG|left|thumb|Egg, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]\n{{Listen|filename=Nymphicus hollandicus call.ogg|title=Cockatiel calling|description= Recording of a cockatiel|format=[[ogg]]}}\n\nCockatiels are native to Australia, where they are found largely in [[arid]] or [[semi-arid]] country but always close to water. Largely nomadic, the species will move to where food and water is available.<ref name=\"ausmus\" /> They are typically seen in pairs or small flocks.<ref name=\"ausmus\" /> Sometimes, hundreds will flock around a single body of water.

They are prized as household [[pet]]s and [[companion parrot]]s throughout the world and are relatively easy to breed. As a caged bird, cockatiels are second in popularity only to the [[budgerigar]].<ref name=\"ausmus\">{{cite web |url=http://birdsinbackyards.net/species/Nymphicus-hollandicus |title=Factsheets:Cockatiel |accessdate=2008-08-30 |publisher=[[Australian Museum]] }}</ref>\n\nThe cockatiel is the only member of the [[genus]] '''''Nymphicus'''''. It was previously considered a crested parrot or small cockatoo; however, more recent molecular studies have assigned it to its own subfamily, ''Nymphicinae''. It is, therefore, now classified as the smallest of the [[Cacatuidae]] (cockatoo family). Cockatiels are native to Australia, favouring the Australian wetlands, scrublands, and bushlands.\n\n== Taxonomy and etymology ==\nOriginally described by Scottish writer and naturalist [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1793 as ''Psittacus hollandicus'', the cockatiel (or cockateel)  was moved to its own genus, ''Nymphicus'', by [[Johann Georg Wagler|Wagler]] in 1832.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Assis | first=V.D.L. | last2=Carvalho | first2=T.S.G. | last3=Pereira | first3=V.M. | last4=Freitas | first4=R.T.F. | last5=Saad | first5=C.E.P. | last6=Costa | first6=A.C. | last7=Silva | first7=A.A.A. | last8=Assis | first8=V.D.L. | last9=Carvalho | first9=T.S.G. | last10=Pereira | first10=V.M. | last11=Freitas | first11=R.T.F. | last12=Saad | first12=C.E.P. | last13=Costa | first13=A.C. | last14=Silva | first14=A.A.A. | title=Environmental enrichment on the behavior and welfare of cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) | journal=Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterin\u00e1ria e Zootecnia | volume=68 | issue=3 | date=1990-01-06 | issn=0102-0935 | doi=10.1590/1678-4162-8747 | pages=562\u2013570 | ref=harv }}</ref> Its genus name reflects the experience of one of the earliest groups of [[Europe]]ans to see the birds in their native [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]; the travellers thought the birds were so beautiful that they named them after mythical [[nymphs]]. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''hollandicus'' refers to [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], a historic name for Australia.\n\nIts biological relationships were for a long time uncertain; it is now placed in a [[monotypic]] [[subfamily]] Nymphicinae, but was sometimes in the past classified among the [[Platycercinae]], the broad-tailed parrots. This issue was settled with molecular studies. A 1984 study of protein allozymes signalled its closer relationship to cockatoos than to parrots,<ref name=adams1984>{{cite journal|year=1984|title=Biochemical systematics of the Australian cockatoos (Psittaciformes: Cacatuinae)|journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |volume=32|issue=3|pages=363\u201377|doi=10.1071/ZO9840363|last1=Adams|first1= M|last2=Baverstock|first2=PR|last3=Saunders|first3=DA|last4=Schodde|first4=R|last5=Smith|first5=GT}}</ref> and [[mtDNA|mitochondrial]] 12S [[rRNA]] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data<ref>Brown, D.M. & Toft, C.A.

The unique, [[parakeet]] (meaning long-tailed parrot) morphological feature is a consequence of the decrease in size and accompanying change of [[ecological niche]].\n\nSequence analysis of [[intron]] 7 of the [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] ''?''-[[fibrinogen]] gene, on the other hand, indicates that it may yet be distinct enough as to warrant recognition of the Nymphicinae rather than inclusion of the genus in the [[Calyptorhynchinae]].<ref>Astuti, Dwi (2004): [http://www.ees.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/J/study/17RA/dwi.pdf A phylogeny of Cockatoos (Aves: Psittaciformes) inferred from DNA sequences of the seventh intron of Nuclear ?-fibrinogen gene]. Doctoral work, Graduate School of Environmental Earth Science, Hokkaido University, Japan.</ref>\n\nThe cockatiel is now biologically classified as a genuine member of [[Cacatuidae]] on account of sharing all of the cockatoo family's biological features, namely, the erectile crest, a [[gallbladder]], [[powder down]], suppressed cloudy-layer (which precludes the display of blue and green structural colours), and facial feathers covering the sides of the beak, all of which are rarely found outside the family Cacatuidae.  This biological relation to other cockatoos is further supported by the existence of at least one documented case of a successful [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a cockatiel and a [[galah]], another cockatoo species.<ref>https://www.talkingbirds.com.au/world-firsts/galatiel-php/world-first-galah-breeds-with-cockatiel</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Brehms Tierleben Cockatiels.jpg|thumb|left|1927 [[Brehms Tierleben]] painting]]\nThe cockatiel's distinctive erectile [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] expresses the animal's emotional state. The crest is dramatically vertical when the cockatiel is startled or excited, gently oblique in its neutral or relaxed state, and flattened close to the head when the animal is angry or defensive. The crest is also held flat but protrudes outward in the back when the cockatiel is trying to appear alluring or flirtatious. In contrast to most cockatoos, the cockatiel has long tail feathers roughly making up half of its total length. At {{convert|30|to|33|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, the cockatiel is the smallest of the cockatoos which are generally larger at between {{convert|30|and|60|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Nymphicus hollandicus -perching on wires -Australia-6a.jpg|thumb|Wild cockatiels, Australia]]\nThe \"normal grey\" or \"wild-type\" cockatiel's plumage is primarily grey with prominent white flashes on the outer edges of each wing. The face of the male is yellow or white, while the face of the female is primarily grey or light grey, and both sexes feature a round orange area on both ears, often referred to as \"cheddar cheeks\". This orange colouration is generally vibrant in adult males, and often quite muted in females. Visual sexing is often possible with this variant of the bird.\n\nCockatiels are relatively vocal birds, the calls of the male being more varied than that of the female. Cockatiels can be taught to sing specific melodies and speak many words and phrases. \n\n=== Sexual dimorphism ===\nAll wild cockatiel chicks and juveniles look female, and are virtually indistinguishable from the time of hatching until their first [[moulting]]. They display horizontal yellow stripes or bars on the [[ventral]] surface of their tail feathers, yellow spots on the ventral surface of the primary flight feathers of their wings, a grey coloured crest and face, and a dull orange patch on each of their cheeks.\n\nAdult cockatiels are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], though to a lesser degree than many other avian species. This is only evident after the first moulting, typically occurring about six to nine months after hatching: the male loses the white or yellow barring and spots on the underside of his tail feathers and wings. The grey feathers on his cheeks and crest are replaced by bright yellow feathers, while the orange cheek patch becomes brighter and more distinct. The face and crest of the female will typically remain mostly grey, though also with an orange cheek patch. Additionally, the female commonly retains the horizontal barring on the underside of her tail feathers.\n\nThe colour in cockatiels is derived from two [[pigment]]s: [[melanin]] (which provides the grey colour in the feathers, eyes, beak, and feet), and [[lipochrome]]s (which provide the yellow colour on the face and tail and the orange colour of the cheek patch). The grey colour of the melanin overrides the yellow and orange of the lipochromes when both are present.\n\nThe melanin content decreases in the face of the males as they mature, allowing the yellow and orange lipochromes to be more visible, while an increase in melanin content in the tail causes the disappearance of the horizontal yellow tail bars.\n\nIn addition to these visible characteristics, the vocalisation of adult males is typically louder and more complex than that of females.\n\n=== Colour mutations ===\n{{Main|Cockatiel colour genetics}}\n[[File:Tiel kiss.png|thumb|Two different-coloured male cockatiels]]\n[[File:Daisy Flower Lutino Cockatiel.jpg|thumb|Female Lutino cockatiel]]\nWorldwide there are currently 22 cockatiel colour [[mutation]]s established in [[aviculture]], of which eight are exclusive to Australia. Mutations in captivity have emerged in various colours, some quite different from those observed in nature. Wild cockatiels are grey with visible differences between males and females. Male grey cockatiels typically have yellow heads while the female has a grey head. Juveniles tend to look like females with pinker beaks. The pied mutation first appeared in California in 1949. This mutation is a blotch of colour on an otherwise solid-coloured bird. For example, this may appear as a grey blotch on a yellow cockatiel.\n\nLutino colouration was first seen in 1958. These birds lack the grey of their wild counterparts and are white to soft yellow. This is a popular colour; due to inbreeding, these cockatiels often have a small bald patch behind their crests. The cinnamon mutation, first seen in the 1950s, is very similar in appearance to the grey; however, these birds have a warmer, browner colouring. Pearling was first seen in 1967. This is seen as a feather of one colour with a different coloured edge, such as grey feathers with yellow tips. This distinctive pattern is on a bird's wings or back. The albino colour mutation is a lack of pigment. These birds are white with red eyes. Fallow cockatiels first appeared sometime in the 1970s. This mutation shows as a bird with cinnamon colouring with yellow sections. Other mutations include emerald/olive, dominant and recessive silver, and mutations exclusive to Australia: Australian fallow, faded (west coast silver), dilute/pastel silver (east coast silver), silver spangle (edged dilute), platinum, suffused (Australian olive), and pewter. Other mutations, such as face altering mutations, include whiteface, pastelface, dominant yellow cheek, sex-linked yellow cheek, gold cheek, creamface, and the Australian yellow cheek.\n\nCockatiel colour mutations can become even more complex as one bird can have multiple colour mutations. For example, a yellow lutino cockatiel may have pearling \u2013 white spots on its back and wings. This is a double mutation. An example of a quadruple mutation would be cinnamon cockatiel with yellowface colouring with pearling and pied markings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/completebookofco00grin|url-access=registration|title=The Complete Book of Cockatiels|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-87605-178-8|last1=Grindol|first1=Diane|date=1998-07-20}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Nymphicus hollandicus MWNH 0584.JPG|left|thumb|Egg, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]\n{{Listen|filename=Nymphicus hollandicus call.ogg|title=Cockatiel calling|description= Recording of a cockatiel|format=[[ogg]]}}\n\nCockatiels are native to Australia, where they are found largely in [[arid]] or [[semi-arid]] country but always close to water.
