Beta-catenin acts as a co-factor that alters the activity of the transcription factor tcf-3 from repressing to activating, which initiates the synthesis of gene products critical for mesoderm differentiation and gastrulation.  Furthermore, mesoderm has the capability to induce the growth of other structures, such as the [[neural plate]], the precursor to the nervous system.\n\n==Definition==\nThe mesoderm  is one of the three germinal layers that appears in the third week of [[embryonic development]]. It is formed through a process called [[gastrulation]]. There are three important components, the [[paraxial mesoderm]], the [[intermediate mesoderm]] and the [[lateral plate mesoderm]]. The paraxial mesoderm forms the [[somitomere]]s, which give rise to [[mesenchyme]] of the head and organize into [[somite]]s in occipital and caudal segments, and give rise to [[sclerotome]]s (cartilage and bone), and [[somite|dermatome]]s (subcutaneous tissue of the skin).<ref name=\"RFB2004Mesoderm\" /><ref name=\"Langman's Medical Embryology 2010\"/> Signals for somite differentiation are derived from surroundings structures, including the [[notochord]], [[neural tube]] and [[epidermis]]. The intermediate mesoderm connects the paraxial mesoderm with the lateral plate, eventually it differentiates into urogenital structures consisting of the kidneys, gonads, their associated ducts, and the adrenal glands. The lateral plate mesoderm give rise to the heart, blood vessels and blood cells of the circulatory system as well as to the mesodermal components   of the limbs.<ref name=\"Scott-2010\">{{cite book|author=Scott, Gilbert|title=Developmental biology|publisher=Sinauer Associates|edition=ninth|place=USA|year= 2010}}</ref>\n\nSome of the mesoderm derivatives include the muscle (smooth, cardiac and skeletal), the muscles of the tongue (occipital somites), the pharyngeal arches muscle (muscles of mastication, muscles of facial expressions), connective tissue, dermis and subcutaneous layer of the [[skin]], [[bone]] and cartilage, dura mater, [[endothelium]] of [[blood vessels]], [[red blood cells]], [[white blood cells]], and microglia, the kidneys and the adrenal cortex.<ref name=\"Dudek-2009\">{{cite book|author=Dudek, Ronald W.|title=High-yield.

This process begins with formation of a primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast.<ref name=\"NCBI-2013\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10085/|title=Paraxial Mesoderm: The somites and their derivatives|publisher=NCBI|accessdate =April 15, 2013}}</ref> The cells of the layers move between the epiblast and hypoblast and begin to spread laterally and cranially. The cells of the epiblast move toward the primitive streak and slip beneath it in a process called invagination.  Some of the migrating cells displace the hypoblast and create the endoderm, and others migrate between the endoderm and the epiblast to create the mesoderm. The remaining cells form the ectoderm. After that, the epiblast and the hypoblast establish contact with the extraembryonic mesoderm until they cover the yolk sac and amnion. They move onto either side of the prechordal plate. The prechordal cells migrate to the midline to form the notochordal plate. The chordamesoderm is the central region of trunk mesoderm.<ref name=\"Scott-2010\" /> This forms the notochord which induces the formation of the neural tube and establishes the anterior-posterior body axis. The notochord extends beneath the neural tube from the head to the tail. The mesoderm moves to the midline until it covers the notochord, when the mesoderm cells proliferate they form the paraxial mesoderm.  In each side, the mesoderm remains thin and is known as the lateral plate.  The intermediate mesoderm lies between the paraxial mesoderm and the lateral plate.\nBetween days 13 and 15, the proliferation of extraembryonic mesoderm, primitive streak and embryonic mesoderm take place. The notochord process occurs between days 15 and 17. Eventually, the development of the notochord canal and the axial canal takes place between days 17 and 19 when the first three somites are formed.<ref name=\"Drews-1993\">{{cite book|author= Drew, Ulrich|title=Color atlas of embryology|publisher=Thieme|place=German|year=1993}}</ref>\n\n==Paraxial mesoderm==\nDuring the third week, the paraxial mesoderm is organized into segments. If they appear in the cephalic region and grow with cephalocaudal direction, they are called somitomeres. If they appear in the cephalic region but establish contact with the neural plate, they are known as [[neuromere]]s, which later will form the mesenchyme in the head. The somitomeres organize into somites which grow in pairs. In the fourth week the somites lose their organization and cover the notochord and spinal cord to form the backbone. In the fifth week, there are 4 occipital somites, 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 8 to 10 coccygeal that will form the axial skeleton.  Somitic derivatives are determined by local signaling between adjacent embryonic tissues, in particular the neural tube, notochord, surface ectoderm and the somitic compartments themselves.<ref name=\"Yusuf-2006\">{{cite journal|last=Yusuf|first=Faisal|title=The eventful somite: Patterning, fate determination and cell division in the somite|journal=Anatomy and Embryology|volume=211 Suppl 1|year=2006|pages=21\u201330|doi=10.1007/s00429-006-0119-8|pmid=17024302|id={{ProQuest|212010706}}}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  The correct specification of the deriving tissues, skeletal, cartilage, endothelia and connective tissue is achieved by a sequence of morphogenic changes of the paraxial mesoderm, leading to the three transitory somitic compartments: dermomyotome, myotome and sclerotome.

The notochord and the neural tube activate the protein SHH  which helps the somite to form its sclerotome. The cells of the sclerotome express the protein PAX1 that induces the cartilage and bone formation. The neural tube activates the protein WNT1 that expresses PAX 2 so the somite creates the myotome and dermatome. Finally, the neural tube also secretes neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), so that the somite creates the dermis. Boundaries for each somite are regulated by [[retinoic acid]] (RA) and a combination of FGF8 and WNT3a.<ref name=\"RFB2004Mesoderm\" /><ref name=\"Langman's Medical Embryology 2010\"/><ref name=\"Cunningham and Duester\">{{cite journal |last1=Cunningham |first1=T.J.|last2=Duester|first2=G.|title=Mechanisms of retinoic acid signalling and its roles in organ and limb development |journal=Nat.

This shows that these cells are multipotent cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=N.L.|last2=Robbins KR|first2=K.R.|last3=Dhara SK|first3=S.K.|last4=West FD|first4=F.D.|last5=Stice SL.|first5=S.L.|title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm-like epithelium transitions to mesenchymal progenitor cells|journal=Tissue Engineering.

The splanchnic depends on a continuous layer that covers the yolk sac. The two layers cover the intraembryonic cavity.  The parietal layer together with overlying ectoderm forms the lateral body wall folds. The visceral layer forms the walls of the gut tube. Mesoderm cells of the parietal layer form the mesothelial membranes or serous membranes which line the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial cavities.<ref name=\"RFB2004Mesoderm\" /><ref name=\"Langman's Medical Embryology 2010\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Axial mesoderm]] (also known as ''chordamesoderm'') which gives rise to the [[notochord]] \n* [[Histogenesis]]\n* [[Organogenesis]]\n* [[Triploblastic]]\n* [[List of human cell types derived from the germ layers]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- * {{cite book|chapter=|title=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|url=}} -->\n\n* {{cite book|author=Gurdon, J.B.|chapter=The formation of mesoderm and muscle in ''Xenopus''|editor=Zagris, Nikolas|title=Organization of the early vertebrate embryo|publisher=Springer|year=1995|isbn=978-0-306-45132-4|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lFH7RnOHsRAC&pg=PA51|display-editors=etal}}\n* {{cite book|editors=Kenderew, John Cowdery & Lawrence, Eleanor|chapter=Mesoderm Induction|title=The encyclopedia of molecular biology|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=1994|isbn=978-0-632-02182-6|page=541|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh0L795oupYC&pg=PA541}}\n* {{cite book|author=Liu, Shu Q.|chapter=Early Embryonic Organ Development|title=Bioregenerative engineering: principles and applications|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2007|isbn=978-0-471-70907-7|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZGJRWRmxRwC&pg=PA346}}\n* {{cite book|chapter=Establishment of the Basic Body Plan|title=Veterinary embryology|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-1147-8|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4C0TUeR7mUC&pg=PA54|author=McGeady, Thomas A.|display-authors=etal}}\n* {{cite book|author=Pappaioannou, Virginia, E.|chapter=Early Embryonic Mesoderm Development|editor=Lanza, Robert Paul|title=Handbook of stem cells, Volume 1|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-12-436642-8|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0JzbMVo3RAC&pg=PA276}}\n* {{cite book|editors=Sherman, Lawrence S.|title=Human embryology|edition=3rd|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2001|isbn=978-0-443-06583-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5qw-jiMc44C|display-editors=etal}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|mesoderm}}\n* {{EmbryologyUNSW|Notes/skmus6}}\n* {{EmbryologyTemple|EMBIII97/sld039}}\n\n{{Embryology}}\n\n[[Category:Germ layers]]\n[[Category:Developmental biology]]\n[[Category:Embryology]]\n[[Category:Gastrulation]]\n", "name_user": "37.236.232.8", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Name and groub)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoderm"}

It asks pairs of poets, many of whom have never met before, to produce new collaborative works for the night of the reading, with no criteria other than a time limit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeanpoetryfestival.com/camarade|title=Camarade|website=European Poetry Festival|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nAttempting to innovative the possibilities of collaboration and the written word, Enemies has involved over 700 practitioners in nearly 20 countries and received awards from [[Arts Council England]], [[Jerwood Charitable Foundation]], the [[British Council]], [[Creative Scotland]], [[Arts Council of Wales]], [[Conaculta]] and others.\n\nFowler is lecturer in Creative Writing and English Literature at [[Kingston University]], has taught at Tate Modern, [[Poetry School]] and [[The Photographers' Gallery|Photographer's Gallery]], among others.\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\n==== Poetry ====\n\n* The Wrestlers (Kingston University Press 2018)\n* The Guide to Being Bear Aware (Shearsman Books 2017)\n* The Rottweiler's guide to the Dog Owner (Eyewear press 2014)\n* Enemies: the selected collaborations of SJ Fowler (Penned in the Margins 2013)\n* Minimum Security Prison Dentistry (Anything Anymore Anywhere press 2011)\n\n==== Art books ====\n\n* Aletta Ocean's Alphabet Empire (Hesterglock Press 2018)\n* I fear my best work behind me (Stranger Press 2017)\n\n== Selected collaborators ==\n\n* [[Aase Berg]]\n* [[Jerome Rothenberg]]\n* [[Joe Dunthorne]]\n* [[Sam Riviere]]\n* [[Eir\u00edkur \u00d6rn Nor\u00f0dahl|Eirikur Orn Norddahl]]\n* [[Morten S\u00f8ndergaard]]\n* [[Zo\u00eb Skoulding]]\n* [[J.R.
