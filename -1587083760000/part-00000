Still, the mission spent a week studying the falls, hoping to find a point where an average-sized river boat might be able to pass the cataracts or otherwise, whether the establishment of a lateral channel would be feasible.

The focus had shifted to scientific recordings, surveys and notes on topography, physical geography, demographics and social observations of the river valley. De Carn\u00e9 reflects on the shifting of motivations for the expedition:\n<blockquote>The principal results which were expected from the exploration of the Mekong may be summed up in a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being our hope that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the [[Chao Phraya River|Me\u00efnam]] and the Mekong? To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was the first part of the programme the commission had to carry out.[sic]</blockquote>\n\nIn April, the mission arrived in [[Luang Prabang]], where the exhausted men rested for four weeks and obtained their passports for China. However, the difficult territories ahead and the region's politically unstable principalities affected appropriate future travel plans and the men's confidence. After much debate over the further route, the expedition left on 25 May 1867. \n\n===From Burma to China===\n\nOn 18 June 1867 the men, whose health and condition had begun to seriously deteriorate and among whom [[malaria]] was widespread, left Siamese controlled territory and entered the Upper Mekong sector under Burmese rule. Shortly after the expedition left the Mekong and proceeded - on a much slower pace - on foot and oxcarts, that had been hired from local merchants. Progress, though was dragged even more by uncooperative official agents and the unpredictable local lords, who sporadically denied or granted permission to set foot on their lands. \n\nIn August de Lagr\u00e9e left the by now seriously disease-ridden and feverish men behind at the village of ''Mong Yawng'' in order to seek diplomatic support from the influential [[Shan States]] who might help with the mission's progress.<ref name=\"Osborne2007\">{{cite book|author=Milton Osborne|title=The Mekong: Turbulent Past, Uncertain Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxF2kH04WKgC&pg=PT166|date=1 December 2007|publisher=Open Road + Grove/Atlantic|isbn=978-0-8021-9609-5|pages=166\u2013}}</ref>       \n\nReunited after three weeks the expedition progressed and reached the borderlands to China by the end of September. On 7 October 1867 they crossed the Mekong via ferry, seeing the river for the last time. Once in China desperately needed clothes, shoes and equipment could be acquired and herbal remedies improved the men's health. At Ssu-Mao, [[Yunnan]] the travellers were yet again halted, this time by the [[Panthay Rebellion]]. \n\nThey now pondered over the dilemma of whether to continue exploring the Mekong, or to conduct a commercial survey of southern China and abandon the river. Carn\u00e9 wrote: \"We were compelled by the Mussulman revolt to leave the Mekong, in order to gain the Sonkoi; to abandon geography, and solve a problem of more practical and immediate importance\" and \"At this moment, the commercial question won out as the impracticalities of continuing the scientific mapping of the Mekong became apparent.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/0910/cjw/cjwlog.html |title=History of Muslims under Chinese Rule, since 1839 |last=Choi |first=Jiwon |date=June 2009 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>  \n \nAfter several months strenuous march in torrential rains, through thick jungle, over rugged and mountainous terrain on {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} high narrow rocky paths, the men arrived at the [[Yangtze]] River in January 1868. \n\nAt Hui-tse, south of [[Dali City|Dali]] the mission reached a tragic climax in the death of the expedition's leader, de Lagr\u00e9e, who succumbed to [[Dysentery]] on 12 March 1868.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://server2.honweb.com/mhm-friend/cgi-bin/mhm-friend?a=d&d=Friend18761002-01.2.16&cl=&srpos=0&dliv=none&st=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121138/http://server2.honweb.com/mhm-friend/cgi-bin/mhm-friend?a=d&d=Friend18761002-01.2.16&cl=&srpos=0&dliv=none&st=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- |url-status=dead|archive-date=April 2, 2015 |title=Explorations in Cambodia |journal=[[The Friend (Quaker)|The Friend]] |volume=33 |issue=10 |edition=1 |date=October 2, 1876 |accessdate=April 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nFrancis Garnier took command of the mission after de Lagr\u00e9e's death and safely led the expedition to Shanghai and the Chinese coast via the [[Yangtze]] River and finally set sail for the [[South China Sea]] towards Saigon, where they arrived on 29 June 1868.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/226122/Francis-Garnier |title=Francis Garnier |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://vorasith.online.fr/cambodge/livres/garnier.htm   |title=Exploration Travel Indochina | publisher= Vorasith Online |date= |accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences and conclusions==\n\n[[File:Map of Siam and French Indochina.svg|thumb|right|<center>French and British colonial expansion in Southeast-Asia</center>]]\n[[File:The French Wolf and The Siamese Lamb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cartoon showing the \"French wolf\" looking across the Mekong towards the \"Siamese lamb\"]]\n[[File:Voyage d'exploration en Indo-Chine - 1885 Francis Garmier 14.jpg|thumb|<center>The ancient city of [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]] with a rhinoceros roaming the ruins (Delaporte) </center>]]\nThe records made over the course of two years were published in four large volumes.

The focus had shifted to scientific recordings, surveys and notes on topography, physical geography, demographics and social observations of the river valley. De Carn\u00e9 reflects on the shifting of motivations for the expedition:\n<blockquote>The principal results which were expected from the exploration of the Mekong may be summed up in a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being our hope that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the [[Chao Phraya River|Me\u00efnam]] and the Mekong? To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was the first part of the programme the commission had to carry out.[sic]</blockquote>\n\nIn April, the mission arrived in [[Luang Prabang]], where the exhausted men rested for four weeks and obtained their passports for China. However, the difficult territories ahead and the region's politically unstable principalities affected appropriate future travel plans and the men's confidence. After much debate over the further route, the expedition left on 25 May 1867. \n\n===From Burma to China===\n\nOn 18 June 1867 the men, whose health and condition had begun to seriously deteriorate and among whom [[malaria]] was widespread, left Siamese controlled territory and entered the Upper Mekong sector under Burmese rule. Shortly after the expedition left the Mekong and proceeded - on a much slower pace - on foot and oxcarts, that had been hired from local merchants. Progress, though was dragged even more by uncooperative official agents and the unpredictable local lords, who sporadically denied or granted permission to set foot on their lands. \n\nIn August de Lagr\u00e9e left the by now seriously disease-ridden and feverish men behind at the village of ''Mong Yawng'' in order to seek diplomatic support from the influential [[Shan States]] who might help with the mission's progress.<ref name=\"Osborne2007\">{{cite book|author=Milton Osborne|title=The Mekong: Turbulent Past, Uncertain Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxF2kH04WKgC&pg=PT166|date=1 December 2007|publisher=Open Road + Grove/Atlantic|isbn=978-0-8021-9609-5|pages=166\u2013}}</ref>       \n\nReunited after three weeks the expedition progressed and reached the borderlands to China by the end of September. On 7 October 1867 they crossed the Mekong via ferry, seeing the river for the last time. Once in China desperately needed clothes, shoes and equipment could be acquired and herbal remedies improved the men's health. At Ssu-Mao, [[Yunnan]] the travellers were yet again halted, this time by the [[Panthay Rebellion]]. \n\nThey now pondered over the dilemma of whether to continue exploring the Mekong, or to conduct a commercial survey of southern China and abandon the river. Carn\u00e9 wrote: \"We were compelled by the Mussulman revolt to leave the Mekong, in order to gain the Sonkoi; to abandon geography, and solve a problem of more practical and immediate importance\" and \"At this moment, the commercial question won out as the impracticalities of continuing the scientific mapping of the Mekong became apparent.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/0910/cjw/cjwlog.html |title=History of Muslims under Chinese Rule, since 1839 |last=Choi |first=Jiwon |date=June 2009 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>  \n \nAfter several months strenuous march in torrential rains, through thick jungle, over rugged and mountainous terrain on {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} high narrow rocky paths, the men arrived at the [[Yangtze]] River in January 1868. \n\nAt Hui-tse, south of [[Dali City|Dali]] the mission reached a tragic climax in the death of the expedition's leader, de Lagr\u00e9e, who succumbed to [[Dysentery]] on 12 March 1868.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://server2.honweb.com/mhm-friend/cgi-bin/mhm-friend?a=d&d=Friend18761002-01.2.16&cl=&srpos=0&dliv=none&st=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121138/http://server2.honweb.com/mhm-friend/cgi-bin/mhm-friend?a=d&d=Friend18761002-01.2.16&cl=&srpos=0&dliv=none&st=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- |url-status=dead|archive-date=April 2, 2015 |title=Explorations in Cambodia |journal=[[The Friend (Quaker)|The Friend]] |volume=33 |issue=10 |edition=1 |date=October 2, 1876 |accessdate=April 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nFrancis Garnier took command of the mission after de Lagr\u00e9e's death and safely led the expedition to Shanghai and the Chinese coast via the [[Yangtze]] River and finally set sail for the [[South China Sea]] towards Saigon, where they arrived on 29 June 1868.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/226122/Francis-Garnier |title=Francis Garnier |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://vorasith.online.fr/cambodge/livres/garnier.htm   |title=Exploration Travel Indochina | publisher= Vorasith Online |date= |accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences and conclusions==\n\n[[File:Map of Siam and French Indochina.svg|thumb|right|<center>French and British colonial expansion in Southeast-Asia</center>]]\n[[File:The French Wolf and The Siamese Lamb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cartoon showing the \"French wolf\" looking across the Mekong towards the \"Siamese lamb\"]]\n[[File:Voyage d'exploration en Indo-Chine - 1885 Francis Garmier 14.jpg|thumb|<center>The ancient city of [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]] with a rhinoceros roaming the ruins (Delaporte) </center>]]\nThe records made over the course of two years were published in four large volumes.

The timing suggests they were each conceived after his wife had become pregnant and was sexually unavailable to him.<ref>[http://www.motopera.org/mg_ed/educational/HS_HistoricalMGarner.html Steven Weisenburger, \"A Historical Margaret Garner\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520031508/http://www.motopera.org/mg_ed/educational/HS_HistoricalMGarner.html |date=2011-05-20 }}, Michigan Opera Theatre, accessed 20 April 2009.  \"Bertram Wyatt-Brown reminds us, Southern men commonly referred to their pregnant wives' last trimester or so when they were sexually unavailable as 'the gander months' because it was supposedly natural, and to some extent informally countenanced, for them to seek intimate 'comfort' with unmarried women or with enslaved women, if they owned any.\"</ref>\n\nIn a contemporary account, abolitionist Levi Coffin described Margaret Garner at her arrest as \"a [[mulatto]], about five feet high ... she appeared to be about twenty-one or twenty-three years old.\"  She also had an old scar on the left side of her forehead and cheek, which she said had been caused when a \"White man struck me.\"  Her two boys were about four and six years old, Mary, two and a half, and Priscilla, an infant.\n\n==Escape and trial==\nOn January 28, 1856, Robert and a pregnant Margaret, together with family members, escaped and fled to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], along with several other enslaved families. Robert had stolen his master's horses and sleigh along with his gun. Seventeen people were reported to have been in their party.  In the coldest winter in 60 years, the [[Ohio River]] had frozen.  The group crossed the ice just west of [[Covington, Kentucky]] at daybreak, and escaped to Cincinnati, then divided to avoid detection.\n\nRobert and Margaret and their four children, with Robert's father Simon and his wife Mary, made their way to a former slave, Margaret's Uncle Joe Kite,<ref name=\"motopera.org\"/> who lived along Mill Creek, below Cincinnati. The other nine slaves in their party reached safe houses in Cincinnati and eventually escaped via the [[Underground Railroad]] to [[Canada]].  Kite went to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Levi Coffin]] for advice on how to get the group to safety.  Coffin agreed to help them escape the city, and told Kite to take the Garner group further west of the city, where many free blacks lived, and to wait until night.\n\n[[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Slave catchers]] and [[U.S. Marshal]]s found the Garners barricaded inside Kite's house before he returned.  They surrounded the property, then stormed the house.  Robert Garner fired several shots and wounded at least one [[Deputy U.S. Marshal|deputy marshal]].  Margaret killed her two-year-old daughter with a butcher knife rather than see the child returned to slavery.  She had wounded her other children, preparing to kill them and herself, when she was subdued by the posse.\n\nThe entire group was taken to jail.  The subsequent trial lasted for two weeks, after which the judge deliberated another two weeks.  It was \"the longest and most complicated case of its kind.\"<ref name=\"motopera.org\"/>  A typical fugitive slave hearing would have lasted less than a day.  The core issue was whether the Garners would be tried as persons, and charged with the murder of their daughter, or tried as property under the Fugitive Slave Law.  The defense attorney argued that Ohio's right to protect its citizens should take precedence.  The slave catchers and owner argued for the precedence of federal law over the state.\n\nThe defense attempted to prove that Margaret had been liberated under a former law covering slaves taken into free states for other work.  Her attorney proposed that she be charged with murder so that the case would be tried in a free state (understanding that the governor would later pardon her).  The prosecuting attorney argued that the federal [[Fugitive Slave Law]] took precedence over state murder charges.  Over a thousand people turned out each day to watch the proceedings, lining the streets outside the courthouse.  Five hundred men were deputized to maintain order in the town.\n\nThe presiding judge, Pendery, ruled that Federal fugitive warrants had supervening authority. Defense attorney John Jolliffe then tried a strategy of arguing that the Fugitive Slave Act violated the guarantee of religious freedom, by compelling citizens to participate in evil by returning slaves.  In the end, Pendery rejected this argument.\n\nOn the closing day of the trial, the antislavery activist [[Lucy Stone]] took the stand to defend her earlier conversations with Margaret (the prosecution had complained.) She spoke about the interracial sexual relationship that underlay part of the case:\n\n<blockquote>Recalling to everyone's memory the faces of Margaret's children, and of A. K. Gaines, Stone told the packed courtroom: \"The faded faces of the Negro children tell too plainly to what degradation the female slaves submit. Rather than give her daughter to that life, she killed it. If in her deep maternal love she felt the impulse to send her child back to God, to save it from coming woe, who shall say she had no right not to do so?\"<ref name=\"motopera.org\"/></blockquote>\n\nMargaret Garner's actions were driven by her master's abuse and the well known abuse slaves faced nationwide. Women were known to practice infanticide to alleviate the burden of slavery from their children; however, in Garner's case her children faced even more opposition due to their being [[mulatto]]s. Mulattoes were seen as a threat as well as a disgrace among the plantation and white families, because the birth of mulatto children highlighted infidelity within the slave-owning families. They reminded the family of a perceived sin, and were often beaten or sold. Garner underwent drastic measures to protect her child not only from the cruelty of the institution of [[slavery]], but from the double threat, due to the child's mulatto status.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKissack|first=Patricia C. McKissack, Fredrick|title=Sojourner Truth ain't I a woman?|year=1995|publisher=Sundance Publishers & Distributors|location=Littleton, MA|isbn=0590446916}}</ref>\n\nMargaret Garner was not immediately tried for murder, but was forced to return to a slave state along with Robert and their youngest child, a daughter of about nine months old. When Ohio authorities got an extradition warrant for Garner to try her for murder, they were unable to find her for the arrest.  Archibald K. Gaines, her owner, kept moving her between cities in Kentucky.  Ohio officials missed finding Margaret in Covington by a few hours, missed getting her again in Frankfort, and finally caught up with her master in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], only to discover that he had put the slaves on a boat headed for his brother's plantation in [[Arkansas]].\n\n==Sent South==\n''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' reported on March 11, 1856, that the steamboat ''Henry Lewis'', on which the Garners were being transported, began to sink after colliding with another boat.  Margaret Garner and her baby daughter were thrown overboard during the collision.  The baby drowned.  It was reported that Margaret was happy that her baby had died and that she tried to drown herself.  She and Robert were kept in Arkansas only a short time before being sent to Gaines' family friends in [[New Orleans]] as a household servant.  The Garners then disappeared from sight.\n\nIn 1870 a reporter from ''The Cincinnati Chronicle'' found Robert Garner and gathered more about his life.  Robert and Margaret Garner had worked in [[New Orleans]], and in 1857 were sold to Judge Dewitt Clinton Bonham for plantation labor at [[Tennessee Landing, Mississippi]].  Robert said Margaret had died in 1858 of [[typhoid fever]], in an epidemic in the valley.  He said that before she died, Margaret urged him to \"never marry again in slavery, but to live in hope of freedom.\"<ref name=\"motopera.org\"/>\n\n==Memorialized==\nGarner's life story was the basis of [[Frances Harper]]'s 1859 poem \"Slave Mother: A Tale of Ohio\".  She also inspired Kentucky painter [[Thomas Satterwhite Noble]]'s 1867 painting, ''The Modern Medea''; [[Medea]] was a woman in Greek mythology who killed her own children.  The painting, owned by Cincinnati manufacturer [[Procter and Gamble]] Corporation, was presented as a gift to the [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]], where it remains on permanent display.  Learning about Margaret Garner's trial and story, [[Toni Morrison]] was inspired to write her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' (1987).\n\nYears later the [[Michigan Opera Theatre]], [[Cincinnati Opera]] and the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]] commissioned the opera ''[[Margaret Garner (opera)|Margaret Garner]]''.  Morrison wrote the libretto and music was composed by the [[Grammy]]-winning [[Richard Danielpour]].  The opera premiered in those three cities in 2005.  It set records for opera attendance in Cincinnati.  In Detroit, it played to unusually large audiences with a high number of [[African American]]s.  It was sold out in Philadelphia.  Mezzo-soprano [[Denyce Graves]] sang Margaret Garner, and baritone [[Rod Gilfry]] sang the role of the plantation owner Edward Gaines.\n\nIn 2008, documentary filmmaker, Joanne Caputo, winner of the PBS Independent Lens Audience Award for her 2005 \"On A Roll: Family, Disability and the American Dream,\" self-published \"Margaret Garner: Diversity and Depth of Love.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.margaretgarnerbook.com/|title=Margaret Garner Books|website=Margaret Garner Books}}</ref> The non-fiction two-book manuscript includes a memoir, in which Caputo describes her paranormal experiences with Margaret Garner and a claim of being Garner's reincarnated murdered daughter.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of slaves]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Coffin, Levi.

Margaret killed her two-year-old daughter with a butcher knife rather than see the child returned to slavery.  She had wounded her other children, preparing to kill them and herself, when she was subdued by the posse.\n\nThe entire group was taken to jail.  The subsequent trial lasted for two weeks, after which the judge deliberated another two weeks.  It was \"the longest and most complicated case of its kind.\"<ref name=\"motopera.org\"/>  A typical fugitive slave hearing would have lasted less than a day.  The core issue was whether the Garners would be tried as persons, and charged with the murder of their daughter, or tried as property under the Fugitive Slave Law.  The defense attorney argued that Ohio's right to protect its citizens should take precedence.  The slave catchers and owner argued for the precedence of federal law over the state.\n\nThe defense attempted to prove that Margaret had been liberated under a former law covering slaves taken into free states for other work.  Her attorney proposed that she be charged with murder so that the case would be tried in a free state (understanding that the governor would later pardon her).  The prosecuting attorney argued that the federal [[Fugitive Slave Law]] took precedence over state murder charges.  Over a thousand people turned out each day to watch the proceedings, lining the streets outside the courthouse.  Five hundred men were deputized to maintain order in the town.\n\nThe presiding judge, Pendery, ruled that Federal fugitive warrants had supervening authority. Defense attorney John Jolliffe then tried a strategy of arguing that the Fugitive Slave Act violated the guarantee of religious freedom, by compelling citizens to participate in evil by returning slaves.  In the end, Pendery rejected this argument.\n\nOn the closing day of the trial, the antislavery activist [[Lucy Stone]] took the stand to defend her earlier conversations with Margaret (the prosecution had complained.) She spoke about the interracial sexual relationship that underlay part of the case:\n\n<blockquote>Recalling to everyone's memory the faces of Margaret's children, and of A. K. Gaines, Stone told the packed courtroom: \"The faded faces of the Negro children tell too plainly to what degradation the female slaves submit. Rather than give her daughter to that life, she killed it. If in her deep maternal love she felt the impulse to send her child back to God, to save it from coming woe, who shall say she had no right not to do so?\"<ref name=\"motopera.org\"/></blockquote>\n\nMargaret Garner's actions were driven by her master's abuse and the well known abuse slaves faced nationwide. Women were known to practice infanticide to alleviate the burden of slavery from their children; however, in Garner's case her children faced even more opposition due to their being [[mulatto]]s. Mulattoes were seen as a threat as well as a disgrace among the plantation and white families, because the birth of mulatto children highlighted infidelity within the slave-owning families. They reminded the family of a perceived sin, and were often beaten or sold. Garner underwent drastic measures to protect her child not only from the cruelty of the institution of [[slavery]], but from the double threat, due to the child's mulatto status.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKissack|first=Patricia C. McKissack, Fredrick|title=Sojourner Truth ain't I a woman?|year=1995|publisher=Sundance Publishers & Distributors|location=Littleton, MA|isbn=0590446916}}</ref>\n\nMargaret Garner was not immediately tried for murder, but was forced to return to a slave state along with Robert and their youngest child, a daughter of about nine months old. When Ohio authorities got an extradition warrant for Garner to try her for murder, they were unable to find her for the arrest.  Archibald K. Gaines, her owner, kept moving her between cities in Kentucky.  Ohio officials missed finding Margaret in Covington by a few hours, missed getting her again in Frankfort, and finally caught up with her master in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], only to discover that he had put the slaves on a boat headed for his brother's plantation in [[Arkansas]].\n\n==Sent South==\n''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' reported on March 11, 1856, that the steamboat ''Henry Lewis'', on which the Garners were being transported, began to sink after colliding with another boat.  Margaret Garner and her baby daughter were thrown overboard during the collision.  The baby drowned.  It was reported that Margaret was happy that her baby had died and that she tried to drown herself.  She and Robert were kept in Arkansas only a short time before being sent to Gaines' family friends in [[New Orleans]] as a household servant.  The Garners then disappeared from sight.\n\nIn 1870 a reporter from ''The Cincinnati Chronicle'' found Robert Garner and gathered more about his life.  Robert and Margaret Garner had worked in [[New Orleans]], and in 1857 were sold to Judge Dewitt Clinton Bonham for plantation labor at [[Tennessee Landing, Mississippi]].  Robert said Margaret had died in 1858 of [[typhoid fever]], in an epidemic in the valley.  He said that before she died, Margaret urged him to \"never marry again in slavery, but to live in hope of freedom.\"<ref name=\"motopera.org\"/>\n\n==Memorialized==\nGarner's life story was the basis of [[Frances Harper]]'s 1859 poem \"Slave Mother: A Tale of Ohio\".  She also inspired Kentucky painter [[Thomas Satterwhite Noble]]'s 1867 painting, ''The Modern Medea''; [[Medea]] was a woman in Greek mythology who killed her own children.  The painting, owned by Cincinnati manufacturer [[Procter and Gamble]] Corporation, was presented as a gift to the [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]], where it remains on permanent display.  Learning about Margaret Garner's trial and story, [[Toni Morrison]] was inspired to write her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' (1987).\n\nYears later the [[Michigan Opera Theatre]], [[Cincinnati Opera]] and the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]] commissioned the opera ''[[Margaret Garner (opera)|Margaret Garner]]''.  Morrison wrote the libretto and music was composed by the [[Grammy]]-winning [[Richard Danielpour]].  The opera premiered in those three cities in 2005.  It set records for opera attendance in Cincinnati.  In Detroit, it played to unusually large audiences with a high number of [[African American]]s.  It was sold out in Philadelphia.  Mezzo-soprano [[Denyce Graves]] sang Margaret Garner, and baritone [[Rod Gilfry]] sang the role of the plantation owner Edward Gaines.\n\nIn 2008, documentary filmmaker, Joanne Caputo, winner of the PBS Independent Lens Audience Award for her 2005 \"On A Roll: Family, Disability and the American Dream,\" self-published \"Margaret Garner: Diversity and Depth of Love.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.margaretgarnerbook.com/|title=Margaret Garner Books|website=Margaret Garner Books}}</ref> The non-fiction two-book manuscript includes a memoir, in which Caputo describes her paranormal experiences with Margaret Garner and a claim of being Garner's reincarnated murdered daughter.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of slaves]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Coffin, Levi.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being strong, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages.<ref name=\"Davis.2010\">{{cite journal| issn = 1068-3844| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = 11\u201314| last = Davis| first = Laurel R.| title = The problems with Native American mascots| journal = Multicultural Education| accessdate = October 10, 2017|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ649928}}</ref> In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship.

Gaffney|James Gaffney]], was a member of New York City's political machine, [[Tammany Hall]], one of the societies formed to honor [[Tamanend]], a chief of the [[Lenape|Delaware]]. The team that moved to become the [[Washington Redskins]] in 1937 was originally also known as the Boston Braves since the [[American football|football]] and baseball teams played at [[Braves Field]]. After moving to [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a \"red\" identifier while retaining the Braves \"Indian Head\" logo. While defenders of the Redskins often cite coach [[William Henry Dietz]], who claimed Native American heritage, to justify the name; the use of Native American names and imagery by this [[National Football League|NFL]] team began in 1932 before hiring Dietz in 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/wasbos/bosskins.html|title=The Boston Redskins|accessdate=2013-04-24| website=Sports Ecyclopedia}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Cleveland Indians]]' name originated from a request by club owner [[Charles Somers]] to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the \"Naps\" following the departure of their star player [[Nap Lajoie]] after the 1914 season.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Baseball writers select \"Indians\" as the best name to apply to the former Naps |url= |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 17, 1915 |access-date= |quote=With the going of Nap Lajoie to the Athletics, a new name had to be selected for the Cleveland American league club.

Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process.

The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending upon the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the [[Cleveland Indians]]' [[Chief Wahoo]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=5437|title=Coalition Of Religious Investors Fight Baseball Team Logo|date=July 10, 1997|accessdate=January 18, 2013|website=Catholic Culture}}</ref> the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as [[Redskin]]s or [[Squaw]]s;<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dodgecountynews.com/archives/7311-Squaws-are-region-runner-upshost-first-round-of-state-Friday.html| title=Squaws are region runner-ups:host first round of state Friday| date=February 15, 2017 | accessdate=March 6, 2017| website=The Dodge County News Online}}</ref> or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures, such as the tomahawk chop.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/5/1/4292152/yeah-the-tomahawk-chop-bugs-me-heres-why| title=Yeah, the \"Tomahawk Chop\" bugs me.

A local example is [[Washington High School (Sioux Falls, South Dakota)|Washington High School]] in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. Many Native American images have been removed, and the \"Warriors\" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a \"circle of courage\" logo with eagle feathers and has also \"updated\" the murals of Chief [[Hollow Horn Bear]] in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at [[Sinte Gleska University]] in Mission, stated: \"We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity.\" However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.argusleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/stu-whitney/2015/01/17/whitney-sioux-falls-team-indian-nickname/21925163/| title=Does Washington High have nickname problem?| first=Stu| last=Whitney| date=January 17, 2015| website=Argus Leader}}</ref>\n\n===Teams outside the Americas===\n{{further|List of sports team names and mascots derived from indigenous peoples}}\nNative American names and images are used by teams in other countries, generally those playing American-style sports and copying the imagery of American teams.
