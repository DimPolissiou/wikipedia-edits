The [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] found on the iPhone 8, has been replaced with Haptic Touch on the iPhone SE. It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. Smart HDR is featured on the rear camera, but not the front camera.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly due to being based on the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR single-camera systems.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13|iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|IPhone SE (2nd generation)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n\n| logo         = IPhone SE (2nd generation) wordmark.svg\n| logosize     = <!-- include \"px\" - Uses users default image size if omitted -->\n| image        = IPhone SE (2nd generation) white vector.svg\n| imagesize    = \n| alt          = \n| caption      = <!-- This is indeed white!

By practical extension, the list includes the [[stadtholder]]s of the House of Orange Nassau since 1556. However, they were voted into office by and were civil servants and generals of the semi-independent provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]] and cannot be seen as monarchs. From [[William IV, Prince of Orange|William IV]] they were the direct male line ancestors of later monarchs when the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|monarchy]] was established in 1813 (first as a Sovereign Principality, but in 1815 as a Kingdom).\n\n==Dutch Republic==\nThe origin of the Dutch monarchy can be traced back to the appointment of [[William the Silent|William I, Prince of Orange]] as stadtholder of [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[Zeeland]] and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] in 1559 by [[Philip II of Spain]]. However, he was removed from office and became the leader of the [[Dutch Revolt]]. Consequently, the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] appointed him as stadtholder of both rebelling provinces, Holland and Zeeland, in 1572. During the Dutch Revolt, most of the Dutch provinces declared their independence with the [[Act of Abjuration]], signed on 26 July 1581 in [[The Hague]] in conformation with the decision made by the States-General. The representative function of the stadtholder became obsolete in the rebellious northern Netherlands \u2013 the feudal Lord himself having been abolished \u2013 but the office nevertheless continued in these provinces who now united themselves into the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. All stadtholders after William I were drawn from his descendants or the descendants of his brother, who were also the descendants of his granddaughter [[Countess Albertine Agnes of Nassau|Albertina Agnes of Nassau-Orange]].\n\nIn 1795 the Republic was overthrown by [[Napoleon]] and replaced with the [[Batavian Republic]]. In 1806 Napoleon abolished the new republic and made his brother King of Holland. However, in 1810 Napoleon invaded the Netherlands and annexed them to France. In 1813, Allied forces drove out the French. The Dutch called back William Frederick, the son of the last stadtholder, to head the new government.  He was proclaimed \"sovereign prince\". In 1815, he raised the Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]].

arms of the Netherlands]]]]\nThis is a '''list of monarchs of the Netherlands''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Koningen der Nederlanden''). By practical extension, the list includes the [[stadtholder]]s of the House of Orange Nassau since 1556. However, they were voted into office by and were civil servants and generals of the semi-independent provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]] and cannot be seen as monarchs. From [[William IV, Prince of Orange|William IV]] they were the direct male line ancestors of later monarchs when the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|monarchy]] was established in 1813 (first as a Sovereign Principality, but in 1815 as a Kingdom).\n\n==Dutch Republic==\nThe origin of the Dutch monarchy can be traced back to the appointment of [[William the Silent|William I, Prince of Orange]] as stadtholder of [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[Zeeland]] and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] in 1559 by [[Philip II of Spain]]. However, he was removed from office and became the leader of the [[Dutch Revolt]]. Consequently, the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] appointed him as stadtholder of both rebelling provinces, Holland and Zeeland, in 1572. During the Dutch Revolt, most of the Dutch provinces declared their independence with the [[Act of Abjuration]], signed on 26 July 1581 in [[The Hague]] in conformation with the decision made by the States-General. The representative function of the stadtholder became obsolete in the rebellious northern Netherlands \u2013 the feudal Lord himself having been abolished \u2013 but the office nevertheless continued in these provinces who now united themselves into the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. All stadtholders after William I were drawn from his descendants or the descendants of his brother, who were also the descendants of his granddaughter [[Countess Albertine Agnes of Nassau|Albertina Agnes of Nassau-Orange]].\n\nIn 1795 the Republic was overthrown by [[Napoleon]] and replaced with the [[Batavian Republic]]. In 1806 Napoleon abolished the new republic and made his brother King of Holland. However, in 1810 Napoleon invaded the Netherlands and annexed them to France. In 1813, Allied forces drove out the French. The Dutch called back William Frederick, the son of the last stadtholder, to head the new government.  He was proclaimed \"sovereign prince\".

It comprises the entire prefecture of [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]] and elects three Councillors every three years by [[single non-transferable vote]].\n\nBetween 1947 and 1995 Kanagawa was represented by four Councillors. The 1994 electoral reform reapportioned the number of seats, increasing the number of Councillors in Miyagi, Saitama, Kanagawa and Gifu by two each (one per election) and reducing the number in Hokkaido, Hyogo and Fukuoka. Kanagawa, like most two-member districts, had often split seats between the two major parties, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) and the [[Japan Socialist Party]] (JSP). Following another reapportionment in the 2007 election when Tokyo gained an additional Councillor Kanagawa has the lowest electoral weight for the House of Councillors countrywide. As of September 2009, 7,301,452 voters were registered in Kanagawa.<ref>[[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications]]: [http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000045936.pdf \u5e73\u6210\uff12\uff11\u5e74\uff19\u6708\uff12\u65e5\u73fe\u5728\u9078\u6319\u4eba\u540d\u7c3f\u53ca\u3073\u5728\u5916\u9078\u6319\u4eba\u540d\u7c3f\u767b\u9332\u8005\u6570] {{in lang|ja}} (includes foreign residents registered as voters in Kanagawa)</ref>\n\n== Councillors from Kanagawa ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

The 1994 electoral reform reapportioned the number of seats, increasing the number of Councillors in Miyagi, Saitama, Kanagawa and Gifu by two each (one per election) and reducing the number in Hokkaido, Hyogo and Fukuoka. Kanagawa, like most two-member districts, had often split seats between the two major parties, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) and the [[Japan Socialist Party]] (JSP). Following another reapportionment in the 2007 election when Tokyo gained an additional Councillor Kanagawa has the lowest electoral weight for the House of Concillors countrywide.

He was a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and served 16 terms in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from 1945 to 1947 and from 1949 to 1978.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nDelaney was born in [[New York City]] on March 19, 1901. He attended public school in [[Long Island City, Queens, New York|Long Island City]], Queens. In 1931, he graduated from the law department of [[Saint John's University, New York|St. John's College]] in Brooklyn with a [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] and was admitted to the bar in 1933. He worked as an [[District attorney (county)|assistant district attorney]] of Queens County from 1936 until his election in 1944.\n\n===Early Career in Congress===\nDelaney was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[79th United States Congress|79th Congress]]. In 1944, much of what was the 6th district was shifted to the [[New York's 10th congressional district|10th district]] taking Rep. [[Andrew Lawrence Somers]] with it. Delaney ran for the open 6th district seat and defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Otto Schuler.\n\nDelaney suffered his only defeat in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1946|1946]]. With President [[Harry Truman]]'s popularity at a low point, the Republican Party gained 55 seats with [[Robert Nodar Jr.]] defeating Delaney. He regained the seat two years later in 1948 and won 14 consecutive elections afterwards.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, after a series of lurid magazine articles and Hollywood films helped to sensationalize youth gangs and violence, Delaney was one of the first congressmen to author legislation banning automatic-opening or [[switchblade]] knives in 1954.  On April 17, 1958, Delaney stated, \"Every day our newspapers report numerous muggings and attacks, most of them involving knives. Can we sit by complacently and ignore the bloodshed in our streets?\"<ref name=\"LEV\">Levine, Bernard R., ''[http://www.knife-expert.com/schr-pb.txt The Switchblade Menace]'', OKCA Newsletter (1993)</ref><ref>Knife World (August 1990)</ref><ref name=\"CON\">Switchblade Knives: Hearing, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Eighty-fifth Congress, Minutes of the Second Session, April 17, 1958</ref>  The ban on switchblade knives was eventually enacted into law as the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958.<ref name=\"CON\"/>  Rep. Delaney and other congressmen supporting the Switchblade Knife Act believed that by stopping the importation and interstate sales of automatic knives (effectively halting sales of new switchblades), the law would reduce youth gang violence by blocking access to what had become a symbolic weapon.<ref name=\"LEV\"/><ref name=\"CON\"/><ref>Knife World Magazine (August 1990)</ref>  However, while switchblade imports, domestic production, and sales to lawful owners soon ended, later legislative research demonstrated that youth gang violence rates had in fact rapidly increased, as gang members turned to firearms instead of knives.<ref>Clark, Charles S., ''Youth Gangs Worsening Violence Prompts Crackdowns and Community Mobilization'', Congressional Quarterly 1, 11 October 1991, pp. 753-776</ref>\n\nDelaney later became chairman of a Select Committee to conduct an investigation and study of the use of chemicals, pesticides, and insecticides in and with respect to food products (81st and 82nd Congresses).

He was a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and served 16 terms in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from 1945 to 1947 and from 1949 to 1978.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nDelaney was born in [[New York City]] on March 19, 1901. He attended public school in [[Long Island City, Queens, New York|Long Island City]], Queens. In 1931, he graduated from the law department of [[Saint John's University, New York|St. John's College]] in Brooklyn with a [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] and was admitted to the bar in 1933. He worked as an [[District attorney (county)|assistant district attorney]] of Queens County from 1936 until his election in 1944.\n\n===Early Career in Congress===\nDelaney was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[79th United States Congress|79th Congress]]. In 1944, much of what was the 6th district was shifted to the [[New York's 10th congressional district|10th district]] taking Rep. [[Andrew Lawrence Somers]] with it. Delaney ran for the open 6th district seat and defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Otto Schuler.\n\nDelaney suffered his only defeat in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1946|1946]]. With President [[Harry Truman]]'s popularity at a low point, the Republican Party gained 55 seats with [[Robert Nodar Jr.]] defeating Delaney. He regained the seat two years later in 1948 and won 14 consecutive elections afterwards.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, after a series of lurid magazine articles and Hollywood films helped to sensationalize youth gangs and violence, Delaney was one of the first congressmen to author legislation banning automatic-opening or [[switchblade]] knives in 1954.  On April 17, 1958, Delaney stated, \"Every day our newspapers report numerous muggings and attacks, most of them involving knives. Can we sit by complacently and ignore the bloodshed in our streets?\"<ref name=\"LEV\">Levine, Bernard R., ''[http://www.knife-expert.com/schr-pb.txt The Switchblade Menace]'', OKCA Newsletter (1993)</ref><ref>Knife World (August 1990)</ref><ref name=\"CON\">Switchblade Knives: Hearing, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Eighty-fifth Congress, Minutes of the Second Session, April 17, 1958</ref>  The ban on switchblade knives was eventually enacted into law as the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958.<ref name=\"CON\"/>  Rep. Delaney and other congressmen supporting the Switchblade Knife Act believed that by stopping the importation and interstate sales of automatic knives (effectively halting sales of new switchblades), the law would reduce youth gang violence by blocking access to what had become a symbolic weapon.<ref name=\"LEV\"/><ref name=\"CON\"/><ref>Knife World Magazine (August 1990)</ref>  However, while switchblade imports, domestic production, and sales to lawful owners soon ended, later legislative research demonstrated that youth gang violence rates had in fact rapidly increased, as gang members turned to firearms instead of knives.<ref>Clark, Charles S., ''Youth Gangs Worsening Violence Prompts Crackdowns and Community Mobilization'', Congressional Quarterly 1, 11 October 1991, pp. 753-776</ref>\n\nDelaney later became chairman of a Select Committee to conduct an investigation and study of the use of chemicals, pesticides, and insecticides in and with respect to food products (81st and 82nd Congresses).  He was noted for adding the 1958 [[Delaney clause]] to the 1938 [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] to ban [[carcinogen]]s as [[food additive]]s, Committee on Rules (95th Congress).\n\n===Later Career in Congress===\nHis political views tracked those of his constituents, which included many working class, but socially conservative Catholic voters.<ref name=\"Battle\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/05/archives/a-democratic-battle-in-queens-regulars-are-fighting-regulars-in-a.html |title=A Democratic Battle in Queens |work=The New York Times |date=1972-05-05}}</ref> Voters who supported [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and [[John F.

Written by [[Michael Schur]] and directed by [[Greg Daniels]], the episode first aired in the United States on February 9, 2006 on [[NBC]]. The episode guest stars [[Craig Anton]], [[Andy Buckley]], [[Charles Esten]], and [[Conan O'Brien]] as himself.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company.  In this episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) travels to New York City to give a presentation, but accidentally tells everyone that he \"hooked up\" with [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]). Meanwhile, the rest of the office is jealous when [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis Lapin]]'s ([[Phyllis Smith]]) boyfriend [[Bob Vance (fictional character)|Bob Vance]] gives her several gifts. Also, [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) gives [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) a [[bobblehead]] model of himself.\n\nThe episode was the first time that Pam Beesly (Fischer) had a different hairstyle. In addition, many of the scenes were improvised, including Dwight's line about ham and Michael's antics in New York. \"Valentine's Day\" received mostly positive reviews from television critics and was watched by 8.95 million viewers.\n\n==Plot==\nBefore a [[Valentine's Day]] meeting at the corporate offices in [[New York City, New York|New York City]] with [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) and the new [[chief financial officer|CFO]] [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] ([[Andy Buckley]]), [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]), defending Jan to the other branch managers, lets slip that he and Jan \"hooked up\". At the meeting, Michael shows a sentimental video about the staff at his branch called \"The Faces of Scranton\" before providing data on the financial status of his branch as asked. Craig ([[Craig Anton]]), from the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] branch, is completely unprepared for the meeting and attempts to cover for it by insinuating that Jan is giving Michael preferential treatment because of the supposed sexual encounter between them. Due to Wallace hearing this accusation, Jan is convinced that her career is over. Michael defuses the situation by telling the CFO that it was a bad joke and Jan is innocent of any unethical behavior. As Michael leaves, Jan kisses him in the elevator, but groans when she realizes they were caught on camera.\n\nBack in the office, [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) gives [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) a \"Dwight\" [[bobblehead]] doll, and he gives her a key to his home. [[Phyllis Lapin]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) is inundated with gifts from her boyfriend [[Bob Vance (fictional character)|Bob Vance]] ([[Robert R. Shafer]]), while [[Pam Beesly]] is irritated with [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] ([[David Denman]]) when the only thing he gives her for Valentine's Day is the promise of the \"best sex of [her] life\". [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) is forced to listen to, and witness [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) turn [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) down for a date. At the end of the day, Jim tells Pam \"Happy Valentine's Day\" and she watches him longingly as he leaves.\n\n==Production==\nThis episode was the fourth episode of the series directed by series creator [[Greg Daniels]].

Written by [[Michael Schur]] and directed by [[Greg Daniels]], the episode first aired in the United States on February 9, 2006 on [[NBC]]. The episode guest stars [[Craig Anton]], [[Andy Buckley]], [[Charles Esten]], and [[Conan O'Brien]] as himself.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company.  In this episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) travels to New York City to give a presentation, but accidentally tells everyone that he \"hooked up\" with [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]). Meanwhile, the rest of the office is jealous when [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis Lapin]]'s ([[Phyllis Smith]]) boyfriend [[Bob Vance (fictional character)|Bob Vance]] gives her several gifts. Also, [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) gives [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) a [[bobblehead]] model of himself.\n\nThe episode was the first time that Pam Beesly (Fischer) had a different hairstyle. In addition, many of the scenes were improvised, including Dwight's line about ham and Michael's antics in New York. \"Valentine's Day\" received mostly positive reviews from television critics and was watched by 8.95 million viewers.\n\n==Plot==\nBefore a [[Valentine's Day]] meeting at the corporate offices in [[New York City, New York|New York City]] with [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) and the new [[chief financial officer|CFO]] [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] ([[Andy Buckley]]), [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]), defending Jan to the other branch managers, lets slip that he and Jan \"hooked up\". At the meeting, Michael shows a sentimental video about the staff at his branch called \"The Faces of Scranton\" before providing data on the financial status of his branch as asked. Craig ([[Craig Anton]]), from the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] branch, is completely unprepared for the meeting and attempts to cover for it by insinuating that Jan is giving Michael preferential treatment because of the supposed sexual encounter between them. Due to Wallace hearing this accusation, Jan is convinced that her career is over. Michael defuses the situation by telling the CFO that it was a bad joke and Jan is innocent of any unethical behavior. As Michael leaves, Jan kisses him in the elevator, but groans when she realizes they were caught on camera.\n\nBack in the office, [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) gives [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) a \"Dwight\" [[bobblehead]] doll, and he gives her a key to his home. [[Phyllis Lapin]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) is inundated with gifts from her boyfriend [[Bob Vance (fictional character)|Bob Vance]] ([[Robert R. Shafer]]), while [[Pam Beesly]] is irritated with [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] ([[David Denman]]) when the only thing he gives her for Valentine's Day is the promise of the \"best sex of [her] life\". [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) is forced to listen to, and witness [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) turn [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) down for a date. At the end of the day, Jim tells Pam \"Happy Valentine's Day\" and she watches him longingly as he leaves.\n\n==Production==\nThis episode was the fourth episode of the series directed by series creator [[Greg Daniels]].
