In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 ([[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers)<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39.</ref>. \n\nThe Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The [[Battle of Toulouse (844)|Battle of Toulouse of 844]], pitting [[Charles the Bald]] against [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n===County of Toulouse===\n{{further|County of Toulouse}}\n[[File:Raymond IV of Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]] was a leader of the [[First Crusade]]]]\nThe town became the capital of the [[County of Toulouse]] during the [[Carolingian era]].\n\nIn 1096, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the [[First Crusade]], of which he was one of the main leaders.\n\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. \n\nIn 1215 the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nVarious monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs'', were started.

The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Within the Kingdom of France===\n\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the [[kingdom of France]] and declared a \"[[Crown lands of France#Reign of Philip III|royal city]]\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1323 the [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] was created in Toulouse to preserve the [[Lyric poetry|lyric art]] of the [[troubadour]]s by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of [[Occitania|Occitan]] literary culture for the next hundred years. The [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated [[Leys d'amor|treatise]] on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the [[Floral Games]] (''Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux''), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\n\nThe 14th century brought a [[pogrom]] against Toulouse's Jewish population by [[crusades|Crusaders]] in 1320,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/is-it-time-for-the-jews-to-leave-europe/386279/.\" | title=Goldberg, Jeffrey. \"Is it Time for the Jews to Leave Europe?\" The Atlantic.

(Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) \n\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Z\u00e9nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.\n\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched.

In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 ([[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers)<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39.</ref>. \n\nThe Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The [[Battle of Toulouse (844)|Battle of Toulouse of 844]], pitting [[Charles the Bald]] against [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n===County of Toulouse===\n{{further|County of Toulouse}}\n[[File:Raymond IV of Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]] was a leader of the [[First Crusade]]]]\nThe town became the capital of the [[County of Toulouse]] during the [[Carolingian era]].\n\nIn 1096, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the [[First Crusade]], of which he was one of the main leaders.\n\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. \n\nIn 1215 the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nVarious monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs'', were started.

(Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) \n\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Z\u00e9nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.\n\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the [[Rapid transit|underground]] was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourlafrance.com/france-city/toulouse-france/toulouse-politics.htm |title=Toulouse politics information |publisher=Bonjourlafrance.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the [[French Revolution]]; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], then [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] mayor of [[Lourdes]] as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (''[[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel]]'') in Paris, the French equivalent of the American [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].\n\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.\n\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate [[Pierre Cohen]].\n\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n===Mayors===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On an outdoor race 400&nbsp;m track, the race begins on the curve and ends on the [[home straight]], so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race. A slightly shorter race, called the ''[[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadion]]'' and run on a straight track, was the first recorded event at the [[ancient Olympic Games]]. The 200&nbsp;m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint. Similarly to other sprint distances, the 200 m begins from the [[starting blocks]]. When the sprinters adopt the 'set' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometrically preload]] their muscles. This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster.\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere, athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash (201.168&nbsp;m) instead of the 200&nbsp;m (218.723 yards), though the distance is now obsolete. The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200&nbsp;m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfhs.org/web/2006/12/converting_times_from_english_to.aspx |title=Converting Times from English to Metric Distances |publisher=National Federation of State High School Associations |accessdate=26 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316150553/http://www.nfhs.org/web/2006/12/converting_times_from_english_to.aspx |archivedate=16 March 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> but other conversion methods exist.  Another obsolete version of this race is the [[200 metres straight]], which was run on tracks that contained such a straight. Initially, when the International Amateur Athletic Association (now known as the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]]) started to ratify world records in 1912, only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration. In 1951, the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track. In 1976, the straight record was discarded.\n\nThe race attracts runners from other events, primarily the [[100 metres]], wishing to double up and claim both titles. This feat has been achieved by men eleven times at the [[Olympic Games]]: by [[Archie Hahn]] in 1904, [[Ralph Craig]] in 1912, [[Percy Williams (sprinter)|Percy Williams]] in 1928, [[Eddie Tolan]] in 1932, [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936, [[Bobby Morrow]] in 1956, [[Valeriy Borzov]] in 1972, [[Carl Lewis]] in 1984, and most recently by Jamaica's [[Usain Bolt]] in 2008, 2012, and 2016.  The double has been accomplished by women seven times: by [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]] in 1948, [[Marjorie Jackson]] in 1952, [[Betty Cuthbert]] in 1956, [[Wilma Rudolph]] in 1960, [[Renate Stecher]] in 1972, [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] in 1988, and [[Elaine Thompson]] in 2016.  [[Marion Jones]] finished first in both races in 2000 but was later disqualified and stripped of her medals after admitting to taking [[performance-enhancing drugs]]. An Olympic double of 200&nbsp;m and [[400 m|400&nbsp;m]] was first achieved by [[Valerie Brisco-Hooks]] in 1984, and later by [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]] from the United States and [[Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec]] of France both in 1996. [[Usain Bolt]] is the only man to repeat as Olympic champion, [[B\u00e4rbel W\u00f6ckel]] (n\u00e9e Eckert) and [[Veronica Campbell-Brown]] are the two women who have repeated as Olympic champion.\n\nThe men's world record holder is [[Usain Bolt]] of Jamaica, who ran 19.19 s at the [[2009 IAAF World Championships in Athletics|2009 World Championships]]. The women's world record holder is [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] of the United States, who ran 21.34 s at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]]. The reigning Olympic champions are Usain Bolt and [[Elaine Thompson]] (JAM).

On an outdoor race 400&nbsp;m track, the race begins on the curve and ends on the [[home straight]], so a combination of techniques are needed to successfully run the race. A slightly shorter race, called the ''[[Stadion (ancient sports)|stadion]]'' and run on a straight track, was the first recorded event at the [[ancient Olympic Games]]. The 200&nbsp;m places more emphasis on speed endurance than shorter sprint distances as athletes predominantly rely on anaerobic energy system during the 200 m sprint. Similarly to other sprint distances, the 200 m begins from the [[starting blocks]]. When the sprinters adopt the 'set' position in the blocks they are able to adopt a more efficient starting posture and [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometrically preload]] their muscles. This enables them to stride forwards more powerfully when the race begins and start faster.\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere, athletes previously ran the 220-yard dash (201.168&nbsp;m) instead of the 200&nbsp;m (218.723 yards), though the distance is now obsolete. The standard adjustment used for the conversion from times recorded over 220 yards to 200&nbsp;m times is to subtract 0.1 seconds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfhs.org/web/2006/12/converting_times_from_english_to.aspx |title=Converting Times from English to Metric Distances |publisher=National Federation of State High School Associations |accessdate=26 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316150553/http://www.nfhs.org/web/2006/12/converting_times_from_english_to.aspx |archivedate=16 March 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> but other conversion methods exist.  Another obsolete version of this race is the [[200 metres straight]], which was run on tracks that contained such a straight. Initially, when the International Amateur Athletic Association (now known as the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]]) started to ratify world records in 1912, only records set on a straight track were eligible for consideration. In 1951, the IAAF started to recognise records set on a curved track. In 1976, the straight record was discarded.\n\nThe race attracts runners from other events, primarily the [[100 metres]], wishing to double up and claim both titles. This feat has been achieved by men eleven times at the [[Olympic Games]]: by [[Archie Hahn]] in 1904, [[Ralph Craig]] in 1912, [[Percy Williams (sprinter)|Percy Williams]] in 1928, [[Eddie Tolan]] in 1932, [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936, [[Bobby Morrow]] in 1956, [[Valeriy Borzov]] in 1972, [[Carl Lewis]] in 1984, and most recently by Jamaica's [[Usain Bolt]] in 2008, 2012, and 2016.  The double has been accomplished by women seven times: by [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]] in 1948, [[Marjorie Jackson]] in 1952, [[Betty Cuthbert]] in 1956, [[Wilma Rudolph]] in 1960, [[Renate Stecher]] in 1972, [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] in 1988, and [[Elaine Thompson]] in 2016.  [[Marion Jones]] finished first in both races in 2000 but was later disqualified and stripped of her medals after admitting to taking [[performance-enhancing drugs]]. An Olympic double of 200&nbsp;m and [[400 m|400&nbsp;m]] was first achieved by [[Valerie Brisco-Hooks]] in 1984, and later by [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]] from the United States and [[Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec]] of France both in 1996. [[Usain Bolt]] is the only man to repeat as Olympic champion, [[B\u00e4rbel W\u00f6ckel]] (n\u00e9e Eckert) and [[Veronica Campbell-Brown]] are the two women who have repeated as Olympic champion.\n\nThe men's world record holder is [[Usain Bolt]] of Jamaica, who ran 19.19 s at the [[2009 IAAF World Championships in Athletics|2009 World Championships]].

Individual colonies can house tens of thousands of bees. Colony activities are organized by [[Bee learning and communication|complex communication]] between individuals, through both [[pheromone]]s and the [[Bee learning and communication#Dance communication|dance language]].\n\nThe western honey bee was one of the first [[Domestication|domesticated]] insects, and it is the primary species maintained by beekeepers to this day for both its honey production and [[pollination]] activities. With human assistance, the western honey bee now occupies every continent except Antarctica. Because of its wide cultivation, this species is the single most important [[pollinator]] for agriculture globally {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}. Western honey bees are threatened by [[List of diseases of the honey bee|pests and diseases]], especially the [[Varroa destructor|''Varroa'' mite]] and [[colony collapse disorder]]. As of 2019, the western honey bee is listed as Data Deficient on the [[IUCN Red List]], as numerous studies indicate that the species has undergone significant declines in Europe; however, it is not clear if they refer to population reduction of wild or managed colonies.

Bees are non-aggressive in this state, since they have no hive to protect.]]\nUnlike most other bee species, western honey bees have [[perennial]] [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] which persist year after year. Because of this high degree of sociality and permanence, western honey bee colonies can be considered [[superorganism]]s. This means that reproduction of the colony, rather than individual bees, is the biologically significant unit. Western honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called \"[[Swarming (honey bee)|swarming]]\".<ref name=\"caron\">{{Cite book|title=Honey bee biology and beekeeping|last=Caron, Dewey M. (Dewey Maurice)|date=2013|publisher=Wicas Press|others=Connor, Lawrence John.|isbn=9781878075291|edition= Revised |location=Kalamazoo, MI|oclc=869287399}}</ref>\n\nIn most climates, western honey bees swarm in the spring and early summer, when there is an abundance of blooming flowers from which to collect [[nectar]] and [[pollen]]. In response to these favorable conditions, the hive creates one to two dozen new queens. Just as the [[pupa]]l stages of these \"daughter queens\" are nearly complete, the old queen and approximately two-thirds of the adult workers leave the colony in a swarm, traveling some distance to find a new location suitable for building a hive (e.g., a hollow tree trunk). In the old colony, the daughter queens often start \"piping\", just prior to emerging as adults,<ref>{{YouTube|VBlI1sgczVY|Piping Queens After a Swarm}}</ref> and, when the daughter queens eventually emerge, they fight each other until only one remains; the survivor then becomes the new queen. If one of the sisters emerges before the others, she may kill her siblings while they are still pupae, before they have a chance to emerge as adults.\n\nOnce she has dispatched all of her rivals, the new queen, the only fertile [[female]], lays all the eggs for the old colony, which her mother has left. Virgin females are able to lay eggs, which develop into males (a trait shared with wasps, bees, and ants because of [[haplodiploidy]]). However, she requires a mate to produce female offspring, which comprise 90% or more of bees in the colony at any given time. Thus, the new queen goes on one or more [[nuptial flight]]s, each time mating with 1\u201317 drones.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Page|first1=Robert E.|title=The Evolution of Multiple Mating Behavior by Honey Bee Queens (Apis mellifera L.)|journal=Genetics|date=1980|pages=253\u2013273|pmc=1214294|pmid=7203010|volume=96|issue=1}}</ref> Once she has finished mating, usually within two weeks of emerging, she remains in the hive, laying eggs.\n\nThroughout the rest of the growing season, the colony produces many workers, who gather pollen and nectar as cold-season food; the average population of a healthy hive in midsummer may be as high as 40,000 to 80,000 bees.  Nectar from flowers is processed by [[worker bee]]s, who evaporate it until the moisture content is low enough to discourage mold, transforming it into [[honey]], which can then be capped over with [[Beeswax|wax]] and stored almost indefinitely. In the temperate climates to which western honey bees are adapted, the bees gather in their hive and wait out the cold season, during which the queen may stop laying. During this time, activity is slow, and the colony consumes its stores of honey used for metabolic heat production in the cold season. In mid- through late winter, the queen starts laying again.  This is probably triggered by [[day length]]. Depending on the subspecies, new queens (and swarms) may be produced every year, or less frequently, depending on local environmental conditions.\n\n===Individual bee life cycle===\n[[File:Bienenwabe mit Eiern und Brut 5.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Full (with larvae) and empty (with eggs) honeycomb cells|Larvae (''left'') and eggs (''right'')]]\nLike other insects that undergo [[holometabolism|complete metamorphosis]], the western honey bee has four distinct life stages: [[egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]] and adult. The complex social structure of western honey bee hives means that all of these life stages occur simultaneously throughout much of the year. The queen deposits a single [[egg]] into each cell of a [[honeycomb]] prepared by worker bees. The egg hatches into a legless, eyeless larva fed by \"nurse\" bees (worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony). After about a week, the larva is sealed in its cell by the nurse bees and begins its pupal stage. After another week, it emerges as an adult bee. It is common for defined regions of the comb to be filled with young bees (also called \"[[brood (honey bee)|brood]]\"), while others are filled with pollen and honey stores.\n\nWorker bees secrete the [[Beeswax|wax]] used to build the hive, clean, maintain and guard it, raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen; the nature of the worker's role varies with age. For the first 10 days of their lives, worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. After this, they begin building comb cells. On days 16 through 20, workers receive nectar and pollen from older workers and store it. After the 20th day, a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager. Although worker bees are usually infertile females, when some subspecies are stressed [[Laying worker bee|they may lay]] fertile eggs. Since workers are not fully sexually developed, they do not mate with [[Drone (bee)|drones]] and thus can only produce haploid (male) offspring.\n\nQueens and workers have a modified [[ovipositor]] called a ''[[Stinger (organ)|stinger]]'', with which they defend the hive. Unlike bees of any other genus and the queens of their own species, the stinger of worker western honey bees is barbed. Contrary to popular belief, a bee does not always die soon after stinging; this misconception is based on the fact that a bee will usually die after stinging a [[human]] or other [[mammal]]. The stinger and its [[venom sac]], with musculature and a ganglion allowing them to continue delivering [[venom]] after they are detached, are designed to [[Autotomy|pull free of the body]] when they lodge. This apparatus (including barbs on the stinger) is thought to have evolved in response to predation by vertebrates, since the barbs do not function (and the stinger apparatus does not detach) unless the stinger is embedded in elastic material. The barbs do not always \"catch\", so a bee may occasionally pull its stinger free and fly off unharmed (or sting again).<ref name=caron/>\n\nAlthough the [[Life expectancy|average lifespan]] of a queen in most subspecies is three to five years, reports from the [[European dark bee|German honey bee]] subspecies (''A. m. mellifera'') previously used for beekeeping indicate that a queen can live up to eight years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Apis_mellifera |title=''Apis mellifera'' |work=AnAge database |publisher=Human Ageing Genomic Resources |accessdate=June 2, 2011}}</ref> Because a queen's store of [[sperm]] is depleted near the end of her life, she begins laying more unfertilized eggs; for this reason, beekeepers often replace queens every year or two.\n\nThe lifespan of workers varies considerably over the year in regions with long winters. Workers born in spring and summer work hard, and live only a few weeks, but those born in autumn remain inside for several months as the colony clusters. On average during the year, about 1% of a colony's worker bees die naturally per day.<ref>Tautz, J.

She is larger than her workers, and has a characteristic rounder, longer abdomen. A female egg can become either a queen or a worker bee. Workers and queen larva are both fed [[royal jelly]], which is high in protein and low in [[flavonoid]], during the first three days. After that, workers are switched to a diet of mixed pollen and nectar (often called \"bee bread\"), while queens continue to receive royal jelly. In the absence of flavonoid and the presence of a high-protein diet, queen bees develop a healthy reproductive tract<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mao |first1=Wenfu |last2=Schuler |first2=Mary A. |last3=Berenbaum |first3=May R. |title=A dietary phytochemical alters caste-associated gene expression in honey bees |journal=Science Advances |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=7 |page=e1500795 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500795|pmid=26601244 |bibcode=2015SciA....1E0795M |pmc=4643792 }}</ref>\u2014a task necessary for maintaining a colony of tens of thousands of daughter-workers.\n\nPeriodically, the colony determines that a new queen is needed. There are three general causes:\n# The hive is filled with honey, leaving little room for new eggs. This will trigger a swarm, where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony and leave the new queen with the other half of the workers to continue the old one.\n# The old queen begins to fail, which is thought to be demonstrated by a decrease in [[Honey bee pheromones#Types of queen honeybee pheromones|queen pheromones]] throughout the hive. This is known as supersedure, and at its end, the old queen is usually killed.\n# The old queen dies suddenly, a situation known as emergency supersedure. The worker bees find several eggs (or larvae) of the appropriate age range and try to develop them into queens. Emergency supersedure can generally be recognized because new queen cells are built out from comb cells, instead of hanging from the bottom of a frame.\nRegardless of the trigger, workers develop the larvae into queens by continuing to feed them royal jelly.\n\n[[File:Queencell 0017.JPG |thumb|right |alt=See caption |Peanut-like queen brood cells extend outward from the brood comb]]\nQueens are not raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the honeycomb. A queen cell is larger and oriented vertically. If workers sense that an old queen is weakening, they produce emergency cells (known as supersedure cells) from cells with eggs or young larvae and which protrude from the comb. When the queen finishes her larval feeding and pupates, she moves into a head-downward position and later chews her way out of the cell. At pupation, workers cap (seal) the cell. The queen asserts control over the worker bees by releasing a complex suite of pheromones, known as queen scent.\n\nAfter several days of orientation in and around the hive, the young queen flies to a drone congregation point&nbsp;\u2013 a site near a clearing and generally about {{convert |30 |ft |m}} above the ground&nbsp;\u2013 where drones from different hives congregate. They detect the presence of a queen in their congregation area by her smell, find her by sight and mate with her in midair; drones can be induced to mate with \"dummy\" queens with the queen pheromone. A queen will mate multiple times, and may leave to mate several days in a row (weather permitting) until her [[spermatheca]] is full.\n\nThe queen lays all the eggs in a healthy colony. The number and pace of egg-laying is controlled by weather, resource availability and specific racial characteristics. Queens generally begin to slow egg-laying in the early fall, and may stop during the winter. Egg-laying generally resumes in late winter when the days lengthen, peaking in the spring. At the height of the season, the queen may lay over 2,500 eggs per day (more than her body mass).\n\nShe fertilizes each egg (with stored sperm from the spermatheca) as it is laid in a worker-sized cell. Eggs laid in drone-sized (larger) cells are left unfertilized; these unfertilized eggs, with half as many genes as queen or worker eggs, develop into drones.\n\n=== Workers ===\nWorkers are females produced by the queen that develop from fertilized, [[diploid]] eggs. Workers are essential for social structure and proper colony functioning. They carry out the main tasks of the colony, because the queen is occupied with only reproducing. These females raise their sister workers and future queens that eventually leave the nest to start their own colony. They also forage and return to the nest with nectar and pollen to feed the young.\n\n===Drones===\n\n[[File:Drohnenpuppen 81b.jpg |thumb|right |alt=Top and bottom views of a developing pupa against a honeycomb |Development of a drone pupa]]\n[[File:Drohnenpuppen 79d.jpg |thumb|right |alt=White and brown pupae filling cells |Pupae of drones]]\n\n{{Main |Drone (bee)}}\n\nDrones are the colony's [[male]] bees. Since they do not have ovipositors, they do not have stingers. Drone honey bees do not forage for nectar or pollen. The primary purpose of a drone is to [[fertilization|fertilize]] a new queen. Many drones mate with a given queen in flight; each dies immediately after mating, since the process of [[insemination]] requires a lethally convulsive effort. Drone honey bees are [[haploid]] (single, unpaired chromosomes) in their genetic structure, and are descended only from their mother (the queen). In temperate regions, drones are generally expelled from the hive before winter, dying of cold and starvation since they cannot forage, produce honey or care for themselves. Given their larger size (1.5 times that of worker bees), inside the hive it is believed that drones may play a significant role in [[thermoregulation]]. Drones are typically located near the center of hive clusters for unclear reasons. It is postulated that it is to maintain [[sperm viability]], which may be compromised at cooler temperatures. Another possible explanation is that a more central location allows drones to contribute to warmth, since at temperatures below {{Convert|25|C|}} their ability to contribute declines.<ref name=Harrison>{{cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=J H |title=Roles of individual honeybee workers and drones in colonial thermogenesis |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |date=1 May 1987 |volume=129 |page=60 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/129/1/53.full.pdf |accessdate=17 October 2014|pmid=3585245 }}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Queen-Worker Conflict}}Queen-worker conflict==\n{{Main|Worker policing}}\nWhen a fertile female worker produces drones, a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen.

Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones decreases the overall productivity of the hive, it increases the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the [[Unit of selection|individual and group levels]] for the stability of the hive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barron | first1 = A. | last2 = Oldroyd | first2 = B | last3 = Ratnieks | first3 = F.L.W. | year = 2001 | title = Worker reproduction in honey-bees (Apis) and the anarchic syndrome: a review | url = | journal = Behavior Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 199\u2013208 | doi = 10.1007/s002650100362 }}</ref>\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, if the queen dies or is removed, reproduction in workers increases because a significant proportion of workers then have activated ovaries.

In that case, workers are related by three-quarters of their genes, and the sons of workers are [[Coefficient of relationship|related]] more than usual to sons of the queen. Then the benefit of policing is negated. Experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social [[hymenoptera]].<ref>Davies, N.R., Krebs, J.R., and West, S.A.

Unlike western honey bees, the [[Apis florea|dwarf honey bee]] does not change the precision of the waggle dance to indicate the type of site that is set as a new goal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Beekman|first=Madeleine|displayauthors=etal|title=Dance Precision of Apis florea\u2014Clues to the Evolution of the Honeybee Dance Language?|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=8|year=2008|pages=1259\u20131265|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0554-z}}</ref> Therefore, western honey bees are better at conveying information than its closely related species and this further supports the notion that the former are more evolved than the latter.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Biewer|first1=Matthias|last2=Schlesinger|first2=Francisca|last3=Hasselmann|first3=Martin|title=The evolutionary dynamics of major regulators for sexual development among Hymenoptera species|journal=Frontiers in Genetics|date=10 April 2015|volume=6|pages=124|doi=10.3389/fgene.2015.00124|pmc=4392698|pmid=25914717}}</ref>\n\nAnother means of communication is the shaking signal, also known as the jerking dance, vibration dance or vibration signal. Although the shaking signal is most common in worker communication, it also appears in reproductive swarming. A worker bee vibrates its body [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsoventrally]] while holding another bee with its front legs. Jacobus Biesmeijer, who examined shaking signals in a forager's life and the conditions leading to its performance, found that experienced foragers executed 92% of observed shaking signals and 64% of these signals were made after the discovery of a food source. About 71% of shaking signals occurred before the first five successful foraging flights of the day; other communication signals, such as the waggle dance, were performed more often after the first five successes. Biesmeijer demonstrated that most shakers are foragers and the shaking signal is most often executed by foraging bees on pre-foraging bees, concluding that it is a transfer message for several activities (or activity levels). Sometimes the signal increases activity, as when active bees shake inactive ones. At other times, such as the end of the day, the signal is an inhibitory mechanism. However, the shaking signal is preferentially directed towards inactive bees. All three forms of communication among honey bees are effective in foraging and task management.\n\n====Pheromones====\n{{Main|Honey bee pheromones}}\nPheromones (substances involved in chemical communication) are essential to honey bee survival.

They argue that western honey bees are able to survive without human help, and in fact require to \"be left at liberty\" to survive. Further, they argue that even if bees could be raised away from the wild, they would still have to fly freely to gather nectar and pollinate plants. Therefore, they argue, beekeeping is \"the exploitation of colonies of a wild insect\", with little more than the provision of a weatherproof cavity for them to nest in.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Bailey |first1= Leslie |last2= Ball |first2= B.

Honey bees do not survive and reproduce individually, but as part of the colony (a [[superorganism]]).\n\nWestern honey bees collect flower nectar and convert it to [[honey]], which is stored in the hive. The nectar, transported in the bees' stomachs, is converted with the addition of [[digestive enzyme]]s and storage in a honey cell for partial dehydration. Nectar and honey provide the energy for the bees' flight muscles and for heating the hive during the winter. Western honey bees also collect [[pollen]] which, after being processed to [[Bee pollen|bee bread]], supplies protein and fat for the [[Brood (honey bee)|bee brood]] to grow. Centuries of [[selective breeding]] by humans have created western honey bees which produce far more honey than the colony needs, and beekeepers (also known as apiarists) harvest the surplus honey.\n\n[[File:Western Honey Bees and Honeycomb Closeup.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Many honey bees on a comb|Honey bees removed from the hive for inspection by a beekeeper]]\n\nBeekeepers provide a place for the colony to live and store honey. There are seven basic types of [[Beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]]: [[skep]]s, [[Langstroth hive]]s, [[top-bar hive]]s, [[box hive]]s, [[log gum]]s, D. E. hives, and miller hives.<ref name=caron/> All U.S. states require beekeepers to use movable frames to allow bee inspectors to check the brood for disease. This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers).\n\nIn cold climates, some beekeepers have kept colonies alive (with varying degrees of success) by moving them indoors for winter. While this can protect the colonies from extremes of temperature and make winter care and feeding more convenient for the beekeeper, it increases the risk of [[Diseases of the honey bee#Nosema|dysentery]] and causes an excessive buildup of [[carbon dioxide]] from the bees' [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Inside wintering has been refined by Canadian beekeepers, who use large barns solely for the wintering of bees; automated ventilation systems assist in carbon dioxide dispersal.\n\n====Products====\n\n[[File:Western honey bee (Apis mellifera).webm|thumb|Western honey bee in a park in Tokyo]] \n[[File:Pumpkin pollination4365.jpg|thumb|alt=Beehives in a planted field|Beehives set up for pollination]]\n[[File:Bee on crocus.ogg|thumb|right|alt=Bee collecting pollen from a blue crocus|Video of western honey bee collecting pollen from blue crocuses]]\n[[File:Apis mellifera flying.jpg|thumb|alt=Bee in flight, carrying pollen in a yellow container large for its size|Western honey bee carrying pollen in a [[Pollen basket|basket]] back to the hive]]\n\n====Honey bees====\nHoney bees are one of the products of a beehive. They can be purchased as mated queens, in spring packages of a queen along with two to five pounds (0.91 to 2.27&nbsp;kg) of honey bees, as nucleus colonies (which include frames of brood), or as full colonies. Commerce of western honey bees dates back to as early as 1622, when the first colonies of bees were shipped from England to Virginia. Modern methods of producing queens and dividing colonies for increase date back to the late 1800s. Honey was extracted by killing off the hive, and bees and bee products were mainly an object of local trade. The first commercial beekeeper in the United States is considered Moses Quinby of New York, who experimented with movable box hives, which allow extraction without killing the hive. The improvements in roads and motor vehicles after World War I allowed commercial beekeepers to expand the size of their businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beesource.com/resources/usda/history-of-beekeeping-in-the-united-states/|title=History of Beekeeping in the United States {{!}} Beesource Beekeeping|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n====Pollination====\n[[File:M\u00e9h (2).jpg|thumb|Western honey bee pollinating a flower]]\n{{Main|Pollination management|List of crop plants pollinated by bees}}\n\nThe western honey bee is an important [[pollinator]] of crops; this service accounts for much of the species' commercial value.

In a number of regions the pollination shortage is addressed by migratory beekeepers, who supply hives during a crop bloom and move them after the blooming period. Commercial beekeepers plan their movements and wintering locations according to anticipated pollination services. At higher latitudes it is difficult (or impossible) to overwinter sufficient bees, or to have them ready for early blooming plants. Much migration is seasonal, with hives wintering in warmer climates and moving to follow the bloom at higher latitudes.\n\nIn [[California]], [[almond]] pollination occurs in February, early in the [[growing season]] before local hives have built up their populations. Almond [[orchard]]s require two hives per acre, or {{Convert|2000|m2||abbr=on|adj=}} per hive, for maximum yield, and pollination is dependent on the importation of hives from warmer climates. [[Almond#Pollination|Almond pollination]] (in February and March in the U.S.) is the largest [[Pollination management|managed pollination]] event in the world, requiring more than one-third of all managed honey bees in the country.

Since 2007, attention has been devoted to [[colony collapse disorder]], a decline in western honey bee colonies in a number of regions.\n\nThe western honey bee is the third insect, after the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] and the [[mosquito]], whose genome has been mapped.

Because of this high degree of sociality and permanence, western honey bee colonies can be considered [[superorganism]]s. This means that reproduction of the colony, rather than individual bees, is the biologically significant unit. Western honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called \"[[Swarming (honey bee)|swarming]]\".<ref name=\"caron\">{{Cite book|title=Honey bee biology and beekeeping|last=Caron, Dewey M.

In response to these favorable conditions, the hive creates one to two dozen new queens. Just as the [[pupa]]l stages of these \"daughter queens\" are nearly complete, the old queen and approximately two-thirds of the adult workers leave the colony in a swarm, traveling some distance to find a new location suitable for building a hive (e.g., a hollow tree trunk). In the old colony, the daughter queens often start \"piping\", just prior to emerging as adults,<ref>{{YouTube|VBlI1sgczVY|Piping Queens After a Swarm}}</ref> and, when the daughter queens eventually emerge, they fight each other until only one remains; the survivor then becomes the new queen. If one of the sisters emerges before the others, she may kill her siblings while they are still pupae, before they have a chance to emerge as adults.\n\nOnce she has dispatched all of her rivals, the new queen, the only fertile [[female]], lays all the eggs for the old colony, which her mother has left. Virgin females are able to lay eggs, which develop into males (a trait shared with wasps, bees, and ants because of [[haplodiploidy]]). However, she requires a mate to produce female offspring, which comprise 90% or more of bees in the colony at any given time. Thus, the new queen goes on one or more [[nuptial flight]]s, each time mating with 1\u201317 drones.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Page|first1=Robert E.|title=The Evolution of Multiple Mating Behavior by Honey Bee Queens (Apis mellifera L.)|journal=Genetics|date=1980|pages=253\u2013273|pmc=1214294|pmid=7203010|volume=96|issue=1}}</ref> Once she has finished mating, usually within two weeks of emerging, she remains in the hive, laying eggs.\n\nThroughout the rest of the growing season, the colony produces many workers, who gather pollen and nectar as cold-season food; the average population of a healthy hive in midsummer may be as high as 40,000 to 80,000 bees.  Nectar from flowers is processed by [[worker bee]]s, who evaporate it until the moisture content is low enough to discourage mold, transforming it into [[honey]], which can then be capped over with [[Beeswax|wax]] and stored almost indefinitely. In the temperate climates to which western honey bees are adapted, the bees gather in their hive and wait out the cold season, during which the queen may stop laying. During this time, activity is slow, and the colony consumes its stores of honey used for metabolic heat production in the cold season. In mid- through late winter, the queen starts laying again.  This is probably triggered by [[day length]]. Depending on the subspecies, new queens (and swarms) may be produced every year, or less frequently, depending on local environmental conditions.\n\n===Individual bee life cycle===\n[[File:Bienenwabe mit Eiern und Brut 5.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Full (with larvae) and empty (with eggs) honeycomb cells|Larvae (''left'') and eggs (''right'')]]\nLike other insects that undergo [[holometabolism|complete metamorphosis]], the western honey bee has four distinct life stages: [[egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]] and adult. The complex social structure of western honey bee hives means that all of these life stages occur simultaneously throughout much of the year. The queen deposits a single [[egg]] into each cell of a [[honeycomb]] prepared by worker bees. The egg hatches into a legless, eyeless larva fed by \"nurse\" bees (worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony). After about a week, the larva is sealed in its cell by the nurse bees and begins its pupal stage. After another week, it emerges as an adult bee. It is common for defined regions of the comb to be filled with young bees (also called \"[[brood (honey bee)|brood]]\"), while others are filled with pollen and honey stores.\n\nWorker bees secrete the [[Beeswax|wax]] used to build the hive, clean, maintain and guard it, raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen; the nature of the worker's role varies with age. For the first 10 days of their lives, worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. After this, they begin building comb cells. On days 16 through 20, workers receive nectar and pollen from older workers and store it. After the 20th day, a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager. Although worker bees are usually infertile females, when some subspecies are stressed [[Laying worker bee|they may lay]] fertile eggs. Since workers are not fully sexually developed, they do not mate with [[Drone (bee)|drones]] and thus can only produce haploid (male) offspring.\n\nQueens and workers have a modified [[ovipositor]] called a ''[[Stinger (organ)|stinger]]'', with which they defend the hive. Unlike bees of any other genus and the queens of their own species, the stinger of worker western honey bees is barbed. Contrary to popular belief, a bee does not always die soon after stinging; this misconception is based on the fact that a bee will usually die after stinging a [[human]] or other [[mammal]]. The stinger and its [[venom sac]], with musculature and a ganglion allowing them to continue delivering [[venom]] after they are detached, are designed to [[Autotomy|pull free of the body]] when they lodge. This apparatus (including barbs on the stinger) is thought to have evolved in response to predation by vertebrates, since the barbs do not function (and the stinger apparatus does not detach) unless the stinger is embedded in elastic material. The barbs do not always \"catch\", so a bee may occasionally pull its stinger free and fly off unharmed (or sting again).<ref name=caron/>\n\nAlthough the [[Life expectancy|average lifespan]] of a queen in most subspecies is three to five years, reports from the [[European dark bee|German honey bee]] subspecies (''A. m. mellifera'') previously used for beekeeping indicate that a queen can live up to eight years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Apis_mellifera |title=''Apis mellifera'' |work=AnAge database |publisher=Human Ageing Genomic Resources |accessdate=June 2, 2011}}</ref> Because a queen's store of [[sperm]] is depleted near the end of her life, she begins laying more unfertilized eggs; for this reason, beekeepers often replace queens every year or two.\n\nThe lifespan of workers varies considerably over the year in regions with long winters. Workers born in spring and summer work hard, and live only a few weeks, but those born in autumn remain inside for several months as the colony clusters. On average during the year, about 1% of a colony's worker bees die naturally per day.<ref>Tautz, J.

She is larger than her workers, and has a characteristic rounder, longer abdomen. A female egg can become either a queen or a worker bee. Workers and queen larva are both fed [[royal jelly]], which is high in protein and low in [[flavonoid]], during the first three days. After that, workers are switched to a diet of mixed pollen and nectar (often called \"bee bread\"), while queens continue to receive royal jelly. In the absence of flavonoid and the presence of a high-protein diet, queen bees develop a healthy reproductive tract<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mao |first1=Wenfu |last2=Schuler |first2=Mary A. |last3=Berenbaum |first3=May R. |title=A dietary phytochemical alters caste-associated gene expression in honey bees |journal=Science Advances |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=7 |page=e1500795 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500795|pmid=26601244 |bibcode=2015SciA....1E0795M |pmc=4643792 }}</ref>\u2014a task necessary for maintaining a colony of tens of thousands of daughter-workers.\n\nPeriodically, the colony determines that a new queen is needed. There are three general causes:\n# The hive is filled with honey, leaving little room for new eggs. This will trigger a swarm, where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony and leave the new queen with the other half of the workers to continue the old one.\n# The old queen begins to fail, which is thought to be demonstrated by a decrease in [[Honey bee pheromones#Types of queen honeybee pheromones|queen pheromones]] throughout the hive. This is known as supersedure, and at its end, the old queen is usually killed.\n# The old queen dies suddenly, a situation known as emergency supersedure. The worker bees find several eggs (or larvae) of the appropriate age range and try to develop them into queens. Emergency supersedure can generally be recognized because new queen cells are built out from comb cells, instead of hanging from the bottom of a frame.\nRegardless of the trigger, workers develop the larvae into queens by continuing to feed them royal jelly.\n\n[[File:Queencell 0017.JPG |thumb|right |alt=See caption |Peanut-like queen brood cells extend outward from the brood comb]]\nQueens are not raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the honeycomb. A queen cell is larger and oriented vertically. If workers sense that an old queen is weakening, they produce emergency cells (known as supersedure cells) from cells with eggs or young larvae and which protrude from the comb. When the queen finishes her larval feeding and pupates, she moves into a head-downward position and later chews her way out of the cell. At pupation, workers cap (seal) the cell. The queen asserts control over the worker bees by releasing a complex suite of pheromones, known as queen scent.\n\nAfter several days of orientation in and around the hive, the young queen flies to a drone congregation point&nbsp;\u2013 a site near a clearing and generally about {{convert |30 |ft |m}} above the ground&nbsp;\u2013 where drones from different hives congregate. They detect the presence of a queen in their congregation area by her smell, find her by sight and mate with her in midair; drones can be induced to mate with \"dummy\" queens with the queen pheromone. A queen will mate multiple times, and may leave to mate several days in a row (weather permitting) until her [[spermatheca]] is full.\n\nThe queen lays all the eggs in a healthy colony. The number and pace of egg-laying is controlled by weather, resource availability and specific racial characteristics. Queens generally begin to slow egg-laying in the early fall, and may stop during the winter. Egg-laying generally resumes in late winter when the days lengthen, peaking in the spring. At the height of the season, the queen may lay over 2,500 eggs per day (more than her body mass).\n\nShe fertilizes each egg (with stored sperm from the spermatheca) as it is laid in a worker-sized cell. Eggs laid in drone-sized (larger) cells are left unfertilized; these unfertilized eggs, with half as many genes as queen or worker eggs, develop into drones.\n\n=== Workers ===\nWorkers are females produced by the queen that develop from fertilized, [[diploid]] eggs. Workers are essential for social structure and proper colony functioning. They carry out the main tasks of the colony, because the queen is occupied with only reproducing. These females raise their sister workers and future queens that eventually leave the nest to start their own colony. They also forage and return to the nest with nectar and pollen to feed the young.\n\n===Drones===\n\n[[File:Drohnenpuppen 81b.jpg |thumb|right |alt=Top and bottom views of a developing pupa against a honeycomb |Development of a drone pupa]]\n[[File:Drohnenpuppen 79d.jpg |thumb|right |alt=White and brown pupae filling cells |Pupae of drones]]\n\n{{Main |Drone (bee)}}\n\nDrones are the colony's [[male]] bees. Since they do not have ovipositors, they do not have stingers. Drone honey bees do not forage for nectar or pollen. The primary purpose of a drone is to [[fertilization|fertilize]] a new queen. Many drones mate with a given queen in flight; each dies immediately after mating, since the process of [[insemination]] requires a lethally convulsive effort. Drone honey bees are [[haploid]] (single, unpaired chromosomes) in their genetic structure, and are descended only from their mother (the queen). In temperate regions, drones are generally expelled from the hive before winter, dying of cold and starvation since they cannot forage, produce honey or care for themselves. Given their larger size (1.5 times that of worker bees), inside the hive it is believed that drones may play a significant role in [[thermoregulation]]. Drones are typically located near the center of hive clusters for unclear reasons. It is postulated that it is to maintain [[sperm viability]], which may be compromised at cooler temperatures. Another possible explanation is that a more central location allows drones to contribute to warmth, since at temperatures below {{Convert|25|C|}} their ability to contribute declines.<ref name=Harrison>{{cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=J H |title=Roles of individual honeybee workers and drones in colonial thermogenesis |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |date=1 May 1987 |volume=129 |page=60 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/129/1/53.full.pdf |accessdate=17 October 2014|pmid=3585245 }}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Queen-Worker Conflict}}Queen-worker conflict==\n{{Main|Worker policing}}\nWhen a fertile female worker produces drones, a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen.

Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones decreases the overall productivity of the hive, it increases the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the [[Unit of selection|individual and group levels]] for the stability of the hive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barron | first1 = A. | last2 = Oldroyd | first2 = B | last3 = Ratnieks | first3 = F.L.W. | year = 2001 | title = Worker reproduction in honey-bees (Apis) and the anarchic syndrome: a review | url = | journal = Behavior Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 199\u2013208 | doi = 10.1007/s002650100362 }}</ref>\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, if the queen dies or is removed, reproduction in workers increases because a significant proportion of workers then have activated ovaries.

In that case, workers are related by three-quarters of their genes, and the sons of workers are [[Coefficient of relationship|related]] more than usual to sons of the queen. Then the benefit of policing is negated. Experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social [[hymenoptera]].<ref>Davies, N.R., Krebs, J.R., and West, S.A.

The temperature on the periphery of the cluster varies with outside air temperature, and the [[winter cluster]]'s internal temperature may be as low as {{convert|20|-|22|C|F}}.\n\nWestern honey bees can forage over a {{convert|30|C|F}} air-temperature range because of behavioral and physiological mechanisms for regulating the temperature of their flight muscles. From low to high air temperatures, the mechanisms are: shivering before flight and stopping flight for additional shivering, passive body-temperature regulation based on work, and [[evaporative cooling]] from regurgitated honey-sac contents. Body temperatures differ, depending on caste and expected foraging rewards.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bernd Heinrich |year=1996 |title=How the honey bee regulates its body temperature |journal=[[Bee World]] |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=130\u2013137 |url=http://www.ibra.org.uk/articles/20100224_2|doi=10.1080/0005772X.1996.11099304 }}</ref>\n\nThe optimal air temperature for [[Forage (honey bee)|foraging]] is {{convert|22|-|25|C|F}}.

[[Karl von Frisch]], who received the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his study of honey bee communication, noticed that bees communicate with dance. Through these dances, bees communicate information regarding the distance, the situation, and the direction of a food source by the dances of the returning (honey bee) worker bee on the vertical comb of the hive.<ref name=\"Capinera2008\">{{cite book|author=John L.

Although the round dance tells other foragers that food is within {{convert|50|m}} of the hive, it provides insufficient information about direction. The waggle dance, which may be vertical or horizontal, provides more detail about the distance and direction of a food source. Foragers are also thought to rely on their [[Olfaction|olfactory sense]] to help locate a food source after they are directed by the dances. Unlike western honey bees, the [[Apis florea|dwarf honey bee]] does not change the precision of the waggle dance to indicate the type of site that is set as a new goal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Beekman|first=Madeleine|displayauthors=etal|title=Dance Precision of Apis florea\u2014Clues to the Evolution of the Honeybee Dance Language?|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=8|year=2008|pages=1259\u20131265|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0554-z}}</ref> Therefore, western honey bees are better at conveying information than its closely related species and this further supports the notion that the former are more evolved than the latter.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Biewer|first1=Matthias|last2=Schlesinger|first2=Francisca|last3=Hasselmann|first3=Martin|title=The evolutionary dynamics of major regulators for sexual development among Hymenoptera species|journal=Frontiers in Genetics|date=10 April 2015|volume=6|pages=124|doi=10.3389/fgene.2015.00124|pmc=4392698|pmid=25914717}}</ref>\n\nAnother means of communication is the shaking signal, also known as the jerking dance, vibration dance or vibration signal. Although the shaking signal is most common in worker communication, it also appears in reproductive swarming. A worker bee vibrates its body [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsoventrally]] while holding another bee with its front legs. Jacobus Biesmeijer, who examined shaking signals in a forager's life and the conditions leading to its performance, found that experienced foragers executed 92% of observed shaking signals and 64% of these signals were made after the discovery of a food source. About 71% of shaking signals occurred before the first five successful foraging flights of the day; other communication signals, such as the waggle dance, were performed more often after the first five successes. Biesmeijer demonstrated that most shakers are foragers and the shaking signal is most often executed by foraging bees on pre-foraging bees, concluding that it is a transfer message for several activities (or activity levels). Sometimes the signal increases activity, as when active bees shake inactive ones. At other times, such as the end of the day, the signal is an inhibitory mechanism. However, the shaking signal is preferentially directed towards inactive bees. All three forms of communication among honey bees are effective in foraging and task management.\n\n====Pheromones====\n{{Main|Honey bee pheromones}}\nPheromones (substances involved in chemical communication) are essential to honey bee survival.

They argue that western honey bees are able to survive without human help, and in fact require to \"be left at liberty\" to survive. Further, they argue that even if bees could be raised away from the wild, they would still have to fly freely to gather nectar and pollinate plants. Therefore, they argue, beekeeping is \"the exploitation of colonies of a wild insect\", with little more than the provision of a weatherproof cavity for them to nest in.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Bailey |first1= Leslie |last2= Ball |first2= B.

Honey bees do not survive and reproduce individually, but as part of the colony (a [[superorganism]]).\n\nWestern honey bees collect flower nectar and convert it to [[honey]], which is stored in the hive. The nectar, transported in the bees' stomachs, is converted with the addition of [[digestive enzyme]]s and storage in a honey cell for partial dehydration. Nectar and honey provide the energy for the bees' flight muscles and for heating the hive during the winter. Western honey bees also collect [[pollen]] which, after being processed to [[Bee pollen|bee bread]], supplies protein and fat for the [[Brood (honey bee)|bee brood]] to grow. Centuries of [[selective breeding]] by humans have created western honey bees which produce far more honey than the colony needs, and beekeepers (also known as apiarists) harvest the surplus honey.\n\n[[File:Western Honey Bees and Honeycomb Closeup.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Many honey bees on a comb|Honey bees removed from the hive for inspection by a beekeeper]]\n\nBeekeepers provide a place for the colony to live and store honey. There are seven basic types of [[Beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]]: [[skep]]s, [[Langstroth hive]]s, [[top-bar hive]]s, [[box hive]]s, [[log gum]]s, D. E. hives, and miller hives.<ref name=caron/> All U.S. states require beekeepers to use movable frames to allow bee inspectors to check the brood for disease. This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers).\n\nIn cold climates, some beekeepers have kept colonies alive (with varying degrees of success) by moving them indoors for winter. While this can protect the colonies from extremes of temperature and make winter care and feeding more convenient for the beekeeper, it increases the risk of [[Diseases of the honey bee#Nosema|dysentery]] and causes an excessive buildup of [[carbon dioxide]] from the bees' [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Inside wintering has been refined by Canadian beekeepers, who use large barns solely for the wintering of bees; automated ventilation systems assist in carbon dioxide dispersal.\n\n====Products====\n\n[[File:Western honey bee (Apis mellifera).webm|thumb|Western honey bee in a park in Tokyo]] \n[[File:Pumpkin pollination4365.jpg|thumb|alt=Beehives in a planted field|Beehives set up for pollination]]\n[[File:Bee on crocus.ogg|thumb|right|alt=Bee collecting pollen from a blue crocus|Video of western honey bee collecting pollen from blue crocuses]]\n[[File:Apis mellifera flying.jpg|thumb|alt=Bee in flight, carrying pollen in a yellow container large for its size|Western honey bee carrying pollen in a [[Pollen basket|basket]] back to the hive]]\n\n====Honey bees====\nHoney bees are one of the products of a beehive. They can be purchased as mated queens, in spring packages of a queen along with two to five pounds (0.91 to 2.27&nbsp;kg) of honey bees, as nucleus colonies (which include frames of brood), or as full colonies. Commerce of western honey bees dates back to as early as 1622, when the first colonies of bees were shipped from England to Virginia. Modern methods of producing queens and dividing colonies for increase date back to the late 1800s. Honey was extracted by killing off the hive, and bees and bee products were mainly an object of local trade. The first commercial beekeeper in the United States is considered Moses Quinby of New York, who experimented with movable box hives, which allow extraction without killing the hive. The improvements in roads and motor vehicles after World War I allowed commercial beekeepers to expand the size of their businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beesource.com/resources/usda/history-of-beekeeping-in-the-united-states/|title=History of Beekeeping in the United States {{!}} Beesource Beekeeping|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n====Pollination====\n[[File:M\u00e9h (2).jpg|thumb|Western honey bee pollinating a flower]]\n{{Main|Pollination management|List of crop plants pollinated by bees}}\n\nThe western honey bee is an important [[pollinator]] of crops; this service accounts for much of the species' commercial value.

In a number of regions the pollination shortage is addressed by migratory beekeepers, who supply hives during a crop bloom and move them after the blooming period. Commercial beekeepers plan their movements and wintering locations according to anticipated pollination services. At higher latitudes it is difficult (or impossible) to overwinter sufficient bees, or to have them ready for early blooming plants. Much migration is seasonal, with hives wintering in warmer climates and moving to follow the bloom at higher latitudes.\n\nIn [[California]], [[almond]] pollination occurs in February, early in the [[growing season]] before local hives have built up their populations. Almond [[orchard]]s require two hives per acre, or {{Convert|2000|m2||abbr=on|adj=}} per hive, for maximum yield, and pollination is dependent on the importation of hives from warmer climates. [[Almond#Pollination|Almond pollination]] (in February and March in the U.S.) is the largest [[Pollination management|managed pollination]] event in the world, requiring more than one-third of all managed honey bees in the country.

The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million.  ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path.

They called Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Miller and Victoria's Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car in front of the Russell Street Police HQ at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986. Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street. Crupi also stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria |Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at[[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed (born Peter Komiazyk). Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in matters relating to several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided the house of Karl Zelinka; an associate of both Reed and the Minogue brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka (who had no criminal record) admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive a Commodore identical to the one used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to 1946 when at the age of 8, he was arrested for truancy and sent to Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] for two years. In 1949, he was arrested for fishing in prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been convicted of theft of motorcycles and burglary. In the early 1960s, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery on a [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and was sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division where met [[Ronald Ryan]]; the last man hanged in Australia. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his escape but Taylor refused. After Ryan was hanged, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge, while on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies over a period of five days before being recaptured and sent back to prison.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Ro.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986. Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street. Crupi also stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria |Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at[[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed (born Peter Komiazyk). Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided the house of Karl Zelinka; an associate of both Reed and the Minogue brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka (who had no criminal record) admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive a Commodore identical to the one used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to 1946 when at the age of 8, he was arrested for truancy and sent to Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] for two years. In 1949, he was arrested for fishing in prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been convicted of theft of motorcycles and burglary. In the early 1960s, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery on a [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and was sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division where met [[Ronald Ryan]]; the last man hanged in Australia. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his escape but Taylor refused. After Ryan was hanged, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge, while on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies over a period of five days before being recaptured and sent back to prison.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Ro.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

It was a 1976 hit and a staple of disco music, and became Boney M.'s first United Kingdom hit.\n\nIt was the second Boney M. single, released in 1976, without making any major impact at first. After a spectacular performance on the ''[[Musikladen]]'' TV show in September the single became a hit, topping most European charts. It reached number six in the United Kingdom charts and number 65 in the [[United States]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The single also topped the German charts and reached the Top 20 in Canada. It proved to be the major European breakthrough of the band.\n\n==The song==\n\"Daddy Cool\" was a novelty gimmick record with an unusual, percussive intro by producer [[Frank Farian]] doing rhythmic tic-tic-tics and playing on his teeth with a pencil. Farian also sang all male voice parts ([[Bobby Farrell]] always danced to full playback). His characteristic deep voice sings: \"She's crazy like a fool...\" and is answered by the bright voices of [[Liz Mitchell]] and [[Marcia Barrett]]: \"...wild about Daddy Cool\". This line has been misheard by listeners as \"...what about Daddy Cool\", so much that the band started singing it that way during live performances.<ref>{{cite web|first= J. |last= Temptation |title= Notes toward a reconceptualization of Boney M.'s \"Daddy Cool\" |website= [[The New Inquiry]] |date= 7 August 2015 |accessdate= 18 April 2019 |url= https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/notes-toward-a-reconceptualiztion-of-boney-m-s-daddy-cool/}}</ref> The bass [[riff]] kicks in and builds to the instrumental theme followed by the repetitive, nursery rhyme-like verse and chorus twice.\n\nThe song [[breakdown (music)|breaks down]] into a spoken passage by Farrell before it goes back into the bass riff and repeats the verse and chorus for the last time. With its slightly hypnotic, repetitive bassline and strings and likewise repetitive, bright female vocals, the track is highly typical of mid-1970s \"Munich disco\".\n\n==The single==\nOriginally, [[Hansa Records]] wanted Boney M.'s cover of [[Bob Marley]]'s \"[[No Woman, No Cry]]\" as the A-side of the single but Farian - seeing that his own song was the clear winner when testing both tracks in his discoth\u00e8que in [[Sankt Ingbert|St. Ingbert]] \u2013 managed to persuade the record company to have it his way. In the US, Hungary and Japan (where the single wasn't released until November), the single was backed by the album track \"Lovin' or Leavin'\", in East Germany the record was released in 1977, backed by their next hit \"[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]\".\n\nBelgium released 7\" has a rare B-side version of \"No Woman, No Cry\" as the track does not fade out at the end but has a hard ending and thus runs slightly longer 5:03 instead the common 4:58. This rare version has so far not been released on CD.\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1976\u20131977)\n!Peak<br/>Position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite web|title= Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 CHART POSITIONS PRE 1989 |publisher= Australian-charts.com.

The original plans of releasing another single (\"[[Dreadlock Holiday]]\") from the group's final album ''[[Eye Dance]]'' were cancelled, instead producer Frank Farian recorded a new version of \"Daddy Cool\" in a special \"anniversary recording\", featuring rap parts, and new instrumental parts. The single, however, proved to be Boney M.'s worst-selling single, failing to chart anywhere. The B-side \"B.M.A.G.O.\" appeared in a longer version on the 7\" than on the 12\" single. The 12\" single also included an edit version of \"Daddy Cool\" which was not credited on the cover.

An all-new line-up '''Boney M. 2000''' featuring three young girls and rapper Mobi T. was featured in the video and also announced to front a forthcoming remix album.

It was a 1976 hit and a staple of disco music, and became Boney M.'s first United Kingdom hit.\n\nIt was the second Boney M. single, released in 1976, without making any major impact at first. After a spectacular performance on the ''[[Musikladen]]'' TV show in September the single became a hit, topping most European charts. It reached number six in the United Kingdom charts and number 65 in the [[United States]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The single also topped the German charts and reached the Top 20 in Canada. It proved to be the major European breakthrough of the band.\n\n==The song==\n\"Daddy Cool\" was a novelty gimmick record with an unusual, percussive intro by producer [[Frank Farian]] doing rhythmic tic-tic-tics and playing on his teeth with a pencil. Farian also sang all male voice parts ([[Bobby Farrell]] always danced to full playback). His characteristic deep voice sings: \"She's crazy like a fool...\" and is answered by the bright voices of [[Liz Mitchell]] and [[Marcia Barrett]]: \"...wild about Daddy Cool\". This line has been misheard by listeners as \"...what about Daddy Cool\", so much that the band started singing it that way during live performances.<ref>{{cite web|first= J. |last= Temptation |title= Notes toward a reconceptualization of Boney M.'s \"Daddy Cool\" |website= [[The New Inquiry]] |date= 7 August 2015 |accessdate= 18 April 2019 |url= https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/notes-toward-a-reconceptualiztion-of-boney-m-s-daddy-cool/}}</ref> The bass [[riff]] kicks in and builds to the instrumental theme followed by the repetitive, nursery rhyme-like verse and chorus twice.\n\nThe song [[breakdown (music)|breaks down]] into a spoken passage by Farrell before it goes back into the bass riff and repeats the verse and chorus for the last time. With its slightly hypnotic, repetitive bassline and strings and likewise repetitive, bright female vocals, the track is highly typical of mid-1970s \"Munich disco\".\n\n==The single==\nOriginally, [[Hansa Records]] wanted Boney M.'s cover of [[Bob Marley]]'s \"[[No Woman, No Cry]]\" as the A-side of the single but Farian - seeing that his own song was the clear winner when testing both tracks in his discoth\u00e8que in [[Sankt Ingbert|St. Ingbert]] \u2013 managed to persuade the record company to have it his way. In the US, Hungary and Japan (where the single wasn't released until November), the single was backed by the album track \"Lovin' or Leavin'\", in East Germany the record was released in 1977, backed by their next hit \"[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]\".\n\nBelgium released 7\" has a rare B-side version of \"No Woman, No Cry\" as the track does not fade out at the end but has a hard ending and thus runs slightly longer 5:03 instead the common 4:58. This rare version has so far not been released on CD.\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1976\u20131977)\n!Peak<br/>Position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite web|title= Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 CHART POSITIONS PRE 1989 |publisher= Australian-charts.com.

The original plans of releasing another single (\"[[Dreadlock Holiday]]\") from the group's final album ''[[Eye Dance]]'' were cancelled, instead producer Frank Farian recorded a new version of \"Daddy Cool\" in a special \"anniversary recording\", featuring rap parts, and new instrumental parts. The single, however, proved to be Boney M.'s worst-selling single, failing to chart anywhere. The B-side \"B.M.A.G.O.\" appeared in a longer version on the 7\" than on the 12\" single. The 12\" single also included an edit version of \"Daddy Cool\" which was not credited on the cover.

An all-new line-up '''Boney M. 2000''' featuring three young girls and rapper Mobi T. was featured in the video and also announced to front a forthcoming remix album. This decision was not popular with the group's fan base, and Farian subsequently dropped the idea. \"Daddy Cool\" could not match the success of its predecessor, peaking only at no. 47 in the German charts.\n\n===Charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1999)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders Tip|2|artist=Boney M. 2000 feat.
