One person is his coach, Harry Royle, who was Hofstra's Head Men's Lacrosse Coach from 1976 through 1985. The other person is Vincent Sombrotto, a former teammate and professional lacrosse player who, according to Metzger, had a will to win and a level of intensity that made him \"the closest thing to a perfect lacrosse player that I have ever seen.\"<ref>[http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/athletics/athletics_brochure_roylesombrotto.pdf The Harry H. Royle and Vincent J.

DiBlasi also was Metzger's coach at Half Hollow Hills High School.<ref>[http://gohofstra.com/news/2009/5/6/ATH_Hofstra_Athletics_Honors_James_C_Metzger_Leadership_Gift_Funds_Traditions_Project_In_Margiotta_Hall_And_Supports_Hofstra_Lacrosse.aspx LEADERSHIP GIFT FUNDS \u201cTRADITIONS PROJECT\u201d IN MARGIOTTA HALL]</ref>\n\nThe Lacrosse Reception Room was named after Gary Arnold '83 and the Unterstein family. Arnold was Metzger's teammate at Hofstra. He was a four-year letterman in lacrosse and team leader in goals for 1981 and 1982. Following graduation, he served as an assistant coach under Harry Royle. The Unterstein family is the only family in Hofstra lacrosse history collectively to earn conference player of the year (Chris, 2006), defensive player of the year (Kevin, 2008) and rookie of the year (Mike, 2005). Chris Unterstein earned 2005 first-team All-America honors while Kevin was an honorable mention All-American for 2007. The three brothers also participated in the North-South Senior All-star game (Chris, 2006; Kevin and Mike; 2008). Funding for renovations of the reception room was provided by Metzger during 2009.<ref name=\"Hofstra Athletics Honors\" />\n\nThe Metzger-Huff Lacrosse Offices at Hofstra University were dedicated during 2010 and named for Metzger and Kevin Huff (Hofstra '78). When Metzger learned that Hofstra planned to name the lacrosse offices for him, he insisted that the facility also honor Huff, who was an assistant coach when Metzger attended the university.

Plans for a new stadium in [[Finglas]] and [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]] came to nothing, as has an FAI-backed proposed groundshare with North Dublin neighbours [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]]. Plans were underway in March and April 2015 for the [[Dublin City Council|Council]] to take back ownership of the land, and for Shelbourne to groundshare Bohemians in (newly Council-owned) [[Dalymount Park]].<ref name=\"Council\">{{cite web |title=Council strikes \u20ac3.4m deal to buy Dalymount Park |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/league-of-ireland/council-strikes-34m-deal-to-buy-dalymount-park-31075591.html |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |last=O'Donoghue |first=Paul |date=18 March 2015 |accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"98fm\">{{cite web |url=http://www.98fm.com/Council-To-Buy-Dalymount-Park- |publisher=[[Dublin's 98FM]] |title=Council To Buy Dalymount Park |date=18 March 2015 |accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/dublin-city-council-keen-to-progress-with-dalymount-park-deal-1.2194119 |title=Dublin City Council keen to progress with Dalymount Park deal |work=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=1 May 2015 |date=30 April 2015 |author=[[Emmet Malone]]}}</ref> On 4 October 2016 Shelbourne announced that they would leave Tolka Park for a newly refurbished Dalymount Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2016/1004/821285-shelbourne-to-leave-tolka-park-for-dalymount/|title=Shelbourne to leave Tolka Park for Dalymount|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n*[[List of rugby league stadiums by capacity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_FDIxIDyNk] Stadium video tour\n\n{{coord|53|22|03.05|N|6|15|07.14|W|region:IE-D_type:landmark_source:dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box|title=Host of the [[Setanta Sports Cup|Setanta Sports Cup Final]]|before=None |after=[[Windsor Park]]||years= [[2005 Setanta Sports Cup|2005]] <br /> [[2006 Setanta Sports Cup|2006]]}}\n{{End}}\n\n{{Shelbourne F.C.}}\n{{Shamrock Rovers F.C.}}\n{{Republic of Ireland women's national football team}}\n{{League of Ireland venues}}\n{{FAI Cup Final venues}}\n{{2000 RLWC Venues}}\n\n[[Category:Drumcondra]]\n[[Category:Association football venues in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Republic of Ireland national football team home stadiums]]\n[[Category:Rugby league stadiums in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Rugby League World Cup stadiums]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:Home Farm F.C.]]\n[[Category:Shamrock Rovers F.C.]]\n[[Category:Shelbourne F.C.]]\n[[Category:Drumcondra F.C.]]\n[[Category:Association football venues in County Dublin]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "not a cook", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolka_Park"}

After the third series, TVE decided not to renew the show and its rights were acquired by [[Telecinco]], which aired series 5\u20138 of the series. Series 8 in 2011 was cancelled due to poor ratings and its finale was rushed as a result.\n\nOn 26 April 2017, [[RTVE]] approved a new series of the talent show produced by Gestmusic Endemol, returning to TVE after 13 years.

Once a week, the contestants have to face a prime time show, where they sing a [[cover version]] of a popular song they have prepared during the week before, as well as recapping their trials and tribulations at The Academy from the past week. The live show will often feature special guest stars, with whom some of the contestants have the opportunity to sing.

[[talent show]] which first aired on [[Spain]]'s [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]] network in 2001. A music talent contest with viewer voting and reality show elements that originated [[Endemol]]'s ''[[Star Academy]]'' franchise, the show aims to find the country's next solo singing sensation.\n\n''Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo'' (also known as ''OT'') first aired in 2001. On its first run between 2001 and 2004, three series were aired on [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]], which also served as the national final to select the [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spanish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest]]. The first series of ''OT'' was particularly successful in ratings, becoming one of the most popular shows in the history of Spanish television and featuring singers that went on to enjoy long-term recognition from the public: notably [[Rosa L\u00f3pez]], [[David Bisbal]], [[David Bustamante]] or [[Chenoa]]. After the third series, TVE decided not to renew the show and its rights were acquired by [[Telecinco]], which aired series 5\u20138 of the series. Series 8 in 2011 was cancelled due to poor ratings and its finale was rushed as a result.\n\nOn April 26, 2017, [[RTVE]] approved a new series of the [[talent show]] produced by Gestmusic Endemol, returning to TVE after 13 years. The total cost of the series was [[\u20ac]]10.2 million.<ref>[http://www.rtve.es/television/20170426/operacion-triunfo-vuelve-1-16-anos-despues-su-estreno-tve/1532100.shtml 'Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo' vuelve a La 1, 16 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su estreno en TVE]</ref> Due to its ratings success, it was renewed for a further series.<ref name=\"OT2018\">{{cite news|url= http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/77319/tve-confirma-ot-2018-renovando-formato-nueva-edicion/|title= TVE confirma 'OT 2018', renovando el formato por una nueva edici\u00f3n|date= February 28, 2018|newspaper= FormulaTV.com}}</ref> This was the second most successful edition of the program to date,<ref>[http://www.eltelevisero.com/2017/12/ha-superado-ot-2017-como-fenomeno-social-a-ot-1/ \u00bfHa superado 'OT 2017' a 'OT 1'?]</ref><ref>[https://www.abc.es/play/television/noticias/abci-claves-convertido-2017-fenomeno-201801040013_noticia.html Las claves que han convertido \u00abOT 2017\u00bb en un fen\u00f3meno]</ref> artists like [[Aitana (singer)|Aitana]], [[Ana Guerra]], [[Amaia (singer)|Amaia]], [[Alfred Garc\u00eda]], [[Cepeda (singer)|Luis Cepeda]], [[Miriam Rodr\u00edguez]] or [[Lola \u00cdndigo]] have emerged from this edition.<ref>[https://www.esquire.com/es/actualidad/tv/a14404254/ot-2017-critica-fenomeno-audiencia/ Adi\u00f3s al fen\u00f3meno de masas de la temporada: por qu\u00e9 OT ha sido un \u00e9xito sin precedentes]</ref>\n\n==Format==\nA selection of hopefuls is boarded in \"The Academy\", managed by a headmaster, where they are coached by various professionals in several artistic disciplines and are filmed with cameras (an idea borrowed from another of Endemol's major reality shows ''[[Big Brother (franchise)|Big Brother]]''). Once a week, the contestants have to face a prime time show, where they sing a [[cover version]] of a popular song they have prepared during the week before, as well as recapping their trials and tribulations at The Academy from the past week. The live show will often feature special guest stars, with whom some of the contestants have the opportunity to sing. Based on the judges' verdicts and viewer voting, the weakest contestant is dropped. The eventual winner is awarded a record deal and/or some amount of money.\n\n==Series overview==\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Winner\n! scope=\"col\" | Runner-up\n! scope=\"col\" | Third place\n! scope=\"col\" | Fourth place\n! scope=\"col\" | Fifth place\n! scope=\"col\" | Sixth place\n! scope=\"col\" | Host\n! scope=\"col\" | Headmaster\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 1)|1]]\n|2001\u201302\n|[[Rosa L\u00f3pez]]\n|[[David Bisbal]]\n|[[David Bustamante]]\n|[[Chenoa]]\n|Manu Tenorio\n|[[Ver\u00f3nica Romero]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Carlos Lozano\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Nina (Spanish singer)|Nina]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 2)|2]]\n|2002\u201303\n|[[Ainhoa Cantalapiedra]]\n|[[Manuel Carrasco]]\n|[[Beth (singer)|Beth Rodergas]]\n|Miguel N\u00e1ndez\n|Hugo Salazar\n|Joan Tena\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 3)|3]]\n|2003\u201304\n|[[Vicente Segu\u00ed Porres|Vicente Segu\u00ed]]\n|[[Ram\u00f3n (singer)|Ram\u00f3n del Castillo]]\n|Miguel Cadenas\n|Davinia Cuevas\n|Mario Mart\u00ednez\n|Leticia P\u00e9rez\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 4)|4]]\n|2005\n|[[Sergio Rivero]]\n|[[Soraya Arnelas]]\n|V\u00edctor Est\u00e9vez\n|[[Idaira|Idaira Fern\u00e1ndez]]\n|Fran Dieli\n|[[Edurne|Edurne Garc\u00eda]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" |[[Jes\u00fas V\u00e1zquez (television presenter)|Jes\u00fas V\u00e1zquez]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Kike Santander]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 5)|5]]\n|2006\u201307\n|[[Lorena (singer)|Lorena G\u00f3mez]]\n|[[Daniel Zueras]]\n|[[Leo Segarra S\u00e1nchez|Leo Segarra]]\n|Saray Ram\u00edrez\n|Moritz Weisskopf\n|[[Jos\u00e9 Galisteo]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 6)|6]]\n|2008\n|[[Virginia Maestro]]\n|[[Pablo L\u00f3pez (singer)|Pablo L\u00f3pez]]\n|Chipper Cooke\n|Manu Castellano\n|Sandra Criado\n|[[Mimi Segura]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[\u00c0ngel Ll\u00e0cer]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 7)|7]]\n|2009\n|[[Mario \u00c1lvarez (singer)|Mario \u00c1lvarez]]\n|Brenda Mau\n|Jon Allende\n|\u00c1ngel Capel\n|Patricia Navarro\n|Sylvia Parejo\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 8)|8]]\n|2011\n|[[Nahuel Sachak]]\n|\u00c1lex Forriols\n|Mario Jefferson\n|Alexandra Masangkay\n|Nicc\u00f3\n|Josh Prada\n|[[Pilar Rubio]]\n|[[Nina (Spanish singer)|Nina]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 9)|9]]\n|2017\u201318\n|[[Amaia Romero]]\n|[[Aitana (singer)|Aitana Oca\u00f1a]]\n|[[Miriam Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|[[Alfred Garc\u00eda]]\n|[[Ana Guerra]]\n|[[Agoney Hern\u00e1ndez]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Roberto Leal (TV presenter)|Roberto Leal]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Noem\u00ed Galera\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 10)|10]]\n|2018\n|Famous Oberogo\n|Alba Reche\n|Natalia Lacunza\n|Sabela Ramil\n|Julia Medina\n|[[Miki N\u00fa\u00f1ez]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"|[[Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 11)|11]]\n|2020\n| colspan=\"6\" | {{TableTBA}}\n|}\n<small>All contestants appearing above (1st to 6th) were born in Spain, except for Chenoa who is Argentinian-born (from series 1), Moritz Weisskopf who is German (series 5), Chipper Cooke who is from the United States (series 6), Brenda Mau who is from Peru (series 7), Alexandra Masangkay who is from the Philippines (series 8), winner of series 8 Nahuel Sachak who is from Paraguay, and winner of series 10 Famous Oberogo who is Nigerian-born.</small>\n\n===Series 1 (2001\u201302)===\n{{main|Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo (series 1)}}\nAll three finalists of the inaugural series released debut albums, but while Rosa (accompanied by some fellow contenders as backing singers) scored seventh place in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002]] with the song \"[[Europe's Living a Celebration]]\", and had notable success with her albums, it was Bisbal who went on to international success, even winning a [[Latin Grammy Award]] for Best Newcomer for his album ''[[Coraz\u00f3n Latino]]''.\n\nOther participants of this first edition ([[Chenoa]], [[Nuria Ferg\u00f3]] and Manu Tenorio) also launched successful solo careers.

They released an album, ''[[He Perdido Los Zapatos]]'', which was highly praised by critics. The album sold over 200,000 copies in Spain alone, an amazing feat as an average album to get to number 1 in Spain needs around 20,000 sales.\n\n[[Vega (singer)|Vega]], who came 9th, managed to release the best selling single of 2003 in Spain with her own composition, \"iGrita!\", with over one million copies sold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

After cresting the hill, it dips slightly and veers left into the world's tallest inversion, an inverting [[dive drop]] element {{Convert|197|ft}} off the ground. The train drops out of the inversion banking sharply left, reaching a point close to the ground and traveling back toward the station. It veers left again and enters a banana roll, an element named after its characteristic shape, that inverts riders twice and raises the train to its second-highest point off the ground. Riders descend low to the ground once more into a small [[Air time (rides)|airtime]] hill heading back toward the first drop, entering a [[Sea serpent (roller coaster element)|sea serpent]] element with two more inversions. This is followed by an airtime hill and the coaster's sixth inversion, a [[dive loop]] that turns the train 180 degrees and sends it back toward the station. After a brief straightaway, riders experience a weightlessness maneuver in a [[zero-g stall]] inversion, sometimes referred to as a top gun stall. The coaster's finale follows, with the train entering a [[Corkscrew (roller coaster element)|corkscrew]] and [[Cutback (roller coaster)|cutback]] in short succession, completing the eighth and ninth inversions respectively. The cutback ends with a slight jump up onto the final brake run, where the train will make its way back into the station.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box | title=World's tallest roller coaster inversion| before=[[GateKeeper (roller coaster)|GateKeeper]] | years=July 2019 - Present| after=None}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Kennywood}}\n{{Pittsburgh Metro Area}}\n\n[[Category:Roller coasters in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Kennywood]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Pittsburgh Steelers themed steel roller coaster at Kennywood}}\n{{Infobox roller coaster\n| name                 = Steel Curtain\n| logo                 = Steel Curtain Roller Coaster Logo.png\n| logodimensions       = 100px\n| image                = File:Kennywood - Steel Curtain.jpg\n| imagedimensions      = 250px\n| caption              =\n| previousnames        =\n| location             = Kennywood\n| locationarticle      = <!--Must not be linked.-->\n| section              = Steelers Country\n| subsection           = <!--Should be linked.-->\n| coordinates          = {{coord|40.3892|-79.8665|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-PA|display=it}}\n| status               = Operating\n| opened               = {{Start date|2019|07|13}}\n| soft_opened          = {{Start date|2019|07|12}}\n| year                 = 2019  <!--To be used in addition to opened, will auto-categorize the coaster.-->\n| cost                 =\n| previousattraction   = [[Log Jammer (Kennywood)|Log Jammer]]\n| replacement          =\n| type                 = Steel\n| type2                = \n| manufacturer         = S&S - Sansei Technologies\n| model                = <!--The name of the S&S model ONLY.

After cresting the hill, it dips slightly and veers left into the world's tallest inversion, an inverting [[dive drop]] element {{Convert|197|ft}} off the ground. The train drops out of the inversion banking sharply left, reaching a point close to the ground and traveling back toward the station. It veers left again and enters a banana roll, an element named after its characteristic shape, that inverts riders twice and raises the train to its second-highest point off the ground. Riders descend low to the ground once more into a small [[Air time (rides)|airtime]] hill heading back toward the first drop, entering a [[Sea serpent (roller coaster element)|sea serpent]] element with two more inversions. This is followed by an airtime hill and the coaster's sixth inversion, a [[dive loop]] that turns the train 180 degrees and sends it back toward the station. After a brief straightaway, riders experience a weightlessness maneuver in a [[zero-g stall]] inversion, sometimes referred to as a top gun stall. The coaster's finale follows, with the the train entering a [[Corkscrew (roller coaster element)|corkscrew]] and [[Cutback (roller coaster)|cutback]] in short succession, completing the eighth and ninth inversions respectively. The cutback ends with a slight jump up onto the final brake run, where the train will make its way back into the station.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box | title=World's tallest roller coaster inversion| before=[[GateKeeper (roller coaster)|GateKeeper]] | years=July 2019 - Present| after=None}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Kennywood}}\n{{Pittsburgh Metro Area}}\n\n[[Category:Roller coasters in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Kennywood]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Curtain_(roller_coaster)"}
