In this context, development is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change.<ref>[http://www.hi.com.au/geogglobal1/pdf/global1_2_3.pdf Geography of global interactions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528032624/http://www.hi.com.au/geogglobal1/pdf/global1_2_3.pdf |date=2008-05-28 }}</ref> However, development is not always a positive process. [[Gunder Frank]] commented on the global economic forces that lead to the development of underdevelopment. This is covered in his [[dependency theory]].\n\nIn development geography, geographers study spatial patterns in development. They try to find by what characteristics they can measure development by looking at [[economic]], [[political]] and [[social]] factors. They seek to understand both the geographical ''causes'' and ''consequences'' of varying development. Studies compare [[MEDCs|More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs)]] with [[LEDC|Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs)]]. Additionally variations within countries are looked at such as the differences between [[Italy|northern]] and southern Italy, the [[Southern Italy|Mezzogiorno]].\n\n==Quantitative indicatorsss==\nQuantitative indicators are numerical indications of development.\n*Economic include [[GNP]] (Gross National Product) per capita, [[unemployment]] rates, [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]] and percentage of GNP in primary industries. Of these, GNP per capita is the most used as it measures the value of all the goods and services produced in a country, excluding those produced by foreign companies, hence measuring the economic and industrial development of the country. However, using GNP per capita also has many problems. \n**It does not take into account the distribution of the money which can often be extremely unequal as in the [[UAE]] where oil money has been collected by a rich elite and has not flowed to the bulk of the country. \n**GNP does not measure whether the money produced is actually improving people's lives and this is important because in many MEDCs there are large increases in wealth over time but only small increases in happiness. \n**The figure rarely takes into account the unofficial economy, which includes subsistence agriculture and cash-in-hand or unpaid work, which is often substantial in LEDCs. In LEDCs it is often too expensive to accurately collect this data and some governments intentionally or unintentionally release inaccurate figures{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. \n** The figure is usually given in US dollars which due to changing currency exchange rates can distort the money's true street value so it is often converted using [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) in which the actual comparative purchasing power of the money in the country is calculated.\n* Social indications include access to clean water and [[sanitation]] (which indicate the level of infrastructure developed in the country) and adult [[literacy]] rate, measuring the resources the government has to meet the needs of the people.\n*Demographic indicators include the [[birth rate]], [[death rate]] and [[fertility rate]], which indicate the level of [[industrialization]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/devindicatorsrev2.shtml BBC bitesize]</ref>\n**Health indicators (a sub-factor of demographic indicators) include [[nutrition]] (calories per day, calories from protein, percentage of population with malnutrition), [[infant mortality]] and population per doctor, which indicate the availability of [[healthcare]] and [[sanitation]] facilities in a country.\n*Environmental indications include how much a country does for the environment.\n\n===Composite indicators===\n*In the table below [[GDP]] stands for gross domestic product, which is generally taken to be equal to GNP.\n*Other composite measures include the [[PQLI]] (Physical Quality of Life Index) which was a precursor to the HDI which used infant mortality rate instead of GNP per capita and rated countries from 0 to 100. It was calculated by assigning each country a score of 0 to 100 for each indicator compared with other countries in the world. The average of these three numbers makes the PQLI of a country.\n*The [[Human Poverty Index|HPI]] (Human Poverty Index) is used to calculate the percentage of people in a country who live in relative poverty. In order to better differentiate the number of people in abnormally poor living conditions the HPI-1 is used in developing countries, and the HPI-2 is used in developed countries. The HPI-1 is calculated based on the percentage of people not expected to survive to 40, the adult illiteracy rate, the percentage of people without access to safe water, health services and the percentage of children under 5 who are underweight. The HPI-2 is calculated based on the percentage of people who do not survive to 60, the adult [[functional illiteracy]] rate and the percentage of people living below 50% of median personal disposable income.\n*The [[Gender-related Development Index|GDI]] (Gender-related Development Index) measures gender equality in a country in terms of life expectancy, literacy rates, school attendance and income.\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n!width=\"50\"|HDI rank\n!width=\"60\"|Country\n!width=\"225\"|GDP per capita\n(PPP US$)\n 2008<ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GDP_PPP.pdf PPP GDP 2008]</ref>\n!width=\"225\"|Human development index\n(HDI) value\n 2006<ref>[http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/ UN Human Development Report (HDR)]</ref>\n|-\n|4\n|Australia\n|35,677\n|0.965\n|-\n|70\n|Brazil\n|10,296\n|0.807\n|-\n|151\n|Zimbabwe\n|188\n|0.513\n|}\n\n==Qualitative indicators==\nQualitative indicators include descriptions of living conditions and people's quality of life. They are useful in analyzing features that are not easily calculated or measured in numbers such as freedom, corruption, or security, which are largely non-material benefits.\n\n==Geographic variations in development==\nThere is a considerable spatial variation in development rates.\n\n{{quote|Global wealth also increased in material terms, and during the period 1947 to 2000, average per capita incomes tripled as global GDP increased almost tenfold (from $US3 trillion to $US30 trillion)... Over 25% of the 4.5 billion people in LEDCs still have life expectancies below 40 years. More than 80 countries have a lower annual per capita income in 2000 than they did in 1990. The average income in the world's five richest countries is 74 times the level in the world's poorest five, the widest it has ever been. Nearly 1.3 billion people have no access to clean water. About 840 million people are malnourished.|Stephen Codrington<ref>[http://www.planetgeography.com Codrington, Stephen ''Planet Geography 3rd Edition'' (2005) Page 97]</ref>}}\n\nThe most famous pattern in development is the [[North-South divide]]. The North-South divide separates the rich North or the developed world, from the poor South. This line of division is not as straightforward as it sounds and splits the globe into two main parts. It is also known as the Brandt Line.\n\nThe \"North\" in this divide is regarded as being North America, Europe, Russia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the like. The countries within this area are generally the more economically developed. The \"South\" therefore encompasses the remainder of the Southern Hemisphere, mostly consisting of KFCs. Another possible dividing line is the Tropic of Cancer with the exceptions of Australia and New Zealand. It is critical to understand that the status of countries is far from static and the pattern is likely to become distorted with the fast development of certain southern countries, many of them [[Newly industrialized countries|NICs]] (Newly Industrialised Countries) including India, Thailand, Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico and others. These countries are experiencing sustained fast development on the back of growing manufacturing industries and exports.\n\nMost countries are experiencing significant increases in wealth and standard of living. However, there are unfortunate exceptions to this rule. Noticeably some of the former [[Soviet Union]] countries has experienced major disruption of industry in the transition to a market economy. Many African nations have recently experienced reduced GNPs due to wars and the AIDS epidemic, including Angola, Congo, Sierra Leone and others. Arab oil producers rely very heavily on oil exports to support their GDPs so any reduction in oil's market price can lead to rapid decreases in GNP. Countries which rely on only a few exports for much of their income are very vulnerable to changes in the market value of those commodities and are often derogatively called [[banana republics]]. Many developing countries do rely on exports of a few primary goods for a large amount of their income (coffee and timber for example), and this can create havoc when the value of these commodities drops, leaving these countries with no way to pay off their debts.\n\nWithin countries the pattern is that wealth is more concentrated around urban areas than rural areas. Wealth also tends towards areas with natural resources or in areas that are involved in tertiary (service) industries and trade. This leads to a gathering of wealth around mines and monetary centres such as New York, London and Tokyo.\n\nGeography can also affect economic development in a number of ways. Analysis of current data sets show three significant implications of geography on developing nations.<ref>J. Sachs, A. Mellinger and J. Gallup (2001) \"The Geography of Poverty and Wealth,\" ''Scientific American'', March: 70-76.</ref> First, access to sea routes is important; this has been noted as far back as [[Adam Smith]]. Sea travel is much cheaper and faster than that of land, leading to a wider and quicker dissemination of both resources and ideas, both of which are integral to economic stimulus. Geography also dictates the prevalence of disease: for example, the [[World Health Organization]] estimates roughly 300-500 million new cases of [[malaria]] every year. Malaria is largely associated with nations that have struggled to achieve sound economic development. Not only does disease decrease labor productivity, but it changes the age structure of the country, forcing the population to lean heavily toward children as adults die from disease and the population sees an increase of fertility to keep up with the high death rates. High fertility both lowers the quality of life for each child due to a decrease in resources allocated to each of them, and also decreases labor productivity for women. The third way geography affects development is through agricultural productivity. Temperate regions have shown the highest output of major grains; regions such as the African [[savanna]] relatively yield much less value for the labor cost. Low agricultural output means that a larger portion of the population must spend their efforts in agriculture, leading to a slower urban development. This, in turn, discourages technological advance: an essential source of development for the twenty-first century.\n\n==Barriers to international development==\n\nGeographers along with other social scientists have recognized that certain factors present in a given society may impede the social and economic development of that society. Factors, which have been identified as obstructing the economic and social welfare of developing societies, include:\n\n*Lack of education<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gyimah-Brempong | first1 = K | year = 2011 | title = Education and Economic Development in Africa | url = | journal = [[African Development Review]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 219\u2013236 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8268.2011.00282.x }}</ref> \n*Lack of healthcare<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/17537980810861475 |title=Spearheading human and economic development in the Arab world through evidence\u2010based and world\u2010class healthcare |journal=Education, Business and Society: Contemporary Middle Eastern Issues |volume=1 |pages=12 |year=2008 |last1=Bowman |first1=Brett |last2=Matzopoulos |first2=Richard |last3=Lerer |first3=Leonard }}</ref> \n*Pervasiveness of intoxicating drugs<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = Merrill | year = 2008 | title = Drugs and development: The global impact of drug use and trafficking on social and economic development | url = | journal = International Journal of Drug Policy | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 467\u2013478 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugpo.2006.12.007 | pmid = 19038724 }}\n</ref> \n*Weak political, social, and economic institutions<ref>Hernando de Soto, ''Dead Capital and the Poor'', The Johns Hopkins University Press. 2001{{pn|date=January 2017}}</ref> \n*Ineffective taxation\n*Environmental degradation<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mosznski | first1 = Peter | year = 2011 | title = Environmental degradation risks undermining development progress, warns report | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 343 | issue = | pages = d7043| doi = 10.1136/bmj.d7043 | pmid = 22049525 }}</ref> \n*Lack of religious/gender/racial/sexual freedoms\n*Indebtedness\n*Protectionist barriers to trade<ref>Merideth Kolsky Lewis \"The EU's Protectionist Problem\" Georgetown journal of International affairs. 01/01/2009</ref> \n*Foreign aid<ref>Africa: the poorest continent is rising.

Some barriers to development may be impossible to address, such as climatic barriers to development.  In these cases societies must evaluate whether such climatic barriers to development dictate that society must relocate a given settlement in order to enjoy greater economic development.\n\nMany scholars agree that foreign aid provided to developing nations is ineffective and in many instances counter productive.<ref>Africa: the poorest continent is rising. Really.Dambisa Moyo. Foreign Policy. .172 (May\u2013June 2009) p90.</ref>   This is due to the manner in which foreign aid changes the incentives for productivity in a given developing society, and the manner in which foreign aid has the tendency to corrupt the governments responsible for its allocation and distribution.\n\nCultural barriers to development such as discrimination based on gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation are challenging to address in certain oppressive societies, though recent progress has been significant in some societies.\n\nWhile the aforementioned barriers to economic growth and development are most prevalent in the less developed economies of the world, even the most developed economies are plagued by select barriers to development such as drug prohibition and income inequality.\n\n== Aid ==\n[[MEDC]]s (More Economically Developed Countries) can give aid to [[LEDC]]s (Less Economically Developed Countries). There are several types of aid:\n* Governmental (bilateral) aid\n* International Organizational (multilateral) aid, e.g. The World Bank\n* Voluntary aid from individuals, often mediated through NGOs\n* Short-term/emergency aid (humanitarian assistance)\n* Long-term/sustainable aid\n* Non-governmental organization (NGO) aid\n\nAid can be given in several ways. Through money, materials, or skilled and learned people (e.g. teachers).\n\nAid has advantages. Mostly short-term or emergency aid help people in LEDCs to survive a natural (earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption etc.) or human (civil war etc.) disaster. Aid helps make the recipient country (the country that receives aid) get more developed.\n\nHowever, aid also has disadvantages. Often aid does not even reach the poorest people. Often money gained from aid is used up to make infrastructures (bridges, roads etc.), which only the rich can use. Also, the recipient country becomes more dependent on aid from a donor country (the country giving aid).\n\nWhilst the above conception of aid has been the most pervasive within development geography work, it is important to remember that the aid landscape is far more complex than one directional flows from 'developed' to 'developing' countries. Development geographers have been at the forefront of research that aims to understand both the material exchanges and discourse surrounding 'South-South' development cooperation. 'Non-traditional' foreign aid from Southern, Middle Eastern and post-Socialist states (those outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD) provide alternative development discourses and approaches to that of the mainstream Western model. Development geographers seek to examine the geopolitical drivers behind the aid donor programmes of \"LEDCs\", as well as the discursive symbolic repertoires of non-DAC donor states.<ref>Mawdsley, E. (2012) 'The Changing Geographies of Foreign Aid and Development Cooperation: Contributions from Gift Theory' Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 37(2): 256-72</ref> Two illustrative examples of the complex aid landscape are that of China, which has been active as an aid donor throughout the latter half of the twentieth century but published its first report on foreign aid policy as recently as 2011<ref>China publishes first report on foreign aid policy, ''[[The Guardian]]'' report: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/apr/28/china-foreign-aid-policy-report</ref> and India, an often cited aid recipient, but which has had donor programmes to Nepal and Bhutan since the 1950s.<ref>India's foreign aid programmes: https://m.devex.com/news/india-s-foreign-aid-program-catches-up-with-its/80919</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n* Allen J.

Many developing countries do rely on exports of a few primary goods for a large amount of their income (coffee and timber for example), and this can create havoc when the value of these commodities drops, leaving these countries with no way to pay off their debts.\n\nWithin countries the pattern is that wealth is more concentrated around urban areas than rural areas. Wealth also tends towards areas with natural resources or in areas that are involved in tertiary (service) industries and trade. This leads to a gathering of wealth around mines and monetary centres such as New York, London and Tokyo.\n\nGeography can also affect economic development in a number of ways. Analysis of current data sets show three significant implications of geography on developing nations.<ref>J. Sachs, A. Mellinger and J. Gallup (2001) \"The Geography of Poverty and Wealth,\" ''Scientific American'', March: 70-76.</ref> First, access to sea routes is important; this has been noted as far back as [[Adam Smith]]. Sea travel is much cheaper and faster than that of land, leading to a wider and quicker dissemination of both resources and ideas, both of which are integral to economic stimulus. Geography also dictates the prevalence of disease: for example, the [[World Health Organization]] estimates roughly 300-500 million new cases of [[malaria]] every year. Malaria is largely associated with nations that have struggled to achieve sound economic development. Not only does disease decrease labor productivity, but it changes the age structure of the country, forcing the population to lean heavily toward children as adults die from disease and the population sees an increase of fertility to keep up with the high death rates. High fertility both lowers the quality of life for each child due to a decrease in resources allocated to each of them, and also decreases labor productivity for women. The third way geography affects development is through agricultural productivity. Temperate regions have shown the highest output of major grains; regions such as the African [[savanna]] relatively yield much less value for the labor cost. Low agricultural output means that a larger portion of the population must spend their efforts in agriculture, leading to a slower urban development. This, in turn, discourages technological advance: an essential source of development for the twenty-first century.\n\n==Barriers to international development==\n\nGeographers along with other social scientists have recognized that certain factors present in a given society may impede the social and economic development of that society. Factors, which have been identified as obstructing the economic and social welfare of developing societies, include:\n\n*Lack of education<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gyimah-Brempong | first1 = K | year = 2011 | title = Education and Economic Development in Africa | url = | journal = [[African Development Review]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 219\u2013236 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8268.2011.00282.x }}</ref> \n*Lack of healthcare<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/17537980810861475 |title=Spearheading human and economic development in the Arab world through evidence\u2010based and world\u2010class healthcare |journal=Education, Business and Society: Contemporary Middle Eastern Issues |volume=1 |pages=12 |year=2008 |last1=Bowman |first1=Brett |last2=Matzopoulos |first2=Richard |last3=Lerer |first3=Leonard }}</ref> \n*Pervasiveness of intoxicating drugs<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = Merrill | year = 2008 | title = Drugs and development: The global impact of drug use and trafficking on social and economic development | url = | journal = International Journal of Drug Policy | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 467\u2013478 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugpo.2006.12.007 | pmid = 19038724 }}\n</ref> \n*Weak political, social, and economic institutions<ref>Hernando de Soto, ''Dead Capital and the Poor'', The Johns Hopkins University Press. 2001{{pn|date=January 2017}}</ref> \n*Ineffective taxation\n*Environmental degradation<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mosznski | first1 = Peter | year = 2011 | title = Environmental degradation risks undermining development progress, warns report | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 343 | issue = | pages = d7043| doi = 10.1136/bmj.d7043 | pmid = 22049525 }}</ref> \n*Lack of religious/gender/racial/sexual freedoms\n*Indebtedness\n*Protectionist barriers to trade<ref>Merideth Kolsky Lewis \"The EU's Protectionist Problem\" Georgetown journal of International affairs. 01/01/2009</ref> \n*Foreign aid<ref>Africa: the poorest continent is rising.

Some barriers to development may be impossible to address, such as climatic barriers to development.  In these cases societies must evaluate whether such climatic barriers to development dictate that society must relocate a given settlement in order to enjoy greater economic development.\n\nMany scholars agree that foreign aid provided to developing nations is ineffective and in many instances counter productive.<ref>Africa: the poorest continent is rising. Really.Dambisa Moyo. Foreign Policy. .172 (May\u2013June 2009) p90.</ref>   This is due to the manner in which foreign aid changes the incentives for productivity in a given developing society, and the manner in which foreign aid has the tendency to corrupt the governments responsible for its allocation and distribution.\n\nCultural barriers to development such as discrimination based on gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation are challenging to address in certain oppressive societies, though recent progress has been significant in some societies.\n\nWhile the aforementioned barriers to economic growth and development are most prevalent in the less developed economies of the world, even the most developed economies are plagued by select barriers to development such as drug prohibition and income inequality.\n\n== Aid ==\n[[MEDC]]s (More Economically Developed Countries) can give aid to [[LEDC]]s (Less Economically Developed Countries). There are several types of aid:\n* Governmental (bilateral) aid\n* International Organizational (multilateral) aid, e.g. The World Bank\n* Voluntary aid from individuals, often mediated through NGOs\n* Short-term/emergency aid (humanitarian assistance)\n* Long-term/sustainable aid\n* Non-governmental organization (NGO) aid\n\nAid can be given in several ways. Through money, materials, or skilled and learned people (e.g. teachers).\n\nAid has advantages. Mostly short-term or emergency aid help people in LEDCs to survive a natural (earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption etc.) or human (civil war etc.) disaster. Aid helps make the recipient country (the country that receives aid) get more developed.\n\nHowever, aid also has disadvantages. Often aid does not even reach the poorest people. Often money gained from aid is used up to make infrastructures (bridges, roads etc.), which only the rich can use. Also, the recipient country becomes more dependent on aid from a donor country (the country giving aid).\n\nWhilst the above conception of aid has been the most pervasive within development geography work, it is important to remember that the aid landscape is far more complex than one directional flows from 'developed' to 'developing' countries. Development geographers have been at the forefront of research that aims to understand both the material exchanges and discourse surrounding 'South-South' development cooperation. 'Non-traditional' foreign aid from Southern, Middle Eastern and post-Socialist states (those outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD) provide alternative development discourses and approaches to that of the mainstream Western model. Development geographers seek to examine the geopolitical drivers behind the aid donor programmes of \"LEDCs\", as well as the discursive symbolic repertoires of non-DAC donor states.<ref>Mawdsley, E. (2012) 'The Changing Geographies of Foreign Aid and Development Cooperation: Contributions from Gift Theory' Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 37(2): 256-72</ref> Two illustrative examples of the complex aid landscape are that of China, which has been active as an aid donor throughout the latter half of the twentieth century but published its first report on foreign aid policy as recently as 2011<ref>China publishes first report on foreign aid policy, ''[[The Guardian]]'' report: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/apr/28/china-foreign-aid-policy-report</ref> and India, an often cited aid recipient, but which has had donor programmes to Nepal and Bhutan since the 1950s.<ref>India's foreign aid programmes: https://m.devex.com/news/india-s-foreign-aid-program-catches-up-with-its/80919</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n* Allen J.

He was the son of [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]], the third Proprietor Governor of [[Maryland]] (1699\u20131751), and may have been the grandson of King [[George I of Great Britain]]. His mother's identity is not known, though one source suggests [[Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham]], an illegitimate daughter of the King.  He was certainly a descendant of Charles II through Charlotte Lee, Countess of Lichfield, the daughter of Barbara Palmer, Duchess of Cleveland, one of the king's mistresses. As he was illegitimate, he was not able to inherit his father's title or estates, which passed instead to his half brother [[Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore]] (1731\u20131771). Benedict Calvert spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony. Calvert became wealthy through proprietarial patronage and became an important colonial official, but he would lose his offices and his political power, though not his land and wealth, during the [[American Revolution]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Charlescalvert5th.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Calvert's father, [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]].]]\nCalvert was born Benedict Swinket in England on January 27, 1722, the illegitimate son of [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]], proprietary governor of the [[Province of Maryland]]. Although his birth year has been variously given as 1724 or 1730\u20131732, his own grave marker in the floor of the chancery of [[St. Thomas' Church (Upper Marlboro, Maryland)|St. Thomas Episcopal Church]] in Croom, Maryland shows the 1722 date, and this would appear to be the most reliable evidence available.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/31102503 Find A Grave webpage for Benedict Swingate Calvert containing a photo of the plaque] Retrieved July 23, 2015</ref>\n\nOf course, the possibility exists that he may have deliberately falsified his birthdate in order to protect or obscure the identity of his mother.

Benedict Calvert spent most of his life as a politician and planter in Maryland, though Frederick, by contrast, never visited the colony.

It produces approximately 600 codes and standards covering many technical areas, such as fasteners, plumbing fixtures, elevators, pipelines, and power plant systems and components.  ASME's standards are developed by committees of subject matter experts using an open, consensus-based process.  Many ASME standards are cited by government agencies as tools to meet their regulatory objectives.  ASME standards are therefore voluntary, unless the standards have been incorporated into a legally binding business contract or incorporated into regulations enforced by an authority having jurisdiction, such as a federal, state, or local government agency.  ASME's standards are used in more than 100 countries and have been translated into numerous languages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Standards Are Global|url=http://www.asme.org/kb/standards/history-of-asme-standards|work=History of ASME Standards|publisher=ASME|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===ASME boiler and pressure vessel code (BPVC)===\n{{main article|ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code}}\nThe largest ASME standard, both in size and in the number of volunteers involved in its preparation, is the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC). The BPVC provides rules for the design, fabrication, installation, inspection, care, and use of [[boiler]]s, [[pressure vessel]]s, and nuclear components. The code also includes standards on materials, welding and brazing procedures and qualifications, nondestructive examination, and nuclear in-service inspection.\n\n===Other notable standardization areas===\n\nOther Notable Standardization Areas include but not limited to are; Elevators and Escalators (A17 Series), Overhead and Mobile Cranes and related lifting and rigging equipment (B30 Series), Piping and Pipelines (B31 Series), Bio-processing Equipment (BPE), Valves Flanges, [[B16 Standardization of Valves, Flanges, Fittings, and Gaskets|Fittings and Gaskets (B16)]], Nuclear Components and Processes Performance Test Codes.\n\n==Society awards==\nASME offers four categories of awards: achievement awards to recognize \"eminently distinguished engineering achievement\"; literature awards for original papers; service awards for voluntary service to ASME; and unit awards, jointly awarded by six societies in recognition of advancement in the field of transportation. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards|title=Honors & Awards|website=www.asme.org}}</ref>\n\n* [[ASME Medal]]\n* Charles T.

He actually runs an [[Prostitution in South Korea|illegal prostitution business]] under the name \"Uncle\" with the help of Lee Whang-chul, also called \"Old Man\", who protects the sex workers and transfers the money to Ji-soo. His classmate Seo Min-hee is one of the workers, though she does not know who \"Uncle\" is. One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Whang-chul to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap. She sends the alert and Ji-soo eventually leaves Gyu-ri to save Min-hee, calling the police but giving the wrong motel room only to scare the client. The latter takes a picture of Min-hee before leaving and intents to upload it on the high school's website at a [[PC bang]] before he is stopped by Whang-chul. In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone, confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n

He actually runs an [[Prostitution in South Korea|illegal prostitution business]] under the name \"Uncle\" with the help of Lee Whang-chul, also called \"Old Man\", who protects the sex workers and transfers the money to Ji-soo. His classmate Seo Min-hee is one of the workers, though she does not know who \"Uncle\" is. One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Whang-chul to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap. She sends the alert and Ji-soo eventually leaves Gyu-ri to save Min-hee, calling the police but giving the wrong motel room only to scare the client. The latter takes a picture of Min-hee before leaving and intents to upload it on the high school's website at a [[PC bang]] before he is stopped by Whang-chul. In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone, confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Episode 2\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Episode 3\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Episode 4\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Episode 7\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Episode 8\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |Title           = Episode 9\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |Title           = Episode 10\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe series is written by [[Song Ji-na]]'s son Jin Han-sae, directed by {{illm|Kim Jin-min|ko|\uae40\uc9c4\ubbfc (\uc5f0\ucd9c\uac00)}} (''[[Time Between Dog and Wolf]]'', ''[[Road No. 1]]'', ''[[Lawless Lawyer]]''), and produced by Studio 329, the same company behind [[YouTube Premium]]'s first and only Korean original series ''[[Top Management (TV series)|Top Management]]''.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming ended on August 6, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Park|first1=So-hee|url=https://entertain.v.daum.net/v/20190807164206994|date=August 7, 2019|work=Daum|title=\uae40\ub3d9\ud76c, '\uc778\uac04\uc218\uc5c5' \ucd2c\uc601 \ub05d \"\ud568\uaed8 \ud574\uc900 \uc2a4\ud15d\ub4e4 \uac10\uc0ac\ud574\uc694\"|language=ko|accessdate=August 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[https://www.netflix.com/title/80990668 Extracurricular]'' on [[Netflix]]\n* {{IMDb title|tt10262630}}\n* {{Hancinema drama|Human_Lessons}}\n\n{{Netflix original series}}\n\n[[Category:Korean-language Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:South Korean romance television series]]\n[[Category:2020s South Korean television series]]\n[[Category:2020 South Korean television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Teen drama television series]]\n[[Category:South Korean crime television series]]\n[[Category:Prostitution in television]]\n", "name_user": "Seokgjin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracurricular_(TV_series)"}

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "{{about|Sexual slavery in Islam|  other uses| Islam and slavery (disambiguation) }}\n{{italic title}}\n'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} While a free Muslim woman was considered to be a man's honour, a slave-girl was merely property and not a man's honour.{{sfn|Bouachrine|2014|p=8}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Islamic jurists held that non-muslims who lived in areas which had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n**Non-muslims residents of an Islamic state who fail to pay jizya or break their contract with the state can also be enslaved.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=26}}{{sfn|Rodriguez|2015|p=2}} However, Muslim rebels can not be enslaved.{{sfn|Lewis|1991|p=82}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the implications of this episode and only considers the event in the context of discussing [[contraceptive]] practices.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Muslim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the information found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} \n\nDue to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}} One of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep. They throw the babe from her mother and drive her into slavery; the child calls out from the ground and the mother hears, yet what is she to do?...They separate the children from the mother like the soul from within the body, and she watches as they divide her loved ones from off her lap, two of them go to two masters, herself to another[...] Her children cry out in lament, their eyes hot with tears.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an ''umm walad''. If she became an ''umm walad'' her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} If someone bought a woman, he could not separate her child from her until the stipulated age, which according to [[Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani|Ibn Abi Zayd]] was when the child became six years old.{{sfn|Bellagamba|2016|p=24}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines. The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] possessed hundreds of concubines. The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to have owned four thousand concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers.

This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n{{quote box|align=right|width=34%|quote=And if a man wants to take a concubine and his wife says to him \"I will kill myself,\" he is not prohibited [from doing so], because it is a lawful act, but if he abstains to save her grief, he will be rewarded, because of the hadith \"Whoever sympathises with my community, God will sympathise with him.\"|source=A 17th century Hanafi scholar, Imam Haskafi, writes in his jurisprudential work Al-Durr al-Mukhtar{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=50}}}}\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 European girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat|Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} Aurangzeb would enslave rebellious peasants.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=91}} [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2,2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=34%|quote=Of our women, you did not capture many.

The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim families tried to ransom their daughters, mothers and wives who had been captured and enslaved.{{sfn|Salzmann|2013|p=397}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\n[[Kurds]] in the Ottoman-Persian frontier would enslave both Shias and Yazidis. The Ottoman jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi|Ebu Su'ud]] upheld the permissibility of wars against the Shia but he forbade the taking of Shias as captives. In particular, he also declared that sexual intercourse with Shia female captives was unlawful. However, he endorsed enslavement of Shias in a later fatwa.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=43}} In 1786-7 an Ottoman general enslaved the wives and children of [[Mamluk]] emirs. In the region of modern day [[Chad]], Muslim women and children from [[Sultanate of Bagirmi|Bagirmi]] were enslaved by the [[List of rulers of Wadai|ruler of Wadai]] around 1800.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=44}}\n\n==Abolition==\n{{POV section|date=April 2020}}\nMarriage was not the only legal way to have sex in Muslim societies prior to the end of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=50}} Colonial governments and independent Muslim states restricted slave raids and the slave trade in response to pressure from Western liberals and nascent Muslim abolitionist movements. Eliminating slavery was an even more difficult task. Many Muslim governments refused to sign the international treaties against slavery which the [[League of Nations]] was co-ordinating since 1926. This refusal was also an issue at the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and at the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|1956 Anti-Slavery Convention]].{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=11}} It was mostly because of the pressure from European colonial powers and economic changes that slavery was abolished. White the institution was eventually abolished, there was no internally well-developed Islamic narrative against slave-ownership.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=54}}\n\nThere is an academic consensus that the Islamic legal sanction for slavery prevented the emergence of any anti-slavery movement in the Muslim world. But [[William Clarence-Smith]] has argued that \"Islamic abolitionism\" was indigenous and rooted in Islamic tradition. However, [[Ehud R. Toledano]] states that abolitionist views were very rare in Muslim societies{{sfn|Toledano|2013|p=121}} and that there was no indigenous abolitionist narrative in the Muslim world.{{sfn|Toledano|2013|p=122}} The scant evidence that exists of \"Islamic abolitionism\" shows that such discourse was extremely limited. The first anti-slavery views came from [[Syed Ahmad Khan]] in the subcontinent. The next anti-slavery texts are to be found, from the 1920s onwards, in the works of non-ulema who were writing outside the realm of Islamic tradition and [[Shariah]]. Amal Ghazal has shown that the modernist ulema in Egypt such as [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Rashid Rida]] were strongly opposed by the majority of Islamic jurists.{{sfn|Toledano|2013|p=122}} While Abduh took a stand in favour of abolition, he noted that only a gradualist approach, which encouraged manumission, would work because slavery itself was sanctioned in Islamic law.{{sfn|Toledano|2013|p=123}}\n{{quote box|align=right|width=34%|quote=Female slavery, being a condition necessary to the legality of this coveted indulgence [concubinage], will never be put down, with a willing or hearty co-operation by any Mussalman community.|source=William Muir, Life of Mahomet.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=277-278}}}}\nIn the late 19th century some Indian Muslim modernists had rejected the legitimacy of slavery in Islam.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=262}} This reformist take on slavery was a part of regenerated Indian Muslim thinking in the 1860s and 1870s.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=264}} Syed Ahmad Khan and [[Syed Ameer Ali]] were primarily concerned with refuting Western criticism of Islamic slavery. However, they did not directly refute the European criticism about female slavery and concubinage.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=269}} According to Dilawar Husain Ahmad, polygamy and concubinage were responsible for \"Muslim decline.\"{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=275}} [[Chiragh Ali]] denied the Quranic permission for concubinage.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=277}} However, he accepted [[William Muir]]'s view that Muslims would not abandon female slavery willingly, but he asserted that Muslim jurists did not allow concubinage with the female slaves being imported from Africa, [[Central Asia]] and Georgia in that time. However, he did not specify who these Islamic jurists were.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=278}} Syed Ahmad Khan was opposed by the ulama on a number of issues, including his views on slavery.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=275}}\n\nA group of ulama led by Waji al-Din Saharanpuri gave a fatwa in the 1830s that it was lawful to enslave even those men and women \"who sought refuge\" after battle. Sayyed Imdad Ali Akbarabadi led ulama in publishing a lot of material in defence of traditional kinds of slavery. Sayyid Muhammad Askari condemned the idea of abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}}  In the 19th century some ulama in Cairo refused to allow slave girls, who had been freed under secular law, to marry unless they had obtained permission from their owner.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=138}} After 1882 the Egyptian ulama refused to prohibit slavery on the grounds that the Prophet had never forbidden it. In 1899 a scholar from  [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]], Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad al-Bulayqi implicitly defended concubinage and refuted modernist arguments.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=139}} Most ulama in [[West Africa]] opposed abolition.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=144-145}} They ruled that concubinage was still allowed with women of slave descent.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=145}} \n\nIn 1911 one Qadi in Mombasa ruled that no government can free a slave without the owner's permission.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=146}} [[J. Spencer Trimingham|Spencer Trimingham]] observed that in coastal Arab areas masters continued to take concubines from slave families because the descendants of slaves are still considered to be enslaved under religious law even if they had been freed according to secular law.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}} The Ottoman ulama maintained the permissibility of slavery due to its Islamic legal sanction. They rejected demands by Young Ottomans for fatwas to ban slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=140-141}} \n\nA conservative [[Deobandi]] scholar published a book in [[Lahore]] in 1946 in which he denied that the Prophet had ever encouraged the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}} After 1947, the ulama in Pakistan called for the revival of slavery. The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\nA lot of ulama in Mauritania did not recognise the legitimacy of abolishing slavery. In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritania]]n scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their gods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\n===Middle East===\nArmenians underwent a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]] in the Ottoman Empire, which climaxed around 1915-16.

[[Eliz Sanasarian]] also notes the involvement of Turkish women in perpetrating violence against Armenian women by selling them into sexual slavery.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=91}} Women who were deemed beautiful were sold as sex slaves to military officials. The remaining women would be beaten and raped.{{sfn|Crawford|2017|p=13}} The women were also often forced into prostitution or forcibly married with non-Armenians.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=126}} \n\nKidnapped Armenian girls were sorted on the basis of their age, beauty and marital status. The \"first choice\" was given to high-level Ottoman officials. Outside [[Mezre]], purchasers asked doctors to check the girls for diseases and to verify their virginity. One German reported the sale of girls in [[Ras al-Ayn]] and testified that the policemen carried out the trade in girls.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141}} A few slave markets were set up in the vicinity of government buildings while Armenian captive sex slaves were kept in the Red Crescent Hospital in Trebizond.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141-142}} The fact that before the genocide the Armenian leaders had appealed to outside powers, to press the Ottomans to make reforms for the Christians, was cited as a violation of their contract with the state.{{sfn|Bloxham|2008|p=361}} Hence, one [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] shaykh ruled that Muslims could buy the Christian girls from the slave markets in the Levant.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=141-142}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]].

One of its atrocities has been to enslave Shia [[Hazaras|Hazara]] women and use them for concubinage.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} The Taliban either took beautiful young women from other ethnic groups as concubines or forcibly married them.{{sfn|Claus|2003|p=7}} In 1998 eyewitnesses in [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar e Sharif]] reported the abduction of hundreds of Shia girls who were used by Taliban fighters as concubines.{{sfn|Nojumi|2016|p=168}} The number of Hazara women taken as concubines by the Taliban was 400.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ahmed Rashid|title=Taliban|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dld2wJ2Z__4C&pg=PA75|year=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16484-8|pages=75\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===North Africa===\nThe evidence strongly demonstrates that the government of Sudan had revived slavery and made it as important as it was in the previous century.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=29}} The [[Sudanese army]] had a central role in the revival of slavery.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=32}} The slavery in Sudan was a result of the conflict between [[North Sudan]]'s Arab Muslims and [[South Sudan]]'s black Christians.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} Christian prisoners of war in the [[Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005)|Sudanese civil war]] were often enslaved. The female captives were used sexually. Their Muslim captors asserted that Islamic law allowed them.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} Sudan's Arab government had recruited Arab troops. One component consisted of millitias and the other component of their forces, called the [[Popular Defense Forces]], consisted of the Sudanese Army. This was a mainly jihadi force fighting the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] which they considered to be an \"enemy of Islam and the Arabs.\"{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=24-25}} Arab raiders destroyed black Christian villages, executed all their  males and then took away the women and children as slaves.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} \n\nRegular soldiers also abducted women and children. The Sudanese government allowed soldiers to take booty to supplement their low salaries. The first slave raid on the [[Dinka]] took place on February 1986.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=25}} Two thousand women and children were taken. In a second raid on February 1987 one thousand women and children were taken. Once the raiders acquired enough booty they would distribute the captives between their selves and their families. Slave raids continued every year after 1985.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=26}} Dinka girls kept in Arab households were used as sex-slaves.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=35}} Some of them were sold to Arab men in [[Libya]], It has been alleged that slave markets were set up in Sudan. Western visitors noted that five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989 female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, when there was an abundance of slaves, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15. Many Western organisations traveled to Sudan with funds collected for the purpose of purchasing these slaves to emancipate them.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}} For example, [[Muhammad Asad]], rejected the notion of any sexual relationship outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asad|first=Muhammad|title=The Message of the Quran.

However, Kecia Ali states that this view is not found anywhere in the pre-modern Islamic legal tradition.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic views on slavery]]\n* [[Polygamy in Islam]]\n* [[Rape in Islamic law]]\n* [[What your right hands possess]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4|pages=196\u2013225|DOI=10.1163/2405836X-00402004| ref = {{sfnRef|Pernilla|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Asifa Quraishi-Landes|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfkFDAAAQBAJ|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13579-1|chapter=A Meditation on Mahr, Modernity, and Muslim Marriage Contract Law| ref = {{sfnRef|Quraishi-Landes|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4XCwAAQBAJ|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-853-5| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2015}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Ibtissam Bouachrine|title=Women and Islam: Myths, Apologies, and the Limits of Feminist Critique|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fxavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8|date=21 May 2014|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-7907-9| ref = {{sfnRef|Bouachrine|2014}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Saad |first1=Salma |title=The legal and social status of women in the Hadith literature |date=1990 |page=242|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/508/1/uk_bl_ethos_443314.pdf| ref = {{sfnRef|Saad|1990}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Jarbel Rodriguez|title=Muslim and Christian Contact in the Middle Ages: A Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3VoBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-0066-9|date=2015}}\n*{{cite book|author=Y.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} While a free Muslim woman was considered to be a man's honour, a slave-girl was merely property and not a man's honour.{{sfn|Bouachrine|2014|p=8}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Islamic jurists held that non-muslims who lived in areas which had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n**Non-muslims residents of an Islamic state who fail to pay jizya or break their contract with the state can also be enslaved.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=26}}{{sfn|Rodriguez|2015|p=2}} However, Muslim rebels can not be enslaved.{{sfn|Lewis|1991|p=82}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the implications of this episode and only considers the event in the context of discussing [[contraceptive]] practices.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Muslim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women.

The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} \n\nDue to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him.

Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family.

However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an ''umm walad''. If she became an ''umm walad'' her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} If someone bought a woman, he could not separate her child from her until the stipulated age, which according to [[Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani|Ibn Abi Zayd]] was when the child became six years old.{{sfn|Bellagamba|2016|p=24}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines. The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] possessed hundreds of concubines. The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to have owned four thousand concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n{{quote box|align=right|width=34%|quote=And if a man wants to take a concubine and his wife says to him \"I will kill myself,\" he is not prohibited [from doing so], because it is a lawful act, but if he abstains to save her grief, he will be rewarded, because of the hadith \"Whoever sympathises with my community, God will sympathise with him.\"|source=A 17th century Hanafi scholar, Imam Haskafi, writes in his jurisprudential work Al-Durr al-Mukhtar{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=50}}}}\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household.

The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim families tried to ransom their daughters, mothers and wives who had been captured and enslaved.{{sfn|Salzmann|2013|p=397}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\n[[Kurds]] in the Ottoman-Persian frontier would enslave both Shias and Yazidis. The Ottoman jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi|Ebu Su'ud]] upheld the permissibility of wars against the Shia but he forbade the taking of Shias as captives. In particular, he also declared that sexual intercourse with Shia female captives was unlawful. However, he endorsed enslavement of Shias in a later fatwa.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=43}} In 1786-7 an Ottoman general enslaved the wives and children of [[Mamluk]] emirs. In the region of modern day [[Chad]], Muslim women and children from [[Sultanate of Bagirmi|Bagirmi]] were enslaved by the [[List of rulers of Wadai|ruler of Wadai]] around 1800.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=44}}\n\n==Abolition==\n{{POV section|date=April 2020}}\n{{quote box|align=right|width=34%|quote=Female slavery, being a condition necessary to the legality of this coveted indulgence [concubinage], will never be put down, with a willing or hearty co-operation by any Mussalman community.|source=William Muir, Life of Mahomet.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=277-278}}}}\n\nMarriage was not the only legal way to have sex in Muslim societies prior to the end of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=50}} Colonial governments and independent Muslim states restricted slave raids and the slave trade in response to pressure from Western liberals and nascent Muslim abolitionist movements. Eliminating slavery was an even more difficult task. Many Muslim governments refused to sign the international treaties against slavery which the [[League of Nations]] was co-ordinating since 1926. This refusal was also an issue at the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and at the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|1956 Anti-Slavery Convention]].{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=11}} It was mostly because of the pressure from European colonial powers and economic changes that slavery was abolished. White the institution was eventually abolished, there was no internally well-developed Islamic narrative against slave-ownership.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=54}}\n\nThere is an academic consensus that the Islamic legal sanction for slavery prevented the emergence of any anti-slavery movement in the Muslim world. But [[William Clarence-Smith]] has argued that \"Islamic abolitionism\" was indigenous and rooted in Islamic tradition. However, [[Ehud R. Toledano]] states that abolitionist views were very rare in Muslim societies{{sfn|Toledano|2013|p=121}} and that there was no indigenous abolitionist narrative in the Muslim world.{{sfn|Toledano|2013|p=122}} The scant evidence that exists of \"Islamic abolitionism\" shows that such discourse was extremely limited. The first anti-slavery views came from [[Syed Ahmad Khan]] in the subcontinent. The next anti-slavery texts are to be found, from the 1920s onwards, in the works of non-ulema who were writing outside the realm of Islamic tradition and [[Shariah]]. Amal Ghazal has shown that the modernist ulema in Egypt such as [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Rashid Rida]] were strongly opposed by the majority of Islamic jurists.{{sfn|Toledano|2013|p=122}} While Abduh took a stand in favour of abolition, he noted that only a gradualist approach, which encouraged manumission, would work because slavery itself was sanctioned in Islamic law.{{sfn|Toledano|2013|p=123}}\n\nIn the late 19th century some Indian Muslim modernists had rejected the legitimacy of slavery in Islam.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=262}} This reformist take on slavery was a part of regenerated Indian Muslim thinking in the 1860s and 1870s.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=264}} Syed Ahmad Khan and [[Syed Ameer Ali]] were primarily concerned with refuting Western criticism of Islamic slavery. However, they did not directly refute the European criticism about female slavery and concubinage.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=269}} According to Dilawar Husain Ahmad, polygamy and concubinage were responsible for \"Muslim decline.\"{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=275}} [[Chiragh Ali]] denied the Quranic permission for concubinage.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=277}} However, he accepted [[William Muir]]'s view that Muslims would not abandon female slavery willingly, but he asserted that Muslim jurists did not allow concubinage with the female slaves being imported from Africa, [[Central Asia]] and Georgia in that time. However, he did not specify who these Islamic jurists were.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=278}} Syed Ahmad Khan was opposed by the ulama on a number of issues, including his views on slavery.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=275}}\n\nA group of ulama led by Waji al-Din Saharanpuri gave a fatwa in the 1830s that it was lawful to enslave even those men and women \"who sought refuge\" after battle. Sayyed Imdad Ali Akbarabadi led ulama in publishing a lot of material in defence of traditional kinds of slavery. Sayyid Muhammad Askari condemned the idea of abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}}  In the 19th century some ulama in Cairo refused to allow slave girls, who had been freed under secular law, to marry unless they had obtained permission from their owner.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=138}} After 1882 the Egyptian ulama refused to prohibit slavery on the grounds that the Prophet had never forbidden it. In 1899 a scholar from  [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]], Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad al-Bulayqi implicitly defended concubinage and refuted modernist arguments.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=139}} Most ulama in [[West Africa]] opposed abolition.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=144-145}} They ruled that concubinage was still allowed with women of slave descent.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=145}} \n\nIn 1911 one Qadi in Mombasa ruled that no government can free a slave without the owner's permission.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=146}} [[J. Spencer Trimingham|Spencer Trimingham]] observed that in coastal Arab areas masters continued to take concubines from slave families because the descendants of slaves are still considered to be enslaved under religious law even if they had been freed according to secular law.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}} The Ottoman ulama maintained the permissibility of slavery due to its Islamic legal sanction. They rejected demands by Young Ottomans for fatwas to ban slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=140-141}} \n\nA conservative [[Deobandi]] scholar published a book in [[Lahore]] in 1946 in which he denied that the Prophet had ever encouraged the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}} After 1947, the ulama in Pakistan called for the revival of slavery. The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\nA lot of ulama in Mauritania did not recognise the legitimacy of abolishing slavery. In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritania]]n scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their gods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\n===Middle East===\nArmenians underwent a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]] in the Ottoman Empire, which climaxed around 1915-16. It has been accepted as the first  genocide of the 20th century by scholars of genocide and historians of the late Ottoman period.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=90}} The Ottomans had intended to destroy the Armenians.{{sfn|Eltringham|2014|p=14}} Derderuan notes that after being separated from their men who were killed, the Armenian women and children were raped, forcibly converted to Islam and subjected to sexual slavery. [[Eliz Sanasarian]] also notes the involvement of Turkish women in perpetrating violence against Armenian women by selling them into sexual slavery.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=91}} Women who were deemed beautiful were sold as sex slaves to military officials. The remaining women would be beaten and raped.{{sfn|Crawford|2017|p=13}} The women were also often forced into prostitution or forcibly married with non-Armenians.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=126}} \n\nKidnapped Armenian girls were sorted on the basis of their age, beauty and marital status. The \"first choice\" was given to high-level Ottoman officials. Outside [[Mezre]], purchasers asked doctors to check the girls for diseases and to verify their virginity. One German reported the sale of girls in [[Ras al-Ayn]] and testified that the policemen carried out the trade in girls.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141}} A few slave markets were set up in the vicinity of government buildings while Armenian captive sex slaves were kept in the Red Crescent Hospital in Trebizond.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141-142}} The fact that before the genocide the Armenian leaders had appealed to outside powers, to press the Ottomans to make reforms for the Christians, was cited as a violation of their contract with the state.{{sfn|Bloxham|2008|p=361}} Hence, one [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] shaykh ruled that Muslims could buy the Christian girls from the slave markets in the Levant.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=141-142}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]].

In the process industry, a [[Symbolic language (engineering)|standard set of symbols]] is used to prepare drawings of processes. The instrument symbols used in these drawings are generally based on [[International Society of Automation]] (ISA) Standard S5.1\n# The primary schematic drawing used for laying out a [[process control]] installation.\n\nThey usually contain the following information:\n\n* Mechanical equipment, including:\n**[[Pressure vessel|Pressure vessels]], columns, tanks, [[Pump|pumps]], [[Compressor|compressors]], [[Heat exchanger|heat exchangers]], [[Furnace|furnaces]], [[Wellhead|wellheads]], fans, [[Cooling tower|cooling towers]], [[Turboexpander|turbo-expanders]], [[Pigging|pig traps]] (see 'symbols' below)\n**[[Rupture disc|Bursting discs]], restriction orifices, strainers and filters, [[Steam trap|steam traps]], moisture traps, sight-glasses, silencers, flares and vents, [[Flame arrester|flame arrestors]], vortex breakers, [[Injector|eductors]]\n\n*Process piping, sizes and identification, including:\n**Pipe classes and piping line numbers\n**Flow directions\n**Interconnections references\n**Permanent start-up, flush and bypass lines\n**Pipelines and flowlines\n**Blinds and spectacle blinds\n**Insulation and heat tracing\n*Process control instrumentation and designation (names, numbers, unique tag identifiers), including:\n**Valves and their types and identifications (e.g. isolation, shutoff, relief and [[safety valve]]s, valve interlocks)\n**Control inputs and outputs ([[sensor]]s and final elements, interlocks)\n**Miscellaneous - vents, drains, [[flange]]s, special fittings, sampling lines, reducers and swages\n*Interfaces for class changes\n*Computer control system\n*Identification of components and subsystems delivered by others\n\nP&IDs are originally drawn up at the design stage from a combination of process flow sheet data, the mechanical process equipment design, and the instrumentation engineering design.  During the design stage, the diagram also provides the basis for the development of system control schemes, allowing for further safety and operational investigations, such as a [[Hazard and operability study]] (HAZOP). To do this, it is critical to demonstrate the physical sequence of equipment and systems, as well as how these systems connect.\n\nP&IDs also play a significant role in the maintenance and modification of the process after initial build. Modifications are red-penned onto the diagrams and are vital records of the current plant design.\n\nThey are also vital in enabling development of;\n*Control and shutdown schemes\n*Safety and regulatory requirements\n*Start-up sequences\n*Operational understanding.\n\nP&IDs form the basis for the live mimic diagrams displayed on [[graphical user interface]]s of large [[industrial control system]]s such as [[SCADA]] and [[distributed control system]]s.\n\n==Identification and reference designation==\nBased on STANDARD [[ANSI]]/[[Instrument Society of America|ISA]] S5.1 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14617-6, the P&ID is used for the identification of measurements within the process. The identifications consist of up to 5 letters. The first identification letter is for the measured value, the second is a modifier, 3rd indicates passive/readout function, 4th - active/output function, and the 5th is the function modifier. This is followed by loop number, which is unique to that loop. For instance FIC045 means it is the Flow Indicating Controller in control loop 045. This is also known as the \"tag\" identifier of the field device, which is normally given to the location and function of the instrument. The same loop may have FT045 - which is the flow transmitter in the same loop.\n\n{| class= \"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#B3B7FF\"\n|  '''Letter''' || '''Column 1''' (Measured value) || '''Column 2''' (Modifier) || '''Column 3''' (Readout/passive function) || '''Column 4''' (Output/active function) || '''Column 5''' (Function modifier)\n|- \n|A ||Analysis || || Alarm  || ||\n|- \n|B ||Burner, combustion || || User choice || User choice || User choice\n|- \n|C ||User's choice (usually conductivity)|| || || Control || Close\n|- \n|D ||User's choice (usually density) || Difference || || || Deviation\n|- \n|E ||Voltage || || Sensor || ||\n|- \n|F ||Flow rate|| Ratio || || ||\n|- \n|G ||User's choice (usually gaging/gauging) || Gas || Glass/gauge/viewing || ||\n|- \n|H ||Hand || || || || High\n|- \n|I ||Current || || Indicate || ||\n|- \n|J ||Power || Scan ||  || ||\n|- \n|K ||Time, time schedule || Time rate of change || || Control station ||\n|- \n|L ||Level || || Light || || Low\n|- \n|M ||User's choice || || || || Middle / intermediate\n|- \n|N ||User's choice (usually torque) || || User choice || User choice || User choice\n|- \n|O ||User's choice || || Orifice || || Open\n|- \n|P ||Pressure || || Point/test connection || ||\n|- \n|Q ||Quantity || Totalize/integrate || Totalize/integrate || ||\n|- \n|R ||Radiation || || Record || || Run\n|- \n|S ||Speed, frequency || Safety (Non SIS (S5.1))||  || Switch || Stop\n|- \n|T ||Temperature || || || Transmit ||\n|- \n|U ||Multivariable || || Multifunction || Multifunction ||\n|- \n|V ||Vibration, mechanical analysis || || || Valve or damper ||\n|- \n|W ||Weight, force || || Well or probe || ||\n|-\n|X ||User's choice (usually on-off valve as XV) || X-axis || Accessory devices, unclassified || Unclassified || Unclassified\n|-\n|Y ||Event, state, presence || Y-axis || || Auxiliary devices ||\n|-\n|Z ||Position, dimension || Z-axis or Safety Instrumented System  || || Actuator, driver or unclassified final control element ||\n|-\n|}\n\nFor reference designation of any equipment in industrial systems the standard [[IEC 61346]] (''Industrial systems, installations and equipment and industrial products \u2014 Structuring principles and reference designations'') can be applied.

[[Thornton Wilder]] adapted Nestroy's play into his 1938 farcical play ''The Merchant of Yonkers''. That play was a flop, so he revised it and retitled it as ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' in 1955, expanding the role of Dolly (played by [[Ruth Gordon]]).<ref name=London2008>[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/hello-dolly-new-wimbledon-theatre-review \"Hello Dolly! \u2013 New Wimbledon Theatre\"] IndieLondon, March 2008</ref>  ''The Matchmaker'' became a hit and was much revived and made into [[The Matchmaker (1958 film)|a 1958 film]] starring [[Shirley Booth]].

Dolly makes a living through what she calls \"meddling\" \u2013 matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons (\"I Put My Hand In\").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.\n\nHorace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because \"It Takes a Woman\" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and \"accidentally\" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.\n\nCornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the [[polka]] competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIrene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (\"Ribbons Down My Back\").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of ''the'' Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics \"Alamo, remember the Alamo!\" (\"Motherhood March\"). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.\n\nDolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (\"Dancing\").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life \"Before the Parade Passes By\".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:Carol Channing Hello Dolly 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Milo Boulton and [[Carol Channing]] in one of several national tours, 1966 ]]\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got \"Elegance\".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be \"twice as lightning\" (\"The Waiters' Gallop\").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (\"Hello, Dolly!\") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during \"The [[Polka]] Contest\", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.\n\nCornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (\"It Only Takes A Moment\"). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him \"So Long, Dearie\", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\"  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Hello, Dolly\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dolly Gallagher Levi''': A widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again.

During the tryouts in [[Detroit]], [[Gower Champion]] invited [[Charles Strouse]] and [[Lee Adams]] to consult on improvements to the musical. [[David Merrick]] was aware of their involvement, but Jerry Herman was not, even though Strouse was under impression that Herman knew about it. Strouse and Adams suggested re-working the ending of Act I, wrote a new song \"Before the Parade Passes By\" and sent it to Champion.

It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ...  Mr. Herman's songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ...  Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome ''Hello, Dolly!'' for its warmth, color and high spirits.<ref>Taubman, Howard.

Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse's neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.</blockquote>\n\nKerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the \"lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them\".<ref name=Suskin/> John McClain of the [[New York Journal American]] particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that\n\n<blockquote>Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song \"Hello, Dolly!\"] produces. Last night the audience nearly tore up the seats as she led the parade of waiters in a series of encores over the semi-circular runway that extends around the orchestra pit out into the audience, ... a tribute to the personal appeal of Miss Channing and the magical inventiveness of Mr. Champion's staging.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Award \n! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1964\n| [[New York Drama Critics Circle|New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramacritics.org/dc_pastawards.html#1964 \"New York Drama Critics Past Awards, 1964\"] dramacritics.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2810 \" 'Hello Dolly' Listing, 1964\u20131970\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 \"Tony Awards, 1964\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105101119/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 |date=2012-01-05 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153433.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1964\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]]\n| [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]]\n| [[Carol Channing]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical]]\n| [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\n| [[Jerry Herman]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award|Best Producer of a Musical]]\n| [[David Merrick]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical|Best Direction of a Musical]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Gower Champion]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Conductor and Musical Director|Best Conductor and Musical Director]]\n| Shepard Coleman\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]]\n| [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]\n| [[Freddy Wittop]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1968\n| [[Special Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 \"Tony Awards, 1968\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407225811/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 |date=2016-04-07 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=30650 \"Pearl Bailey Listing, Awards and Nominations\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153442.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1968\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| Special Award\n| [[Pearl Bailey]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1970\n| [[Drama Desk Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramadesk.org/1969_1970dd.html \"Drama Desk, 1969\u20131970\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} dramadesk.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>Flinn, Caryl.

(film)|Hello Dolly!]]'' by [[20th Century Fox]], which won three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Score of a Musical Picture]] and was nominated in four other categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[42nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==History==\nThe plot of ''Hello, Dolly!'' originated in the 1835 English play ''A Day Well Spent'' by [[John Oxenford]], which [[Johann Nestroy]] adapted into the farce ''[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]'' (''He Will Go on a Spree'' or ''He'll Have Himself a Good Time''). [[Thornton Wilder]] adapted Nestroy's play into his 1938 farcical play ''The Merchant of Yonkers''. That play was a flop, so he revised it and retitled it as ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' in 1955, expanding the role of Dolly (played by [[Ruth Gordon]]).<ref name=London2008>[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/hello-dolly-new-wimbledon-theatre-review \"Hello Dolly! \u2013 New Wimbledon Theatre\"] IndieLondon, March 2008</ref>  ''The Matchmaker'' became a hit and was much revived and made into [[The Matchmaker (1958 film)|a 1958 film]] starring [[Shirley Booth]]. However, the 1891 musical ''[[A Trip to Chinatown]]'' also features a meddlesome widow who strives to bring romance to several couples and to herself in a big city restaurant.<ref>Saltzman, Simon.

Dolly makes a living through what she calls \"meddling\" \u2013 matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons (\"I Put My Hand In\").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.\n\nHorace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because \"It Takes a Woman\" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and \"accidentally\" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.\n\nCornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the [[polka]] competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIrene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (\"Ribbons Down My Back\").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of ''the'' Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics \"Alamo, remember the Alamo!\" (\"Motherhood March\"). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.\n\nDolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (\"Dancing\").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life \"Before the Parade Passes By\".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:Carol Channing Hello Dolly 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Milo Boulton and [[Carol Channing]] in one of several national tours, 1966 ]]\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got \"Elegance\".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be \"twice as lightning\" (\"The Waiters' Gallop\").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (\"Hello, Dolly!\") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during \"The [[Polka]] Contest\", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.\n\nCornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (\"It Only Takes A Moment\"). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him \"So Long, Dearie\", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\"  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Hello, Dolly\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dolly Gallagher Levi''': A widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again.

In his review of the opening night performance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' theatre critic Howard Taubman wrote\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' ... has qualities of freshness and imagination that are rare in the run of our machine-made musicals. It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ...  Mr. Herman's songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ...  Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome ''Hello, Dolly!'' for its warmth, color and high spirits.<ref>Taubman, Howard. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&tols_title=HELLO,%20DOLLY!%20(PLAY)&pdate=19640117&byline=By%20HOWARD%20TAUBMAN&id=1077011430206 \"Hello Dolly!\"]. ''The New York Times'', 1964</ref></blockquote>\n\nJohn Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' lauded Carol Channing's performance, declaring her \"the most outgoing woman on the musical stage today \u2013 big and warm, all eyes and smiles, in love with everybody in the theatre and possessing a unique voice ranging somewhat upward from a ''basso profundo''.\"  He also wrote, \"I wouldn't say that Jerry Herman's score is memorable.\"<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven. ''Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre'', pp. 297\u2013301. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-02-872625-1}}</ref> [[New York Post]] critic Richard Watts, Jr., wrote,\n\n<blockquote>The fact that [''Hello, Dolly!''] seems to me short on charm, warmth, and the intangible quality of distinction in no way alters my conviction that it will be an enormous popular success. Herman has composed a score that is always pleasant and agreeably tuneful, although the only number that comes to mind at the moment is the lively title song. His lyrics could be called serviceable.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\nIn the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Walter Kerr]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' is a musical comedy dream, with Carol Channing the girl of it. ... Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse's neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.</blockquote>\n\nKerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the \"lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them\".<ref name=Suskin/> John McClain of the [[New York Journal American]] particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that\n\n<blockquote>Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song \"Hello, Dolly!\"] produces. Last night the audience nearly tore up the seats as she led the parade of waiters in a series of encores over the semi-circular runway that extends around the orchestra pit out into the audience, ... a tribute to the personal appeal of Miss Channing and the magical inventiveness of Mr. Champion's staging.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Award \n! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1964\n| [[New York Drama Critics Circle|New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramacritics.org/dc_pastawards.html#1964 \"New York Drama Critics Past Awards, 1964\"] dramacritics.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2810 \" 'Hello Dolly' Listing, 1964\u20131970\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 \"Tony Awards, 1964\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105101119/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 |date=2012-01-05 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153433.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1964\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]]\n| [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]]\n| [[Carol Channing]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical]]\n| [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\n| [[Jerry Herman]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award|Best Producer of a Musical]]\n| [[David Merrick]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical|Best Direction of a Musical]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Gower Champion]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Conductor and Musical Director|Best Conductor and Musical Director]]\n| Shepard Coleman\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]]\n| [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]\n| [[Freddy Wittop]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1968\n| [[Special Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 \"Tony Awards, 1968\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407225811/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 |date=2016-04-07 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=30650 \"Pearl Bailey Listing, Awards and Nominations\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153442.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1968\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| Special Award\n| [[Pearl Bailey]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1970\n| [[Drama Desk Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramadesk.org/1969_1970dd.html \"Drama Desk, 1969\u20131970\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} dramadesk.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>Flinn, Caryl.
