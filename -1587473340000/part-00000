Methods of the formal sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of [[scientific model]]s dealing with observable reality,{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79&ndash;82}} and major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in the empirical sciences.\n\n=== Decision theory ===\n{{Main|Decision theory}}\n\n''Decision theory'' in economics, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision. It is very closely related to the field of game theory.\n\n=== Logic ===\n{{Main|Logic|Outline of logic}}\n\n''Logic'' (from the Greek ''[[wiktionary:\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae|\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae]]'' logik\u0113)<ref>\"possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative\", also related to ''[[wiktionary:\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2|\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2]]'' (logos), \"word, thought, idea, argument, account, reason, or principle\" (Liddell & Scott 1999; Online Etymology Dictionary 2001).</ref> is the formal systematic study of the [[principle]]s of valid [[inference]] and correct [[reasoning]]. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in the disciplines of [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[computer science]].  Logic examines general forms which [[argument]]s may take, which forms are valid, and which are [[fallacies]]. In philosophy, the study of logic figures in most major areas: [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]]. In mathematics and computer science, it is the study of valid [[inference]]s within some [[formal language]].<ref name=stanford-logic-onthology>{{cite book | last = Hofweber | first = T. | year = 2004 | chapter = Logic and Ontology |  title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | editor-first = Edward N | editor-last = Zalta | editor-link = Edward N.

It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] rather than empirical methods.{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10&ndash;11}}\n\n=== Statistics ===\n{{Main|Statistics|Outline of statistics}}\n\nKpop is really and truly underrated and that needs to change, love you forever Kim Taehyung. I purple you!\n\nA [[statistician]] is someone who is particularly well versed in the ways of thinking necessary for the successful application of statistical analysis. Such people have often gained this experience through working in any of a [[list of fields of application of statistics|wide number of fields]]. There is also a discipline called ''[[mathematical statistics]]'', which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.\n\nThe word ''statistics'', when referring to the scientific discipline, is singular, as in \"Statistics is an art.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistics | title = Statistics | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}</ref> This should not be confused with the word ''statistic'', referring to a quantity (such as [[mean]] or [[median]]) calculated from a set of data,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistic | title = Statistic | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}</ref> whose plural is ''statistics'' (\"this statistic seems wrong\" or \"these statistics are misleading\").\n\n=== Systems theory ===\n{{Main|Systems theory}}\n\n''Systems theory'' is the [[transdisciplinary]] study of [[system]]s in general, to elucidate principles that can be applied to all types of systems in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of [[systems thinking]] and a generalization of [[systems science]]. The term originates from [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Bertalanffy]]'s [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|General System Theory]] (GST) and is used in later efforts in other fields, such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]] and the system-theory of [[Niklas Luhmann]].\n\nIn this context the word ''systems'' is used to refer specifically to self-regulating systems, i.e. that are self-correcting through [[feedback]]. Self-regulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of our body, in local and global ecosystems, and climate.\n\n=== Theoretical computer science ===\n{{Main|Theoretical computer science}}\n\n''Theoretical computer science'' (TCS) is a division or subset of general [[computer science]] and focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing.\n\nThese divisions and subsets include [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[formal semantics of programming languages]]. Technically, there are hundreds of divisions and subsets besides these two. Each of the multiple parts has its leaders (of popularity) and there are many associations and professional social groups and publications of distinction.\n\n== Natural/Pure Science ==\n{{Main|Natural science|Outline of natural science}}\n\nNatural science is a branch of [[science]] that seeks to [[wiktionary:elucidate|elucidate]] the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world by applying an [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]] to the study of the [[universe]]. The term natural sciences is used to distinguish it from the [[social sciences]], which apply the scientific method to study [[human behavior]] and [[social]] [[patterns]]; the [[humanities]], which use a [[critical theory|critical]], or [[Analytic philosophy|analytical approach]] to the study of the [[human condition]]; and the [[formal sciences]].\n\n=== Physical science ===\n{{Main|Physical science|Outline of physical science}}\n\n''Physical science'' is an encompassing term for the branches of natural science and science that study non-living systems, in contrast to the life sciences. However, the term \"physical\" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena. There is a difference between physical science and physics.\n\n==== Physics ====\n{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics}}\n\n''Physics'' (from {{lang-grc|\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2|[[physis]]|nature}}) is a [[natural science]] that involves the study of [[matter]]{{NoteTag|[[Richard Feynman]] begins [[The Feynman Lectures on Physics|his ''Lectures'']] with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: \"If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words?

However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]]}}\n\nPhysics is one of the oldest [[academic discipline]]s, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].<ref>Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000&nbsp; BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.</ref> Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of [[natural philosophy]] along with [[chemistry]], certain branches of [[mathematics]], and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 16th century, the [[natural science]]s emerged as unique research programs in their own right.<ref>[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].</ref> Certain research areas are [[interdisciplinary]], such as [[biophysics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], which means that the boundaries of physics are not [[demarcation problem|rigidly defined]]. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [[physicalism]] emerged as a major unifying feature of the [[philosophy of science]] as physics provides fundamental explanations for every [[observation|observed]] natural [[phenomenon]]. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening to new research areas in mathematics and philosophy.\n\n==== Chemistry ====\n{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry}}\n\n''Chemistry'' (the etymology of the word has been much disputed){{NoteTag|See [[Chemistry (etymology)]] for possible origins of this word.}} is the [[science]] of [[matter]] and the changes it undergoes. The science of matter is also addressed by [[physics]], but while physics takes a more general and fundamental approach, chemistry is more specialized, being concerned by the composition, behavior (or reaction), structure, and properties of [[matter]], as well as the changes it undergoes during [[chemical reaction]]s.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry]. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.</ref> It is a [[physical science]] which studies various [[chemical substance|substance]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and matter (especially carbon based); [[biochemistry]], the study of [[chemical substance|substances]] found in [[organisms|biological organisms]]; [[physical chemistry]], the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]; and [[analytical chemistry]], the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years, e.g. [[neurochemistry]] the chemical study of the [[nervous system]]<!--INVALID INNERLINK-- (see [[#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines]])-->.\n\n==== Earth science ====\n{{Main|Earth science|Outline of earth science}}\n\n''Earth science'' (also known as ''geoscience'', ''the geosciences'' or ''the Earth sciences'') is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the [[planet]] [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].<ref>[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Earth+science&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o7=&o5=&o1=1&o6=&o4=&o3=&h=0 Wordnet Search: Earth science]</ref> It is arguably a special case in [[planetary science]], the Earth being the only known [[life]]-bearing planet. There are both [[reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. The formal discipline of Earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans, and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works, and how it evolved to its current state.\n\n===== Ecology =====\n{{Main|Ecology|Outline of ecology}}\n\nEcology (from Greek: \u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, \"house\"; -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, \"study of\") is the [[scientific]] study of the relationships that living [[organisms]] have with each other and with their abiotic [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest to ecologists include the composition, distribution, amount ([[biomass]]), number, and changing states of organisms within and among [[ecosystems]].\n\n===== Oceanography =====\n{{Main|Oceanography}}\n\nOceanography, or marine biology, is the branch of [[Earth science]] that studies the ocean. It covers a wide range of topics, including [[marine organisms]] and [[ecosystem]] dynamics; [[ocean currents]], [[water waves|waves]], and geophysical fluid dynamics; [[plate tectonics]] and the geology of the seafloor; and [[flux]]es of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it: [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], and [[physics]] as well as [[geography]].\n\n===== Geology =====\n{{Main|Geology|Outline of geology}}\n\nGeology (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03b3\u1fc6, g\u00ea, \"earth\" and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, [[logos]], \"study\") is the science comprising the study of solid [[Earth]], the [[rocks]] of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change.\n\n===== Meteorology =====\n{{Main|Meteorology|Outline of meteorology}}\n\nMeteorology is the [[interdisciplinary]] scientific study of the [[atmosphere]]. Studies in the field stretch back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 17th century. The 19th century saw breakthroughs occur after observing networks developed across several countries. After the development of the computer in the latter half of the 20th century, breakthroughs in [[weather forecasting]] were achieved.\n\n==== Space Science or Astronomy ====\n{{Main|Space Science|Outline of space science}}\n\nSpace science or Astronomy is the study of everything in outer space.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/space+science space science \u2013 definition of space science by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This has sometimes been called [[astronomy]], but recently astronomy has come to be regarded as a division of broader space science, which has grown to include other related fields,<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/planetary-science-data/national-space-science-data-center-nssdc/ National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) \u2013 NASA Science<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> such as studying issues related to [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and [[space exploration]] (including [[space medicine]]), [[space archaeology]]<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/space+science Space science | Define Space science at Dictionary.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and science performed in [[outer space]] (see [[space research]]).\n\n=== Science of living things ===\n{{Main|Life science|Outline of life sciences}}\n\nThe science of living things comprises the branches of science<ref>[http://www.sciencemirror.com/branches-of-science-the-complete-list Branches of Science]</ref> that involve the scientific study of living organisms, like plants, animals, and human beings. However, the study of behavior of organisms, such as practiced in ethology and psychology, is only included in as much as it involves a biological aspect. While biology remains the centerpiece of the science of living things, technological advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have led to a burgeoning of specializations and new, often interdisciplinary, fields.\n\n==== Biology ====\n{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology}}\n\n''Biology'' is the branch of [[natural science]] concerned with the study of [[life]] and living [[organism]]s, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy.<ref>Based on definition from [http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608000000/http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |date=June 8, 2004 }}</ref> Biology is a vast subject containing many subdivisions, topics, and disciplines.\n\n===== Zoology =====\n{{Main|Zoology|Outline of zoology}}\n\nZoology, occasionally spelled zo\u00f6logy, is the branch of science that relates to the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct. The term is derived from Ancient Greek \u03b6\u1ff7\u03bf\u03bd (z\u014don, \"animal\") + \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (logos, \"knowledge\"). Some branches of zoology include: [[anthrozoology]], [[arachnology]], [[archaeozoology]], [[cetology]], [[embryology]], [[entomology]], [[helminthology]], [[herpetology]], [[histology]], [[ichthyology]], [[malacology]], [[mammalogy]], [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[nematology]], [[ornithology]], [[palaeozoology]], [[pathology]], [[primatology]], [[protozoology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and [[zoogeography]].\n\n=====Human biology=====\n{{main|Human biology}}\nHuman biology is an interdisciplinary academic field of biology, biological anthropology, nutrition and medicine which focuses on humans; it is closely related to primate biology, and a number of other fields.\n<!-- (A suspicious paragraph added by 99.108.127.17 on 22:00, 25 October 2011, as of revision 457389486)\nSome branches of biology include: [[microbiology]], [[anatomy]], [[neurology]] and [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[biophysics]], [[biolinguistics]], and [[ophthalmology]].\n-->\n\n===== Botany =====\n{{Main|Botany|Outline of botany}}\n\nBotany, plant science, or plant biology is a branch of biology that involves the scientific study of plant life. Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines including structure, growth, reproduction, metabolism, development, diseases, chemical properties, and evolutionary relationships among taxonomic groups. Botany began with early human efforts to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest sciences. Today botanists study over 550,000 species of living organisms.\nThe term \"botany\" comes from Greek \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7, meaning \"pasture, grass, fodder\", perhaps via the idea of a livestock keeper needing to know which plants are safe for livestock to eat.\n\n===== Mycology =====\n{{Main|Mycology}}\n\nMycology, the study of fungi, is a branch of biology that focuses on fungi.\n\n== Social sciences ==\n{{Main|Social sciences|Outline of social science}}\n\nThe ''social sciences'' are the [[field of study|fields]] of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]] that study society. \"Social science\" is commonly used as an [[umbrella term]] for empirical fields outside of the [[natural sciences]]. These include: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[international relations]], [[political science]] (aka [[government]]), [[public health]], [[sociology]], some branches of [[psychology]] (results of which can not be replicated or validated easily - e.g. [[social psychology]]), and certain aspects of [[business administration]], [[communication]], [[education]], [[geography]], [[history]], and [[law]].<ref name=\"issues\">{{cite book |last=Verheggen |year=1999 |chapter=From shared representations to consensually coordinated actions |title=Theoretical Issues in Psychology |editor-first=John |editor-last=Morrs |publisher=International Society for Theoretical Psychology |location= |isbn= |display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Vygotskyboom.htm |first=L. |last=Garai |first2=M. |last2=Kocski |title=Another crisis in the psychology: A possible motive for the Vygotsky-boom |journal=Journal of Russian and East European Psychology |year=1995 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=82\u201394 |doi=10.2753/RPO1061-0405330182 |pmid= }}</ref>\n\n== Applied sciences ==\n{{Main|Applied science|Outline of applied sciences}}\n\n''Applied science'' is the application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. Examples include testing a theoretical model through the use of formal science or solving a practical problem through the use of natural science.\n\nApplied science differs from [[fundamental science]], which seeks to describe the most basic objects and forces, having less emphasis on practical applications. Applied science can be like biological science and physical science.\n\nExample fields of applied science include\n* [[Engineering]]\n* [[Applied mathematics]]\n* [[Applied physics]]\n* [[Medicine]]\n* [[Computer science]]\n\nFields of [[engineering]] are closely related to applied sciences. Applied science is important for [[technology]] development. Its use in industrial settings is usually referred to as [[research and development]] (R&D).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Index of branches of science]]\n* [[Outline of science]]\n** [[Exact science]]\n** [[Fundamental science]]\n** [[Hard and soft science]]\n* [[Branches of philosophy]]\n** [[Philosophy of science]]\n*[[Engineering science]]\n*[[Moral science]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n| last=Popper |first=Karl R. | year=2002 | title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery | orig-year=1959 | edition= | publisher=Routledge Classics | location=New York, NY |isbn = 0-415-27844-9 |oclc = 59377149 | ref=harv |title-link=The Logic of Scientific Discovery }}\n* {{cite web |url = http://atlas-disciplines.unige.ch/ |last=Sandoz |first=Rapha\u00ebl |title=Interactive Historical Atlas of the Disciplines |website=University of Geneva |access-date=20 May 2019 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Branches of science| ]]\n[[Category:Scientific disciplines|*]]\n[[Category:Science|*Branches]]\n", "text_old": "{{further|Outline of science#Branches of science}}\n{{broader|Academic discipline}}\n{{Science|all}}\n\n[[File: The Scientific Universe.png|thumb|450px|The scale of the Universe mapped to branches of science and showing how one system is built atop the next through the [[hierarchy of the sciences]].]]\n\nThe '''branches of science''', also referred to as [[science]]s, \"scientific fields\", or \"scientific disciplines,\" are commonly divided into three major groups:\n\n*'''[[Formal science]]s''': the study of [[logic]], [[mathematics]], which use an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', as opposed to [[empirical]], [[methodology]].\n*'''[[Natural science]]s''': the study of natural phenomena (including cosmological, geological, physical, chemical, and biological factors of the universe).

It is very closely related to the field of game theory.\n\n=== Logic ===\n{{Main|Logic|Outline of logic}}\n\n''Logic'' (from the Greek ''[[wiktionary:\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae|\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae]]'' logik\u0113)<ref>\"possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative\", also related to ''[[wiktionary:\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2|\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2]]'' (logos), \"word, thought, idea, argument, account, reason, or principle\" (Liddell & Scott 1999; Online Etymology Dictionary 2001).</ref> is the formal systematic study of the [[principle]]s of valid [[inference]] and correct [[reasoning]]. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in the disciplines of [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[computer science]].  Logic examines general forms which [[argument]]s may take, which forms are valid, and which are [[fallacies]]. In philosophy, the study of logic figures in most major areas: [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]]. In mathematics and computer science, it is the study of valid [[inference]]s within some [[formal language]].<ref name=stanford-logic-onthology>{{cite book | last = Hofweber | first = T. | year = 2004 | chapter = Logic and Ontology |  title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | editor-first = Edward N | editor-last = Zalta | editor-link = Edward N.

It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] rather than empirical methods.{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10&ndash;11}}\n\n=== Statistics ===\n{{Main|Statistics|Outline of statistics}}\n\n''Statistics'' is the study of the collection, organization, and interpretation of [[data]].<ref name=Dodge>Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=statistics The Free Online Dictionary]</ref> It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[Statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].<ref name=Dodge/>\n\nA [[statistician]] is someone who is particularly well versed in the ways of thinking necessary for the successful application of statistical analysis. Such people have often gained this experience through working in any of a [[list of fields of application of statistics|wide number of fields]]. There is also a discipline called ''[[mathematical statistics]]'', which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.\n\nThe word ''statistics'', when referring to the scientific discipline, is singular, as in \"Statistics is an art.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistics | title = Statistics | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}</ref> This should not be confused with the word ''statistic'', referring to a quantity (such as [[mean]] or [[median]]) calculated from a set of data,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistic | title = Statistic | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}</ref> whose plural is ''statistics'' (\"this statistic seems wrong\" or \"these statistics are misleading\").\n\n=== Systems theory ===\n{{Main|Systems theory}}\n\n''Systems theory'' is the [[transdisciplinary]] study of [[system]]s in general, to elucidate principles that can be applied to all types of systems in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of [[systems thinking]] and a generalization of [[systems science]]. The term originates from [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Bertalanffy]]'s [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|General System Theory]] (GST) and is used in later efforts in other fields, such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]] and the system-theory of [[Niklas Luhmann]].\n\nIn this context the word ''systems'' is used to refer specifically to self-regulating systems, i.e. that are self-correcting through [[feedback]]. Self-regulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of our body, in local and global ecosystems, and climate.\n\n=== Theoretical computer science ===\n{{Main|Theoretical computer science}}\n\n''Theoretical computer science'' (TCS) is a division or subset of general [[computer science]] and focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing.\n\nThese divisions and subsets include [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[formal semantics of programming languages]]. Technically, there are hundreds of divisions and subsets besides these two. Each of the multiple parts has its leaders (of popularity) and there are many associations and professional social groups and publications of distinction.\n\n== Natural/Pure Science ==\n{{Main|Natural science|Outline of natural science}}\n\nNatural science is a branch of [[science]] that seeks to [[wiktionary:elucidate|elucidate]] the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world by applying an [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]] to the study of the [[universe]]. The term natural sciences is used to distinguish it from the [[social sciences]], which apply the scientific method to study [[human behavior]] and [[social]] [[patterns]]; the [[humanities]], which use a [[critical theory|critical]], or [[Analytic philosophy|analytical approach]] to the study of the [[human condition]]; and the [[formal sciences]].\n\n=== Physical science ===\n{{Main|Physical science|Outline of physical science}}\n\n''Physical science'' is an encompassing term for the branches of natural science and science that study non-living systems, in contrast to the life sciences. However, the term \"physical\" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena. There is a difference between physical science and physics.\n\n==== Physics ====\n{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics}}\n\n''Physics'' (from {{lang-grc|\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2|[[physis]]|nature}}) is a [[natural science]] that involves the study of [[matter]]{{NoteTag|[[Richard Feynman]] begins [[The Feynman Lectures on Physics|his ''Lectures'']] with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: \"If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words?

However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]]}}\n\nPhysics is one of the oldest [[academic discipline]]s, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].<ref>Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000&nbsp; BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.</ref> Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of [[natural philosophy]] along with [[chemistry]], certain branches of [[mathematics]], and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 16th century, the [[natural science]]s emerged as unique research programs in their own right.<ref>[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].</ref> Certain research areas are [[interdisciplinary]], such as [[biophysics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], which means that the boundaries of physics are not [[demarcation problem|rigidly defined]]. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [[physicalism]] emerged as a major unifying feature of the [[philosophy of science]] as physics provides fundamental explanations for every [[observation|observed]] natural [[phenomenon]]. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening to new research areas in mathematics and philosophy.\n\n==== Chemistry ====\n{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry}}\n\n''Chemistry'' (the etymology of the word has been much disputed){{NoteTag|See [[Chemistry (etymology)]] for possible origins of this word.}} is the [[science]] of [[matter]] and the changes it undergoes. The science of matter is also addressed by [[physics]], but while physics takes a more general and fundamental approach, chemistry is more specialized, being concerned by the composition, behavior (or reaction), structure, and properties of [[matter]], as well as the changes it undergoes during [[chemical reaction]]s.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry]. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.</ref> It is a [[physical science]] which studies various [[chemical substance|substance]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and matter (especially carbon based); [[biochemistry]], the study of [[chemical substance|substances]] found in [[organisms|biological organisms]]; [[physical chemistry]], the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]; and [[analytical chemistry]], the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years, e.g. [[neurochemistry]] the chemical study of the [[nervous system]]<!--INVALID INNERLINK-- (see [[#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines]])-->.\n\n==== Earth science ====\n{{Main|Earth science|Outline of earth science}}\n\n''Earth science'' (also known as ''geoscience'', ''the geosciences'' or ''the Earth sciences'') is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the [[planet]] [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].<ref>[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Earth+science&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o7=&o5=&o1=1&o6=&o4=&o3=&h=0 Wordnet Search: Earth science]</ref> It is arguably a special case in [[planetary science]], the Earth being the only known [[life]]-bearing planet. There are both [[reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. The formal discipline of Earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans, and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works, and how it evolved to its current state.\n\n===== Ecology =====\n{{Main|Ecology|Outline of ecology}}\n\nEcology (from Greek: \u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, \"house\"; -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, \"study of\") is the [[scientific]] study of the relationships that living [[organisms]] have with each other and with their abiotic [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest to ecologists include the composition, distribution, amount ([[biomass]]), number, and changing states of organisms within and among [[ecosystems]].\n\n===== Oceanography =====\n{{Main|Oceanography}}\n\nOceanography, or marine biology, is the branch of [[Earth science]] that studies the ocean. It covers a wide range of topics, including [[marine organisms]] and [[ecosystem]] dynamics; [[ocean currents]], [[water waves|waves]], and geophysical fluid dynamics; [[plate tectonics]] and the geology of the seafloor; and [[flux]]es of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it: [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], and [[physics]] as well as [[geography]].\n\n===== Geology =====\n{{Main|Geology|Outline of geology}}\n\nGeology (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03b3\u1fc6, g\u00ea, \"earth\" and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, [[logos]], \"study\") is the science comprising the study of solid [[Earth]], the [[rocks]] of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change.\n\n===== Meteorology =====\n{{Main|Meteorology|Outline of meteorology}}\n\nMeteorology is the [[interdisciplinary]] scientific study of the [[atmosphere]]. Studies in the field stretch back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 17th century. The 19th century saw breakthroughs occur after observing networks developed across several countries. After the development of the computer in the latter half of the 20th century, breakthroughs in [[weather forecasting]] were achieved.\n\n==== Space Science or Astronomy ====\n{{Main|Space Science|Outline of space science}}\n\nSpace science or Astronomy is the study of everything in outer space.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/space+science space science \u2013 definition of space science by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This has sometimes been called [[astronomy]], but recently astronomy has come to be regarded as a division of broader space science, which has grown to include other related fields,<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/planetary-science-data/national-space-science-data-center-nssdc/ National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) \u2013 NASA Science<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> such as studying issues related to [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and [[space exploration]] (including [[space medicine]]), [[space archaeology]]<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/space+science Space science | Define Space science at Dictionary.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and science performed in [[outer space]] (see [[space research]]).\n\n=== Science of living things ===\n{{Main|Life science|Outline of life sciences}}\n\nThe science of living things comprises the branches of science<ref>[http://www.sciencemirror.com/branches-of-science-the-complete-list Branches of Science]</ref> that involve the scientific study of living organisms, like plants, animals, and human beings. However, the study of behavior of organisms, such as practiced in ethology and psychology, is only included in as much as it involves a biological aspect. While biology remains the centerpiece of the science of living things, technological advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have led to a burgeoning of specializations and new, often interdisciplinary, fields.\n\n==== Biology ====\n{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology}}\n\n''Biology'' is the branch of [[natural science]] concerned with the study of [[life]] and living [[organism]]s, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy.<ref>Based on definition from [http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608000000/http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |date=June 8, 2004 }}</ref> Biology is a vast subject containing many subdivisions, topics, and disciplines.\n\n===== Zoology =====\n{{Main|Zoology|Outline of zoology}}\n\nZoology, occasionally spelled zo\u00f6logy, is the branch of science that relates to the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct. The term is derived from Ancient Greek \u03b6\u1ff7\u03bf\u03bd (z\u014don, \"animal\") + \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (logos, \"knowledge\"). Some branches of zoology include: [[anthrozoology]], [[arachnology]], [[archaeozoology]], [[cetology]], [[embryology]], [[entomology]], [[helminthology]], [[herpetology]], [[histology]], [[ichthyology]], [[malacology]], [[mammalogy]], [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[nematology]], [[ornithology]], [[palaeozoology]], [[pathology]], [[primatology]], [[protozoology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and [[zoogeography]].\n\n=====Human biology=====\n{{main|Human biology}}\nHuman biology is an interdisciplinary academic field of biology, biological anthropology, nutrition and medicine which focuses on humans; it is closely related to primate biology, and a number of other fields.\n<!-- (A suspicious paragraph added by 99.108.127.17 on 22:00, 25 October 2011, as of revision 457389486)\nSome branches of biology include: [[microbiology]], [[anatomy]], [[neurology]] and [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[biophysics]], [[biolinguistics]], and [[ophthalmology]].\n-->\n\n===== Botany =====\n{{Main|Botany|Outline of botany}}\n\nBotany, plant science, or plant biology is a branch of biology that involves the scientific study of plant life. Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines including structure, growth, reproduction, metabolism, development, diseases, chemical properties, and evolutionary relationships among taxonomic groups. Botany began with early human efforts to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest sciences. Today botanists study over 550,000 species of living organisms.\nThe term \"botany\" comes from Greek \u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7, meaning \"pasture, grass, fodder\", perhaps via the idea of a livestock keeper needing to know which plants are safe for livestock to eat.\n\n===== Mycology =====\n{{Main|Mycology}}\n\nMycology, the study of fungi, is a branch of biology that focuses on fungi.\n\n== Social sciences ==\n{{Main|Social sciences|Outline of social science}}\n\nThe ''social sciences'' are the [[field of study|fields]] of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]] that study society. \"Social science\" is commonly used as an [[umbrella term]] for empirical fields outside of the [[natural sciences]]. These include: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[international relations]], [[political science]] (aka [[government]]), [[public health]], [[sociology]], some branches of [[psychology]] (results of which can not be replicated or validated easily - e.g. [[social psychology]]), and certain aspects of [[business administration]], [[communication]], [[education]], [[geography]], [[history]], and [[law]].<ref name=\"issues\">{{cite book |last=Verheggen |year=1999 |chapter=From shared representations to consensually coordinated actions |title=Theoretical Issues in Psychology |editor-first=John |editor-last=Morrs |publisher=International Society for Theoretical Psychology |location= |isbn= |display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Vygotskyboom.htm |first=L. |last=Garai |first2=M. |last2=Kocski |title=Another crisis in the psychology: A possible motive for the Vygotsky-boom |journal=Journal of Russian and East European Psychology |year=1995 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=82\u201394 |doi=10.2753/RPO1061-0405330182 |pmid= }}</ref>\n\n== Applied sciences ==\n{{Main|Applied science|Outline of applied sciences}}\n\n''Applied science'' is the application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. Examples include testing a theoretical model through the use of formal science or solving a practical problem through the use of natural science.\n\nApplied science differs from [[fundamental science]], which seeks to describe the most basic objects and forces, having less emphasis on practical applications. Applied science can be like biological science and physical science.\n\nExample fields of applied science include\n* [[Engineering]]\n* [[Applied mathematics]]\n* [[Applied physics]]\n* [[Medicine]]\n* [[Computer science]]\n\nFields of [[engineering]] are closely related to applied sciences. Applied science is important for [[technology]] development.

He stated:<blockquote>\u2026the employment of state machinery to curb dissent instils fear and creates a chilling atmosphere on free speech which violates the rule of law and detracts from the constitutional vision of a pluralist society\u2026The true test of a democracy is its ability to ensure the creation and protection of spaces where every individual can voice their opinion without the fear of retribution\u2026A state committed to the rule of law ensures that the state apparatus is not employed to curb legitimate and peaceful protest but to create spaces conducive for deliberation. Within the bounds of law, liberal democracies ensure that their citizens enjoy the right to express their views in every conceivable manner, including the right to protest and express dissent against prevailing laws. The blanket labelling of such dissent as \u2018anti-national\u2019 or \u2018anti-democratic\u2019 strikes at the heart of our commitment to the protection of constitutional values and the promotion of a deliberative democracy.</blockquote>In an impassioned appeal to pluralism and the celebration of diversity, he stated:<blockquote>The framers of the Constitution rejected the notion of a Hindu India and a Muslim India. They recognised only the Republic of India\u2026A united India is not one characterized by a single identity devoid of its rich plurality, both of cultures and of values. National unity denotes a shared culture of values and a commitment to the fundamental ideals of the Constitution in which all individuals are guaranteed not just the fundamental rights but also conditions for their free and safe exercise. Pluralism depicts not merely a commitment to the preservation of diversity, but a commitment to the fundamental postulates of individual and equal dignity. In this sense, pluralism furthers the basic postulates of the Constitution and nourishes and provides content to the goal of national unity...No single individual or institution can claim a monopoly over the idea of India\u2026what is of utmost relevance today is our ability and commitment to preserve, conserve and build on the rich pluralistic history we have inherited.</blockquote>The speech was reported <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indialegallive.com/top-news-of-the-day/news/dissent-not-anti-national-says-justice-dy-chandrachud-89239|title=Dissent Not Anti-National excerpts/ Justice PD Desai Memorial Lecture 2020|last=Legal|first=India|date=2020-02-22|website=India Legal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/blanket-labelling-of-dissent-as-antinational-hurts-ethos-of/1735088|title=Blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national hurts ethos of|website=https://www.outlookindia.com/|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/dissent-a-safety-valve-justice-chandrachud/articleshow/74156371.cms|title=Dissent a safety valve: Justice Chandrachud|last=Feb 16|first=PTI {{!}} Updated:|last2=2020|website=Pune Mirror|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20|last3=Ist|first3=08:07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/hindu-india-and-a-muslim-indiajustice-chandrachud-152796|title='The Framers of Constitution Rejected The Notion of a Hindu India And a Muslim India':Justice Chandrachud [Read Full Text Of Speech]|last=NETWORK|first=LIVELAW NEWS|date=2020-02-16|website=www.livelaw.in|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> as a plea to protect the right to dissent in a free and democratic society.\n\n==Notable judgments==\n\nAs a judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Chandrachud has been on the highest number of Constitution Benches (five judges or more) constituted to hear matters before the Indian Supreme Court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barandbench.com/columns/constituting-constitution-benches-of-the-supreme-court-an-analysis|title=Constituting Constitution Benches of the Supreme Court: An analysis|last=Bench|first=Bar &|website=Bar and Bench - Indian Legal news|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> During his tenure at the Supreme Court, he has delivered a large number of landmark judgements on Indian constitutional law, comparative constitutional law, human rights law, gender justice, public interest litigation, commercial law and criminal law.\n\n=== Privacy ===\nForemost among his notable judgments is his authorship of the lead opinion in [[Justice K.

Writing for himself and three other judges, he stated:<blockquote>Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and self-determination.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>One expert on constitutional law hailed the decision<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2017/08/27/the-supreme-courts-right-to-privacy-judgment-i-foundations/|title=The Supreme Court\u2019s Right to Privacy Judgment \u2013 I: Foundations|last=Bhatia|first=Gautam|date=2017-08-27|website=Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> as \u201ca historic and landmark verdict of our times\u201d which \u201cwill have a profound impact upon our legal and constitutional landscape for years to come.\u201d He stated that the:<blockquote>\u2026judgment deserves to be a landmark, not only in the annals of Indian constitutional jurisprudence, but across the world.

Naz Foundation]] upheld [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] which criminalized carnal intercourse against the order of nature. Justice Chandrachud referred to the decision as striking \u201ca discordant note which directly bears upon the evolution of the constitutional jurisprudence on the right to privacy.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> He observed that the decision was wrong as \u201cthe purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of majorities, whether ''legislative or popular''.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> He concluded by disagreeing \u201cwith the manner in which Koushal has dealt with the privacy \u2013 dignity-based claims of LGBT persons\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> and held that:<blockquote>The test of popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to disregard rights which are conferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection.\u00a0 Discrete and insular minorities face grave dangers of discrimination for the simple reason that their views, beliefs or way of life does not accord with the \u2018mainstream\u2019.

In its capacity as a public authority enforcing the rule of law, the state must ensure that conditions in which these freedoms flourish are maintained.

The Court observed the numerous deficiencies in the process leading to the grant of the clearance and directed that a rapid EIA be conducted afresh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2019/03/30/environmental-clearance-for-development-of-airport-at-mopa-goa-to-be-revisited/|title=Environmental Clearance for development of Airport at Mopa, Goa to be revisited|last=Bhardwaj|first=Prachi|date=2019-03-29|website=SCC Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/sc-suspends-environmental-clearance-to-mopa-airport-asks-eac-to-revisit-decision|title=Supreme Court Suspends Environmental Clearance Granted To Goa\u2019s Mopa Airport|website=BloombergQuint|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> by the project proponent. The Court highlighted that compliance with the core governing notification is mandatory in the following terms:<blockquote>The 2006 notification represents an independent code with the avowed objective of balancing the development agenda with the protection of the environment. An applicant cannot claim an EC, under the 2006 notification, based on substantial or proportionate compliance with the terms stipulated in the notification. The terms of the notification lay down strict standards that must be complied with by an applicant seeking an EC for a proposed project.

A framework of environmental governance committed to the rule of law requires a regime which has effective, accountable and transparent institutions. Equally important is responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making. Environmental governance is founded on the rule of law and emerges from the values of our Constitution. Where the health of the environment is key to preserving the right to life as a constitutionally recognized value under Article 21 of the Constitution, proper structures for environmental decision making find expression in the guarantee against arbitrary action and the affirmative duty of fair treatment under Article 14 of the Constitution.<ref name=\":8\" /></blockquote>Justice Chandrachud has also authored a judgment on the validity of grating ''ex post facto'' Environmental Clearances in Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd v Rohit Prajapati.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/2562/2562_2016_0_1501_21582_Judgement_01-Apr-2020.pdf|title=Alembic Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The erstwhile Ministry of Environmental and Forests had issued an administrative circular in 2002 envisaging the grant of ''ex post facto'' clearances to those industries that had failed to comply with the mandatory EIA notification of 1994. The ex post facto clearances granted to a group of drug and pharmaceutical companies located in Gujarat were challenged. Justice Chandrachud set aside the administrative circular of 2002 and noted that the concept of ''ex post facto'' ECs derogates from the fundamental principles of the environmental rule of law. He noted that the grant of ''ex post facto'' ECs was contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the principal of sustainable development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-penalises-three-pharma-cos-asks-to-pay-fine-of-rs-10-cr-each-820450.html|title=SC penalises three pharma cos, asks to pay fine of Rs 10 Cr each|date=2020-04-02|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud noted that all the industries in question had made significant infrastructural investments.

Allowing for an ex post facto clearance would essentially condone the operation of industrial activities without the grant of an EC. In the absence of an EC, there would be no conditions that would safeguard the environment. Moreover, if the EC was to be ultimately refused, irreparable harm would have been caused to the environment. In either view of the matter, environment law cannot countenance the notion of an ex post facto clearance. This would be contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the need for sustainable development.<ref name=\":9\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Others ==\nJustice Chandrachud has also been the voice of a strong dissent in notable cases.

In his judgment regarding the construction of a new airport in Goa and resulting environmental law violations, the Environmental Clearance (EC) granted for the construction of the new airport at Mopa in Goa has been suspended until the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) revisits the recommendations made for the grant of an EC.

The judgment was celebrated for undertaking a critical, nuanced analysis that favoured an inclusive definition of 'efficiency' and consequently 'merit', - one that is consistent with the principle of substantive equality, as opposed to formal equality.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070806180624/http://www.vmslaw.edu/sympo.htm Millennium laws For India Inc.---A symposium]\n* [http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/adr_conf/chandrachud3.pdf M E D I A T I O N \u2013 realizing the potential and designing. implementation strategies.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170649/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2002/judges_papers/chandrachud_final.pdf First South Asian Regional Judicial Colloquium on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820184647/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2003/background_papers.htm CHRI: Judicial Colloquia Series on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702192624/http://www.interights.org/page.php?dir=News Justiciability of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Pacific\u2014A judicial colloquium and workshop]\n* [http://www.allahabadhighcourt.in/service/judgeDetail.jsp?id=203|High Court of Judicature at Allahabad]\n\n{{Sitting Judges of the Supreme Court of India}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chandrachud, Dhananjaya Y.}}\n[[Category:20th-century Indian judges]]\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Faculty of Law, University of Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:Indian solicitors]]\n[[Category:Judges of the Mumbai High Court]]\n[[Category:St. Columba's School, Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Chief Justices of the Allahabad High Court]]\n[[Category:Justices of the Supreme Court of India]]\n[[Category:21st-century Indian judges]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Indian judge}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=August 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| honorific-prefix =Hon'ble Dr. Justice\n| name = Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud\n| honorific-suffix = \n| image = File:Justice D.Y.

He stated:<blockquote>\u2026the employment of state machinery to curb dissent instils fear and creates a chilling atmosphere on free speech which violates the rule of law and detracts from the constitutional vision of a pluralist society\u2026The true test of a democracy is its ability to ensure the creation and protection of spaces where every individual can voice their opinion without the fear of retribution\u2026A state committed to the rule of law ensures that the state apparatus is not employed to curb legitimate and peaceful protest but to create spaces conducive for deliberation. Within the bounds of law, liberal democracies ensure that their citizens enjoy the right to express their views in every conceivable manner, including the right to protest and express dissent against prevailing laws. The blanket labelling of such dissent as \u2018anti-national\u2019 or \u2018anti-democratic\u2019 strikes at the heart of our commitment to the protection of constitutional values and the promotion of a deliberative democracy.</blockquote>In an impassioned appeal to pluralism and the celebration of diversity, he stated:<blockquote>The framers of the Constitution rejected the notion of a Hindu India and a Muslim India. They recognised only the Republic of India\u2026A united India is not one characterized by a single identity devoid of its rich plurality, both of cultures and of values. National unity denotes a shared culture of values and a commitment to the fundamental ideals of the Constitution in which all individuals are guaranteed not just the fundamental rights but also conditions for their free and safe exercise. Pluralism depicts not merely a commitment to the preservation of diversity, but a commitment to the fundamental postulates of individual and equal dignity. In this sense, pluralism furthers the basic postulates of the Constitution and nourishes and provides content to the goal of national unity...No single individual or institution can claim a monopoly over the idea of India\u2026what is of utmost relevance today is our ability and commitment to preserve, conserve and build on the rich pluralistic history we have inherited.</blockquote>The speech was delivered in the backdrop<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scroll.in/latest/953264/labelling-dissent-as-anti-national-strikes-at-the-heart-of-democracy-says-justice-chandrachud|title=Labelling dissent as \u2018anti-national\u2019 strikes at the heart of democracy, says Justice Chandrachud|last=Staff|first=Scroll|website=Scroll.in|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> of the nationwide protests against the [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]].

S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors.]] as part of a unanimous nine-judge Bench decision of the Indian Supreme Court which affirmed that the right to privacy is a constitutionally guaranteed right under the Indian Constitution.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2012/35071/35071_2012_Judgement_24-Aug-2017.pdf|title=Privacy judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud grounded the right to privacy in dignity, liberty, autonomy, bodily and mental integrity, self-determination and across a spectrum of protected rights. Writing for himself and three other judges, he stated:<blockquote>Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and self-determination.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>One expert on constitutional law hailed the decision<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2017/08/27/the-supreme-courts-right-to-privacy-judgment-i-foundations/|title=The Supreme Court\u2019s Right to Privacy Judgment \u2013 I: Foundations|last=Bhatia|first=Gautam|date=2017-08-27|website=Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> as \u201ca historic and landmark verdict of our times\u201d which \u201cwill have a profound impact upon our legal and constitutional landscape for years to come.\u201d He stated that the:<blockquote>\u2026judgment deserves to be a landmark, not only in the annals of Indian constitutional jurisprudence, but across the world. The verdict locates privacy in the grand sweep of democracy and within the core human values of autonomy, dignity, and freedom, while also placing it within the realm of the concrete, the flesh-and-blood relationship between the individual and the State.<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>The judgment is also noteworthy for Justice Chandrachud\u2019s observations on sexual autonomy and privacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/law/justice-chandrachud-judgment-right-to-privacy|title=Key Highlights of Justice Chandrachud's Judgment in the Right to Privacy Case|website=The Wire|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> In 2013, a two judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India in [[Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation]] upheld [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] which criminalized carnal intercourse against the order of nature. Justice Chandrachud referred to the decision as striking \u201ca discordant note which directly bears upon the evolution of the constitutional jurisprudence on the right to privacy.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> He observed that the decision was wrong as \u201cthe purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of majorities, whether ''legislative or popular''.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> He concluded by disagreeing \u201cwith the manner in which Koushal has dealt with the privacy \u2013 dignity-based claims of LGBT persons\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> and held that:<blockquote>The test of popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to disregard rights which are conferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection.\u00a0 Discrete and insular minorities face grave dangers of discrimination for the simple reason that their views, beliefs or way of life does not accord with the \u2018mainstream\u2019. Yet in a democratic constitution founded on the rule of law, their rights are as sacred as those conferred on other citizens to protect their freedoms and liberties. Sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy.

In its capacity as a public authority enforcing the rule of law, the state must ensure that conditions in which these freedoms flourish are maintained. In the space reserved for the free exercise of speech and expression, the state cannot look askance when organized interests threaten the existence of freedom.

The Court observed the numerous deficiencies in the process leading to the grant of the clearance and directed that a rapid EIA be conducted afresh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2019/03/30/environmental-clearance-for-development-of-airport-at-mopa-goa-to-be-revisited/|title=Environmental Clearance for development of Airport at Mopa, Goa to be revisited|last=Bhardwaj|first=Prachi|date=2019-03-29|website=SCC Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/sc-suspends-environmental-clearance-to-mopa-airport-asks-eac-to-revisit-decision|title=Supreme Court Suspends Environmental Clearance Granted To Goa\u2019s Mopa Airport|website=BloombergQuint|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> by the project proponent. The Court highlighted that compliance with the core governing notification is mandatory in the following terms:<blockquote>The 2006 notification represents an independent code with the avowed objective of balancing the development agenda with the protection of the environment. An applicant cannot claim an EC, under the 2006 notification, based on substantial or proportionate compliance with the terms stipulated in the notification. The terms of the notification lay down strict standards that must be complied with by an applicant seeking an EC for a proposed project. The burden of establishing environmental compliance rests on a project proponent who intends to bring about a change in the existing state of the environment\u2026 There can be no gambles with the environment: a \u2018heads I win, tails you lose\u2019 approach is simply unacceptable; unacceptable if we are to preserve environmental governance under the rule of law.<ref name=\":7\" /></blockquote>The judgment is celebrated for advancing the \u2018environmental rule of law\u2019 and for providing hope for the protection of the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/news/india/goa-turbulence-throws-light-on-mega-projects-1556208292034.html|title=Goa turbulence throws light on mega projects|date=2019-04-25|website=Livemint|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> The judgment was also lauded by the United Nations Environment Program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iamrenew.com/environment/un-lauds-sc-decision-to-suspend-construction-of-controversial-goa-airport/|title=UN Lauds SC Decision To Suspend Construction of Goa Airport|date=2019-04-02|website=Renewable Energy and Environmental Sustainability in India|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> In a separate section titled the \u2018Environmental Rule of Law\u2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://epaper.timesgroup.com/Olive/ODN/TimesOfIndia/shared/ShowArticle.aspx?doc=TOIM/2019/03/31&entity=Ar00907&sk=8A6A3A2D&mode=text#|title=SC quotes \u2018environmental rule of law\u2019, stalls Goa\u2019s Mopa airport - The Times Of India - Mumbai, 3/31/2019|website=epaper.timesgroup.com|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> the Court drew from vast literature<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/news/india/goa-turbulence-throws-light-on-mega-projects-1556208292034.html|title=Goa turbulence throws light on mega projects|date=2019-04-25|website=Livemint|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> on environmental law which included the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the work of Amartya Sen and Dhvani Mehta to draw a link between the protection of the environment and the right to life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.\n\nIn Bangalore Development Authority v Mr Sudhakar Hegde,<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2019/8100/8100_2019_3_1503_21539_Judgement_17-Mar-2020.pdf|title=BDA judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> he authored a judgment directing the appellant to conduct a rapid EIA as a result of the numerous deficiencies in the process leading upto the grant of Environmental Clearance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/state/get-fresh-environmental-impact-study-for-prr-supreme-court-to-karnataka-govt-814825.html|title=Get fresh environmental impact study for PRR: Supreme Court to Karnataka govt|date=2020-03-18|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> The Court noted the \u201cpatent contradiction\u201d in disclosing the existence of forest land to be diverted for the project connecting Tumkur Road to Hosur Road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2020/mar/18/apex-court-raps-bda-over-prr-seeks-new-eco-study-2118183.html|title=Apex court raps BDA over PRR, seeks new eco-study|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/city/top-bengaluru-stories/take-fresh-environmental-clearance-for-8-lane-project-in-bengaluru-sc-to-bda-814629.html|title=Take fresh environmental clearance for 8-lane project in Bengaluru: SC to BDA|date=2020-03-17|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> In a section titled \u2018Courts and the Environment\u2019, he highlighted the importance of a broad-based approach to the protection of the environment in the following terms:<blockquote>The protection of the environment is premised not only on the active role of courts, but also on robust institutional frameworks within which every stakeholder complies with its duty to ensure sustainable development. A framework of environmental governance committed to the rule of law requires a regime which has effective, accountable and transparent institutions. Equally important is responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making. Environmental governance is founded on the rule of law and emerges from the values of our Constitution. Where the health of the environment is key to preserving the right to life as a constitutionally recognized value under Article 21 of the Constitution, proper structures for environmental decision making find expression in the guarantee against arbitrary action and the affirmative duty of fair treatment under Article 14 of the Constitution.<ref name=\":8\" /></blockquote>Justice Chandrachud has also authored a judgment on the validity of grating ''ex post facto'' Environmental Clearances in Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd v Rohit Prajapati.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/2562/2562_2016_0_1501_21582_Judgement_01-Apr-2020.pdf|title=Alembic Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The erstwhile Ministry of Environmental and Forests had issued an administrative circular in 2002 envisaging the grant of ''ex post facto'' clearances to those industries that had failed to comply with the mandatory EIA notification of 1994. The ex post facto clearances granted to a group of drug and pharmaceutical companies located in Gujarat were challenged. Justice Chandrachud set aside the administrative circular of 2002 and noted that the concept of ''ex post facto'' ECs derogates from the fundamental principles of the environmental rule of law. He noted that the grant of ''ex post facto'' ECs was contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the principal of sustainable development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-penalises-three-pharma-cos-asks-to-pay-fine-of-rs-10-cr-each-820450.html|title=SC penalises three pharma cos, asks to pay fine of Rs 10 Cr each|date=2020-04-02|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud noted that all the industries in question had made significant infrastructural investments.

Allowing for an ex post facto clearance would essentially condone the operation of industrial activities without the grant of an EC. In the absence of an EC, there would be no conditions that would safeguard the environment. Moreover, if the EC was to be ultimately refused, irreparable harm would have been caused to the environment. In either view of the matter, environment law cannot countenance the notion of an ex post facto clearance. This would be contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the need for sustainable development.<ref name=\":9\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Others ==\nJustice Chandrachud has also been the voice of a strong dissent in notable cases. He wrote a dissenting opinion in the Aadhaar<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/supremecourt/2012/35071/35071_2012_Judgement_26-Sep-2018.pdf|title=Aadhaar}}</ref> case, where the majority upheld the constitutional validity of the largest biometric identity project in the world. Justice Chandrachud held the project to be unconstitutional and violative of fundamental rights. In Jindal Stainless Ltd. v. State of Haryana,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sci.gov.in/jonew/judis/44300.pdf|title=Entry Tax}}</ref> a 9-judge Bench decision on the constitutional validity of entry tax imposed by states in India, Justice Chandrachud authored a dissenting opinion.

In his judgment regarding the construction of a new airport in Goa and resulting environmental law violations, the Environmental Clearance (EC) granted for the construction of the new airport at Mopa in Goa has been suspended until the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) revisits the recommendations made for the grant of an EC.

The judgment was celebrated for undertaking a critical, nuanced analysis that favoured an inclusive definition of 'efficiency' and consequently 'merit', - one that is consistent with the principle of substantive equality, as opposed to formal equality.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070806180624/http://www.vmslaw.edu/sympo.htm Millennium laws For India Inc.---A symposium]\n* [http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/adr_conf/chandrachud3.pdf M E D I A T I O N \u2013 realizing the potential and designing. implementation strategies.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170649/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2002/judges_papers/chandrachud_final.pdf First South Asian Regional Judicial Colloquium on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820184647/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2003/background_papers.htm CHRI: Judicial Colloquia Series on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702192624/http://www.interights.org/page.php?dir=News Justiciability of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Pacific\u2014A judicial colloquium and workshop]\n* [http://www.allahabadhighcourt.in/service/judgeDetail.jsp?id=203|High Court of Judicature at Allahabad]\n\n{{Sitting Judges of the Supreme Court of India}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chandrachud, Dhananjaya Y.}}\n[[Category:20th-century Indian judges]]\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Faculty of Law, University of Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:Indian solicitors]]\n[[Category:Judges of the Mumbai High Court]]\n[[Category:St. Columba's School, Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Chief Justices of the Allahabad High Court]]\n[[Category:Justices of the Supreme Court of India]]\n[[Category:21st-century Indian judges]]\n", "name_user": "Charmanderrulez", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor edits on grammar and text.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud"}

A settlement also developed around the castle on the hill opposite and was the French borough supporting the Normans in the castle.

In 1831 citizens rioted in protest against the [[Duke of Newcastle]]'s opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832]], setting fire to his residence, [[Nottingham Castle]].\n\n[[File:Nottingham Map 1831 by Staveley and Wood.jpg|thumb|Nottingham in 1831]]\nIn common with the UK textile industry, Nottingham's textile sector fell into decline in the decades following World War II. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  Little textile manufacture now takes place in Nottingham; however, many of the former industrial buildings in the Lace Market district have been restored and put to new uses.\n\nNottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and at that time consisted of the parishes of St Mary, St Nicholas and St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of [[Basford, Nottingham|Basford]], Brewhouse Yard, [[Bulwell]], [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]], [[Sneinton]], Standard Hill, and parts of the parishes of [[West Bridgford]], [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]], [[Wilford, Nottinghamshire|Wilford]] (North Wilford). In 1889 Nottingham became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the prime minister, the [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] to the mayor, dated 18 June 1897. Nottingham was extended in 1933 by adding [[Bilborough]] and [[Wollaton]], parts of the parishes of Bestwood Park and [[Colwick]], and a recently developed part of the [[Beeston Urban District]]. A further boundary extension was granted in 1951 when Clifton and Wilford (south of the River Trent) were incorporated into the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |title=Relationships / unit history of Nottingham |accessdate=22 March 2007 |publisher=A Vision of Britain Through Time |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235913/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |archivedate=30 September 2007  }}</ref><ref name=localhist>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |title=A Brief History of Nottingham, England |author=Tim Lambert |accessdate=12 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622224124/http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |archive-date=22 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{historical populations\n|title = Demographic evolution of Nottingham\n|cols = 2 | align = center|percentages=off\n|4th century|&lt;37\n|10th century|&lt;1,000\n|11th century|1,500\n|14th century|3,000\n|Early 17th century|4,000\n|Late 17th century|5,000\n}}\n{{historical populations\n|title = <nowiki />\n|cols = 3 | align = center\n|1801|29,000\n|1811|34,000\n|1821|40,000\n|1831|51,000\n|1841|53,000\n|1851|58,000\n|1861|76,000\n|1871|87,000\n|1881|159,000\n|1901|240,000\n|1911|260,000\n|1921|269,000\n|1931|265,000\n|1951|306,000\n|1961|312,000\n|1971|301,000\n|1981|278,000\n|1991|273,000\n|2001|275,000\n}}\nElectric trams were introduced to the city in 1901; they served the city for 35 years until 1936.

South of the river there has also been expansion with new areas such as Edwalton and West Bridgford, adding to Nottingham's [[urban sprawl]]. Although this growth slowed towards the end of the century, the modern pressures for more affordable and council housing is back on the political agenda and there is now pressure on the [[green belt]] which surrounds the city.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Government==\n\n===Local government===\n[[File:Council-House-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nottingham Council House]]]]\n\nThere are two major local authorities that serve the Nottingham area. These are [[Nottingham City Council]] and [[Nottinghamshire County Council]].\n\n[[Nottingham City Council]] is a [[unitary authority]] based at [[Loxley House, Nottingham]] on Station Street. It consists of 55 [[councillors]], representing 20 [[Ward (politics)|wards]], who are elected every four years; the last elections being held on [[2015 Nottingham City Council election|7 May 2015]].\n\nThe city also has a [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham|Lord Mayor]] who is selected by city councillors from among themselves. The position is largely ceremonial but the Lord Mayor also acts as Chair of Full Council meetings.\n\nThe City of Nottingham's boundaries are tightly drawn and exclude several suburbs and satellite towns that are usually considered part of [[Greater Nottingham]]. Unlike the City, these areas are governed by a two tier system of local government. [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] (based at [[County Hall, Nottinghamshire|County Hall]]), provides the upper tier of local government whilst the lower tier is split into several district or borough councils. The County Council are responsible for Health, Social Care, Education, Highways, Transport, Libraries and Trading Standards, whilst the lower tier councils are responsible for local planning, neighbourhood services, housing, licensing, environmental health and leisure facilities. The western suburbs of [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] and [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]] are administered by [[Broxtowe Borough Council]]. Further west still, the Nottingham urban district extends into [[Derbyshire]] where [[Ilkeston]] and [[Long Eaton]] are administered by [[Erewash Borough Council]], and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] by [[Amber Valley]]. To the north, [[Hucknall]] is controlled by [[Ashfield District Council]], while in the east [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]] and [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]] form part of the [[Borough of Gedling]]. South of the river, the suburb of [[West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire|West Bridgford]] lies in [[Rushcliffe]], as do the outlying villages of [[Ruddington]] and [[Tollerton, Nottinghamshire|Tollerton]] and the town of [[Bingham, Nottinghamshire|Bingham]].\n[[File:GreaterNottingham-map.png|thumb|Map illustrating the boundaries of the city and the wider [[Greater Nottingham]] area]]\n\n===UK Parliament===\nNottingham has three UK parliamentary [[constituency]] seats within its boundaries. [[Nottingham North (UK Parliament constituency)|Nottingham North]] has been represented since 2017 by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Alex Norris]], [[Nottingham East (UK Parliament constituency)|Nottingham East]] since 2010 by Labour MP [[Chris Leslie (politician)|Chris Leslie]] ([[Change UK - The Independent Group]] as of February 2019<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47278902|title=Seven MPs leave Labour in Corbyn protest|date=18 February 2019|access-date=2 March 2019|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301061322/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47278902|archive-date=1 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>) and [[Nottingham South (UK Parliament constituency)|Nottingham South]] since 2010 by Labour MP [[Lilian Greenwood]].

Completely encircling the city, it extends for several miles into the surrounding districts, as well as towards Derby.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe geographical centre of Nottingham is usually defined as the [[Old Market Square]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which replaced the Nottingham Exchange Building, built in 1726. The Council House was built in the 1920s to display civic pride, ostentatiously using [[baroque]] columns and placing stone statues of two lions at the front to stand watch over the square. The [[Exchange Arcade]], on the ground floor, is an upmarket shopping centre containing boutiques.\n\n[[File:Byron house 2.JPG|thumb|Nottingham Trent University, Arkwright Building]]\n\nTall office buildings line Maid Marian Way. The Georgian area around Oxford and Regent Streets is dominated by small professional firms. The [[Albert Hall, Nottingham|Albert Hall]] faces the [[gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival]] [[Nottingham Cathedral|St Barnabas' Roman Catholic Cathedral]] by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]]. [[Nottingham Castle]] and its grounds are located further south in the western third of the city. The central third descends from the University district in the north, past [[Nottingham Trent University]]'s Gothic revival Arkwright Building. The university also owns many other buildings in this area. The Theatre Royal on Theatre Square, with its pillared fa\u00e7ade, was built in 1865. King and Queen Streets are home to striking [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings designed by such architects as [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and [[Watson Fothergill]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nTo the south, is [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]]. The Canal-side further south of this is adjacent to [[Nottingham railway station]] and home to numerous redeveloped 19th-century industrial buildings, reused as bars and restaurants.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe eastern third of the city centre contains the Victoria Shopping Centre, built in the 1970s on the site of the demolished Victoria Railway Station. All that remains of the old station is the clock tower and the station hotel, now the Nottingham Hilton Hotel. The 250-foot-high Victoria Centre flats stand above the shopping centre and are the tallest buildings in the city. The eastern third contains [[Hockley Village]]. Hockley is where many of Nottingham's unique, independent shops are to be found. It is also home to two alternative cinemas.\n\n===Lace Market===\n[[File:Lace market justice galleries.JPG|thumb|National Justice Museum in the Lace Market]]\n\nThe [[Lace Market]] area just south of [[Hockley, Nottingham|Hockley]] has streets with four- to seven-storey red brick warehouses, [[iron railing]]s and [[Red telephone box|red phone boxes]].\n\nMany of the buildings have been converted into apartments, bars and restaurants. The largest building in the Lace Market is the [[The Adams Building Nottingham|Adams Building]], built by [[Thomas Chambers Hine]] for [[Thomas Adams (manufacturer and philanthropist)|Thomas Adams]] (1807\u20131873), and currently used by [[Nottingham College]]. The Georgian-built Shire Hall, which was once Nottingham's main [[courtroom|court]] and [[prison]] building, is now home to the [[National Justice Museum]] (formerly the \"Galleries of Justice\").\n\n===Public houses===\n''[[Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem]]'' (the ''Trip''), partially built into the cave system beneath Nottingham Castle, is a contender for the title of England's Oldest Pub, as it is supposed to have been established in 1189.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| title=Nottingham \u2013 Pubs| accessdate=4 December 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621045656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| archive-date=21 June 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Bell Inn, Nottingham|The Bell Inn]]'' in the Old Market Square, and ''[[Ye Olde Salutation Inn]]'' (the ''Salutation'') in Maid Marian Way have both disputed this claim.

There are also caves beneath the ''Salutation'' that date back to the medieval period, although they are no longer used as beer cellars. The ''Bell Inn'' is probably the oldest of the three pub buildings still standing, according to [[dendrochronology]], and has medieval cellars that are still used to store beer.<ref name=\"Lomax2013\">{{cite book |author=Scott C.

Nottingham, however, does not have one, having only been designated a city in 1897, in celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. From around AD 1100 Nottingham was part of the [[Diocese of Lichfield]], controlled as an [[List of Archdeacons of Nottingham|archdeaconry]] from [[Lichfield Cathedral]] in Staffordshire. However, in 1837 the archdeaconry was placed under the control of the [[Diocese of Lincoln]].

The bishop is based at [[Southwell Minster]], {{convert|14|mi|0}} north-east of the city.\n\nDespite not having a cathedral, Nottingham has three notable historic [[Anglican parish church]]es, all of which date back to the [[Middle Ages]]. [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary the Virgin]], in the Lace Market, is the oldest and largest. The church dates from the eighth or ninth centuries, but the present building is at least the third on the site, dating primarily from 1377 to 1485. St. Mary's is considered the mother church of the city and civic services are held here, including the welcome to the new [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham]] each year. It is a member of the [[Greater Churches Group]]. [[St. Peter's Church, Nottingham|St. Peter's]] in the heart of the city is the oldest building in continuous use in Nottingham, with traces of building starting in 1180. [[St. Nicholas' Church, Nottingham|St. Nicholas']] is the third.\n\nA variety of chapels and meeting rooms are in the town.

In 1831 citizens rioted in protest against the [[Duke of Newcastle]]'s opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832]], setting fire to his residence, [[Nottingham Castle]].\n\n[[File:Nottingham Map 1831 by Staveley and Wood.jpg|thumb|Nottingham in 1831]]\nIn common with the UK textile industry, Nottingham's textile sector fell into decline in the decades following World War II. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  Little textile manufacture now takes place in Nottingham; however, many of the former industrial buildings in the Lace Market district have been restored and put to new uses.\n\nNottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and at that time consisted of the parishes of St Mary, St Nicholas and St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of [[Basford, Nottingham|Basford]], Brewhouse Yard, [[Bulwell]], [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]], [[Sneinton]], Standard Hill, and parts of the parishes of [[West Bridgford]], [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]], [[Wilford, Nottinghamshire|Wilford]] (North Wilford). In 1889 Nottingham became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the prime minister, the [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] to the mayor, dated 18 June 1897. Nottingham was extended in 1933 by adding [[Bilborough]] and [[Wollaton]], parts of the parishes of Bestwood Park and [[Colwick]], and a recently developed part of the [[Beeston Urban District]]. A further boundary extension was granted in 1951 when Clifton and Wilford (south of the River Trent) were incorporated into the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |title=Relationships / unit history of Nottingham |accessdate=22 March 2007 |publisher=A Vision of Britain Through Time |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235913/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |archivedate=30 September 2007  }}</ref><ref name=localhist>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |title=A Brief History of Nottingham, England |author=Tim Lambert |accessdate=12 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622224124/http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |archive-date=22 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{historical populations\n|title = Demographic evolution of Nottingham\n|cols = 2 | align = center|percentages=off\n|4th century|&lt;37\n|10th century|&lt;1,000\n|11th century|1,500\n|14th century|3,000\n|Early 17th century|4,000\n|Late 17th century|5,000\n}}\n{{historical populations\n|title = <nowiki />\n|cols = 3 | align = center\n|1801|29,000\n|1811|34,000\n|1821|40,000\n|1831|51,000\n|1841|53,000\n|1851|58,000\n|1861|76,000\n|1871|87,000\n|1881|159,000\n|1901|240,000\n|1911|260,000\n|1921|269,000\n|1931|265,000\n|1951|306,000\n|1961|312,000\n|1971|301,000\n|1981|278,000\n|1991|273,000\n|2001|275,000\n}}\nElectric trams were introduced to the city in 1901; they served the city for 35 years until 1936.

South of the river there has also been expansion with new areas such as Edwalton and West Bridgford, adding to Nottingham's [[urban sprawl]]. Although this growth slowed towards the end of the century, the modern pressures for more affordable and council housing is back on the political agenda and there is now pressure on the [[green belt]] which surrounds the city.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Government==\n\n===Local government===\n[[File:Council-House-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nottingham Council House]]]]\n\nThere are two major local authorities that serve the Nottingham area. These are [[Nottingham City Council]] and [[Nottinghamshire County Council]].\n\n[[Nottingham City Council]] is a [[unitary authority]] based at [[Loxley House, Nottingham]] on Station Street. It consists of 55 [[councillors]], representing 20 [[Ward (politics)|wards]], who are elected every four years; the last elections being held on [[2015 Nottingham City Council election|7 May 2015]].\n\nThe city also has a [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham|Lord Mayor]] who is selected by city councillors from among themselves. The position is largely ceremonial but the Lord Mayor also acts as Chair of Full Council meetings.\n\nThe City of Nottingham's boundaries are tightly drawn and exclude several suburbs and satellite towns that are usually considered part of [[Greater Nottingham]]. Unlike the City, these areas are governed by a two tier system of local government. [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] (based at [[County Hall, Nottinghamshire|County Hall]]), provides the upper tier of local government whilst the lower tier is split into several district or borough councils. The County Council are responsible for Health, Social Care, Education, Highways, Transport, Libraries and Trading Standards, whilst the lower tier councils are responsible for local planning, neighbourhood services, housing, licensing, environmental health and leisure facilities. The western suburbs of [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] and [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]] are administered by [[Broxtowe Borough Council]]. Further west still, the Nottingham urban district extends into [[Derbyshire]] where [[Ilkeston]] and [[Long Eaton]] are administered by [[Erewash Borough Council]], and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] by [[Amber Valley]].

Completely encircling the city, it extends for several miles into the surrounding districts, as well as towards Derby.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe geographical centre of Nottingham is usually defined as the [[Old Market Square]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} The square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which replaced the Nottingham Exchange Building, built in 1726. The Council House was built in the 1920s to display civic pride, ostentatiously using [[baroque]] columns and placing stone statues of two lions at the front to stand watch over the square. The [[Exchange Arcade]], on the ground floor, is an upmarket shopping centre containing boutiques.\n\n[[File:Byron house 2.JPG|thumb|Nottingham Trent University, Arkwright Building]]\n\nTall office buildings line Maid Marian Way. The Georgian area around Oxford and Regent Streets is dominated by small professional firms. The [[Albert Hall, Nottingham|Albert Hall]] faces the [[gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival]] [[Nottingham Cathedral|St Barnabas' Roman Catholic Cathedral]] by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]]. [[Nottingham Castle]] and its grounds are located further south in the western third of the city. The central third descends from the University district in the north, past [[Nottingham Trent University]]'s Gothic revival Arkwright Building. The university also owns many other buildings in this area. The Theatre Royal on Theatre Square, with its pillared fa\u00e7ade, was built in 1865. King and Queen Streets are home to striking [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings designed by such architects as [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and [[Watson Fothergill]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nTo the south, is [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]]. The Canal-side further south of this is adjacent to [[Nottingham railway station]] and home to numerous redeveloped 19th-century industrial buildings, reused as bars and restaurants.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe eastern third of the city centre contains the Victoria Shopping Centre, built in the 1970s on the site of the demolished Victoria Railway Station. All that remains of the old station is the clock tower and the station hotel, now the Nottingham Hilton Hotel. The 250-foot-high Victoria Centre flats stand above the shopping centre and are the tallest buildings in the city. The eastern third contains [[Hockley Village]]. Hockley is where many of Nottingham's unique, independent shops are to be found. It is also home to two alternative cinemas.\n\n===Lace Market===\n[[File:Lace market justice galleries.JPG|thumb|National Justice Museum in the Lace Market]]\n\nThe [[Lace Market]] area just south of [[Hockley, Nottingham|Hockley]] has streets with four- to seven-storey red brick warehouses, [[iron railing]]s and [[Red telephone box|red phone boxes]].\n\nMany of the buildings have been converted into apartments, bars and restaurants. The largest building in the Lace Market is the [[The Adams Building Nottingham|Adams Building]], built by [[Thomas Chambers Hine]] for [[Thomas Adams (manufacturer and philanthropist)|Thomas Adams]] (1807\u20131873), and currently used by [[Nottingham College]]. The Georgian-built Shire Hall, which was once Nottingham's main [[courtroom|court]] and [[prison]] building, is now home to the [[National Justice Museum]] (formerly the \"Galleries of Justice\").\n\n===Public houses===\n''[[Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem]]'' (the ''Trip''), partially built into the cave system beneath Nottingham Castle, is a contender for the title of England's Oldest Pub, as it is supposed to have been established in 1189.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| title=Nottingham \u2013 Pubs| accessdate=4 December 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621045656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| archive-date=21 June 2014| url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Bell Inn, Nottingham|The Bell Inn]]'' in the Old Market Square, and ''[[Ye Olde Salutation Inn]]'' (the ''Salutation'') in Maid Marian Way have both disputed this claim.

Nottingham, however, does not have one, having only been designated a city in 1897, in celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. From around AD 1100 Nottingham was part of the [[Diocese of Lichfield]], controlled as an [[List of Archdeacons of Nottingham|archdeaconry]] from [[Lichfield Cathedral]] in Staffordshire. However, in 1837 the archdeaconry was placed under the control of the [[Diocese of Lincoln]]. In 1884 it became part of the newly created [[Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham|Diocese of Southwell]], which it, and the city, are still part of today. The bishop is based at [[Southwell Minster]], {{convert|14|mi|0}} north-east of the city.\n\nDespite not having a cathedral, Nottingham has three notable historic [[Anglican parish church]]es, all of which date back to the [[Middle Ages]]. [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary the Virgin]], in the Lace Market, is the oldest and largest. The church dates from the eighth or ninth centuries, but the present building is at least the third on the site, dating primarily from 1377 to 1485. St. Mary's is considered the mother church of the city and civic services are held here, including the welcome to the new [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham]] each year. It is a member of the [[Greater Churches Group]]. [[St. Peter's Church, Nottingham|St. Peter's]] in the heart of the city is the oldest building in continuous use in Nottingham, with traces of building starting in 1180. [[St. Nicholas' Church, Nottingham|St. Nicholas']] is the third.\n\nA variety of chapels and meeting rooms are in the town. Many of these grand buildings have been demolished, including [[Halifax Place Wesleyan Chapel]], but some have been re-used, notably [[High Pavement Chapel]] which is now a public house. There are three [[Christadelphian]] meeting halls in the city and the national headquarters of the [[Congregational Federation]] is in Nottingham.\n\nNottingham is one of 18 British cities that do not have an Anglican cathedral.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovemytown.co.uk/citystatus/index.htm |title=City Status |publisher=Lovemytown.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620043638/http://lovemytown.co.uk/CityStatus/index.htm |archive-date=20 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.asp |title=Cathedrals |publisher=Lovemytown.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116110835/http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.asp |archive-date=16 January 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is, however, home to the [[Nottingham Cathedral|Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Barnabas]], which was designed by [[Augustus Pugin]] and [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1844.

It stars [[Song Kang-ho]], [[Lee Sun-kyun]], [[Cho Yeo-jeong]], [[Choi Woo-shik]], [[Park So-dam]], [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]], and [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] and follows the members of a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family by infiltrating their household and posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.\n\n''Parasite'' premiered at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival]] on 21 May 2019, where it became the first South Korean film to win the [[Palme d'Or]]. It was then released in South Korea by [[CJ Entertainment]] on 30 May 2019.\n\nThe film received universal critical acclaim, with praise directed towards its screenplay, Bong's direction, score, cinematography, editing, production values, and the performances of the cast, particularly from Song and Cho. It is considered one of the greatest films of the 2010s. It grossed over $266 million worldwide on a production budget of about $11 million, becoming [[List of highest-grossing films in South Korea#Domestic films by gross|the highest-grossing South Korean film]].\n\nAmong its [[List of accolades received by Parasite|numerous accolades]], ''Parasite'' won a leading four awards at the [[92nd Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]], becoming the first film not in English to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.{{refn|group=note|Although ''Parasite'' was the first film not in English to win Best Picture at the Oscars, it is not to be confused with the first   ''foreign'' film (produced by a company of a country that does not have English as its primary language) to win Best Picture, which was achieved by ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' in 2012.

Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that Ki-woo takes over his job as an English [[tutor]] for the daughter of the wealthy Park family, though Ki-woo is initially hesitant. Ki-jung forges a diploma from [[Yonsei University]] for Ki-woo to help him get hired; upon arrival, Mrs. Park hires him, and decides they will call him \"Kevin\".\n\nThe Kim family infiltrates the lives of the Parks by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated and highly qualified workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with the Parks' daughter, Da-hye. Ki-jung poses as \"Jessica\", an [[Art therapy|art therapist]] to the Parks' hyperactive young son, Da-song. Ki-jung frames Mr. Park's chauffeur as having had sex in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr. Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach allergy of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs. Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang suddenly returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his Taiwanese bakery failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal their secret to Moon-gwang, who threatens to report them to the Parks.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs. Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a seizure-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] on a previous birthday when he saw a \"ghost\"&nbsp;\u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement&nbsp;\u2013 and that the family has celebrated Da-song's birthday outside the house ever since. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr. Park's offhanded comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners and flicks the light everyday hoping ki-woo will see it one day.

Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with the Parks' daughter, Da-hye. Ki-jung poses as \"Jessica\", an [[Art therapy|art therapist]] to the Parks' hyperactive young son, Da-song. Ki-jung frames Mr. Park's chauffeur as having had sex in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr. Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach allergy of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs. Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang suddenly returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his Taiwanese bakery failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal their secret to Moon-gwang, who threatens to report them to the Parks.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs. Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a seizure-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] on a previous birthday when he saw a \"ghost\"&nbsp;\u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement&nbsp;\u2013 and that the family has celebrated Da-song's birthday outside the house ever since. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr. Park's offhanded comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* Park Geun-rok as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013.

In terms of practical lighting, the DP [director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color.

Snyder]], Deitch co-produced and directed a series of TV shorts of ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' for King Features from 1962 to 1964. ''[[The Bluffers]]'', which was based on one of Deitch's ideas, was also co-produced by him. He directed the 1966 film ''[[Alice of Wonderland in Paris]]''. In 1966, he worked with Czech animator [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]] on a feature-length animated film adapatation of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. However, producer William L. Snyder couldn't secure the funds, and in order to not let the rights for the novel expire, he asked Deitch to produce a short film adaptation in 30 days. Deitch and illustrator [[Adolf Born]] made a 13-minute animated film never intended for distribution; the film was long considered lost until it was rediscovered by Snyder's son and released on [[YouTube]] in 2012.<ref name=DVTV>{{cite web|url=https://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/jsi-bud-komunista-nebo-blazen-slychaval-ceskoslovensko-bylo/r~a96bd4a84c8211e880d30cc47ab5f122/?redirected=1526714757|title=Jsi bu\u010f komunista, nebo bl\u00e1zen, sl\u00fdch\u00e1val. \u010ceskoslovensko bylo jako st\u0159edov\u011bk, l\u00ed\u010d\u00ed dr\u017eitel Oscara / 'You are either a communist or a fool': Czechoslovakia was like the Middle Ages, says the Oscar winner| publisher=[[DVTV]]| date= n.d.|accessdate=May 19, 2018|location=Czech Republic|language=czech}}</ref> Also in 1966, Deitch created a young girl adventurer in ''Terr'ble Tessie.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/terrble.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fEh3AEBM?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/terrble.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2016  }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1969 until his retirement in 2008, Deitch was the leading animation director for the Connecticut organization [[Weston Woods Studios]], adapting children's picture books.
