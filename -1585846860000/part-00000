The series aired on [[Disney Channel]] from March 18, 2005, to September 1, 2008 with 4 million viewers, making it the most successful premiere for Disney Channel. The series was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] three times and was also nominated for a [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award]] three times.\n\nThe series is set in the Tipton Hotel in [[Boston]] and centers on [[Zack Martin (Suite Life)|Zack Martin]] and [[Cody Martin]] ([[Dylan and Cole Sprouse]]), troublesome twins who live at the Tipton Hotel.<ref name=\"imdb\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426371/ The Suite Life of Zack and Cody]</ref> The series' other main characters include the Tipton hotel's ditzy heiress [[London Tipton]] ([[Brenda Song]]), the hotel's candy counter girl [[Maddie Fitzpatrick]] ([[Ashley Tisdale]]), the manager, [[Mr. Moseby|Mr. Marion Moseby]] ([[Phill Lewis]]), and the boys' single mother who is also the Hotel's [[lounge singer]], [[Carey Martin]] ([[Kim Rhodes]]).<ref name=\"imdb\"/> The series is the third Disney Channel Original to have more than 65 episodes, after ''[[That's So Raven]]'' and ''[[Kim Possible]]''.<ref name=\"s3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.juniorcelebs.com/the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody-season-3/ |title=The Suite Life of Zack and Cody \u2013 Season 3 |publisher=Juniorcelebs.com |date=January 4, 2008 |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}</ref> Reruns aired on [[Disney XD]] until 2014.

They are listed in the same order throughout the article for consistency. -->\n*[[Dylan and Cole Sprouse|Cole Sprouse]] portrays [[Cody Martin]], the calm, mature, and smarter twin. He is a \"straight [[Academic grading in North America#United States|A]]\" student (except for wood shop, in which he receives a C, but switches to taking it Pass/Fail), making him better, academically, than his brother Zack, who gets \"D's\". In the first season of the show, it was revealed that Cody is ten minutes younger than Zack.<ref name=agedifferenceproof>Suite Life on Deck episode: Bermuda Triangle \u2013 Cody says that he was born at 6:40, Zack says that he was born at 6:30</ref> Janice and Jessica seem to like Cody more (due to his sensitive nature). Cody has an on-again, off-again girlfriend named Barbara. Cody is the more gentle twin compared to his brother and somehow always gets talked into going along with Zack's schemes. In ''The Fairest of Them All'', he dressed as a girl to win money. He never drinks soda after 9:30 (unless he is at a bachelor party).\n*[[Dylan and Cole Sprouse|Dylan Sprouse]] portrays [[Zack Martin (Suite Life)|Zack Martin]], the self-centered, outgoing, immature twin, who usually dresses in skater and baggy-camo clothes. At school, he is a straight \"D\" student, although he does well in wood shop. In the first season of the show it was revealed that Zack is ten minutes older than Cody, as he was born at 6:30 and Cody at 6:40<ref name=\"agedifferenceproof\"/> which he uses against Cody, normally telling him, since he's older, to do some sort of job that he doesn't want to do. Or in some cases, gives him \"brotherly\" advice because, \"I'm the older twin.\" He has a big crush on Maddie, but after the first season, he was showing this less frequently. He has also taken advantage of his teachers and has faked conditions like dyslexia (in ''Smart and Smarterer'').\n*[[Brenda Song]] portrays [[London Tipton]], the only daughter of Wilfred Tipton, the owner of the Tipton Hotel. London is a rich, dimwitted teenager with her own private suite at the Tipton Hotel in Boston, complete with a large wardrobe with several divisions (each with their own talking mirror) and a kitchen. London loves fashion; she only wears designer clothes and hates plaid, especially the plaid Catholic school uniforms. She does not have a nanny, or any other adult, to help her but relies on the Tipton Hotel Staff for any assistance or guidance. In the episode ''Forever Plaid'', due to her poor attendance at her old school, she transferred to the same Catholic girls' school, \"Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow,\" that Maddie attends. In the episode ''First Day of High School'', London transfers to Zack and Cody's public school, \"Cheevers High,\" due to being expelled from all of the private schools she had previously attended. She dislikes her step-moms (previous and current) and usually talks to Mr. Moseby and Maddie about her problems. When happy she always claps her hands repeatedly while saying her catchphrase, \"Yay me!\" She also has her own web show called ''Yay Me! Starring London Tipton'' that exists both within the program and in the real world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/suitelife/yaymestarringlondontipton|title=Yay Me! Starring London Tipton|publisher=Disney|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref> London often refuses to go to school and even skipped detention twice. Though it seems like London may lead the ultimate rich-girl life, her childhood was not perfect. In the episode ''Arwinstein'', she states she is allergic to lobster, although in one episode she asked Maddie for a lobster dinner. However, it is possible that she developed an allergy to lobster after the earlier episodes and before the later ones. It is also revealed in one episode that she must think about what she does before doing it. For example, she was walking through the lobby while thinking \"left, right, blink, breathe\" in the episode ''Super Twins'' (although this was Zack's dream). London is a shopaholic who shops to fill the void of lack of attention from her father.\n*{{anchor|Maddie_Fitzpatrick}}[[Ashley Tisdale]] She is Sharpay in HSM.portrays Maddie Fitzpatrick, the teenage candy-counter girl at the Tipton Hotel, who throughout the series holds several other jobs/positions including a cashier at the Cluck Bucket, manager on the Camp Tipton Daycare Center, and counselor for her school's summer camp program \u2013 Camp Heaven on Earth. She also visits [[Antarctica]] during the series to help save the penguins. While she comes from a lower-class family, Maddie is very hard-working, outspoken, and intelligent. On the occasions that her selfish side comes out, she can be a bigger opportunist than London, though she always loses out when this side of her personality is shown. Like Esteban, it is shown she has an incredibly long name; in the episode \"Pilot Your Own Life,\" it is revealed to be Madeline Margaret Genevieve Miranda Catherine Fitzpatrick.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Pilot Your Own Life|episodelink=List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes#ep23|series=The Suite Life of Zack & Cody|network=[[Disney Channel]]|airdate=January 6, 2006|season=1|number=23|minutes=9:40}}</ref> She attends private school at \"Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow\" and later attends \"Cheevers High.\" Maddie is London's closest friend, though London often treats her like a servant, as in the episode ''Footloser'', usually bribing her with money. Maddie also babysat Zack and Cody throughout season one. Zack has a huge crush on her in Season One, however the crush is less visible during the other two seasons. She is a strong supporter of environmental causes. She is left-handed. It is revealed that she has [[asthma]]. She also plays volleyball as seen in the episode \"Volley Dad''. She appeared sporadically throughout Season 3.\n*[[Phill Lewis]] portrays [[Mr. Moseby|Mr. Marion Moseby]], the stern and uptight manager of the Tipton Hotel, who speaks with a large vocabulary and an urbane vernacular, and is often annoyed by Zack's and Cody's schemes.  It is later revealed that his first name is Marion and the majority of the other characters often made fun of his masculinity because of his feminine name, as well as his experience as a ballet dancer. His repeated catch phrases, \"Good luck with that\", \"Pish posh\" and \"If you'll excuse me\". have become his trademark. Though he acts as though he does not care about the boys, he actually has a great deal of affection for them. In the episode \"The Ghost of 613,\" it is revealed that he started out at the Tipton as a bellhop back in the 1970s, and had a \"voluminous 'fro\". Mr. Moseby is more of a father to London than her own, because Mr. Tipton is seldom around. Moseby even taught London how to walk, her ABCs, and tried to teach her how to drive. He cares for London and treats her like his own child. He also helps London with any problems she is having. He was also known as the \"Meanager,\" due to his stern persona. He has an older brother named Spencer, who is a little person (played by Dana Michael Woods), who is very wealthy and lactose intolerant. His mother's' name is Beulah Moseby, who favors Spencer, but still likes Marion. His grandmother is Rose Moseby (whom Phill Lewis also plays) who visits him in the episode \"Nugget of History\". He has a 16-year-old niece named Nia Moseby (played by [[Giovonnie Samuels]]) who comes to stay with him during the third season and temporarily replaces Maddie as candy counter girl, while she is in Antarctica.\n\n:A running gag of the series is that Mr. Moseby often makes a fool of himself in front of people (e.g.: hitting a baby doll that wouldn't stop crying against a chair when a woman with a baby walked by), or making a sarcastic comment about himself (that the customers think is true, and not sarcastic). Another running joke is that he often just barely catches a vase on the center table of the lobby from falling, although he fails to do that in the series' finale. In his schooling he was captain of the cheerleading squad; his experience with cheering comes in useful in a cheer-off. He also was a junior putt-putt champion and taught Zack how to succeed in playing mini-golf. Mr. Moseby also took ballet lessons and is a very good dancer. When he practiced and participated in Esteban's dance school, he was temporarily partnered with Carey, but found it hard to dance with her since she is much taller than he is, which all the other characters made fun of much to his dismay. He also takes advantage of Zack and Cody in some cases, like in the episode \"Heck's Kitchen\" he treats them with room service so they will find a food critic. He makes a brief appearance in the Disney Channel sitcom ''[[Jessie (2011 TV series)|Jessie]]'' where it is revealed that he now manages the Tipton Hotel in New York.\n\n*[[Kim Rhodes]] portrays [[Carey Martin]], the single working mother of Zack and Cody. She is the hotel's lounge singer, who sings beautifully. She and her sons traveled to several cities before arriving at the Boston Tipton Hotel, which she called the \"best gig we've ever had.\" She was married to Kurt Martin, but they divorced after the twins were born for unstated reasons. Arwin has made it known on several occasions that he has a massive crush on her (a crush that didn't wane during the series' course). Whenever Carey kisses Arwin, he faints. When Zack and Cody have an argument, she tells them stories about her ex-boyfriends, much to their dismay.\n\nThroughout the series' run, Brenda Song was absent for two episodes while Ashley Tisdale was absent from twelve episodes. All other main cast members appeared in all 87 episodes.\n\n===Recurring===\n {{Main|List of recurring characters in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody}}\nBelow is a list of cast members who have appeared in significant roles as [[recurring character]]s throughout the series.

Raven Baxter meets Zack and Cody as she visits the Tipton Hotel to do a photo shoot promoting a new fashion line for boys, only to have a troubling psychic vision of Cody. In the meantime, London refuses to wear one of Raven's original designs until Hannah Montana stops by and shows an interest in the fashions.\n\n==Settings==\n\n;Tipton Hotel\n[[The Tipton Hotel]] is where Zack, Cody, Carey, and London all live, and where the majority of the other characters in the series work. It is the main setting for the series. The Tipton Hotel is located in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. [[Hotel Vancouver]] is used for the exterior of the hotel.\n\n;The [[The Suite Life on Deck#SS Tipton|SS ''Tipton'']]\nIn the episode \"Let Us Entertain You\", Zack, Cody, and Carey spent a week vacationing on board the SS ''Tipton''. It is also the setting of the sequel series, ''The Suite Life on Deck''. The first time the SS ''Tipton'' is referenced is in the episode, \"To Catch a Thief\". While Maddie talks to London on the phone a life preserver with the words \"S.S. Tipton\" can be seen in the background.\n\n;Buckner Middle School<ref>Nurse Zack (Season 2, Episode 29)</ref>\nThe twins' Middle School. The school's mascot is a [[badger]].\n\nIn the scene outside of the school where a few students are walking between two buildings shows \"The Mall\" area that's located in [[Lincoln Park High School (Illinois)|Lincoln Park High School]], in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Some of the students that attend Buckner were Max, Bob, and Agnes. Carey would come sit outside of the detention area while Zack was being punished. She said when she was outside the principal's office at Cheevers High that, \"Thanks to Zack, I knitted 32 sweaters and an afghan.\"\n\nThe name comes from former-[[Boston Red Sox]] [[first baseman]] [[Bill Buckner]].\n\n;Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow [[Catholic schools in the United States|Catholic School]]\nMaddie and Mary Margaret ([[Monique Coleman]]) attended this private school in season one. Later in season two, Corrie ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]) and Leslie ([[Kaycee Stroh]]) were added to the minor cast, with London also attending the school in season two. In season three, London, Maddie, and Leslie no longer attend Our Lady. External shots of Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow Catholic School are of [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada.\n\n;Paul Revere Mini Mart\nZack and Cody work at the Paul Revere mini mart for the manager, Wayne Wormser. The mini mart's motto is, \"The savings are coming! The savings are coming!\" It is across the street from another mini mart with a patriotic name and theme, The Betsy Ross Stop and Shop, which is run by Wormser's business enemy and fierce rival.\n\n;Camp Heaven on Earth\nThe summer camp where Maddie works over the summer. The only part of the camp shown is the cabin in which Maddie and the young girls stay.\n\n;Cheevers High School\nWhere Zack, Cody, London, Maddie, and Nia attend along with other students including Barbara, Bob, and Mark. This setting was used in \"Lip Synchin' in the Rain,\" \"First Day of High School,\" \"Orchestra,\" and \"Benchwarmers.\" [[John Marshall High School (Los Angeles, California)]] is shown in a snapshot as Cheevers High School.\n\n;Other places in Boston\nScenes also take place in several other places in Boston, including [[Fenway Park]], a movie theater, Maddie's apartment, the local shopping mall, a bowling alley (The same bowling alley was used to film a scene from the [[Hannah Montana]] episode, \"People Who Use People\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/hannah-montana/people-who-use-people/episode/724978/summary.html|title=Hannah Montana Episode 18: People Who Use People|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref> a miniature golf course, Kurt's apartment, Mr. Moseby's condo, the Goose Lodge, Liberty Park, an apartment where Maddie and her friends painted for a poor family for community service, Arwin's apartment, camp Knock-a-Number, the forest that has Merele's cabin, Kurt's tour bus, the shop where Maddie demanded London give her inhaler, an art museum, a dance club, an alley with a garbage container, a pizza restaurant, Theo's home, the \"Risk It All\" studio, the Cluck Bucket, an aptitude company, and the restaurant where Wayne \"dates\" London. There are even two episodes that take place in Hollywood, which includes a movie studio, LAX, a beach, Sunset Blvd, Hollywood Blvd, and the Tipton Los Angeles.\n\n==Theme song and opening sequence==\nThe show's theme song, \"Here I Am,\" was written by John Adair and Steve Hampton (who also wrote the theme for the show's spinoff ''The Suite Life on Deck'', as well as for fellow Disney Channel series ''[[Phil of the Future]]'', ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', ''[[Sonny With a Chance]]'', ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'', ''[[Good Luck Charlie]]'', ''[[Shake It Up (U.S. TV series)|Shake It Up]]'', ''[[A.N.T.

The theme was remixed for the ending credits of \"Rock Star in the House\" in a form similar to \"[[Beautiful Soul (song)|Beautiful Soul]]\" to accompany the episode's guest appearance of [[Jesse McCartney]].\n\n==Sequel series and film==\n{{Main|The Suite Life on Deck|The Suite Life Movie}}\n''The Suite Life on Deck'' is a sequel to ''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody'', that debuted on Disney Channel on September 26, 2008, set on a cruise ship with Zack, Cody, and London attending a semester-at-sea program, while Mr. Moseby manages the ship.

They are listed in the same order throughout the article for consistency. -->\n*[[Dylan and Cole Sprouse|Cole Sprouse]] portrays [[Cody Martin]], the calm, mature, and smarter twin. He is a \"straight [[Academic grading in North America#United States|A]]\" student (except for wood shop, in which he receives a C, but switches to taking it Pass/Fail), making him better, academically, than his brother Zack, who gets \"D's\". In the first season of the show, it was revealed that Cody is ten minutes younger than Zack.<ref name=agedifferenceproof>Suite Life on Deck episode: Bermuda Triangle \u2013 Cody says that he was born at 6:40, Zack says that he was born at 6:30</ref> Janice and Jessica seem to like Cody more (due to his sensitive nature). Cody has an on-again, off-again girlfriend named Barbara. Cody is the more gentle twin compared to his brother and somehow always gets talked into going along with Zack's schemes. In ''The Fairest of Them All'', he dressed as a girl to win money. He never drinks soda after 9:30 (unless he is at a bachelor party).\n*[[Dylan and Cole Sprouse|Dylan Sprouse]] portrays [[Zack Martin (Suite Life)|Zack Martin]], the self-centered, outgoing, immature twin, who usually dresses in skater and baggy-camo clothes. At school, he is a straight \"D\" student, although he does well in wood shop. In the first season of the show it was revealed that Zack is ten minutes older than Cody, as he was born at 6:30 and Cody at 6:40<ref name=\"agedifferenceproof\"/> which he uses against Cody, normally telling him, since he's older, to do some sort of job that he doesn't want to do. Or in some cases, gives him \"brotherly\" advice because, \"I'm the older twin.\" He has a big crush on Maddie, but after the first season, he was showing this less frequently. He has also taken advantage of his teachers and has faked conditions like dyslexia (in ''Smart and Smarterer'').\n*[[Brenda Song]] portrays [[London Tipton]], the only daughter of Wilfred Tipton, the owner of the Tipton Hotel. London is a rich, dimwitted teenager with her own private suite at the Tipton Hotel in Boston, complete with a large wardrobe with several divisions (each with their own talking mirror) and a kitchen. London loves fashion; she only wears designer clothes and hates plaid, especially the plaid Catholic school uniforms. She does not have a nanny, or any other adult, to help her but relies on the Tipton Hotel Staff for any assistance or guidance. In the episode ''Forever Plaid'', due to her poor attendance at her old school, she transferred to the same Catholic girls' school, \"Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow,\" that Maddie attends. In the episode ''First Day of High School'', London transfers to Zack and Cody's public school, \"Cheevers High,\" due to being expelled from all of the private schools she had previously attended. She dislikes her step-moms (previous and current) and usually talks to Mr. Moseby and Maddie about her problems. When happy she always claps her hands repeatedly while saying her catchphrase, \"Yay me!\" She also has her own web show called ''Yay Me! Starring London Tipton'' that exists both within the program and in the real world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/suitelife/yaymestarringlondontipton|title=Yay Me! Starring London Tipton|publisher=Disney|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref> London often refuses to go to school and even skipped detention twice. Though it seems like London may lead the ultimate rich-girl life, her childhood was not perfect. In the episode ''Arwinstein'', she states she is allergic to lobster, although in one episode she asked Maddie for a lobster dinner. However, it is possible that she developed an allergy to lobster after the earlier episodes and before the later ones. It is also revealed in one episode that she must think about what she does before doing it. For example, she was walking through the lobby while thinking \"left, right, blink, breathe\" in the episode ''Super Twins'' (although this was Zack's dream). London is a shopaholic who shops to fill the void of lack of attention from her father.\n*{{anchor|Maddie_Fitzpatrick}}[[Ashley Tisdale]] portrays Maddie Fitzpatrick, the teenage candy-counter girl at the Tipton Hotel, who throughout the series holds several other jobs/positions including a cashier at the Cluck Bucket, manager on the Camp Tipton Daycare Center, and counselor for her school's summer camp program \u2013 Camp Heaven on Earth. She also visits [[Antarctica]] during the series to help save the penguins. While she comes from a lower-class family, Maddie is very hard-working, outspoken, and intelligent. On the occasions that her selfish side comes out, she can be a bigger opportunist than London, though she always loses out when this side of her personality is shown. Like Esteban, it is shown she has an incredibly long name; in the episode \"Pilot Your Own Life,\" it is revealed to be Madeline Margaret Genevieve Miranda Catherine Fitzpatrick.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Pilot Your Own Life|episodelink=List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes#ep23|series=The Suite Life of Zack & Cody|network=[[Disney Channel]]|airdate=January 6, 2006|season=1|number=23|minutes=9:40}}</ref> She attends private school at \"Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow\" and later attends \"Cheevers High.\" Maddie is London's closest friend, though London often treats her like a servant, as in the episode ''Footloser'', usually bribing her with money. Maddie also babysat Zack and Cody throughout season one. Zack has a huge crush on her in Season One, however the crush is less visible during the other two seasons. She is a strong supporter of environmental causes. She is left-handed. It is revealed that she has [[asthma]]. She also plays volleyball as seen in the episode \"Volley Dad''. She appeared sporadically throughout Season 3.\n*[[Phill Lewis]] portrays [[Mr. Moseby|Mr. Marion Moseby]], the stern and uptight manager of the Tipton Hotel, who speaks with a large vocabulary and an urbane vernacular, and is often annoyed by Zack's and Cody's schemes.  It is later revealed that his first name is Marion and the majority of the other characters often made fun of his masculinity because of his feminine name, as well as his experience as a ballet dancer. His repeated catch phrases, \"Good luck with that\", \"Pish posh\" and \"If you'll excuse me\". have become his trademark. Though he acts as though he does not care about the boys, he actually has a great deal of affection for them. In the episode \"The Ghost of 613,\" it is revealed that he started out at the Tipton as a bellhop back in the 1970s, and had a \"voluminous 'fro\". Mr. Moseby is more of a father to London than her own, because Mr. Tipton is seldom around. Moseby even taught London how to walk, her ABCs, and tried to teach her how to drive. He cares for London and treats her like his own child. He also helps London with any problems she is having. He was also known as the \"Meanager,\" due to his stern persona. He has an older brother named Spencer, who is a little person (played by Dana Michael Woods), who is very wealthy and lactose intolerant. His mother's' name is Beulah Moseby, who favors Spencer, but still likes Marion. His grandmother is Rose Moseby (whom Phill Lewis also plays) who visits him in the episode \"Nugget of History\". He has a 16-year-old niece named Nia Moseby (played by [[Giovonnie Samuels]]) who comes to stay with him during the third season and temporarily replaces Maddie as candy counter girl, while she is in Antarctica.\n\n:A running gag of the series is that Mr. Moseby often makes a fool of himself in front of people (e.g.: hitting a baby doll that wouldn't stop crying against a chair when a woman with a baby walked by), or making a sarcastic comment about himself (that the customers think is true, and not sarcastic). Another running joke is that he often just barely catches a vase on the center table of the lobby from falling, although he fails to do that in the series' finale. In his schooling he was captain of the cheerleading squad; his experience with cheering comes in useful in a cheer-off. He also was a junior putt-putt champion and taught Zack how to succeed in playing mini-golf. Mr. Moseby also took ballet lessons and is a very good dancer. When he practiced and participated in Esteban's dance school, he was temporarily partnered with Carey, but found it hard to dance with her since she is much taller than he is, which all the other characters made fun of much to his dismay. He also takes advantage of Zack and Cody in some cases, like in the episode \"Heck's Kitchen\" he treats them with room service so they will find a food critic. He makes a brief appearance in the Disney Channel sitcom ''[[Jessie (2011 TV series)|Jessie]]'' where it is revealed that he now manages the Tipton Hotel in New York.\n\n*[[Kim Rhodes]] portrays [[Carey Martin]], the single working mother of Zack and Cody. She is the hotel's lounge singer, who sings beautifully. She and her sons traveled to several cities before arriving at the Boston Tipton Hotel, which she called the \"best gig we've ever had.\" She was married to Kurt Martin, but they divorced after the twins were born for unstated reasons. Arwin has made it known on several occasions that he has a massive crush on her (a crush that didn't wane during the series' course). Whenever Carey kisses Arwin, he faints. When Zack and Cody have an argument, she tells them stories about her ex-boyfriends, much to their dismay.\n\nThroughout the series' run, Brenda Song was absent for two episodes while Ashley Tisdale was absent from twelve episodes. All other main cast members appeared in all 87 episodes.\n\n===Recurring===\n {{Main|List of recurring characters in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody}}\nBelow is a list of cast members who have appeared in significant roles as [[recurring character]]s throughout the series.

Raven Baxter meets Zack and Cody as she visits the Tipton Hotel to do a photo shoot promoting a new fashion line for boys, only to have a troubling psychic vision of Cody. In the meantime, London refuses to wear one of Raven's original designs until Hannah Montana stops by and shows an interest in the fashions.\n\n==Settings==\n\n;Tipton Hotel\n[[The Tipton Hotel]] is where Zack, Cody, Carey, and London all live, and where the majority of the other characters in the series work. It is the main setting for the series. The Tipton Hotel is located in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. [[Hotel Vancouver]] is used for the exterior of the hotel.\n\n;The [[The Suite Life on Deck#SS Tipton|SS ''Tipton'']]\nIn the episode \"Let Us Entertain You\", Zack, Cody, and Carey spent a week vacationing on board the SS ''Tipton''. It is also the setting of the sequel series, ''The Suite Life on Deck''. The first time the SS ''Tipton'' is referenced is in the episode, \"To Catch a Thief\". While Maddie talks to London on the phone a life preserver with the words \"S.S. Tipton\" can be seen in the background.\n\n;Buckner Middle School<ref>Nurse Zack (Season 2, Episode 29)</ref>\nThe twins' Middle School. The school's mascot is a [[badger]].\n\nIn the scene outside of the school where a few students are walking between two buildings shows \"The Mall\" area that's located in [[Lincoln Park High School (Illinois)|Lincoln Park High School]], in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Some of the students that attend Buckner were Max, Bob, and Agnes. Carey would come sit outside of the detention area while Zack was being punished. She said when she was outside the principal's office at Cheevers High that, \"Thanks to Zack, I knitted 32 sweaters and an afghan.\"\n\nThe name comes from former-[[Boston Red Sox]] [[first baseman]] [[Bill Buckner]].\n\n;Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow [[Catholic schools in the United States|Catholic School]]\nMaddie and Mary Margaret ([[Monique Coleman]]) attended this private school in season one. Later in season two, Corrie ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]) and Leslie ([[Kaycee Stroh]]) were added to the minor cast, with London also attending the school in season two. In season three, London, Maddie, and Leslie no longer attend Our Lady. External shots of Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow Catholic School are of [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada.\n\n;Paul Revere Mini Mart\nZack and Cody work at the Paul Revere mini mart for the manager, Wayne Wormser. The mini mart's motto is, \"The savings are coming! The savings are coming!\" It is across the street from another mini mart with a patriotic name and theme, The Betsy Ross Stop and Shop, which is run by Wormser's business enemy and fierce rival.\n\n;Camp Heaven on Earth\nThe summer camp where Maddie works over the summer. The only part of the camp shown is the cabin in which Maddie and the young girls stay.\n\n;Cheevers High School\nWhere Zack, Cody, London, Maddie, and Nia attend along with other students including Barbara, Bob, and Mark. This setting was used in \"Lip Synchin' in the Rain,\" \"First Day of High School,\" \"Orchestra,\" and \"Benchwarmers.\" [[John Marshall High School (Los Angeles, California)]] is shown in a snapshot as Cheevers High School.\n\n;Other places in Boston\nScenes also take place in several other places in Boston, including [[Fenway Park]], a movie theater, Maddie's apartment, the local shopping mall, a bowling alley (The same bowling alley was used to film a scene from the [[Hannah Montana]] episode, \"People Who Use People\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/hannah-montana/people-who-use-people/episode/724978/summary.html|title=Hannah Montana Episode 18: People Who Use People|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref> a miniature golf course, Kurt's apartment, Mr. Moseby's condo, the Goose Lodge, Liberty Park, an apartment where Maddie and her friends painted for a poor family for community service, Arwin's apartment, camp Knock-a-Number, the forest that has Merele's cabin, Kurt's tour bus, the shop where Maddie demanded London give her inhaler, an art museum, a dance club, an alley with a garbage container, a pizza restaurant, Theo's home, the \"Risk It All\" studio, the Cluck Bucket, an aptitude company, and the restaurant where Wayne \"dates\" London. There are even two episodes that take place in Hollywood, which includes a movie studio, LAX, a beach, Sunset Blvd, Hollywood Blvd, and the Tipton Los Angeles.\n\n==Theme song and opening sequence==\nThe show's theme song, \"Here I Am,\" was written by John Adair and Steve Hampton (who also wrote the theme for the show's spinoff ''The Suite Life on Deck'', as well as for fellow Disney Channel series ''[[Phil of the Future]]'', ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', ''[[Sonny With a Chance]]'', ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'', ''[[Good Luck Charlie]]'', ''[[Shake It Up (U.S. TV series)|Shake It Up]]'', ''[[A.N.T.

The theme was remixed for the ending credits of \"Rock Star in the House\" in a form similar to \"[[Beautiful Soul (song)|Beautiful Soul]]\" to accompany the episode's guest appearance of [[Jesse McCartney]].\n\n==Sequel series and film==\n{{Main|The Suite Life on Deck|The Suite Life Movie}}\n''The Suite Life on Deck'' is a sequel to ''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody'', that debuted on Disney Channel on September 26, 2008, set on a cruise ship with Zack, Cody, and London attending a semester-at-sea program, while Mr. Moseby manages the ship.
