An ad in the ''[[Idaho Statesman]]'' newspaper touted Joe Albertson's first store as \"Idaho's largest and finest food store.\"  The store was filled with perks that, at the time, were brand new: free parking, a money-back guarantee, and even an ice cream shop.  The original store was built onto several times, but it was demolished in 1979 and a replacement store built on the same property.  A brick monument stands on the northwest corner of 16th and State Streets in downtown Boise, commemorating the original store.\n[[File:Albertson's cheese department, 1955.jpg|thumb|The cheese department of an Albertsons in Seattle (1955)]]\nJoe Albertson's grocery store was an enormous success, and he reinvested his profits back into the business.  New stores were opened in neighboring towns to the west, [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], [[Caldwell, Idaho|Caldwell]], and [[Emmett, Idaho|Emmett]], before [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] in late 1941.  The company grew steadily in the years following [[World War II]].  When Albertson was considering putting a new store in a town, he would drive around the town and look for neighborhoods with lots of children's clothing hanging on clotheslines; he knew that those kinds of neighborhoods were where he wanted to build his stores.\n\nAlbertsons, Inc. became a public company in 1959, and its growth continued, opening its 100th store in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] in 1964.  In 1966, Albertsons expanded to southern [[California]] by acquiring Greater All American Markets, a small chain in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].\n\n===Partnering with Skaggs===\n\nIn 1969, Albertsons partnered with [[Skaggs Drug Centers]], owned by [[Skaggs Companies|The Skaggs Companies, Inc.]], to create the first combination food/drug stores,<ref name=\"auto\"/> first in Texas. The partnership was a tremendous success for several years. The partnership ended due to the fact that it was getting more difficult to control. Neither partner could buy each other out, and the partnership was dissolved amicably in 1977. Skaggs kept stores in [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Arkansas]], and Albertsons kept stores in [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], and [[Louisiana]], as well as some [[Texas]] stores (based in San Antonio).<ref name=\"fundinguniverse.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/albertson-s-inc-history/|title=History of Albertson's, Inc.|website=Fundinguniverse.com}}</ref>\n\nAlbertsons continued to expand its base in the West during this time, buying Fazio's-Shopping Bag in 1972 from [[Fisher Foods]],<ref name=\"fundinguniverse.com\"/> adding 46 stores to the Los Angeles area. In 1974, Albertson's bought the 4-store Monte Mart chain in northern California.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Immigrant Voices: Discover Immigrant Stories from Angel Island| work = AIISFIV.org| accessdate = 2019-08-10| url = https://www.immigrant-voices.aiisf.org/stories-by-author/894-the-adventures-of-lit-ng/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Albertsons reorganized its management into four regions: California, Northwest, Intermountain, and South. The South stores included stores in Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida, as there were no stores between Louisiana and Florida. Albertsons continued to add stores in the 1980s, building or acquiring about 283 stores during the decade. Albertsons continued to expand in Texas beyond the Skaggs base in north Texas and San Antonio, entering the Dallas-Fort Worth market in 1984, and adding three [[Skaggs-Alpha Beta]] stores in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] within months after entering that market in early 1989 with the acquisition of six [[Tom Thumb (grocery store)|Tom Thumb]] stores.\n\n===Expansion in the 1990s===\nAlbertsons began to expand heavily in the 1990s.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In 1992, Albertsons bought the stores [[American Stores]] (formerly Skaggs Drugs Cos.) had in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Florida. Many of the stores had been opened as Skaggs Albertsons originally (later turning into \"Skaggs Alpha Beta\" under American Stores ownership) but by 1991 had been rebranded as [[Jewel-Osco]]. These included a few stores that American Stores opened in the late 1980s under that name in Florida. Additionally, a non-food distributions center in [[Ponca City, Oklahoma]], was purchased from ASC.\n\nThe Skaggs acquisition was a success, and the new stores were integrated into Albertsons' Southern division. The ease of that acquisition and Albertsons' high-flying stock price led Albertsons to attempt expansion on a grand scale. In a series of acquisitions in the late 1990s, Albertsons purchased [[Seessel's]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/113148777/|title=The Tennessean from Nashville, Tennessee on June 3, 1998 \u00b7 Page 35|website=Newspapers.com|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref> and 14 other stores from [[Bruno's]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/113461381/|title=The Tennessean from Nashville, Tennessee on August 25, 1998 \u00b7 Page 37|website=Newspapers.com|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref> [[Buttrey Food & Drug]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1998/09/ftc-negotiates-settlements-albertsonsbuttrey-merger-keep|title=FTC Negotiates Settlements in Albertson's/Buttrey Merger to Keep Supermarket Prices Competitive in Montana and Wyoming|date=September 22, 1998|website=Ftc.gov}}</ref> (divesting seven Buttrey stores and six Albertsons stores to [[Smith's Food and Drug|Smith's]] and another two  Buttrey stores to [[SuperValu (United States)|SuperValu]]), the Springfield, Missouri [[Smitty's (retailer)|Smitty's]] chain, and three Super One Foods stores from Miner's Inc. in the Des Moines market, all while building new stores across all divisions. These acquisitions brought Albertsons into five new states: Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, and Tennessee.<ref name=\"fundinguniverse.com\"/>\n\n===American Stores===\n[[File:Albertsons 4.JPG|thumb|right|A typical Albertsons in Boise, Idaho, in June 2007]]\n\nIn 1999, Albertsons made its biggest acquisition yet: [[American Stores Company]], which included the chains [[Acme Markets|ACME]] in [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]]; [[Lucky Stores|Lucky]] in [[California]] and [[Nevada]]; [[Jewel (supermarket)|Jewel]], [[Jewel-Osco]] in [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Iowa]]<!--removed Michigan, evidence shows J/O did have stores in Michigan but they closed prior to 1999-->, and two drug store chains: [[Osco Drug]] and [[Sav-on Drugs]]. The acquisition briefly made Albertsons the largest American food and drug operator, with over 2,500 stores (including stand-alone drug stores) in 37 states, until [[Kroger]]'s acquisition of [[Fred Meyer]] closed the following month.  To make the acquisition, Albertsons was forced by anti-trust concerns to sell 146 stores, primarily in [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[New Mexico]]. In southern California, there were already Albertsons, so in order to not have two banners in the same area, Lucky stores were converted to the Albertsons banner in November 1999, and the Lucky brand name was retired.\n\nIn January 2001, Albertsons restructured its \"districts\" to a divisional structure mostly based around distribution centers, with a drug store division and 18 regional division offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermarketnews.com/archive/albertsons-switching-divisional-structure|title=ALBERTSON'S SWITCHING TO DIVISIONAL STRUCTURE|date=January 22, 2001|work=supermarketnews.com}}</ref>\n\n===2001\u20132004 restructuring===\nOn July 18, 2001, Larry Johnston, the new chairman and CEO of Albertson's, announced it would close 165 \"underperforming\" stores spread across 25 states, cut jobs, and reduce its newly created operating divisions. The first change was that the Utah, Idaho, and Big Sky (Montana) division were merged back into Intermountain, while Oregon, Washington, and the Inland Empire (eastern Washington and Northern Idaho) division would be consolidated back into a single Northwestern division. Albertsons sold its freestanding Osco Drug stores in the northeastern states to [[Jean Coutu Group]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] drug store company (those stores were re-branded as [[Brooks Pharmacy]] after the sale was completed in January 2002).

Albertsons had held the third position at the time [[Kroger]] exited the market in mid-1993 when it closed its 15 area stores. Then, H-E-B's 37 area stores held a 43.2 percent market share, Kroger's 15 area stores a 13.7 percent share, and Albertsons' 10 stores a 13.1 percent share.

Many of the acquired chains had systems that did not mesh well with Albertsons. Financing those acquisitions required Albertsons Inc. to take on significant debt.  Added to those problems were significant changes in consumer buying patterns, including new competition from large discounters such as [[Walmart]] and [[Costco]] that impacted sales.\n\nAfter several assessments of the company and months of rumors it was announced on January 23, 2006, Albertsons, Inc. was to be sold to a consortium of companies. [[SuperValu (United States)|SuperValu]] would take the bulk of the company including the brand names and what was considered to be the stronger divisions, including the Albertsons divisions of Southern California, Northwest, and Intermountain, as well as the [[Acme Markets|ACME]], [[Shaw's Supermarkets]] and [[Star Market]], [[Bristol Farms]], and [[Jewel-Osco]] brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/95521/000119312506009695/dex991.htm|title=News Release dated January 23, 2006|website=Sec.gov}}</ref>\n\n[[CVS Health|CVS]] would acquire 702 stand-alone Osco and Sav-on Drug stores (closing about 100 of them) and converting them to CVS/pharmacy stores.\n\nWhat was left of Albertsons Inc. became Albertsons, LLC,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/95521/000119312506126085/d8k.htm|title=Current Report|website=Sec.gov}}</ref> purchased by a [[Cerberus Capital Management|Cerberus]]-led group of investors, and [[CVS Pharmacy]]. The acquisition was completed on June 2, 2006 with the Cerberus-led group (who also included [[Kimco Realty Corporation]], [[Schottenstein Stores Corp.]], Lubert-Adler Partners, and Klaff Realty). They held Albertsons LLC as \"AB Acquisition LLC\". Albertsons LLC included 661 stores and the distribution centers and offices from five of Albertsons divisions. These five divisions were thought to be Albertsons' five weakest divisions, and conventional wisdom in the industry was that the stores would eventually be closed or sold to other operators.\n\nAs of June 2, 2006, the company's retail stores were divided as follows:\n* SuperValu had acquired 1,124 stores in the deal, including:\n** ACME (134 locations)\n** ACME Express, Jewel Express, and Albertsons Express (107 fuel centers)\n** Albertsons (564 locations in Southern California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) \u2013 New Albertsons Inc.

Many CVS locations were close to Sav-on stores.

(the new name of AB Acquisition LLC). Albertsons attempted to IPO with the ticker ABS on October 14, 2015, planning to raise as much as $1.7 billion, selling 65.3 million shares with a range of $23 - $26 per share. However, the company postponed the listing due to market conditions, particularly after Wal-Mart warned of more challenged sales earlier that day. Albertsons has reportedly postponed the IPO indefinitely, as of October 2015.<ref name=\"albertsons.com\"/> All during this time, Albertsons continued to expand, purchasing 70 stores owned by the bankrupt [[Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company]] (operating under the names of [[The Food Emporium]], A&P, A&P Fresh, [[Superfresh]], and [[Pathmark]]), which were quickly reopened as [[ACME Markets|ACME]] stores after two-day store resets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://producenews.com/news-dep-menu/test-featured/16930-acme-stop-shop-reduce-a-p-purchases|title=ACME, Stop & Shop reduce A&P purchases|website=Producenews.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acmemarkets.com/2015/10/acme-getting-better-every-day/|title=ACME: Getting Better Every Day!|website=Acme|access-date=December 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923051003/http://www.acmemarkets.com/2015/10/acme-getting-better-every-day/|archive-date=September 23, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Safeway acquisitions===\n[[File:Weatherford May 2017 42 (Albertsons).jpg|thumb|Albertsons in [[Weatherford, Texas]] in May 2017]]\n\nAt the time of the Albertsons-Safeway merger, the 18-store Pacific Northwest chain [[Haggen]] purchased 146 West Coast Vons, Pavilions, Albertsons, and Safeway locations that had to be sold due to anti-trust concerns, paying $300 million, plus spending $100 million to rebrand the stores.

The drug store brands (used for health and beauty aids, over-the-counter medications, and intimate paper goods) were consolidated under the name \"Equaline\", rather than the previous \"Sav-On Osco by Albertsons\" brand.

An ad in the ''[[Idaho Statesman]]'' newspaper touted Joe Albertson's first store as \"Idaho's largest and finest food store.\"  The store was filled with perks that, at the time, were brand new: free parking, a money-back guarantee, and even an ice cream shop.  The original store was built onto several times, but it was demolished in 1979 and a replacement store built on the same property.  A brick monument stands on the northwest corner of 16th and State Streets in downtown Boise, commemorating the original store.\n[[File:Albertson's cheese department, 1955.jpg|thumb|The cheese department of an Albertsons in Seattle (1955)]]\nJoe Albertson's grocery store was an enormous success, and he reinvested his profits back into the business.  New stores were opened in neighboring towns to the west, [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], [[Caldwell, Idaho|Caldwell]], and [[Emmett, Idaho|Emmett]], before [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] in late 1941.  The company grew steadily in the years following [[World War II]].  When Albertson was considering putting a new store in a town, he would drive around the town and look for neighborhoods with lots of children's clothing hanging on clotheslines; he knew that those kinds of neighborhoods were where he wanted to build his stores.\n\nAlbertsons, Inc. became a public company in 1959, and its growth continued, opening its 100th store in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] in 1964.  In 1966, Albertsons expanded to southern [[California]] by acquiring Greater All American Markets, a small chain in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].\n\n===Partnering with Skaggs===\n\nIn 1969, Albertsons partnered with [[Skaggs Drug Centers]], owned by [[Skaggs Companies|The Skaggs Companies, Inc.]], to create the first combination food/drug stores,<ref name=\"auto\"/> first in Texas. The partnership was a tremendous success for several years. The partnership ended due to the fact that it was getting more difficult to control. Neither partner could buy each other out, and the partnership was dissolved amicably in 1977. Skaggs kept stores in [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Arkansas]], and Albertsons kept stores in [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], and [[Louisiana]], as well as some [[Texas]] stores (based in San Antonio).<ref name=\"fundinguniverse.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/albertson-s-inc-history/|title=History of Albertson's, Inc.|website=Fundinguniverse.com}}</ref>\n\nAlbertsons continued to expand its base in the West during this time, buying Fazio's-Shopping Bag in 1972 from [[Fisher Foods]],<ref name=\"fundinguniverse.com\"/> adding 46 stores to the Los Angeles area. In 1974, Albertson's bought the 4-store Monte Mart chain in northern California.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Immigrant Voices: Discover Immigrant Stories from Angel Island| work = AIISFIV.org| accessdate = 2019-08-10| url = https://www.immigrant-voices.aiisf.org/stories-by-author/894-the-adventures-of-lit-ng/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Albertsons reorganized its management into four regions: California, Northwest, Intermountain, and South. The South stores included stores in Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida, as there were no stores between Louisiana and Florida. Albertsons continued to add stores in the 1980s, building or acquiring about 283 stores during the decade. Albertsons continued to expand in Texas beyond the Skaggs base in north Texas and San Antonio, entering the Dallas-Fort Worth market in 1984, and adding three [[Skaggs-Alpha Beta]] stores in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] within months after entering that market in early 1989 with the acquisition of six [[Tom Thumb (grocery store)|Tom Thumb]] stores.\n\n===Expansion in the 1990s===\nAlbertsons began to expand heavily in the 1990s.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In 1992, Albertsons bought the stores [[American Stores]] (formerly Skaggs Drugs Cos.) had in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Florida. Many of the stores had been opened as Skaggs Albertsons originally (later turning into \"Skaggs Alpha Beta\" under American Stores ownership) but by 1991 had been rebranded as [[Jewel-Osco]]. These included a few stores that American Stores opened in the late 1980s under that name in Florida. Additionally, a non-food distributions center in [[Ponca City, Oklahoma]], was purchased from ASC.\n\nThe Skaggs acquisition was a success, and the new stores were integrated into Albertsons' Southern division. The ease of that acquisition and Albertsons' high-flying stock price led Albertsons to attempt expansion on a grand scale. In a series of acquisitions in the late 1990s, Albertsons purchased [[Seessel's]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/113148777/|title=The Tennessean from Nashville, Tennessee on June 3, 1998 \u00b7 Page 35|website=Newspapers.com|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref> and 14 other stores from [[Bruno's]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/113461381/|title=The Tennessean from Nashville, Tennessee on August 25, 1998 \u00b7 Page 37|website=Newspapers.com|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref> [[Buttrey Food & Drug]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1998/09/ftc-negotiates-settlements-albertsonsbuttrey-merger-keep|title=FTC Negotiates Settlements in Albertson's/Buttrey Merger to Keep Supermarket Prices Competitive in Montana and Wyoming|date=September 22, 1998|website=Ftc.gov}}</ref> (divesting seven Buttrey stores and six Albertsons stores to [[Smith's Food and Drug|Smith's]] and another two  Buttrey stores to [[SuperValu (United States)|SuperValu]]), the Springfield, Missouri [[Smitty's (retailer)|Smitty's]] chain, and three Super One Foods stores from Miner's Inc. in the Des Moines market, all while building new stores across all divisions. These acquisitions brought Albertsons into five new states: Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, and Tennessee.<ref name=\"fundinguniverse.com\"/>\n\n===American Stores===\n[[File:Albertsons 4.JPG|thumb|right|A typical Albertsons in Boise, Idaho, in June 2007]]\n\nIn 1999, Albertsons made its biggest acquisition yet: [[American Stores Company]], which included the chains [[Acme Markets|ACME]] in [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]]; [[Lucky Stores|Lucky]] in [[California]] and [[Nevada]]; [[Jewel (supermarket)|Jewel]], [[Jewel-Osco]] in [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Iowa]]<!--removed Michigan, evidence shows J/O did have stores in Michigan but they closed prior to 1999-->, and two drug store chains: [[Osco Drug]] and [[Sav-on Drugs]]. The acquisition briefly made Albertsons the largest American food and drug operator, with over 2,500 stores (including stand-alone drug stores) in 37 states, until [[Kroger]]'s acquisition of [[Fred Meyer]] closed the following month.  To make the acquisition, Albertsons was forced by anti-trust concerns to sell 146 stores, primarily in [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[New Mexico]]. In southern California, there were already Albertsons, so in order to not have two banners in the same area, Lucky stores were converted to the Albertsons banner in November 1999, and the Lucky brand name was retired.\n\nIn January 2001, Albertsons restructured its \"districts\" to a divisional structure mostly based around distribution centers, with a drug store division and 18 regional division offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermarketnews.com/archive/albertsons-switching-divisional-structure|title=ALBERTSON'S SWITCHING TO DIVISIONAL STRUCTURE|date=January 22, 2001|work=supermarketnews.com}}</ref>\n\n===2001\u20132004 restructuring===\nOn July 18, 2001, Larry Johnston, the new chairman and CEO of Albertson's, announced it would close 165 \"underperforming\" stores spread across 25 states, cut jobs, and reduce its newly created operating divisions. The first change was that the Utah, Idaho, and Big Sky (Montana) division were merged back into Intermountain, while Oregon, Washington, and the Inland Empire (eastern Washington and Northern Idaho) division would be consolidated back into a single Northwestern division. Albertsons sold its freestanding Osco Drug stores in the northeastern states to [[Jean Coutu Group]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] drug store company (those stores were re-branded as [[Brooks Pharmacy]] after the sale was completed in January 2002).

Albertsons had held the third position at the time [[Kroger]] exited the market in mid-1993 when it closed its 15 area stores. Then, H-E-B's 37 area stores held a 43.2 percent market share, Kroger's 15 area stores a 13.7 percent share, and Albertsons' 10 stores a 13.1 percent share.

Many of the acquired chains had systems that did not mesh well with Albertsons. Financing those acquisitions required Albertsons Inc. to take on significant debt.  Added to those problems were significant changes in consumer buying patterns, including new competition from large discounters such as [[Walmart]] and [[Costco]] that impacted sales.\n\nAfter several assessments of the company and months of rumors it was announced on January 23, 2006, Albertsons, Inc. was to be sold to a consortium of companies. [[SuperValu (United States)|SuperValu]] would take the bulk of the company including the brand names and what was considered to be the stronger divisions, including the Albertsons divisions of Southern California, Northwest, and Intermountain, as well as the [[Acme Markets|ACME]], [[Shaw's Supermarkets]] and [[Star Market]], [[Bristol Farms]], and [[Jewel-Osco]] brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/95521/000119312506009695/dex991.htm|title=News Release dated January 23, 2006|website=Sec.gov}}</ref>\n\n[[CVS Health|CVS]] would acquire 702 stand-alone Osco and Sav-on Drug stores (closing about 100 of them) and converting them to CVS/pharmacy stores.\n\nWhat was left of Albertsons Inc. became Albertsons, LLC,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/95521/000119312506126085/d8k.htm|title=Current Report|website=Sec.gov}}</ref> purchased by a [[Cerberus Capital Management|Cerberus]]-led group of investors, and [[CVS Pharmacy]]. The acquisition was completed on June 2, 2006 with the Cerberus-led group (who also included [[Kimco Realty Corporation]], [[Schottenstein Stores Corp.]], Lubert-Adler Partners, and Klaff Realty). They held Albertsons LLC as \"AB Acquisition LLC\". Albertsons LLC included 661 stores and the distribution centers and offices from five of Albertsons divisions. These five divisions were thought to be Albertsons' five weakest divisions, and conventional wisdom in the industry was that the stores would eventually be closed or sold to other operators.\n\nAs of June 2, 2006, the company's retail stores were divided as follows:\n* SuperValu had acquired 1,124 stores in the deal, including:\n** ACME (134 locations)\n** ACME Express, Jewel Express, and Albertsons Express (107 fuel centers)\n** Albertsons (564 locations in Southern California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) \u2013 New Albertsons Inc.

Many CVS locations were close to Sav-on stores. CVS also acquired one distribution center.\n* The Cerberus-led Albertsons LLC retained:\n** Albertsons (655 locations in Arizona, Northern California, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming \u2013 Albertsons LLC)\n** County Line Liquors (1 location)\n** Grocery Warehouse (1 location)\n** Jewel-Osco (2 locations)\n** Max Foods (2 locations)\n** Super Saver Foods (23 locations, 21 closed in late 2006)\n\nFollowing the sale, Albertson's, Inc., was removed from the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]].

Albertson's LLC has concentrated on rebuilding market share and its store base in its strongest areas, and divesting stores and other property in its weaker areas.\n\nOn June 6, 2006, only one week after Albertsons LLC was created, the company announced its intent to close 100 Albertsons stores by August 2006.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150904052951/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060608/ai_n16483143?tag=rel.res1 Albertsons to close 100 of its stores] ''Deseret News'' (Salt Lake City), June 8, 2006.</ref> Those closures were spread across all five divisions.

Other Albertsons brands over the years have included ''A+'', ''Good Day'', ''Janet Lee'' (named after the executive vice-president's daughter), ''Master's Choice'', and ''Village Market''. The drug store brands (used for health and beauty aids, over-the-counter medications, and intimate paper goods) were consolidated under the name \"Equaline\", rather than the previous \"Sav-On Osco by Albertsons\" brand. Albertsons introduced an upscale private label brand, \"Essensia\", in 2003, which was later renamed by SuperValu as Culinary Circle.\n\nStore brand items in Albertsons stores included Albertsons (national brand quality food), Arctic Shores (frozen seafood), Baby Basics (diapers and infant care items), Culinary Circle (\"gourmet\" foods and ready-made meals), Equaline (health and beauty products), Farm Fresh (fresh produce), Flavorite (national brand quality foods, used throughout Supervalu stores), Homelife (national brand quality non-foods), Java Delight (coffee), Shoppers Value (value priced items), Stockman & Dakota (high-quality beef), Stone Ridge (ice cream and sherbet), Super Chill (soft drinks and mixers), Whole Care Pet (pet foods and supplies), and Wild Harvest (natural and organic foods). In 2011, SuperValu announced it would eliminate Flavorite and all brands named after the chains it operates (such as Albertsons, Jewel, Shaw's, etc.) and would replace those labels with a new label, Essential Everyday.\n\nAfter its purchase of Safeway, Albertsons began replacing some of its brands with Safeway's. O Organics and Open Nature replaced Wild Harvest, Pantry Essentials replaced Shoppers Value, and Refreshe replaced Super Chill. By late 2015, the remaining store brands were replaced with \"Signature\" (formerly Safeway Care, Farms, Home, and Kitchens). Albertsons started selling Lucerne dairy products, Mom To Mom baby products, and Priority Pet Food as well.\n\nAlbertsons Companies line of Own Brands <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/about-us/ourbusiness.html|title=Our Business|website=albertsonscompanies.com|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref> products launches 1,100 brand new items a year, making it one of the most diverse in-house brands in the country.

It is not certain exactly when the myth originated, but in 1900 Oscar Kuhns published ''The Germans and Swiss settlements of colonial Pennsylvania: a study of the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch''. In it he stated the Bushongs were French [[Huguenot]]s and their name was originally Beauchamp...\n{{quote|\"These German names almost all came from the Palatinate and Switzerland. Even today we can trace the Swiss origin of many-for instance, Urner (from Uri), Johns (Tschantz), Neagley (Naegeli), Bossler (Baseler). Some are of French Huguenot origin, which by combined German and English influence have often received a not very elegant or euphonious form: examples are Lemon (Le Mon), Bushong (Beauchamp)\".}}\n\nRev. A. Stapleton published this book in 1901-\n''\"Memorials of the Huguenots in America, with special reference to their emigration to Pennsylvania\"''\n\n{{quote|\"Beauchamp, \u2014 In 1731 arrived; Beauchamp and wife Barbara, the head of the \"Bushong\" family, now so numorous in America. He located in East Lampeter, near the Heller Church. He was born in France in 1692. His son Jacob located in Berks\ncounty and was the head of the Bushong family of Berks county, while another son, Peter, emigrated to the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, and founded the Southern branch.\"}}\n\n===Multiple lines of colonial Bushongs immigrated===\n\nOne theory fostered by some, was that there were numerous different lines of Bushongs entering Colonial America, some with different spellings. To date there is no evidence to support this theory and to the contrary, thousands of Bushong descendants are listed as descendants of Hans Boschung and Johann Nicholas Boschung's son, Andreas. With a charting project for the entire Bushong [[1930 United States Census]] completed and most identified, it makes multiple lines that much more improbable.<ref>[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/bushong/2012-01/1326559349 The 1930 Census for all Bushongs is Charted!]</ref>\n\n===Bosang descend from Bushong===\n\nThis myth was first mentioned in the late 1980s or early 1990s by several Bushong researchers, who perceived a similarity between the surnames ''Bosang'' and Bushong. It was suggested that David Bosang, whose name was spelled ''Bosseng'' before it was Anglicized, had been a Bushong in Europe prior to leaving. Though lacking any European documentation, the myth gained a degree of legitimacy through repeated publishing of Bosang's United States documentation mixed with the Bushong name.  It is probable that Bosseng is a variant spelling of the surname ''[[Bossong]]''.\n\n==Some notable people, places, and businesses==\n\n*[[Dr. Lee C.

It is not certain exactly when the myth originated, but in 1900 Oscar Kuhns published ''The Germans and Swiss settlements of colonial Pennsylvania: a study of the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch''. In it he stated the Bushongs were French [[Huguenot]]s and their name was originally Beauchamp...\n{{quote|\"These German names almost all came from the Palatinate and Switzerland. Even today we can trace the Swiss origin of many-for instance, Urner (from Uri), Johns (Tschantz), Neagley (Naegeli), Bossler (Baseler). Some are of French Huguenot origin, which by combined German and English influence have often received a not very elegant or euphonious form: examples are Lemon (Le Mon), Bushong (Beauchamp)\".}}\n\nRev. A. Stapleton published this book in 1901-\n''\"Memorials of the Huguenots in America, with special reference to their emigration to Pennsylvania\"''\n\n{{quote|\"Beauchamp, \u2014 In 1731 arrived; Beauchamp and wife Barbara, the head of the \"Bushong\" family, now so numorous in America. He located in East Lampeter, near the Heller Church. He was born in France in 1692. His son Jacob located in Berks\ncounty and was the head of the Bushong family of Berks county, while another son, Peter, emigrated to the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, and founded the Southern branch.\"}}\n\n===Multiple lines of colonial Bushongs immigrated===\n\nOne theory fostered by some, was that there were numerous different lines of Bushongs entering Colonial America, some with different spellings. To date there is no evidence to support this theory and to the contrary, thousands of Bushong descendants are listed as descendants of Hans Boschung and Johann Nicholas Boschung's son, Andreas. With a charting project for the entire Bushong [[1930 United States Census]] completed and most identified, it makes multiple lines that much more improbable.<ref>[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/bushong/2012-01/1326559349 The 1930 Census for all Bushongs is Charted!]</ref>\n\n===Bosang descend from Bushong===\n\nThis myth was first mentioned in the late 1980s or early 1990s by several Bushong researchers, who perceived a similarity between the surnames ''Bosang'' and Bushong. It was suggested that David Bosang, whose name was spelled ''Bosseng'' before it was Anglicized, had been a Bushong in Europe prior to leaving. Though lacking any European documentation, the myth gained a degree of legitimacy through repeated publishing of Bosang's United States documentation mixed with the Bushong name.  It is probable that Bosseng is a variant spelling of the surname ''[[Bossong]]''.\n\n==Some notable people, places, and businesses==\n\n*[[Dr. Lee C.

One winter, under the juniper tree in the courtyard, the wife peels an apple. She cuts her finger and drops of blood fall onto the snow. This leads her to wish for a child to be as white as snow and as red as blood. Six months later, the wife becomes gravely ill from eating juniper berries and asks her husband to bury her beneath the juniper tree if she dies. A month later, she gives birth to a baby boy as white as snow and as red as blood. She dies of happiness. Keeping his promise, the husband buries her beneath the juniper tree. He eventually marries again and he and his new wife have a daughter named Marlinchen (in some versions Marlene, Marjory or Ann Marie).\n\nThe new wife loves Marlinchen but despises her stepson. She abuses him every day, claiming that she wishes Marlinchen to inherit her father's wealth instead of her stepson. One afternoon after school, the stepmother plans to lure her stepson into an empty room containing a chest of apples. Marlinchen sees the chest and asks for an apple, which the stepmother gracefully offers. However, when the boy enters the room and reaches down the chest for an apple, the stepmother slams the lid onto his neck, decapitating him. The stepmother bounds his head with the rest of his body with a bandage and props his body onto a chair outside, with an apple on his lap. Marlinchen, unaware of the situation, asks her stepbrother for an apple. Hearing no response, she is forced by her mother to box him in the ear, causing his head to roll onto the ground. Marlinchen profusely cries throughout the day whilst the stepmother dismembers the stepson's body and cooks him into a \"blood-soup\" (Black Puddings Sauer/Suur) for dinner. She later deceives her husband by telling him that his son stayed at the mother's great uncle's house. The husband unwittingly eats the \"blood-soup\" (Black puddings/Sauer/Suur) during dinner and proclaims it to be delicious. Marlinchen gathers the bones from the dinner and buries them beneath the juniper tree with a handkerchief.\n\nSuddenly, a mist emerges from the juniper tree and a beautiful bird flies out. The bird visits the local townspeople and sings about its brutal murder at the hands of its stepmother. Captivated by its lullaby, a goldsmith, a shoemaker and a miller offer the bird a gold chain, a pair of red shoes and a millstone in return for the bird singing its song again. The bird returns home to give the gold chain to the husband while giving Marlinchen the red shoes. Meanwhile, the stepmother complains about the \u201craging fires within her arteries\u201d, revealed to be the real cause of her anger and hatred towards her stepson. She goes outside for relief but the bird drops the millstone onto her head, killing her instantly. Surrounded by smoke and flames, the son, revealed to be the bird, emerges and reunites with his family. They celebrate and head inside for lunch, and live happily ever after.\n\n==Characters==\nNone of the characters in ''The Juniper Tree'' have names except for Marlinchen. Instead, they are referred to by their relationship to one another or by their occupation. They are listed below in order of importance.\n\n=== The Boy ===\nArguably the protagonist of the story, he is the child of the father and the father's first wife who is also Marlinchen's stepbrother (or in other versions, her half-brother). He was often afraid to return home from school since he would routinely be cruelly abused and beaten by his stepmother, making him cry to sleep every night. Eventually, he is decapitated by his stepmother and his flesh is dismembered, his blood drained and his body and blood are cooked into \"Black Puddings/Blood-Soup\". The boy eventually reincarnates into a beautiful bird and kills the stepmother in revenge and reverts to his original human self by the end of the story.\n\n=== The Stepmother ===\nPerceived as the antagonist of the story, she is the second wife of the father and the mother of Marlinchen. She is a disturbed and insane individual who is often clouded with evil thoughts and she often blames this on the \"raging fires in her veins\". However, she attempts to rationalize her evil nature by stating that her stepson would inherit his father's wealth instead of Marlinchen. In some versions, it is mentioned that evil spirits often influenced the stepmother in committing evil deeds against her stepson and she is often thought to be possessed by the [[Devil]] himself.\n\n=== Marlinchen ===\nIn some versions she is called Marlene, Marjory or Ann Marie. She is the daughter of stepmother. She is treated kindly by the stepmother in comparison to her stepbrother. She often cares for her stepbrother in spite of the abuse. When she discovers her stepbrother's corpse, Marlinchen initially presumes that he is ignoring her requests of giving her an apple and under the instruction of her stepmother, she boxes him in the ear. She becomes horrified of causing her stepbrother's head to fall off and cries frantically many times throughout the story, especially when the stepmother cooks the stepson into a stew. She eventually buries the bones of her stepbrother beneath the juniper tree. Marlinchen is a [[static character]] throughout the story but becomes more emotional and tearful, especially after the murder of her stepbrother.\n\n=== The Father ===\nThe son's father, the stepmother's husband, the husband of the first wife and Marlinchen's stepfather. He is a wealthy and pious man but he is often absent at home, which probably explains why the stepmother could get away with her abuse towards his son. He was also unaware that the blood-soup/black pudding he consumed was actually made from his son's blood and body. The father is a static character in this work.\n\n=== The Goldsmith, the Shoemaker and the Miller ===\nThree residents of an unnamed town that is located near the house where the main characters reside. They are captivated by the bird's lullaby who sings about a horrific fate similar to the one suffered by the son. As a reward, for the bird singing its song again they offer the bird a gold chain, a pair of red shoes and a millstone respectively in return. Considered minor characters in this work.\n\n=== The First Wife ===\nThe son's biological mother and the original wife of the father. Like her husband, she is wealthy and pious and often prays in hopes of getting a child. She dies at the beginning of the story after being extremely ecstatic over the sight of her newborn son and is buried beneath the juniper tree.\n\n==Motifs==\nThere are many themes, such as cannibalism, death, and food, that play an important role in the short story, ''The Juniper Tree.'' These overall themes are listed below.\n\n=== Cannibalism ===\nSome argue that ''The Juniper Tree'' draws cues from the short story ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]''. Following the death of the main character, the mother (in an attempt to cover up his death) literally \"chopped him in pieces, put him into the pan and... [cooked him up in blood-soup/black puddings].<ref name=\":0\" /> The husband then eats the blood-soup/black pudding, saying how \u201cdelicious [the] food is,\" and even asks for the wife to \"give [him] some more.\u201d <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Parallel between food and death ===\nIt is quite clear by the end of the tale that food is associated with death. At the beginning of the short story, the first wife is cutting an apple when she cuts her fingers and \"blood [falls to] the snow.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> An apple later is even referred to as ushering in the Devil when the little boy comes home and the Devil figuratively makes the mother say to him, \"My son, wilt thou have an apple?\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> You could even look to the son as a source of death when he is turned into stew. Finally, a millstone is used to kill the mother. A millstone<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/millstone|title=millstone - definition of millstone in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-20}}</ref> is a tool typically used to grind corn.\n\n=== Guardianship ===\nCritics suggest that the character of the mother in \"The Juniper Tree\" is used to represent a guardian spirit. This theme of guardianship is shown throughout other Grimm fairy tales such as [[Cinderella]], [[Sleeping Beauty|Briar Rose]], and [[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarves]]. In all of these stories, there is some object (normally represented through nature) that watches after the main character. In the case of \"Briar Rose,\" \"the briar hedge is the symbol of nature guarding her rose: the princess who sleeps inside the castle.\" <ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3813902 |jstor=3813902 |title=A Literary Approach to the Brothers Grimm |journal=Journal of the Folklore Institute |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=180\u2013196 |last1=David |first1=Alfred |last2=David |first2=Mary Elizabeth |year=1964 }}</ref>\n\n=== Gift giving ===\nWhen the son becomes a bird, he requests gifts such as a gold chain from a goldsmith and a pair of shoes for his sister. In addition, he asks for a millstone from a group of millers, which he drops on the wife's head leading to her swift death. Critics argue that while the chain may represent power (to leave the wife), the shoes may also allude to freedom.\n\n=== Song ===\nSong is a symbolic motif in that it served as a vessel to expose the son's wrongful death. The bird sang this song to different townspeople in order to get gifts that he will later bestow on his sister and father after they heard the bird sing as well. This song fueled the personification of a bird, which naturally does not have the ability to communicate words to humans.\n\nThe song went like this:\n\n'''Lyrics'''\n\n\"My mother she killed me,\n\nMy father he ate me,\n\nMy sister, little Marlinchen,\n\nGathered together all my bones,\n\nTied them in a silken handkerchief,\n\nLaid them beneath the juniper-tree,\n\nKywitt, kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Child abuse ===\nChild abuse is a prevalent theme shown through the stepmother constantly abusing her stepson and eventually murdering him. This theme, along with cruel oppression, is a recurring theme in the works of the Brothers Grimm. such as [[The Frog Prince]] and [[Rapunzel]]. Critic Jack Zipes suggests that the theme of child abuse leads to a more adult centered story. This veers away from the more accepted thought that fairy tales are meant for children.<ref name=\"renamed_from_19_on_20161207074816\">{{cite journal |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=2000 |title=The Contamination of the Fairy Tale, or The Changing Nature of the Grimms' Fairy Tales |jstor=43308420 |journal=Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=77\u201393 }}</ref>\n\n===Personification of the Devil===\nThe devil makes an appearance in many Grimms' tales, often in \u201cvarious disguises.\u201d<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=CARSCH|first=HENRY|date=1968-01-01|title=THE ROLE OF THE DEVIL IN GRIMMS' TALES: AN EXPLORATION OF THE CONTENT AND FUNCTION OF POPULAR TALES|jstor=40969921|journal=Social Research|volume=35|issue=3|pages=466\u2013499}}</ref> He takes many identities including anything from a \u201clittle man,\u201d to an \u201cold goat.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" />  The stepmother's deep disgust and violent tendencies towards the stepson play right into the mindset that she may be an offshoot of the devil himself. The stepmother offering the stepson an apple before brutally killing him and manipulating her daughter's innocence to cover up the murder is also a direct allusion to the [[Fall of man|biblical temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden]].  Near the end, the stepmother experiences \"raging fires\" within her veins, symbolising the weight of her sins and possibly the [[damnation]] of her soul. It is even described at one point during the story that the Devil (who is referred as the Evil One in most adaptions) has [[Demonic possession|gone into her mind]] before her villainous breakdown.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Religion ===\nReligion plays a major symbolic role in the story. Devotion to God was often associated with purity and innocence, as shown through the boy's biological parents and presumably, the boy himself and Marlinchen. The boy reincarnating into the bird and killing the stepmother with the millstone out of revenge can also symbolize the [[Holy Spirit]], who is often depicted as a white [[dove]], executing divine judgement upon the wicked. The story also takes place \"well on two thousand years ago\" placing it firmly in Biblical times. In most English language translations, the dish/cooking method that is described in the text is translated as \"stew\" or as in Margaret Hunt's 1884 translation as \"black puddings.\" What is important here is that the body and the blood of the boy are cooked and consumed by the father. What is missing in most English language translations in the word \"stew\" is that the blood of the boy is also cooked and eaten. The symoblism in relation to the Eucharist - eating the body and drinking the blood of Christ - then become unmistakable.\n\n=== Reincarnation ===\n\"In fairy tales the cycle of human life is intimately related to the cycle of nature.\" <ref name=\":5\"/> \nParticularly seen in the Grimm Brother's \"The Juniper Tree,\" reincarnation plays a major role in the tale. The audience first sees reincarnation when the first wife asks to be buried under the juniper tree. Although the mother never truly comes back to life, her spirit appears to have supernatural influence over the juniper tree, which allows her son to be physically reincarnated, as a bird and as his originally physical form, at the end of the story.\n\n== Theory of Grimm ==\nEach Grimm tale follows a predetermined and categorical format. Every tale is based on the idea that each character is born with fault.  For example, if a child is \u201cloved by his parents, he is hated by a brother or sister.\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Marthe|last2=Powell|first2=Wyley L.|date=1969-01-01|title=The Grimm Brothers|jstor=2929635|journal=Yale French Studies|issue=43|pages=44\u201356|doi=10.2307/2929635}}</ref> Another example could include a child \u201csurrounded by affection.\u201d Using the Grimm theory, the child then must be \u201cpursued by an offense committed prior to his birth, generally by one of his family.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> It is this format that pushes a \"coming of character moment\" where the main character (in order to survive) \u201cset[s] out on a road strew with pitfalls, pursued by an evil willpower, as if distance itself could not take him away from the fatality of [his or her] family.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Transformative bodies in Grimm ===\nContinuous throughout each of the Grimm tales are the reappearance of transformative bodies. Critic Jeana Jorgensen, argues that there is a connection between the physical transformation of characters and their genders.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |doi=10.13110/marvelstales.28.1.0127 |url=https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/marvels/vol28/iss1/9 |title=Quantifying the Grimm Corpus: Transgressive and Transformative Bodies in the Grimms' Fairy Tales |journal=Marvels & Tales |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=127 |date=2014-05-21 |last1=Jorgensen |first1=Jeana }}</ref> Drawing a connection between beauty ideals consistently being a major factor in female character development to Grimm, while transformations playing a significant role in the development of mostly male characters. She concludes that female characters are usually described with a focus on their physical attributes such as small, petite, wicked, beautiful, and ugly compared to the adjectives used in male transformations that overall relate strictly to age and size. Specifically, in ''The Juniper Tree'', Jorgensen uses Miriam's depiction of sorrow as a representation of the fact that in several of Grimm's tales \"suffering is written on women\u2019s bodies in a way that naturalizes their pain and almost leads us to expect women to cry in fairy tales.\" <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Fantasy and magic in Grimm ===\nFor the Grimm Brother's audience \"the fantasy and magic of the story can be interpreted as instruments to establish or restore social and economic justice.\"<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/376915 |jstor=376915 |title=The Fairy Tale: An Introduction to Literature and the Creative Process |journal=College English |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=31\u201345 |last1=Markman |first1=Roberta Hoffman |year=1983 }}</ref> Roberta Markman believes that this is the case among all of the Grimm fairy tales because the creative process' \"transformative power[s]\" can change social norms. As a result, literature and other creative art forms have the power to change someone's personal attitude regarding their economic and social situations. This is especially prevalent in Grimm fairy tales where normally the character's social and economic situation is poor at best. For example, in the Grimm's [[Cinderella]], Cinderella's social situation is contingent upon her servitude to her stepmother. As an audience member, when one reads this they are reminded of how good their social situation is in comparison.\n\n=== Family conflict in Grimm ===\nThere is an apparent parallel between Grimm's ''The Juniper Tree'' and his previous works, familial drama. Critic Walter Scherf in a study of the introductions of children's literature, noted that out of 176 texts, 169 of them started with a basic family conflict.<ref name=\":6\" /> Similar to the plot in Juniper Tree, in Grimm's ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', the children live with their stepmother who does not like them, and makes a plan to get rid of them. She states that in the morning she and her husband will take the children into the thickest part of the forest and leave them there, with the intention that they won't be able to find their way back, and end up starving to death.<ref>Segal, Lore and Randall Jerrell. \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d. ''The Juniper Tree and Other Tales from Grimm''. 2nd ed, Douglas and McIntyre, 2003, pp. 154-170.</ref> In comparison to the Stepmother in ''The Juniper Tree'' who wanted her daughter to inherit everything from the Father, killing the Son in order to guarantee this possibility.\n\n== Original translation and background ==\nIt is important to remember that the Juniper tree is not only the title of the collection, but also a piece of prose within the book. More importantly, the collection of short stories were not written by the Grimm brothers, but instead collected from \u201cvarious sources\u2026 many of which were the original authors.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blind|first=Karl|date=1888-01-01|title=A GRIMM'S TALE IN A SHETLAND FOLKLORE VERSION|jstor=24708733|journal=The Archaeological Review|volume=1|issue=5|pages=346\u2013352}}</ref> In total, there are twenty-seven short stories spanning three hundred and thirty-three pages. The Grimm brothers also used illustrations to add to the overall work. According to Grimm, the \"illustrations [used are] delicate in detail, imaginative in concept, and truly beautiful.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> They actually stole it from the Indigenous people. White people think they invented everything\nSad\n\n== Commentary ==\nAcademic discourse is an important part of understanding any sort of text.{{Opinion|date=March 2020}} The Brothers Grimm's \"Juniper Tree\" is no different. Listed below, in alphabetical order, are some examples of commentary written by academic scholars regarding this fairy tale. This represents their individual opinions regarding ''The Juniper Tree''.\n\n=== Alfred and Mary Elizabeth David === \nIn Alfred and Elizabeth David's essay, they interpret \"The Juniper Tree\" as \"folk literature for inspiration.\" They believe that the nature and native culture presented in most Grimm fairy tale inspires other artists in their literary endeavors <ref name=\":5\"/> In \"The Juniper Tree,\" this theme of nature is present. The Grimm Brothers use the juniper tree as a life source for the mother and the son. The use of nature as a life source inspired other literary work such as \"Briar Rose\".\n\n=== Maria Tatar === \nMany folklorists interpret evil stepmothers as stemming from actual competition between a woman and her stepchildren for resources.  In this tale, the motive is made explicit:  the stepmother wants her daughter to inherit everything.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 161, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[millstone]] in the story would have had biblical connotations for the readers of the Grimms' days, especially as the verse Luke 17:2 says that anyone who causes a child to sin would be better off being thrown into the sea with a millstone about his neck; both refer to a millstone as a punishment for those who harm the young and innocent.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''Off with Their Heads!'' p. 213 {{ISBN|0-691-06943-3}}</ref> Another biblical connotation could be the offering of the apple from the stepmother, possessed by the devil, to the son, which parallels the devil, disguised as a serpent, offering the forbidden fruit (traditionally an apple) to Eve.\n\n=== J. R .R Tolkien === \nIn his essay \"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\", [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] cited ''The Juniper Tree'' as an example of the evils of censorship for children; many versions in his day omitted the stew, and Tolkien thought children should not be spared it, unless they were spared the whole fairy tale.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Maria Raffaella |last1=Benvenuto |chapter=German Folktale: ''Deutsche Mythologie'' |page=236 |chapterurl={{Google books|B0loOBA3ejIC|page=236|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Michael D.

The story was adapted:\n\n*For the comic book ''[[Grimm Fairy Tales (comics)|Grimm Fairy Tales]]'' as issue 17. The story goes: a woman kills her stepson in order to prevent him from eloping with her daughter, then buries his body underneath the juniper tree in their yard. The next day, a bird on the branch of the tree tells the daughter the truth, and out of grief, she hangs herself from the tree. The story is told to a woman named Patricia, who was contemplating having her drug-addict stepson Bryan killed because of the horrible example he set for her daughter, Carolyn. But, in a sense of twisted irony, her daughter dies anyway from a drug overdose.\n*By [[Barbara Comyns Carr]] in her novel, ''The Juniper Tree'', published by [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] in 1985. In Comyns Carr's adaptation the stepmother is a sympathetic character and the son's death an accident. Whereas in Grimm's fairy tale it is Marlene (the daughter) who buries the bones of the son, Comyns Carr makes Marlene ignorant of the death and has the stepmother, desperate to prevent her husband from finding out and in the throes of a nervous breakdown, bury the little boy under the juniper tree. At the end of the adaptation, the stepmother does not die but is treated and begins a new life. ''The Juniper Tree'' was Barbara Comyns Carr's first novel after an 18-year hiatus in her work and was described in ''[[The Financial Times]]'', at the time of publication, as \"delicate, tough, quick-moving .... haunting\".<ref>Comyns Carr, Barbara: ''The Juniper Tree'', Adapted from a children's fairy story of the same name by the Brother's Grimm, which is far too macabre for adult reading.

One winter, under the juniper tree in the courtyard, the wife peels an apple. She cuts her finger and drops of blood fall onto the snow. This leads her to wish for a child to be as white as snow and as red as blood. Six months later, the wife becomes gravely ill from eating juniper berries and asks her husband to bury her beneath the juniper tree if she dies. A month later, she gives birth to a baby boy as white as snow and as red as blood. She dies of happiness. Keeping his promise, the husband buries her beneath the juniper tree. He eventually marries again and he and his new wife have a daughter named Marlinchen (in some versions Marlene, Marjory or Ann Marie).\n\nThe new wife loves Marlinchen but despises her stepson. She abuses him every day, claiming that she wishes Marlinchen to inherit her father's wealth instead of her stepson. One afternoon after school, the stepmother plans to lure her stepson into an empty room containing a chest of apples. Marlinchen sees the chest and asks for an apple, which the stepmother gracefully offers. However, when the boy enters the room and reaches down the chest for an apple, the stepmother slams the lid onto his neck, decapitating him. The stepmother bounds his head with the rest of his body with a bandage and props his body onto a chair outside, with an apple on his lap. Marlinchen, unaware of the situation, asks her stepbrother for an apple. Hearing no response, she is forced by her mother to box him in the ear, causing his head to roll onto the ground. Marlinchen profusely cries throughout the day whilst the stepmother dismembers the stepson's body and cooks him into a \"blood-soup\" (Black Puddings Sauer/Suur) for dinner. She later deceives her husband by telling him that his son stayed at the mother's great uncle's house. The husband unwittingly eats the \"blood-soup\" (Black puddings/Sauer/Suur) during dinner and proclaims it to be delicious. Marlinchen gathers the bones from the dinner and buries them beneath the juniper tree with a handkerchief.\n\nSuddenly, a mist emerges from the juniper tree and a beautiful bird flies out. The bird visits the local townspeople and sings about its brutal murder at the hands of its stepmother. Captivated by its lullaby, a goldsmith, a shoemaker and a miller offer the bird a gold chain, a pair of red shoes and a millstone in return for the bird singing its song again. The bird returns home to give the gold chain to the husband while giving Marlinchen the red shoes. Meanwhile, the stepmother complains about the \u201craging fires within her arteries\u201d, revealed to be the real cause of her anger and hatred towards her stepson. She goes outside for relief but the bird drops the millstone onto her head, killing her instantly. Surrounded by smoke and flames, the son, revealed to be the bird, emerges and reunites with his family. They celebrate and head inside for lunch, and live happily ever after.\n\n==Characters==\nNone of the characters in ''The Juniper Tree'' have names except for Marlinchen. Instead, they are referred to by their relationship to one another or by their occupation. They are listed below in order of importance.\n\n=== The Boy ===\nArguably the protagonist of the story, he is the child of the father and the father's first wife who is also Marlinchen's stepbrother (or in other versions, her half-brother). He was often afraid to return home from school since he would routinely be cruelly abused and beaten by his stepmother, making him cry to sleep every night. Eventually, he is decapitated by his stepmother and his flesh is dismembered, his blood drained and his body and blood are cooked into \"Black Puddings/Blood-Soup\". The boy eventually reincarnates into a beautiful bird and kills the stepmother in revenge and reverts to his original human self by the end of the story.\n\n=== The Stepmother ===\nPerceived as the antagonist of the story, she is the second wife of the father and the mother of Marlinchen. She is a disturbed and insane individual who is often clouded with evil thoughts and she often blames this on the \"raging fires in her veins\". However, she attempts to rationalize her evil nature by stating that her stepson would inherit his father's wealth instead of Marlinchen. In some versions, it is mentioned that evil spirits often influenced the stepmother in committing evil deeds against her stepson and she is often thought to be possessed by the [[Devil]] himself.\n\n=== Marlinchen ===\nIn some versions she is called Marlene, Marjory or Ann Marie. She is the daughter of stepmother. She is treated kindly by the stepmother in comparison to her stepbrother. She often cares for her stepbrother in spite of the abuse. When she discovers her stepbrother's corpse, Marlinchen initially presumes that he is ignoring her requests of giving her an apple and under the instruction of her stepmother, she boxes him in the ear. She becomes horrified of causing her stepbrother's head to fall off and cries frantically many times throughout the story, especially when the stepmother cooks the stepson into a stew. She eventually buries the bones of her stepbrother beneath the juniper tree. Marlinchen is a [[static character]] throughout the story but becomes more emotional and tearful, especially after the murder of her stepbrother.\n\n=== The Father ===\nThe son's father, the stepmother's husband, the husband of the first wife and Marlinchen's stepfather. He is a wealthy and pious man but he is often absent at home, which probably explains why the stepmother could get away with her abuse towards his son. He was also unaware that the blood-soup/black pudding he consumed was actually made from his son's blood and body. The father is a static character in this work.\n\n=== The Goldsmith, the Shoemaker and the Miller ===\nThree residents of an unnamed town that is located near the house where the main characters reside. They are captivated by the bird's lullaby who sings about a horrific fate similar to the one suffered by the son. As a reward, for the bird singing its song again they offer the bird a gold chain, a pair of red shoes and a millstone respectively in return. Considered minor characters in this work.\n\n=== The First Wife ===\nThe son's biological mother and the original wife of the father. Like her husband, she is wealthy and pious and often prays in hopes of getting a child. She dies at the beginning of the story after being extremely ecstatic over the sight of her newborn son and is buried beneath the juniper tree.\n\n==Motifs==\nThere are many themes, such as cannibalism, death, and food, that play an important role in the short story, ''The Juniper Tree.'' These overall themes are listed below.\n\n=== Cannibalism ===\nSome argue that ''The Juniper Tree'' draws cues from the short story ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]''. Following the death of the main character, the mother (in an attempt to cover up his death) literally \"chopped him in pieces, put him into the pan and... [cooked him up in blood-soup/black puddings].<ref name=\":0\" /> The husband then eats the blood-soup/black pudding, saying how \u201cdelicious [the] food is,\" and even asks for the wife to \"give [him] some more.\u201d <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Parallel between food and death ===\nIt is quite clear by the end of the tale that food is associated with death. At the beginning of the short story, the first wife is cutting an apple when she cuts her fingers and \"blood [falls to] the snow.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> An apple later is even referred to as ushering in the Devil when the little boy comes home and the Devil figuratively makes the mother say to him, \"My son, wilt thou have an apple?\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> You could even look to the son as a source of death when he is turned into stew. Finally, a millstone is used to kill the mother. A millstone<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/millstone|title=millstone - definition of millstone in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-20}}</ref> is a tool typically used to grind corn.\n\n=== Guardianship ===\nCritics suggest that the character of the mother in \"The Juniper Tree\" is used to represent a guardian spirit. This theme of guardianship is shown throughout other Grimm fairy tales such as [[Cinderella]], [[Sleeping Beauty|Briar Rose]], and [[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarves]]. In all of these stories, there is some object (normally represented through nature) that watches after the main character. In the case of \"Briar Rose,\" \"the briar hedge is the symbol of nature guarding her rose: the princess who sleeps inside the castle.\" <ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3813902 |jstor=3813902 |title=A Literary Approach to the Brothers Grimm |journal=Journal of the Folklore Institute |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=180\u2013196 |last1=David |first1=Alfred |last2=David |first2=Mary Elizabeth |year=1964 }}</ref>\n\n=== Gift giving ===\nWhen the son becomes a bird, he requests gifts such as a gold chain from a goldsmith and a pair of shoes for his sister. In addition, he asks for a millstone from a group of millers, which he drops on the wife's head leading to her swift death. Critics argue that while the chain may represent power (to leave the wife), the shoes may also allude to freedom.\n\n=== Song ===\nSong is a symbolic motif in that it served as a vessel to expose the son's wrongful death. The bird sang this song to different townspeople in order to get gifts that he will later bestow on his sister and father after they heard the bird sing as well. This song fueled the personification of a bird, which naturally does not have the ability to communicate words to humans.\n\nThe song went like this:\n\n'''Lyrics'''\n\n\"My mother she killed me,\n\nMy father he ate me,\n\nMy sister, little Marlinchen,\n\nGathered together all my bones,\n\nTied them in a silken handkerchief,\n\nLaid them beneath the juniper-tree,\n\nKywitt, kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Child abuse ===\nChild abuse is a prevalent theme shown through the stepmother constantly abusing her stepson and eventually murdering him. This theme, along with cruel oppression, is a recurring theme in the works of the Brothers Grimm. such as [[The Frog Prince]] and [[Rapunzel]]. Critic Jack Zipes suggests that the theme of child abuse leads to a more adult centered story. This veers away from the more accepted thought that fairy tales are meant for children.<ref name=\"renamed_from_19_on_20161207074816\">{{cite journal |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=2000 |title=The Contamination of the Fairy Tale, or The Changing Nature of the Grimms' Fairy Tales |jstor=43308420 |journal=Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=77\u201393 }}</ref>\n\n===Personification of the Devil===\nThe devil makes an appearance in many Grimms' tales, often in \u201cvarious disguises.\u201d<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=CARSCH|first=HENRY|date=1968-01-01|title=THE ROLE OF THE DEVIL IN GRIMMS' TALES: AN EXPLORATION OF THE CONTENT AND FUNCTION OF POPULAR TALES|jstor=40969921|journal=Social Research|volume=35|issue=3|pages=466\u2013499}}</ref> He takes many identities including anything from a \u201clittle man,\u201d to an \u201cold goat.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" />  The stepmother's deep disgust and violent tendencies towards the stepson play right into the mindset that she may be an offshoot of the devil himself. The stepmother offering the stepson an apple before brutally killing him and manipulating her daughter's innocence to cover up the murder is also a direct allusion to the [[Fall of man|biblical temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden]].  Near the end, the stepmother experiences \"raging fires\" within her veins, symbolising the weight of her sins and possibly the [[damnation]] of her soul. It is even described at one point during the story that the Devil (who is referred as the Evil One in most adaptions) has [[Demonic possession|gone into her mind]] before her villainous breakdown.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Religion ===\nReligion plays a major symbolic role in the story. Devotion to God was often associated with purity and innocence, as shown through the boy's biological parents and presumably, the boy himself and Marlinchen. The boy reincarnating into the bird and killing the stepmother with the millstone out of revenge can also symbolize the [[Holy Spirit]], who is often depicted as a white [[dove]], executing divine judgement upon the wicked. The story also takes place \"well on two thousand years ago\" placing it firmly in Biblical times. In most English language translations, the dish/cooking method that is described in the text is translated as \"stew\" or as in Margaret Hunt's 1884 translation as \"black puddings.\" What is important here is that the body and the blood of the boy are cooked and consumed by the father. What is missing in most English language translations in the word \"stew\" is that the blood of the boy is also cooked and eaten. The symoblism in relation to the Eucharist - eating the body and drinking the blood of Christ - then become unmistakable.\n\n=== Reincarnation ===\n\"In fairy tales the cycle of human life is intimately related to the cycle of nature.\" <ref name=\":5\"/> \nParticularly seen in the Grimm Brother's \"The Juniper Tree,\" reincarnation plays a major role in the tale. The audience first sees reincarnation when the first wife asks to be buried under the juniper tree. Although the mother never truly comes back to life, her spirit appears to have supernatural influence over the juniper tree, which allows her son to be physically reincarnated, as a bird and as his originally physical form, at the end of the story.\n\n== Theory of Grimm ==\nEach Grimm tale follows a predetermined and categorical format. Every tale is based on the idea that each character is born with fault.  For example, if a child is \u201cloved by his parents, he is hated by a brother or sister.\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Marthe|last2=Powell|first2=Wyley L.|date=1969-01-01|title=The Grimm Brothers|jstor=2929635|journal=Yale French Studies|issue=43|pages=44\u201356|doi=10.2307/2929635}}</ref> Another example could include a child \u201csurrounded by affection.\u201d Using the Grimm theory, the child then must be \u201cpursued by an offense committed prior to his birth, generally by one of his family.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> It is this format that pushes a \"coming of character moment\" where the main character (in order to survive) \u201cset[s] out on a road strew with pitfalls, pursued by an evil willpower, as if distance itself could not take him away from the fatality of [his or her] family.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Transformative bodies in Grimm ===\nContinuous throughout each of the Grimm tales are the reappearance of transformative bodies. Critic Jeana Jorgensen, argues that there is a connection between the physical transformation of characters and their genders.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |doi=10.13110/marvelstales.28.1.0127 |url=https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/marvels/vol28/iss1/9 |title=Quantifying the Grimm Corpus: Transgressive and Transformative Bodies in the Grimms' Fairy Tales |journal=Marvels & Tales |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=127 |date=2014-05-21 |last1=Jorgensen |first1=Jeana }}</ref> Drawing a connection between beauty ideals consistently being a major factor in female character development to Grimm, while transformations playing a significant role in the development of mostly male characters. She concludes that female characters are usually described with a focus on their physical attributes such as small, petite, wicked, beautiful, and ugly compared to the adjectives used in male transformations that overall relate strictly to age and size. Specifically, in ''The Juniper Tree'', Jorgensen uses Miriam's depiction of sorrow as a representation of the fact that in several of Grimm's tales \"suffering is written on women\u2019s bodies in a way that naturalizes their pain and almost leads us to expect women to cry in fairy tales.\" <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Fantasy and magic in Grimm ===\nFor the Grimm Brother's audience \"the fantasy and magic of the story can be interpreted as instruments to establish or restore social and economic justice.\"<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/376915 |jstor=376915 |title=The Fairy Tale: An Introduction to Literature and the Creative Process |journal=College English |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=31\u201345 |last1=Markman |first1=Roberta Hoffman |year=1983 }}</ref> Roberta Markman believes that this is the case among all of the Grimm fairy tales because the creative process' \"transformative power[s]\" can change social norms. As a result, literature and other creative art forms have the power to change someone's personal attitude regarding their economic and social situations. This is especially prevalent in Grimm fairy tales where normally the character's social and economic situation is poor at best. For example, in the Grimm's [[Cinderella]], Cinderella's social situation is contingent upon her servitude to her stepmother. As an audience member, when one reads this they are reminded of how good their social situation is in comparison.\n\n=== Family conflict in Grimm ===\nThere is an apparent parallel between Grimm's ''The Juniper Tree'' and his previous works, familial drama. Critic Walter Scherf in a study of the introductions of children's literature, noted that out of 176 texts, 169 of them started with a basic family conflict.<ref name=\":6\" /> Similar to the plot in Juniper Tree, in Grimm's ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', the children live with their stepmother who does not like them, and makes a plan to get rid of them. She states that in the morning she and her husband will take the children into the thickest part of the forest and leave them there, with the intention that they won't be able to find their way back, and end up starving to death.<ref>Segal, Lore and Randall Jerrell. \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d. ''The Juniper Tree and Other Tales from Grimm''. 2nd ed, Douglas and McIntyre, 2003, pp. 154-170.</ref> In comparison to the Stepmother in ''The Juniper Tree'' who wanted her daughter to inherit everything from the Father, killing the Son in order to guarantee this possibility.\n\n== Original translation and background ==\nIt is important to remember that the Juniper tree is not only the title of the collection, but also a piece of prose within the book. More importantly, the collection of short stories were not written by the Grimm brothers, but instead collected from \u201cvarious sources\u2026 many of which were the original authors.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blind|first=Karl|date=1888-01-01|title=A GRIMM'S TALE IN A SHETLAND FOLKLORE VERSION|jstor=24708733|journal=The Archaeological Review|volume=1|issue=5|pages=346\u2013352}}</ref> In total, there are twenty-seven short stories spanning three hundred and thirty-three pages. The Grimm brothers also used illustrations to add to the overall work. According to Grimm, the \"illustrations [used are] delicate in detail, imaginative in concept, and truly beautiful.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Commentary ==\nAcademic discourse is an important part of understanding any sort of text.{{Opinion|date=March 2020}} The Brothers Grimm's \"Juniper Tree\" is no different. Listed below, in alphabetical order, are some examples of commentary written by academic scholars regarding this fairy tale. This represents their individual opinions regarding ''The Juniper Tree''.\n\n=== Alfred and Mary Elizabeth David === \nIn Alfred and Elizabeth David's essay, they interpret \"The Juniper Tree\" as \"folk literature for inspiration.\" They believe that the nature and native culture presented in most Grimm fairy tale inspires other artists in their literary endeavors <ref name=\":5\"/> In \"The Juniper Tree,\" this theme of nature is present. The Grimm Brothers use the juniper tree as a life source for the mother and the son. The use of nature as a life source inspired other literary work such as \"Briar Rose\".\n\n=== Maria Tatar === \nMany folklorists interpret evil stepmothers as stemming from actual competition between a woman and her stepchildren for resources.  In this tale, the motive is made explicit:  the stepmother wants her daughter to inherit everything.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 161, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[millstone]] in the story would have had biblical connotations for the readers of the Grimms' days, especially as the verse Luke 17:2 says that anyone who causes a child to sin would be better off being thrown into the sea with a millstone about his neck; both refer to a millstone as a punishment for those who harm the young and innocent.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''Off with Their Heads!'' p. 213 {{ISBN|0-691-06943-3}}</ref> Another biblical connotation could be the offering of the apple from the stepmother, possessed by the devil, to the son, which parallels the devil, disguised as a serpent, offering the forbidden fruit (traditionally an apple) to Eve.\n\n=== J. R .R Tolkien === \nIn his essay \"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\", [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] cited ''The Juniper Tree'' as an example of the evils of censorship for children; many versions in his day omitted the stew, and Tolkien thought children should not be spared it, unless they were spared the whole fairy tale.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Maria Raffaella |last1=Benvenuto |chapter=German Folktale: ''Deutsche Mythologie'' |page=236 |chapterurl={{Google books|B0loOBA3ejIC|page=236|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Michael D.

The story was adapted:\n\n*For the comic book ''[[Grimm Fairy Tales (comics)|Grimm Fairy Tales]]'' as issue 17. The story goes: a woman kills her stepson in order to prevent him from eloping with her daughter, then buries his body underneath the juniper tree in their yard. The next day, a bird on the branch of the tree tells the daughter the truth, and out of grief, she hangs herself from the tree. The story is told to a woman named Patricia, who was contemplating having her drug-addict stepson Bryan killed because of the horrible example he set for her daughter, Carolyn. But, in a sense of twisted irony, her daughter dies anyway from a drug overdose.\n*By [[Barbara Comyns Carr]] in her novel, ''The Juniper Tree'', published by [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] in 1985. In Comyns Carr's adaptation the stepmother is a sympathetic character and the son's death an accident. Whereas in Grimm's fairy tale it is Marlene (the daughter) who buries the bones of the son, Comyns Carr makes Marlene ignorant of the death and has the stepmother, desperate to prevent her husband from finding out and in the throes of a nervous breakdown, bury the little boy under the juniper tree. At the end of the adaptation, the stepmother does not die but is treated and begins a new life. ''The Juniper Tree'' was Barbara Comyns Carr's first novel after an 18-year hiatus in her work and was described in ''[[The Financial Times]]'', at the time of publication, as \"delicate, tough, quick-moving .... haunting\".<ref>Comyns Carr, Barbara: ''The Juniper Tree'', Adapted from a children's fairy story of the same name by the Brother's Grimm, which is far too macabre for adult reading.
