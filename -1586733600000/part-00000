This was the seventh time that Ireland hosted the event, and the fourth in five years.\n\nThe contest was held at the [[Point Theatre]] on 3 May 1997.

Dublin was chosen to be the host city, making it the sixth time that the Eurovision Song Contest was staged in the Irish capital. The venue for the contest was the [[Point Theatre]] located on the North Wall Quay of the [[River Liffey]], amongst the [[Dublin Docklands]]. The theatre previously hosted the {{Escyr|1994}} and {{Escyr|1995}} contests. The Point Theatre is the only venue to have hosted the final three times.<ref name=Eurovision1997/>\n\n==Format==\nAfter the controversy over the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996#Pre-qualifying round|1996 pre-qualifying round]], the [[European Broadcasting Union]] introduced a new system for 1997: countries with the lowest average scores over the previous four years would be excluded from the 1997 contest, and those with the lowest averages over the previous five years would be excluded from future contests (save that every country so excluded for one year would automatically be allowed to participate the following year), with so many countries being omitted as would reduce the number of participants each year to 25.<ref name=Eurovision1997/>\n\nIsrael declined to participate, as the Contest was held on its [[Yom HaShoah|Holocaust Remembrance Day]], granting a reprieve to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which would otherwise have been excluded owing to its low point average over the previous four years.<ref name=Eurovision1997/> RT\u00c9 once again produced a highly spectacular show, with a stage that had a smaller performance space for the artists than in previous years. This was the third Eurovision set to be designed by Paula Farrell, who had previously been involved with the 1988 and 1994 contests.<ref name=Eurovision1997/>\n\nThere was a wide array of different styles this year. Denmark brought a [[hip hop music|rap]] song, Croatia came with their version of the [[Spice Girls]] and Sweden brought a mid-1980s style [[boy band]]. The music was in general more modern than before, and for the first time in six years, an [[up-tempo]] song won (the last time this happened was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|Rome 1991]], with [[Carola H\u00e4ggkvist|Carola]]'s song, [[F\u00e5ngad av en stormvind]]).<ref name=Eurovision1997/> This year, [[Televoting#Televoting in the Eurovision Song Contest|televoting]] was tested in five countries: Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The results of the televoting countries were, in some cases, different from those that used a jury. Iceland received 16 of its 18 points from these five countries.<ref name=Eurovision1997/>\n\nAlso, for the first time in Eurovision history, there was a country where not one, but two spokespeople gave votes - France.

Ireland was ostensibly the best scoring country across the televoting countries, except they were able to score points from all 5 televoting countries. The United Kingdom was only eligible to receive points from 4 of them, since they couldn't vote for themselves. In fact, the UK received 12 points from all the other televoting countries except Germany, from whom they received 10 points: in other words, the UK earned 46 of 48 (95.83%) possible televote points that year;

Despite being the runner-up, it remarkably received only one 12-point score, which came from the United Kingdom. The UK spokesman [[Colin Berry]] remarked: \"You're going to like this one: Ireland, twelve points!\" causing [[Terry Wogan]] to reply: \"Well, tit for tat!\" The winning song scored an unprecedented 227 points; it received points from all participating countries, including five sets of 10 points and a record-breaking ten sets of the maximum 12 points. \"Love Shine a Light\" is still regarded as one of the most successful Eurovision winners,<ref group=\"N\">As noted on a [[TOTP2]] Eurovision special, it ranks third in the rankings of points achieved as a percentage of maximum available with 227 out of 288 or 78.81%, behind [[Nicole (German singer)|Nicole]]'s \"[[Ein bi\u00dfchen Frieden]]\" in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] (161 out of 204 or 78.92%) and [[Brotherhood of Man]]'s \"[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]\" in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]] (164 out of 204 or 80.39%). For comparison, Elena Paparizou's 2005 win took 230 points out of a possible 456, or only 50.04%.</ref> and was the closing song in the medleys that opened the 50th anniversary show \"[[Congratulations (Eurovision)|Congratulations]]\" in [[Copenhagen]] in 2005, and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|ESC 2006]] semi-final in [[Athens]]. With this victory, the United Kingdom has five Eurovision wins and it is to date the country's last win in the Contest. In 2020, all 41 acts from the canceled contest, due to the Covid-19 epidemic, will perform Love Shine a Light in tribute to the contest.\n\n==Barbara Dex Award==\nFor the first time, the fansite House of Eurovision presented the [[Barbara Dex Award]], a humorous award given to the worst dressed artist each year in the contest. It is named after the Belgian artist, [[Barbara Dex]], who came last in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993 contest]], in which she wore her own self designed dress. House of Eurovision would continue to provide the Barbara Dex Award until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], when another Eurovision fansite, songfestival.be, took the reins of the award and will present it every year starting with the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017|2017 Eurovision Song Contest]] in Ukraine.\n\n[[Debbie Scerri]] of Malta was the 1997 Barbara Dex Award winner.\n\n==International broadcasts and voting==\n\n===Voting and spokespersons===\nThe spokespersons announced the score from their respective country's national jury (or, in some cases, televote) in running order.\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# {{Esc|Cyprus|1960}} - Marios Skordis<ref name=\"Savvidis, Christos OGAE Cyprus\"/>\n# {{Esc|Turkey}} - [[\u00d6mer \u00d6nder]]\n# {{Esc|Norway}} - Ragnhild S\u00e6lthun Fj\u00f8rtoft\n# {{Esc|Austria}} - Adriana Zartl\n# {{Esc|Ireland}} - [[Eileen Dunne]]\n# {{Esc|Slovenia}} - [[Mojca Mavec]]\n# {{Esc|Switzerland}} - Sandy Altermatt\n# {{Esc|Netherlands}} - [[Corry Brokken]] <small>(Dutch representative in {{Escyr|1956}}, {{Escyr|1958}};

Dublin was chosen to be the host city, making it the sixth time that the Eurovision Song Contest was staged in the Irish capital. The venue for the contest was the [[Point Theatre]] located on the North Wall Quay of the [[River Liffey]], amongst the [[Dublin Docklands]]. The theatre previously hosted the {{Escyr|1994}} and {{Escyr|1995}} contests. The Point Theatre is the only venue to have hosted the final three times.<ref name=Eurovision1997/>\n\n==Format==\nAfter the controversy over the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996#Pre-qualifying round|1996 pre-qualifying round]], the [[European Broadcasting Union]] introduced a new system for 1997: countries with the lowest average scores over the previous four years would be excluded from the 1997 contest, and those with the lowest averages over the previous five years would be excluded from future contests (save that every country so excluded for one year would automatically be allowed to participate the following year), with so many countries being omitted as would reduce the number of participants each year to 25.<ref name=Eurovision1997/>\n\nIsrael declined to participate, as the Contest was held on its [[Yom HaShoah|Holocaust Remembrance Day]], granting a reprieve to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which would otherwise have been excluded owing to its low point average over the previous four years.<ref name=Eurovision1997/> RT\u00c9 once again produced a highly spectacular show, with a stage that had a smaller performance space for the artists than in previous years. This was the third Eurovision set to be designed by Paula Farrell, who had previously been involved with the 1988 and 1994 contests.<ref name=Eurovision1997/>\n\nThere was a wide array of different styles this year. Denmark brought a [[hip hop music|rap]] song, Croatia came with their version of the [[Spice Girls]] and Sweden brought a mid-1980s style [[boy band]]. The music was in general more modern than before, and for the first time in six years, an [[up-tempo]] song won (the last time this happened was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|Rome 1991]], with [[Carola H\u00e4ggkvist|Carola]]'s song, [[F\u00e5ngad av en stormvind]]).<ref name=Eurovision1997/> This year, [[Televoting#Televoting in the Eurovision Song Contest|televoting]] was tested in five countries: Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The results of the televoting countries were, in some cases, different from those that used a jury. Iceland received 16 of its 18 points from these five countries.<ref name=Eurovision1997/>\n\nAlso, for the first time in Eurovision history, there was a country where not one, but two spokespeople gave votes - France. Television reporter [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ferrer]] and {{Escyr|1977}} Eurovision winner [[Marie Myriam]] each took turns at giving results from that country. Long-time Irish conductor [[Noel Kelehan]] was not the host conductor this year, the duty being fulfilled by [[Frank McNamara (musician)|Frank McNamara]].\n\n==Returning artists==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Iceland got most of its 18 points from the 5 countries that used televoting. Ireland was ostensibly the best scoring country across the televoting countries, except they were able to score points from all 5 televoting countries. The United Kingdom was only eligible to receive points from 4 of them, since they couldn't vote for themselves. In fact, the UK received 12 points from all the other televoting countries except Germany, from whom they received 10 points: in other words, the UK earned 46 of 48 (95,83 %) possible televote points that year; Ireland earned 47 of 60 (78,33 %) possible televote points\u2014including their only 12 from the UK.<ref name=\"1997 Results\"/>\n\nDuring the voting the United Kingdom received at least five points from every voting country, the exception is Malta who only gave the United Kingdom one point.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;

Despite being the runner-up, it remarkably received only one 12-point score, which came from the United Kingdom. The UK spokesman [[Colin Berry]] remarked: \"You're going to like this one: Ireland, twelve points!\" causing [[Terry Wogan]] to reply: \"Well, tit for tat!\" The winning song scored an unprecedented 227 points; it received points from all participating countries, including five sets of 10 points and a record-breaking ten sets of the maximum 12 points. \"Love Shine a Light\" is still regarded as one of the most successful Eurovision winners,<ref group=\"N\">As noted on a [[TOTP2]] Eurovision special, it ranks third in the rankings of points achieved as a percentage of maximum available with 227 out of 288 or 78.81%, behind [[Nicole (German singer)|Nicole]]'s \"[[Ein bi\u00dfchen Frieden]]\" in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] (161 out of 204 or 78.92%) and [[Brotherhood of Man]]'s \"[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]\" in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]] (164 out of 204 or 80.39%). For comparison, Elena Paparizou's 2005 win took 230 points out of a possible 456, or only 50.04%.</ref> and was the closing song in the medleys that opened the 50th anniversary show \"[[Congratulations (Eurovision)|Congratulations]]\" in [[Copenhagen]] in 2005, and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|ESC 2006]] semi-final in [[Athens]]. With this victory, the United Kingdom has five Eurovision wins and it is to date the country's last win in the Contest. In 2020, all 41 acts from the canceled contest, due to the Covid-19 epidemic, will perform Love Shine a Light in tribute to the contest.\n\n==Barbara Dex Award==\nFor the first time, the fansite House of Eurovision presented the [[Barbara Dex Award]], a humorous award given to the worst dressed artist each year in the contest. It is named after the Belgian artist, [[Barbara Dex]], who came last in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993 contest]], in which she wore her own self designed dress. House of Eurovision would continue to provide the Barbara Dex Award until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], when another Eurovision fansite, songfestival.be, took the reins of the award and will present it every year starting with the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017|2017 Eurovision Song Contest]] in Ukraine.\n\n[[Debbie Scerri]] of Malta was the 1997 Barbara Dex Award winner.\n\n==International broadcasts and voting==\n\n===Voting and spokespersons===\nThe spokespersons announced the score from their respective country's national jury (or, in some cases, televote) in running order.\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# {{Esc|Cyprus|1960}} - Marios Skordis<ref name=\"Savvidis, Christos OGAE Cyprus\"/>\n# {{Esc|Turkey}} - [[\u00d6mer \u00d6nder]]\n# {{Esc|Norway}} - Ragnhild S\u00e6lthun Fj\u00f8rtoft\n# {{Esc|Austria}} - Adriana Zartl\n# {{Esc|Ireland}} - [[Eileen Dunne]]\n# {{Esc|Slovenia}} - [[Mojca Mavec]]\n# {{Esc|Switzerland}} - Sandy Altermatt\n# {{Esc|Netherlands}} - [[Corry Brokken]] <small>(Dutch representative in {{Escyr|1956}}, {{Escyr|1958}};

Earlier, in 1378 Courtenay had taken part with his uncles, [[Philip Courtenay (died 1406)|Sir Philip Courtenay]] and [[Peter Courtenay (d.1405)|Sir Peter Courtenay]], in an unsuccessful naval expedition against Spain at which Courtenay was captured, but quickly ransomed. He had been knighted by 1387, and in March of that year served at sea in his brother's retinue under the Lord Admiral, the [[Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]].\n\nLittle else is known of his career until he went to Ireland with [[Richard II of England|King Richard II's]] expedition in April 1399, serving under the [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Duke of Aumale]], who had earlier been granted custody of the lands of Courtenay's stepson, Fulk FitzWarin.\n\nOver the years Courtenay acquired considerable property, much of it by way of his marriages. At his death he held 14 manors, principally in the West Country, but also in Essex and Herefordshire.\n\nCourtenay served on commissions during the reigns of both Richard II and his successor, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], including commissions concerned with inquiry into the possessions of Richard II's former supporters, suggesting that he accommodated himself to both regimes.\n\nHe was made Commissioner of Survey to Devon and Cornwall in 1388, and again by Lords Appellant to the two counties in October 1397.  In 1395 he was elected as MP for [[Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|Devon]] and again in September 1397.  At the height of the Crisis, King Richard II betrayed his uncle, Earl of Arundel, and as a consequence he lost his main supporters.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAfter the usurpation by King Henry IV Hugh was made Commissioner of Array for Devon in December 1399 - responsible for raising troops and bringing the south-west to the Lancastrian cause.  He proved a successful recruiter for the wars in France, as he was made commissioner again in July 1402 to fight the Welsh Rebellion.  The commission met again in August, September, and October 1403, after King Henry had defeated Harry Hotspur and the Mortimers at Shrewsbury.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn February 1400, Sir Hugh was a Commissioner of oyer and terminer dispensing the king's justice in the south-west.  There was also a Commission of Inquiry into waste lands. King Henry made Hugh a Commissioner in the region and in Hampshire, a traditional land area of Courtenay holdings, to look into the concealment of possessions owned by adherents of the late king.  He was also on the commission for \"concealment of alnage\" in Devon from July 1401.\n\nThe south-western counties disliked the new king and interference of parliament and in 1405 the Cornish rebelled with widespread rioting. In January a commission was set up to look into \"unlawful assemblies\" during 1406.  Sir Hugh, however was a known Lancastrian: in May 1402 he had been forced to proclaim the intention of Henry IV to govern well.  Also he was a JP for Devon, appointed on 16 February 1400 for the period until 1407; instructed to enforce the law and collect the king's taxes.  He was appointed Tax Collector for Devon in March 1404. \n \nHe was made [[High Sheriff of Devon]] on 4 November 1418, holding the office for the year until 23 November 1419.  When his brother the Earl of Devon died the new earl was fighting the French abroad, and so Sir Hugh was the most senior member of the family at home and probably felt compelled to represent Devon in parliament again in May 1421.\n\nHenry IV died in 1413, and during the new reign Sir Hugh found favour with Henry V. King Henry V had travelled triumphantly through France, securing the future accession of his son as King of both England and France.  Sir Hugh was thus present as [[knight of the shire]] for the County of Devon.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nHugh's brother, the [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd Earl of Devon|11th Earl]], died in 1419, and was succeeded by his son, [[Hugh de Courtenay, 4th Earl of Devon|Hugh Courtenay, 12th Earl of Devon]] (1389 \u2014 16 June 1422). The 12th Earl spent considerable time abroad in service to the crown, leaving Hugh as the senior member of the family in England. After the death of his nephew in 1422, Courtenay was again the senior member of the family during the minority of [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon]].\n\nCourtenay died on 5 or 6 March 1425, leaving two daughters, Joan and Eleanor, by his third wife Philippa, and two sons and a daughter by his fourth wife, Maud. The lands which had belonged to Philippa were divided between their two daughters, Joan and Eleanor. Courtenay's heir was his elder son, Edward, who was eight years of age at his father's death. Courtenay's younger son, Hugh (d.1471) of Boconnoc, was the father of [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1485 creation)|Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon]] of the 1485 creation.\n\nCourtenay was buried at [[Haccombe]] beside his third wife, Philippa.<ref>Transactions of Devon Association LXXXIII 227.</ref>\n\n==Marriages and issue==\nSir Hugh Courtenay married four times:<ref>{{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|pp=402, 547\u20139}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson II|2011|p=326}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1916|pp=328\u20139}}.</ref>\n*Firstly to Elizabeth FitzPayn (d. by 1392),<ref>1st marriage not listed in Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Devon, 1895, p.245, pedigree of Courtenay</ref> widow of Sir Thomas de Audley (d. pre-1386), slain in France in the Hundred Years' War, and daughter of Sir Robert FitzPayn by his wife  Elizabeth Bryan, daughter of Guy de Bryan, Lord Bryan.

At the height of the Crisis, King Richard II betrayed his uncle, Earl of Arundel, and as a consequence he lost his main supporters.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAfter the usurpation by King Henry IV Hugh was made Commissioner of Array for Devon in December 1399 - responsible for raising troops and bringing the south-west to the Lancastrian cause.  He proved a successful recruiter for the wars in France, as he was made commissioner again in July 1402 to fight the Welsh Rebellion.  The commission met again in August, September, and October 1403, after King Henry had defeated Harry Hotspur and the Mortimers at Shrewsbury.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn February 1400, Sir Hugh was a Commissioner of oyer and terminer dispensing the king's justice in the south-west.  There was also a Commission of Inquiry into waste lands. King Henry made Hugh a Commissioner in the region and in Hampshire, a traditional land area of Courtenay holdings, to look into the concealment of possessions owned by adherents of the late king.  He was also on the commission for \"concealment of alnage\" in Devon from July 1401.\n\nThe south-western counties disliked the new king and interference of parliament and in 1405 the Cornish rebelled with widespread rioting. In January a commission was set up to look into \"unlawful assemblies\" during 1406.  Sir Hugh, however was a known Lancastrian: in May 1402 he had been forced to proclaim the intention of Henry IV to govern well.  Also he was a JP for Devon, appointed on 16 February 1400 for the period until 1407; instructed to enforce the law and collect the king's taxes.  He was appointed Tax Collector for Devon in March 1404. \n \nHe was made [[High Sheriff of Devon]] on 4 November 1418, holding the office for the year until 23 November 1419.  When his brother the Earl of Devon died the new earl was fighting the French abroad, and so Sir Hugh was the most senior member of the family at home and probably felt compelled to represent Devon in parliament again in May 1421.\n\nHenry IV died in 1413, and during the new reign Sir Hugh found favour with Henry V. King Henry V had travelled triumphantly through France, securing the future accession of his son as King of both England and France.  Sir Hugh was thus present as [[knight of the shire]] for the County of Devon.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nHugh's brother, the [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd Earl of Devon|11th Earl]], died in 1419, and was succeeded by his son, [[Hugh de Courtenay, 4th Earl of Devon|Hugh Courtenay, 12th Earl of Devon]] (1389 \u2014 16 June 1422). The 12th Earl spent considerable time abroad in service to the crown, leaving Hugh as the senior member of the family in England. After the death of his nephew in 1422, Courtenay was again the senior member of the family during the minority of [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon]].\n\nCourtenay died on 5 or 6 March 1425, leaving two daughters, Joan and Eleanor, by his third wife Philippa, and two sons and a daughter by his fourth wife, Maud. The lands which had belonged to Philippa were divided between their two daughters, Joan and Eleanor. Courtenay's heir was his elder son, Edward, who was eight years of age at his father's death. Courtenay's younger son, Hugh (d.1471) of Boconnoc, was the father of [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1485 creation)|Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon]] of the 1485 creation.\n\nCourtenay was buried at [[Haccombe]] beside his third wife, Philippa.<ref>Transactions of Devon Association LXXXIII 227.</ref>\n\n==Marriages and issue==\nSir Hugh Courtenay married four times:<ref>{{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|pp=402, 547\u20139}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson II|2011|p=326}}; {{Harvnb|Cokayne|1916|pp=328\u20139}}.</ref>\n*Firstly to Elizabeth FitzPayn (d. by 1392),<ref>1st marriage not listed in Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Devon, 1895, p.245, pedigree of Courtenay</ref> widow of Sir Thomas de Audley (d. pre-1386), slain in France in the Hundred Years' War, and daughter of Sir Robert FitzPayn by his wife  Elizabeth Bryan, daughter of Guy de Bryan, Lord Bryan.

It is likely that such a Ros\u00e9, which would include a small proportion of Pinot Noir vinified red, will be adopted only at the DOC level from the 2019 harvest and therefore be available to buy from as early as January 2020.<ref>https://imbibe.com/news/prosecco-ros\u00e9-will-be-a-reality-by-2020.

Prosecco Conegliano Valdobbiadene Superiore DOCG, is made on the hills between the towns of [[Conegliano]], [[Valdobbiadene]] and [[Vittorio Veneto]]. Producers from Valdobbiadene have recently tended to skip the mention of Conegliano on their front label, calling their wine ''Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore''. The second DOCG is the smaller Asolo Prosecco Superiore DOCG, produced on the hills near the town of [[Asolo]].<ref>https://www.asolomontello.it/asolo-prosecco</ref> Currently, in addition to the usual range of Prosecco styles, Asolo DOCG can also make an \"Extra-Brut\" (0-6 g/l), and Conegliano Valdobbiadene is expected to introduce this style soon. While the bulk of Prosecco DOC is grown on low-lying plains in an extended area covering 23,300 hectares, the DOCG Prosecco Superiore is grown exclusively on hillside vineyards in two far smaller growing areas, being 6,860 hectares for Conegliano Valdobbiadene and 1,783 hectares for Asolo.<ref>https://italianwinecentral.com</ref> The steepness of the hills means that everything, from pruning to picking, is principally done by hand.
