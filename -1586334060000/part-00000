It is believed to be the oldest surviving martial art in India. It is also considered to be among the oldest martial arts still in existence, with its origin in the [[martial arts timeline]] dating back to at least the 3rd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|last=Deleury|first=Guy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gIDuAAAAIAAJ|title=India: The Rebel Continent|date=2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=1403924880|page=89}}</ref> \n\nKalaripayattu is also mentioned in the [[Vadakkan Pattukal]] ballads written about the [[Chekavar]] from the Malabar region of Kerala.

Practitioners of Kalaripayattu possess intricate knowledge of pressure points on the human body and healing techniques that incorporate the knowledge of Ayurveda and Yoga. Students are taught the martial art as a way of life, with a sense of compassion, discipline, and respect toward the master, fellow-students, parents and the community. Particular emphasis is placed on avoiding confrontational situations and using the martial art only as a means of protection, when no other alternative is available.\n\nUnlike other parts of India, warriors in Kerala belonged to all castes.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1992\">{{cite journal|author=Zarrilli, Phillip B.|first=|date=|year=1992|title=To Heal and/or To Harm: The Vital Spots (Marmmam/Varmam) in Two South Indian Martial Traditions Part I: Focus on Kerala's Kalarippayattu|url=http://www.spa.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/healharm.html|journal=[[Journal of Asian Martial Arts]]|volume=1|issue=1|pages=|via=}}</ref> Women in Keralite society also underwent training in Kalaripayattu, and still do so to this day.

They are the Northern style, or ''Vadakkan Kalari'', and the Southern style, or ''Thekkan Kalari.''<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nA newer style of Kalaripayattu called the Central style, or ''Madhya Kalari'', which claims to combine elements of the Northern and Southern styles of Kalaripayattu is also being taught in Kerala. The legitimacy of this style is controversial due to its recent development and the lack of consensus of its existence amongst Kalaripayattu practitioners.<ref name=\"Luijendijk 08\" /> \n\nA smaller, regional style of Kalaripayattu called ''Tulunadan Kalari,'' is referenced in texts such as the [[Vadakkan Pattukal]], but it is largely restricted to the [[Tulu Nadu]] region in northern Kerala and southern Karnataka.\n\nOther smaller, regional styles are also said to exist in isolated regions of Kerala, but these styles are becoming increasingly rare, and difficult to find. \n\n== History ==\nThe word, \u201c''Kalaripayattu'',\u201d is said to be derived from the from the name of [[Hindu]] deity ''Khaloorika [[Bhagavati|Bhagavathy]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ia802801.us.archive.org/27/items/ahandbookonkalaipayattuorg/A%20Handbook%20on%20Kalaipayattu%20Org.pdf%3C/ref%3E|title=A Handbook on Kalaripayattu|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The word Kalari is also found in [[Sangam literature]]. The ''[[Akananuru]]'' and ''[[Purananuru]]'' describe the use of spears, swords, shields, bows and [[silambam]] in the Sangam era. The word ''kalari'' also appears in the ''Puram'' (verses 225, 237, 245, 356) and ''Akam'' (verses 34, 231, 293) to describe both a battlefield and combat arena. The word ''kalari tatt'' denoted a martial feat, while ''kalari kozhai'' meant a coward in war. Each warrior in the Sangam era received regular military training<ref name=\"Subramanian, N. 1966\">Subramanian, N. (1966). ''[[iarchive:in.ernet.dli.2015.111129|Sangam polity]]''.

In that period and during later periods, the word used for military and military service was ''chevam''. The warriors or soldiers in military service were was called [[Chekavar]]. They specialized in one or more of the important weapons of the period including the spear (''vel''), sword (''val''), shield (''kedaham''), and bow and arrow (''vil ambu'').

Northern Kalaripayattu, or \"Vadakkan Kalari\" is based on elegant and flexible movements, evasions, jumps and weapons training, while the southern \"Thekkan Kalari\" style specializes in hard, impact based techniques with priority on hand-to-hand combat and pressure point strikes. Both systems make use of internal and external concepts. Warriors trained in Kalaripayattu would use very light, and basic body armor, as it was difficult to maintain flexibility and mobility while in heavy armor. Some of the methods used to enhance flexibility in Kalaripayattu are also utilized in Keralite dance forms such as Kathakali.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\" /> Dancers in Kerala who had experience with Kalaripayattu were noted to be markedly better than the other performers. Some traditional Indian dance schools still incorporate Kalaripayattu as part of their training regimen.\n\n== Techniques and teaching==\n[[File:JasmineSimhalan-kalaripayatt-silambam.gif|right|[[Jasmine Simhalan]] performing steps and postures<br />|frame]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu Vidhyarambham.jpg|thumb|Ritualistic ceremony by which a Guru welcomes a new child to the Kalari on [[Vidy\u0101ra\u1e43bha\u1e43]].<br />]]\n[[File:Kalari Poothara Pooja.jpg|thumb|''Kalari Poothara Pooja'' is a ritual performed in every kalari during the [[Navaratri]] festival to honour the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity [[Shiva]].]]\n\nTraditions and methods of teaching of Kalaripayattu varied between different regions of Kerala. Kalaripayattu is taught in a specialized training ground known as a ''Kalari.'' Each kalari is built in accordance to [[Hinduism|Hindu]] architectural treatises such as the [[Vastu shastra|Vastu Shastras]] and [[Shilpa Shastras]], along with various religious traditions and customs native to [[Kerala]]. The presiding deity of Kalaripayattu is said to be [[Shiva]] as well as [[Bhadrakali]]. Before every training session in the Kalari, salutations are provides to the presiding deities in the form of a [[mantra]], or prayer.\n\nKalari Salutation Mantra\u00a0:\n\n\u00a0\n\"\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35 \u0d24\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d38\u0d35\u0d30\u0d42\u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d2f\n\n\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35 \u0d24\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d38\u0d35\u0d30\u0d42\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d23\u0d3f\n\n\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d17\u0d3e\u0d2f\u0d38\u0d2e\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d25\u0d3e\u0d2f\n\n\u0d36\u0d3f\u0d35\u0d3e\u0d2f \u0d17\u0d41\u0d30\u0d41\u0d35\u0d35 \u0d28\u0d2e\u0d03\u201d\n\n(Sarva Thantra Swaroopaya\n\nSarva Thantra Swaroopini\n\nSarvagaya Samasthaya\n\nShivaya Guruve Namath)\n\nHistorically, all Keralites of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] community, men and women alike, would undergo mandatory training in Kalaripayattu beginning at the age of 7 or 9 and lasting until the end of their education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cvnkalari.in/training.html|title=....#CVN KALARI#....|website=cvnkalari.in|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>  Warriors, soldiers and others who wanted to pursue a martial career would continue their training for the rest of their lives. Generally, two styles of Kalaripayattu are acknowledged among Kalari practitioners: the Northern Style and the Southern Style.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://kalaripayattuclass.com/about-kalaripayattu/|title=About Kalaripayattu|website=Kalaripayattu Class|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>  These two systems are quite similar, but their training methods begin to diverge to specialize in either weapons or hand-to-hand combat. The styles are variations that various masters have adapted and modified according to their understanding of the art. Development and mastery of Kalaripayattu comes from the tradition of constantly learning, adapting and improving the techniques by observing what techniques are practical and effective. There is a great amount of respect and observation of tradition which allows the preservation of the art. The knowledge and experience gained by the practitioners is improved upon by subsequent masters who utilize keen observation, research of various techniques and variations to update the knowledge. The adaptability of Kalaripayattu is largely due to Kalaripayattu being designed for use in warfare and combat. A Kalari practitioner might encounter new fighting techniques from an enemy combatant. The Kalari practitioner would need to learn how to anticipate, adapt to and neutralize these new techniques. This is especially seen in the Southern style of Kalaripayattu, which is believed to have been adapted and modified during wars with [[Tamils|Tamil]] kingdoms to counter martial arts like [[Silambam]], which was one of the main martial art forms practiced by Tamil soldiers at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://silambam.org.in/|title=Indian Traditional Arts|last=Association (WSA)|first=World Silambam|date=2019-06-05|website=World Silambam Association (WSA)|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Kalaripayattu is ultimately taught not just as a martial art, but as a way of life that epitomizes respect, compassion and duty over all else.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://karmagroup.com/blog/kalaripayattu-original-martial-art/|title=Kalaripayattu: Original Martial Art from Kerala, India|date=2018-03-21|website=Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Northern style ===\nThe Northern style is also known as, ''Vadakkan Kalari'', and is generally regarded as the \"original,\" form of Kalaripayattu. This system places more emphasis on physical flexibility exercises and strength training rooted on the slogan ''Meyy kanavanam'', meaning, \"make the body an eye.\" These exercises are done individually, as well as in combinations. After that ''meypayattu'' (a concept similar to [[kata]] in Karate) is taught. These are a combination of flexibility exercises with offensive and defensive techniques, however, the actual techniques are taught very much later. Traditionally, the number of ''meypayattu'' may differ as per the teaching methods of the Guru. After the student learns meypayattu, stick fighting is taught. Generally, the majority of the ''Kalaris'' (schools that teach Kalaripayattu) start training with weapons within 3 to 6 months. Some Kalaris only allow one weapon to be learned per year. After long stick and small stick fighting, iron weapons are introduced. Training begins with the dagger, sword and then the spear. Not all modern schools use specialized weapons. Traditionally, bows and arrows were commonly used in Kerala and students were trained in these techniques, but is rarely taught today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerala.me/specialities/art-and-culture/kalaripayattu|title=Kalaripayattu {{!}} Art & Culture of Kerala {{!}} Kerala {{!}} Kerala|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nKalaripayattu has three forms, which are distinguished by their attacking and defensive patterns. They are ''Arappa Kayy'', ''Pilla Thangi'', and ''Vatten Thiripp''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onlinestore.dcbooks.com/authors/valappil-karunan-gurukkal|title=Kalarippayattile Kanakkukal Kalariprayogaprakaram|last=Karunan|first=Valappil|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Southern style ===\nThe Southern style is also known as ''Thekkan Kalari''. The origin of Thekkan Kalari is a subject of much debate and controversy. It is a style of Kalaripayattu that is said to have been altered and influenced by Sage Agastya. It may have been altered from the Northern style of Kalaripayattu to fight combatants trained in Adi Murai and [[Silambam]] from Tamil Nadu during various wars and skirmishes with Tamil kingdoms. It is essentially a style which combines Kalaripayattu with certain elements of Adi Murai and Silambam. Other sources suggest that martial arts such as Varma Kalai and Adi Thadi may also have influenced the Southern style. While the Southern style is less commonly practiced in Kerala compared to the Northern style, it is revered in Kerala as a combination of the teachings of both Parashurama and Agastya. It is predominantly practiced in some regions of the southern parts of Kerala, particularly in areas near [[Kanyakumari]]. While many of the exercises of the Southern style are identical to the Northern Style, it places heavy emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and hard impact techniques, and places less emphasis on weapons and combinations. It starts with the training in ''Chuvadus'': a system of various combinations of fighting techniques similar to [[Muay Thai]] and shadow boxing. Immediately after that, sparring with a partner is introduced as part of the training.  These pre-determined techniques are repeatedly trained. After a basic proficiency in unarmed combat is established, weapons training begins with a small stick. Small stick training is usually done with two combatants, armed with a stick or dagger. These are primarily defensive techniques. Fighting techniques with two combatants having the same weapons include sparring with long stick, sword, etc. During the duration of this training, the refining of un-armed combat also progresses. As the student gains more experience, a small amount of knowledge pertaining to the ''Marma'' points (pressure points) is also taught to the student if deemed appropriate by the Gurukkal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://agasthyakalari.org/html/kalari-kerala.htm|title=Agasthya Kalari - for Siddha Treatments, Kalari Marma Treatments and offers training in Kalari strictly based on ancient scripts - located in Cochin, Kerala, India|website=agasthyakalari.org|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nKalaripayattu techniques are a combination of steps (''Chuvadu'') and postures (''Vadivu''). ''Chuvadu'' literally means 'steps', the basic steps of the martial arts. ''Vadivu'' literally means 'postures' or stances which are the foundations of Kalaripayattu training. They are named after animals, and are usually presented in eight forms. Styles differ considerably from one tradition to another. Not only do the names of poses differ, but their utilization and interpretation vary depending on the Gurukkal's preference, and the traditions of the Kalari. Each stance has its own style, combination, and function. These techniques vary from one style to another.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\"/>{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[File:Kalaripayattuartist.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu artist passing through the double ring of fire.]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 3.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 2.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance|222x222px]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 1.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 4.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Kalariartist.jpg|thumb|A Kalaripayattu artist swishing his sword on fire.]]\n\n== Marmashastram and massage ==\n{{Main|Marmam}}\n[[File:Chavittithirumal.jpg|thumb|Chavittithirumal/massage]]\n\nIt is claimed that experienced Kalari warriors could disable or kill their opponents by merely striking the correct ''marmam'' (vital point) on their opponent's body. This technique is taught only to the most promising and level-headed students so as to discourage misuse of the technique. ''Marmashastram'' stresses on the knowledge of marmam and is also used for marma treatment (''marmachikitsa''). This system of marma treatment originated from [[Ayurveda]], as well as [[Siddha medicine]]. Critics of Kalaripayattu have pointed out that the application of marmam techniques against neutral outsiders has not always produced verifiable results.\n \nThe earliest mention of marmam is found in the ''[[Rig Veda]]'', where [[Indra]] is said to have defeated [[Vritra]] by attacking his ''marmam'' with a [[vajra]].<ref>Mariana Fedorova (1990).

Utah USA.</ref> With numerous other scattered references to vital points in Vedic and epic sources, it is certain that India's early martial artists knew about and practiced attacking or defending vital points.<ref name=Zarrilli1/> [[Sushruta]] (c. 6th century BC) identified and defined 107 vital points of the human body in his ''Sushruta Samhita''.<ref>G. D. Singhal, L. V. Guru (1973). ''Anatomical and Obstetrical Considerations in Ancient Indian Surgery Based on Sarira-Sthana of Susruta Samhita''.</ref> Of these 107 points, 64 were classified as being lethal if properly struck with a fist or stick.<ref name=\"Svinth\"/> Sushruta's work formed the basis of the medical discipline [[Ayurveda]], which was taught alongside various [[Indian martial arts]] that had an emphasis on vital points, such as [[Varma Kalai|Varma kalai]] and Marma adi.<ref name=Svinth/>\n\nAs a result of learning about the human body, Indian martial artists became knowledgeable in the fields of traditional medicine and massage. Kalaripayattu teachers often provide massages (''uzhichil'') with medicinal oils to their students in order to increase their physical flexibility or to treat muscle injuries encountered during practice. Such massages are generally termed ''thirumal'' and the unique massage given to increase flexibility is known as ''katcha thirumal''. It is said to be as sophisticated as the ''uzhichil'' treatment of Ayurveda. Kalaripayattu has borrowed extensively from [[Ayurveda]] and equally lends to it.\n\n== Documentaries ==\n* Among the earliest known [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmt0WTZfKI0 documentaries on Kalaripayattu] is a BBC documentary titled ''[[The Way of the Warrior (TV series)|The Way of the Warrior]]''.\n* Kalaripayattu was also documented in [[Fight Quest#Season 2|Season 2 of Fight Quest]].\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{See|List of Kalarippayattu films}}\n\nThe resurgence of public interest in Kalaripayattu began in the 1920s in [[Thalassery]], as part of a wave of rediscovery of the traditional arts throughout southern [[India]]<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\"/> and continued through the 1970s surge of general worldwide interest in martial arts.<ref name=\"Zarilli 92\">Zarrilli 1992</ref> It has featured in international and [[cinema of India|Indian films]] such as:\n#''[[Thacholi Othenan (film)]]'' (1964),\n#''[[Aromalunni]]''  (1972)\n#''[[Ondanondu Kaladalli]]'' ([[Kannada]]) (1978)\n#''[[Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha]]''  (1989)\n#''[[Asoka (2001 film)|Asoka]]'' (2001)\n#''[[The Myth (film)|The Myth]]'' (2005)\n#''[[The Last Legion]]'' (2007)\n#''[[Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja (film)]]'' (2009)\n#''[[Manasara]]'' (2010)\n# ''[[Urumi (film)]]'' (2011)\n# ''[[Commando (2013 film)|Commando]]'' (2013)\n# ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015)\n# ''[[Baaghi (2016 film)|Baaghi]]'' (2016)\n# ''[[Veeram (2016 film)|Veeram]]'' (2016)\n# ''[[Padmaavat]]'' (2018)\n# ''[[Kayamkulam Kochunni (2018 film)|Kayamkulam Kochunni]]'' (2018)\n# ''[[Junglee (2019 film)|Junglee]]'' (2019)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|India|Society|Martial arts}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Angampora]]\n*[[Banshay]]\n*[[Bataireacht]]\n*[[B\u014djutsu]]\n*[[Gatka]]\n*[[Adimurai]]\n*[[Indian martial arts]]\n*[[Kendo]]\n*[[Krabi\u2013krabong]]\n*[[Kuttu Varisai]]\n*[[Mardani khel]]\n*[[Silambam]]\n*[[Tahtib]]\n*[[Thang-ta]]\n*[[Varma kalai]]\n*[[Ankam]]\n*[[Kalarippayattu films]]\n*[[Kalarippayattu stick fighting]]\n*[[Malayali]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Balakrsnan, Pi (1995) ''Kalarippayattu: The ancient martial art of Kerala'', C.V.

Practitioners of Kalaripayattu possess intricate knowledge of pressure points on the human body and healing techniques that incorporate the knowledge of Ayurveda and Yoga. Students are taught the martial art as a way of life, with a sense of compassion, discipline, and respect toward the master, fellow-students, parents and the community. Particular emphasis is placed on avoiding confrontational situations and using the martial art only as a means of protection, when no other alternative is available.\n\nUnlike other parts of India, warriors in Kerala belonged to all castes.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1992\">{{cite journal|author=Zarrilli, Phillip B.|first=|date=|year=1992|title=To Heal and/or To Harm: The Vital Spots (Marmmam/Varmam) in Two South Indian Martial Traditions Part I: Focus on Kerala's Kalarippayattu|url=http://www.spa.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/healharm.html|journal=[[Journal of Asian Martial Arts]]|volume=1|issue=1|pages=|via=}}</ref> Women in Keralite society also underwent training in Kalaripayattu, and still do so to this day.

The legitimacy of this style is controversial due to its recent development and the lack of consensus of its existence amongst Kalaripayattu practitioners.<ref name=\"Luijendijk 08\" /> \n\nA smaller, regional style of Kalaripayattu called ''Tulunadan Kalari,'' is referenced in texts such as the [[Vadakkan Pattukal]], but it is largely restricted to the [[Tulu Nadu]] region in northern Kerala and southern Karnataka.\n\nOther smaller, regional styles are also said to exist in isolated regions of Kerala, but these styles are becoming increasingly rare, and difficult to find. \n\n== History ==\nThe word, \u201c''Kalaripayattu'',\u201d is said to be derived from the from the name of [[Hindu]] deity ''Khaloorika [[Bhagavati|Bhagavathy]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ia802801.us.archive.org/27/items/ahandbookonkalaipayattuorg/A%20Handbook%20on%20Kalaipayattu%20Org.pdf%3C/ref%3E|title=A Handbook on Kalaripayattu|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The word Kalari is also found in [[Sangam literature]]. The ''[[Akananuru]]'' and ''[[Purananuru]]'' describe the use of spears, swords, shields, bows and [[silambam]] in the Sangam era. The word ''kalari'' also appears in the ''Puram'' (verses 225, 237, 245, 356) and ''Akam'' (verses 34, 231, 293) to describe both a battlefield and combat arena. The word ''kalari tatt'' denoted a martial feat, while ''kalari kozhai'' meant a coward in war.

Northern Kalaripayattu, or \"Vadakkan Kalari\" is based on elegant and flexible movements, evasions, jumps and weapons training, while the southern \"Thekkan Kalari\" style specializes in hard, impact based techniques with priority on hand-to-hand combat and pressure point strikes. Both systems make use of internal and external concepts. Warriors trained in Kalaripayattu would use very light, and basic body armor, as it was difficult to maintain flexibility and mobility while in heavy armor. Some of the methods used to enhance flexibility in Kalaripayattu are also utilized in Keralite dance forms such as Kathakali.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\" /> Dancers in Kerala who had experience with Kalaripayattu were noted to be markedly better than the other performers. Some traditional Indian dance schools still incorporate Kalaripayattu as part of their training regimen.\n\n== Techniques and teaching==\n[[File:JasmineSimhalan-kalaripayatt-silambam.gif|right|[[Jasmine Simhalan]] performing steps and postures<br />|frame]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu Vidhyarambham.jpg|thumb|Ritualistic ceremony by which a Guru welcomes a new child to the Kalari on [[Vidy\u0101ra\u1e43bha\u1e43]].<br />]]\n[[File:Kalari Poothara Pooja.jpg|thumb|''Kalari Poothara Pooja'' is a ritual performed in every kalari during the [[Navaratri]] festival to honour the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity [[Shiva]].]]\n\nTraditions and methods of teaching of Kalaripayattu varied between different regions of Kerala. Kalaripayattu is taught in a specialized training ground known as a ''Kalari.'' Each kalari is built in accordance to [[Hinduism|Hindu]] architectural treatises such as the [[Vastu shastra|Vastu Shastras]] and [[Shilpa Shastras]], along with various religious traditions and customs native to [[Kerala]]. The presiding deity of Kalaripayattu is said to be [[Shiva]] as well as [[Bhadrakali]]. Before every training session in the Kalari, salutations are provides to the presiding deities in the form of a [[mantra]], or prayer.\n\nKalari Salutation Mantra\u00a0:\n\n\u00a0\n\"\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35 \u0d24\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d38\u0d35\u0d30\u0d42\u0d2a\u0d3e\u0d2f\n\n\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35 \u0d24\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d38\u0d35\u0d30\u0d42\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d23\u0d3f\n\n\u0d38\u0d7c\u0d35\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d17\u0d3e\u0d2f\u0d38\u0d2e\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d25\u0d3e\u0d2f\n\n\u0d36\u0d3f\u0d35\u0d3e\u0d2f \u0d17\u0d41\u0d30\u0d41\u0d35\u0d35 \u0d28\u0d2e\u0d03\u201d\n\n(Sarva Thantra Swaroopaya\n\nSarva Thantra Swaroopini\n\nSarvagaya Samasthaya\n\nShivaya Guruve Namath)\n\nHistorically, all Keralites of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] community, men and women alike, would undergo mandatory training in Kalaripayattu beginning at the age of 7 or 9 and lasting until the end of their education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cvnkalari.in/training.html|title=....#CVN KALARI#....|website=cvnkalari.in|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>  Warriors, soldiers and others who wanted to pursue a martial career would continue their training for the rest of their lives. Generally, two styles of Kalaripayattu are acknowledged among Kalari practitioners: the Northern Style and the Southern Style.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://kalaripayattuclass.com/about-kalaripayattu/|title=About Kalaripayattu|website=Kalaripayattu Class|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>  These two systems are quite similar, but their training methods begin to diverge to specialize in either weapons or hand-to-hand combat. The styles are variations that various masters have adapted and modified according to their understanding of the art. Development and mastery of Kalaripayattu comes from the tradition of constantly learning, adapting and improving the techniques by observing what techniques are practical and effective. There is a great amount of respect and observation of tradition which allows the preservation of the art. The knowledge and experience gained by the practitioners is improved upon by subsequent masters who utilize keen observation, research of various techniques and variations to update the knowledge. The adaptability of Kalaripayattu is largely due to Kalaripayattu being designed for use in warfare and combat. A Kalari practitioner might encounter new fighting techniques from an enemy combatant. The Kalari practitioner would need to learn how to anticipate, adapt to and neutralize these new techniques. This is especially seen in the Southern style of Kalaripayattu, which is believed to have been adapted and modified during wars with [[Tamils|Tamil]] kingdoms to counter martial arts like [[Silambam]], which was one of the main martial art forms practiced by Tamil soldiers at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://silambam.org.in/|title=Indian Traditional Arts|last=Association (WSA)|first=World Silambam|date=2019-06-05|website=World Silambam Association (WSA)|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Kalaripayattu is ultimately taught not just as a martial art, but as a way of life that epitomizes respect, compassion and duty over all else.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://karmagroup.com/blog/kalaripayattu-original-martial-art/|title=Kalaripayattu: Original Martial Art from Kerala, India|date=2018-03-21|website=Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Northern style ===\nThe Northern style is also known as, ''Vadakkan Kalari'', and is generally regarded as the \"original,\" form of Kalaripayattu. This system places more emphasis on physical flexibility exercises and strength training rooted on the slogan ''Meyy kanavanam'', meaning, \"make the body an eye.\" These exercises are done individually, as well as in combinations. After that ''meypayattu'' (a concept similar to [[kata]] in Karate) is taught. These are a combination of flexibility exercises with offensive and defensive techniques, however, the actual techniques are taught very much later. Traditionally, the number of ''meypayattu'' may differ as per the teaching methods of the Guru. After the student learns meypayattu, stick fighting is taught. Generally, the majority of the ''Kalaris'' (schools that teach Kalaripayattu) start training with weapons within 3 to 6 months. Some Kalaris only allow one weapon to be learned per year. After long stick and small stick fighting, iron weapons are introduced. Training begins with the dagger, sword and then the spear. Not all modern schools use specialized weapons. Traditionally, bows and arrows were commonly used in Kerala and students were trained in these techniques, but is rarely taught today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerala.me/specialities/art-and-culture/kalaripayattu|title=Kalaripayattu {{!}} Art & Culture of Kerala {{!}} Kerala {{!}} Kerala|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nKalaripayattu has three forms, which are distinguished by their attacking and defensive patterns. They are ''Arappa Kayy'', ''Pilla Thangi'', and ''Vatten Thiripp''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onlinestore.dcbooks.com/authors/valappil-karunan-gurukkal|title=Kalarippayattile Kanakkukal Kalariprayogaprakaram|last=Karunan|first=Valappil|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Southern style ===\nThe Southern style is also known as ''Thekkan Kalari''. The origin of Thekkan Kalari is a subject of much debate and controversy. It is a style of Kalaripayattu that is said to have been altered and influenced by Sage Agastya. It may have been altered from the Northern style of Kalaripayattu to fight combatants trained in Adi Murai and [[Silambam]] from Tamil Nadu during various wars and skirmishes with Tamil kingdoms. It is essentially a style which combines Kalaripayattu with certain elements of Adi Murai and Silambam. Other sources suggest that martial arts such as Varma Kalai and Adi Thadi may also have influenced the Southern style. While the Southern style is less commonly practiced in Kerala compared to the Northern style, it is revered in Kerala as a combination of the teachings of both Parashurama and Agastya. It is predominantly practiced in some regions of the southern parts of Kerala, particularly in areas near [[Kanyakumari]]. While many of the exercises of the Southern style are identical to the Northern Style, it places heavy emphasis on hand-to-hand combat and hard impact techniques, and places less emphasis on weapons and combinations. It starts with the training in ''Chuvadus'': a system of various combinations of fighting techniques similar to [[Muay Thai]] and shadow boxing. Immediately after that, sparring with a partner is introduced as part of the training.  These pre-determined techniques are repeatedly trained. After a basic proficiency in unarmed combat is established, weapons training begins with a small stick. Small stick training is usually done with two combatants, armed with a stick or dagger. These are primarily defensive techniques. Fighting techniques with two combatants having the same weapons include sparring with long stick, sword, etc. During the duration of this training, the refining of un-armed combat also progresses. As the student gains more experience, a small amount of knowledge pertaining to the ''Marma'' points (pressure points) is also taught to the student if deemed appropriate by the Gurukkal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://agasthyakalari.org/html/kalari-kerala.htm|title=Agasthya Kalari - for Siddha Treatments, Kalari Marma Treatments and offers training in Kalari strictly based on ancient scripts - located in Cochin, Kerala, India|website=agasthyakalari.org|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\nKalaripayattu techniques are a combination of steps (''Chuvadu'') and postures (''Vadivu''). ''Chuvadu'' literally means 'steps', the basic steps of the martial arts. ''Vadivu'' literally means 'postures' or stances which are the foundations of Kalaripayattu training. They are named after animals, and are usually presented in eight forms. Styles differ considerably from one tradition to another. Not only do the names of poses differ, but their utilization and interpretation vary depending on the Gurukkal's preference, and the traditions of the Kalari. Each stance has its own style, combination, and function. These techniques vary from one style to another.<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\"/>{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[File:Kalaripayattuartist.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu artist passing through the double ring of fire.]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 3.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 2.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance|222x222px]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 1.jpg|thumb|Kalaripayattu performance]]\n[[File:Kalaripayattu performance 4.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Kalariartist.jpg|thumb|A Kalaripayattu artist swishing his sword on fire.]]\n\n== Marmashastram and massage ==\n{{Main|Marmam}}\n[[File:Chavittithirumal.jpg|thumb|Chavittithirumal/massage]]\n\nIt is claimed that experienced Kalari warriors could disable or kill their opponents by merely striking the correct ''marmam'' (vital point) on their opponent's body. This technique is taught only to the most promising and level-headed students so as to discourage misuse of the technique. ''Marmashastram'' stresses on the knowledge of marmam and is also used for marma treatment (''marmachikitsa''). This system of marma treatment originated from [[Ayurveda]], as well as [[Siddha medicine]]. Critics of Kalaripayattu have pointed out that the application of marmam techniques against neutral outsiders has not always produced verifiable results.\n \nThe earliest mention of marmam is found in the ''[[Rig Veda]]'', where [[Indra]] is said to have defeated [[Vritra]] by attacking his ''marmam'' with a [[vajra]].<ref>Mariana Fedorova (1990).

Utah USA.</ref> With numerous other scattered references to vital points in Vedic and epic sources, it is certain that India's early martial artists knew about and practiced attacking or defending vital points.<ref name=Zarrilli1/> [[Sushruta]] (c. 6th century BC) identified and defined 107 vital points of the human body in his ''Sushruta Samhita''.<ref>G. D. Singhal, L. V. Guru (1973). ''Anatomical and Obstetrical Considerations in Ancient Indian Surgery Based on Sarira-Sthana of Susruta Samhita''.</ref> Of these 107 points, 64 were classified as being lethal if properly struck with a fist or stick.<ref name=\"Svinth\"/> Sushruta's work formed the basis of the medical discipline [[Ayurveda]], which was taught alongside various [[Indian martial arts]] that had an emphasis on vital points, such as [[Varma Kalai|Varma kalai]] and Marma adi.<ref name=Svinth/>\n\nAs a result of learning about the human body, Indian martial artists became knowledgeable in the fields of traditional medicine and massage. Kalaripayattu teachers often provide massages (''uzhichil'') with medicinal oils to their students in order to increase their physical flexibility or to treat muscle injuries encountered during practice. Such massages are generally termed ''thirumal'' and the unique massage given to increase flexibility is known as ''katcha thirumal''. It is said to be as sophisticated as the ''uzhichil'' treatment of Ayurveda. Kalaripayattu has borrowed extensively from [[Ayurveda]] and equally lends to it.\n\n== Documentaries ==\n* Among the earliest known [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmt0WTZfKI0 documentaries on Kalaripayattu] is a BBC documentary titled ''[[The Way of the Warrior (TV series)|The Way of the Warrior]]''.\n* Kalaripayattu was also documented in [[Fight Quest#Season 2|Season 2 of Fight Quest]].\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{See|List of Kalarippayattu films}}\n\nThe resurgence of public interest in Kalaripayattu began in the 1920s in [[Thalassery]], as part of a wave of rediscovery of the traditional arts throughout southern [[India]]<ref name=\"Zarrilli1998\"/> and continued through the 1970s surge of general worldwide interest in martial arts.<ref name=\"Zarilli 92\">Zarrilli 1992</ref> It has featured in international and [[cinema of India|Indian films]] such as:\n#''[[Thacholi Othenan (film)]]'' (1964),\n#''[[Aromalunni]]''  (1972)\n#''[[Ondanondu Kaladalli]]'' ([[Kannada]]) (1978)\n#''[[Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha]]''  (1989)\n#''[[Asoka (2001 film)|Asoka]]'' (2001)\n#''[[The Myth (film)|The Myth]]'' (2005)\n#''[[The Last Legion]]'' (2007)\n#''[[Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja (film)]]'' (2009)\n#''[[Manasara]]'' (2010)\n# ''[[Urumi (film)]]'' (2011)\n# ''[[Commando (2013 film)|Commando]]'' (2013)\n# ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]'' (2015)\n# ''[[Baaghi (2016 film)|Baaghi]]'' (2016)\n# ''[[Veeram (2016 film)|Veeram]]'' (2016)\n# ''[[Padmaavat]]'' (2018)\n# ''[[Kayamkulam Kochunni (2018 film)|Kayamkulam Kochunni]]'' (2018)\n# ''[[Junglee (2019 film)|Junglee]]'' (2019)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|India|Society|Martial arts}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Angampora]]\n*[[Banshay]]\n*[[Bataireacht]]\n*[[B\u014djutsu]]\n*[[Gatka]]\n*[[Adimurai]]\n*[[Indian martial arts]]\n*[[Kendo]]\n*[[Krabi\u2013krabong]]\n*[[Kuttu Varisai]]\n*[[Mardani khel]]\n*[[Silambam]]\n*[[Tahtib]]\n*[[Thang-ta]]\n*[[Varma kalai]]\n*[[Ankam]]\n*[[Kalarippayattu films]]\n*[[Kalarippayattu stick fighting]]\n*[[Malayali]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Balakrsnan, Pi (1995) ''Kalarippayattu: The ancient martial art of Kerala'', C.V.
