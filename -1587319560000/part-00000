They are occasionally called '''''North Caspian''''', as opposed to ''North Pontic'' for the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]]. \n\n==Name of the family==\nSeveral names have been in use for this family. The most common term, ''Northeast Caucasian,'' contrasts the three established families of the Caucasus language area: ''Northeast Caucasian, [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]'' (Abkhaz\u2013Adyghean), and ''South Caucasian'' ([[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]]). This may be shortened to ''East Caucasian''. The term ''Nakh(o)-Dagestanian'' can be taken to reflect a primary division of the family into Nakh and Dagestanian branches, a view which is no longer widely accepted, or ''Dagestanian'' can subsume the entire family. The rare term ''North Caspian'' (as in bordering the Caspian Sea) is only used in opposition to the use of ''North Pontic'' (as in bordering the Black Sea) for the Northwest Caucasian languages.\n\n==Linguistic features==\n\n===Phonology===\nHistorically, Northeast Caucasian phonemic inventories were thought to be significantly smaller than those of the neighboring [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian family]].  However, more recent research has revealed that many Northeast Caucasian languages are much more phoneme-rich than previously believed, with some languages containing as many as 70 consonants.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europaq|location=Munich|page=49}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to numerous oral obstruents, many Northeast Caucasian languages also possess a number of back consonants, including [[uvular consonant|uvulars]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeals]], and glottal stops and fricatives. Northeast Caucasian phonology is also notable for its use of numerous [[secondary articulation]]s as contrastive features. Whereas English consonant classes are divided into voiced and voiceless phonemes, Northeast Caucasian languages are known to contrast phones into voiced, voiceless, [[ejective consonants|ejective]], and [[fortis and lenis|tense]] variants, which contributes to their large phonemic inventories. Some languages also include palatalization and labialization as contrastive features.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich|pages=49\u201354}}</ref> Most languages in this family contrast tense and weak consonants. Tense consonants are characterized by the intensiveness of articulation, which naturally leads to a lengthening of these consonants.\n\nIn contrast to the generally large consonant inventories of Northeast Caucasian languages, most languages in the family have relatively few vowels, although more on average than the Northwest Caucasian Languages.<ref name=\"Matthews 1951 88\">{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=W.K.|title=Languages of the U.S.S.R.|year=1951|publisher=Russel & Russel|location=New York|page=88}}</ref>  However, there are some exceptions to this trend, such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]], which has at least twenty-eight vowels, diphthongs, and triphthongs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|page=58}}</ref>\n\n{{Pie chart|label1=[[Chechen language|Chechen]]|value1=33.6|label2=[[Avar language|Avar]]|value2=18.9|label3=[[Lezgian language|Lezgian]]|value3=16.3|label4=[[Dargwa language|Dargwa]]|value4=12.1|label5=[[Ingush language|Ingush]]|value5=8.0|label6=[[Lak language|Lak]]|value6=3.8|label7=Others|value7=7.3|caption=Percentage of Northeast Caucasian languages by speakers}}\n\n===Morphology===\nThese languages can be characterized by strong [[suffix]]al [[agglutination]]. Weak tendencies towards [[inflection]] may be noted as well. [[Noun]]s display covert [[Noun class|nominal classification]], but partially overt cases of secondary origin can be observed too. The number of noun classes in individual languages range from two to eight. Regarding [[grammatical number]], there may be a distinction between singular and [[plural]], plurality itself may impact the class to which a noun belongs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich|page=80}}</ref> In some cases, a grammatical [[collective number|collective]] is seen. Many languages distinguish ''[[List of grammatical cases#Place and time|local]]'' versus ''functional'' cases,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich|pages=81\u201382}}</ref> and to some degree also ''[[nominative case|casus rectus]]'' versus ''[[oblique case|casus obliquus]]''.\n\nThe inflectional paradigms are often based on partially classifying productive [[word stem|stem]] extensions ([[absolutive case|absolutive]], and [[oblique case|oblique]], [[ergative case|ergative]], and [[genitive case|genitive]] inflection.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} Localization is mostly conveyed by [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], but it can be also partly based on [[preverb]]s. [[Noun phrase]]s exhibit incomplete class [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], group inflection{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} (on the noun) with partial [[Noun adjunct|attributive]] oblique marking, which may, in turn, carry a partially [[determiner (linguistics)|determining]] function.\n\n====Ergativity====\n\nMost Northeast Caucasian languages exhibit an [[ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative\u2013absolutive morphology]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=R.M.W.|title=Studies in Ergativity|year=1987|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.|location=Amsterdam|page=133}}</ref>  This means that objects of transitive sentences and subjects of intransitive sentences both fall into a single grammatical case known as the absolutive.  Subjects of transitive sentences, however, carry a different marking to indicate that they belong to a separate case, known as the ergative.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Valen|first=Robert D.|title=Grammatical Relations in Ergative Languages|journal=Studies in Language|year=1981|volume=5|issue=3|pages=361\u2013394|url=http://linguistics.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/vanvalin/rrg/Van%20Valin%20Grammatical%20Relations%20in%20ergative%20languages.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2013|doi=10.1075/sl.5.3.05van}}</ref>   This distinction can be seen in the following two Archi sentences.

They are occasionally called '''''North Caspian''''', as opposed to ''North Pontic'' for the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]]. \n\n==Name of the family==\nSeveral names have been in use for this family. The most common term, ''Northeast Caucasian,'' contrasts the three established families of the Caucasus language area: ''Northeast Caucasian, [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]'' (Abkhaz\u2013Adyghean), and ''South Caucasian'' ([[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]]). This may be shortened to ''East Caucasian''. The term ''Nakh(o)-Dagestanian'' can be taken to reflect a primary division of the family into Nakh and Dagestanian branches, a view which is no longer widely accepted, or ''Dagestanian'' can subsume the entire family. The rare term ''North Caspian'' (as in bordering the Caspian Sea) is only used in opposition to the use of ''North Pontic'' (as in bordering the Black Sea) for the Northwest Caucasian languages.\n\n==Linguistic features==\n\n===Phonology===\nHistorically, Northeast Caucasian phonemic inventories were thought to be significantly smaller than those of the neighboring [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian family]].  However, more recent research has revealed that many Northeast Caucasian languages are much more phoneme-rich than previously believed, with some languages containing as many as 70 consonants.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europaq|location=Munich|page=49}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to numerous oral obstruents, many Northeast Caucasian languages also possess a number of back consonants, including [[uvular consonant|uvulars]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeals]], and glottal stops and fricatives. Northeast Caucasian phonology is also notable for its use of numerous [[secondary articulation]]s as contrastive features. Whereas English consonant classes are divided into voiced and voiceless phonemes, Northeast Caucasian languages are known to contrast phones into voiced, voiceless, [[ejective consonants|ejective]], and [[fortis and lenis|tense]] variants, which contributes to their large phonemic inventories. Some languages also include palatalization and labialization as contrastive features.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich|pages=49\u201354}}</ref> Most languages in this family contrast tense and weak consonants. Tense consonants are characterized by the intensiveness of articulation, which naturally leads to a lengthening of these consonants.\n\nIn contrast to the generally large consonant inventories of Northeast Caucasian languages, most languages in the family have relatively few vowels, although more on average than the Northwest Caucasian Languages.<ref name=\"Matthews 1951 88\">{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=W.K.|title=Languages of the U.S.S.R.|year=1951|publisher=Russel & Russel|location=New York|page=88}}</ref>  However, there are some exceptions to this trend, such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]], which has at least twenty-eight vowels, diphthongs, and triphthongs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|page=58}}</ref>\n\n{{Pie chart|label1=[[Chechen language|Chechen]]|value1=33.6|label2=[[Avar language|Avar]]|value2=18.9|label3=[[Lezgian language|Lezgian]]|value3=16.3|label4=[[Dargwa language|Dargwa]]|value4=12.1|label5=[[Ingush language|Ingush]]|value5=8.0|label6=[[Lak language|Lak]]|value6=3.8|label7=Others|value7=7.3|caption=Percentage of Northeast Caucasian languages by speakers}}\n\n===Morphology===\nThese languages can be characterized by strong [[suffix]]al [[agglutination]]. Weak tendencies towards [[inflection]] may be noted as well. [[Noun]]s display covert [[Noun class|nominal classification]], but partially overt cases of secondary origin can be observed too. The number of noun classes in individual languages range from two to eight. Regarding [[grammatical number]], there may be a distinction between singular and [[plural]], plurality itself may impact the class to which a noun belongs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich|page=80}}</ref> In some cases, a grammatical [[collective number|collective]] is seen. Many languages distinguish ''[[List of grammatical cases#Place and time|local]]'' versus ''functional'' cases,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=George|title=Introduction to the Study of the Languages of the Caucasus|year=2004|publisher=Lincom Europa|location=Munich|pages=81\u201382}}</ref> and to some degree also ''[[nominative case|casus rectus]]'' versus ''[[oblique case|casus obliquus]]''.\n\nThe inflectional paradigms are often based on partially classifying productive [[word stem|stem]] extensions ([[absolutive case|absolutive]], and [[oblique case|oblique]], [[ergative case|ergative]], and [[genitive case|genitive]] inflection.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} Localization is mostly conveyed by [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], but it can be also partly based on [[preverb]]s. [[Noun phrase]]s exhibit incomplete class [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], group inflection{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} (on the noun) with partial [[Noun adjunct|attributive]] oblique marking, which may, in turn, carry a partially [[determiner (linguistics)|determining]] function.\n\n====Ergativity====\n\nMost Northeast Caucasian languages exhibit an [[ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative\u2013absolutive morphology]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=R.M.W.|title=Studies in Ergativity|year=1987|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.|location=Amsterdam|page=133}}</ref>  This means that objects of transitive sentences and subjects of intransitive sentences both fall into a single grammatical case known as the absolutive.

While hunting with William, Caleb asks if Samuel's unbaptized soul will reach [[Heaven]]. William encourages Caleb to not raise the question and later reveals to Caleb that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her cup and suspects her to be responsible for Samuel's abduction. After the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family.\n\nEarly the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check a trap in the forest and forces him to take her with him by threatening to awaken their parents. In the woods, the two spot a hare, which sends their horse into a panic and their dog Fowler promptly chases. Caleb pursues, while the horse throws Thomasin off, knocking her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon Fowler's disemboweled body. Deep in the woods, he comes across a hovel, where a beautiful young woman emerges and seduces him.  Once Caleb is close enough, however, the woman's arm becomes old and decrepit and grabs Caleb. William finds Thomasin and takes her home where Katherine angrily chastises Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods before William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's cup. Katherine does not allow Thomasin the chance to explain that she was there to help keep watch over Caleb.\n\nLater that evening, Caleb has found his way home and Thomasin discovers him outdoors in the rain, naked and delirious from an unknown illness. When he awakens the next day, Caleb expels a bloody apple from his mouth; Katherine believes it to be [[Christian views on witchcraft|witchcraft]]. Caleb passionately proclaims his love to Christ before he dies, though Katherine believes Caleb to have been under some sort of spell. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft and, in retaliation, Thomasin reveals to the parents that the twins have had conversations with Black Phillip, the family's [[British primitive goat|billy goat]]. Enraged, William boards both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house. Thomasin overhears William break down and confess to God that he has been [[pride]]ful and made his family leave their old village out of stubbornness rather than sincere religious devotion. Later in the night, the three children are woken by the sounds of rustling in the goat house and discover an old woman drinking milk from the goats. Meanwhile, inside the house, Katherine awakens to a vision of Caleb holding Samuel. After a brief discussion, Caleb offers Samuel to Katherine so she may breast feed the baby but the baby is shown to be in fact a crow that is pecking away at her breast.\n\nThe next day William awakens and walks outside to find the stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with blood-stained hands. As Thomasin awakens, Black Phillip gores William before her eyes. An unhinged Katherine, who now blames Thomasin for the tragedies that have beset the family and accusing her of trying to seduce William and Caleb, attacks Thomasin, who kills her mother with a cleaver in self-defense.\n\nAlone, Thomasin enters the stable and urges Black Phillip to speak to her. The goat responds by asking if Thomasin would like to \"live deliciously\" and materializes into a [[Satan|tall, devilishly handsome, black-clad man]]. Black Phillip orders Thomasin to remove her clothes and to sign her name in a book that appears before her. Thomasin follows Black Phillip into the forest, where she joins a [[coven]] of witches holding a [[Witches' Sabbath]] around a bonfire. The coven begins to levitate and a laughing Thomasin joins them, ascending above the trees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] as Thomasin\n* [[Ralph Ineson]] as William\n* [[Kate Dickie]] as Katherine\n* Harvey Scrimshaw as Caleb\n* Ellie Grainger as Mercy\n* Lucas Dawson as Jonas\n* [[Julian Richings]] as The Governor\n* Bathsheba Garnett as Witch\n* [[Sarah Stephens]] as Young Witch\n* Charlie as Black Phillip (goat form)<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/black-phillip-real-story-behind-871974 |title=Black Phillip: The Real Story Behind the Breakout Goat From 'The Witch' |date=March 2, 2016 |last=Abramovitch |first=Seth |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref>\n* Wahab Chaudhry as Black Phillip (voice, human form)\n* Axtun Henry Dube and Athan Conrad Dube as Samuel\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nEggers, who was born in New Hampshire, was inspired to write the film by his childhood fascination with [[witchcraft|witches]] and frequent visits to the [[Plimoth Plantation]] as a schoolboy.

The family builds a farm near a large, secluded forest and Katherine has a newborn child, Samuel.

While hunting with William, Caleb asks if Samuel's unbaptized soul will reach [[Heaven]]. William encourages Caleb to not raise the question and later reveals to Caleb that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her cup and suspects her to be responsible for Samuel's abduction. After the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family.\n\nEarly the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check a trap in the forest and forces him to take her with him by threatening to awaken their parents. In the woods, the two spot a hare, which sends their horse into a panic and their dog Fowler promptly chases. Caleb pursues, while the horse throws Thomasin off, knocking her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon Fowler's disemboweled body. Deep in the woods, he comes across a hovel, where a beautiful young woman emerges and seduces him.  Once Caleb is close enough, however, the woman's arm becomes old and decrepit and grabs Caleb. William finds Thomasin and takes her home where Katherine angrily chastises Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods before William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's cup. Katherine does not allow Thomasin the chance to explain that she was there to help keep watch over Caleb.\n\nLater that evening, Caleb has found his way home and Thomasin discovers him outdoors in the rain, naked and delirious from an unknown illness. When he awakens the next day, Caleb expels a bloody apple from his mouth; Katherine believes it to be [[Christian views on witchcraft|witchcraft]]. Caleb passionately proclaims his love to Christ before he dies, though Katherine believes Caleb to have been under some sort of spell. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft and, in retaliation, Thomasin reveals to the parents that the twins have had conversations with Black Phillip, the family's [[British primitive goat|billy goat]]. Enraged, William boards both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house. Thomasin overhears William break down and confess to God that he has been [[pride]]ful and made his family leave their old village out of stubbornness rather than sincere religious devotion. Later in the night, the three children are woken by the sounds of rustling in the goat house and discover an old woman drinking milk from the goats. Meanwhile, inside the house, Katherine awakens to a vision of Caleb holding Samuel. After a brief discussion, Caleb offers Samuel to Katherine so she may breast feed the baby but the baby is shown to be in fact a crow that is pecking away at her breast.\n\nThe next day William awakens and walks outside to find the stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with blood-stained hands. As Thomasin awakens, Black Phillip gores William before her eyes. An unhinged Katherine, who now blames Thomasin for the tragedies that have beset the family and accusing her of trying to seduce William and Caleb, attacks Thomasin, who kills her mother with a cleaver in self-defense.\n\nAlone, Thomasin enters the stable and urges Black Phillip to speak to her. The goat responds by asking if Thomasin would like to \"live deliciously\" and materializes into a [[Satan|tall, devilishly handsome, black-clad man]]. Black Phillip orders Thomasin to remove her clothes and to sign her name in a book that appears before her. Thomasin follows Black Phillip into the forest, where she joins a [[coven]] of witches holding a [[Witches' Sabbath]] around a bonfire.

{"title_page": "Hydrogen safety", "text_new": "{{Globalize|date=July 2011}}\n'''Hydrogen safety''' covers the safe production, handling and use of [[hydrogen]] - particularly [[hydrogen gas]] fuel and [[liquid hydrogen]].  The main concern in working with hydrogen is [[flammability]].\n\nHydrogen possesses the [[NFPA 704]]'s highest rating of 4 on the flammability scale because it is flammable when mixed even in small amounts with ordinary air;  ignition can occur at a volumetric ratio of hydrogen to air as low as 4% due to the oxygen in the air and the simplicity and chemical properties of the reaction.  However, hydrogen has no rating for innate hazard for [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] or [[toxicity]].  The storage and use of hydrogen poses unique challenges due to its ease of leaking as a [[gaseous]] fuel, low-[[energy]] [[Combustion|ignition]], wide range of combustible fuel-air mixtures, [[buoyancy]], and its ability to [[hydrogen embrittlement|embrittle metals]] that must be accounted for to ensure safe operation. [[Liquid hydrogen]] poses additional challenges due to its increased [[density]] and the extremely low [[temperature]]s needed to keep it in liquid form.\n\n{{NFPA 704|Health = 0|Flammability = 4|Reactivity = 0|S= SA |caption=The fire diamond hazard sign for both elemental hydrogen gas and its isotope [[deuterium]].<ref>http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/8729</ref><ref>http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/3073</ref>}}\n\n==Summary==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n* For over 40 years, [[industry]] has used hydrogen in vast quantities as an industrial [[chemical]] and [[fuel]] for [[space exploration]]. During that time, industry has developed an infrastructure to produce, store, transport and utilize hydrogen safely.\n*Hydrogen gas is an extremely high-powered fuel.  It burns with incredible speed and can produce incredible force and is used mostly for applications that require vast amounts of instantaneous power - such as [[rocket]]ry and [[spaceflight]].  For instance, it was used to power the [[Space Shuttle]].\n*Liquid hydrogen is sometimes used as an extremely condensed hydrogen fuel.\n*Gaseous hydrogen can be used as a [[coolant]] for electric generators in power stations.  This is because of its high thermal conductivity and low \"windage\", so reducing frictional and turbulence losses.\n*Hydrogen is also used as a feedstock in industrial processes including production of [[ammonia]] and [[methanol]].\n\n==Hydrogen codes and standards==\n[[Hydrogen codes and standards]] are [[Code (law)|code]]s and [[Technical standard|standards]] (RCS) for [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell vehicle]]s, [[stationary fuel cell applications]] and [[portable fuel cell applications]].\n\nAdditional to the codes and standards for [[hydrogen technology]] products, there are codes and standards for hydrogen safety, for the safe handling of hydrogen<ref>[http://www.hysafe.org/download/1710/HYSAFE_D113_version_1.1.pdf HySafe Initial Guidance for Using Hydrogen in Confined Spaces].

By comparison, natural gas is also odorless, colorless and tasteless, but industry adds a sulfur-containing odorant called a mercaptan to make it detectable by people. Currently, all known odorants contaminate fuel cells (a popular application for hydrogen). However, given hydrogen's tendency to rise quickly, a hydrogen leak indoors would briefly collect on the ceiling and eventually move towards the corners and away from places where people might be exposed to it. For that and other reasons, industry often uses hydrogen sensors to help detect hydrogen leaks and has maintained a high safety record using them for decades. Researchers are investigating other methods that might be used for hydrogen detection: tracers, new odorant technology, advanced sensors and others.<ref>http://www.arhab.org/pdfs/h2_safety_fsheet.pdf</ref>\n* Hydrogen leaks can support combustion at very low flow rates, as low as 4 micrograms/s.<ref>M.S.

Axelbaum, Limits for Hydrogen Leaks that Can Support Stable Flames, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy 34 (2009) 5174\u20135182.</ref>\n\n===Liquid hydrogen===\n* \"Condensed and solidified atmospheric air, or trace air accumulated in manufacturing, contaminates [[liquid hydrogen]], thereby forming an unstable mixture. This mixture may detonate with effects similar to those produced by [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) and other highly explosive materials\"\n\nLiquid Hydrogen requires complex storage technology such as the special thermally insulated containers and requires special handling common to all [[cryogenic]] substances. This is similar to, but more severe than [[liquid oxygen]].  Even with thermally insulated containers it is difficult to keep such a low temperature, and the hydrogen will gradually leak away. (Typically it will evaporate at a rate of 1% per day.<ref>Peter Kushnir.

Vol. 32, Issue 3, May\u2013June 2000. almc.army.mil.</ref>)\n\n== Prevention ==\n\nHydrogen collects under roofs and overhangs, where it forms an explosion hazard; any building that contains a potential source of hydrogen should have good ventilation, strong ignition suppression systems for all electric devices, and preferably be designed to have a roof that can be safely blown away from the rest of the structure in an explosion.  It also enters pipes and can follow them to their destinations.  Hydrogen pipes should be located above other pipes to prevent this occurrence.  [[Hydrogen sensor]]s allow for rapid detection of hydrogen leaks to ensure that the hydrogen can be vented and the source of the leak tracked down.  As in natural gas, an [[hydrogen odorant|odorant]] can be added to hydrogen sources to enable leaks to be detected by smell. While hydrogen flames can be hard to see with the naked eye, they show up readily on UV/IR [[flame detector]]s. More recently Multi IR detectors have been developed, which have even faster detection on hydrogen-flames.[https://www.fg-detection.com/flamespec-ir3-h2 1][https://www.spectrex.net/en-us/flame-gas-detectors/flame-detectors/40-40-series/40-40m-multi-ir-flame-detector 2] Chemo-chromic indicators can be added to silicone tapes for hydrogen detection purposes.

The main concern in working with hydrogen is [[flammability]].\n\nHydrogen possesses the [[NFPA 704]]'s highest rating of 4 on the flammability scale because it is flammable when mixed even in small amounts with ordinary air;  ignition can occur at a volumetric ratio of hydrogen to air as low as 4% due to the oxygen in the air and the simplicity and chemical properties of the reaction.  However, hydrogen has no rating for innate hazard for [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] or [[toxicity]].  The storage and use of hydrogen poses unique challenges due to its ease of leaking as a [[gaseous]] fuel, low-[[energy]] [[Combustion|ignition]], wide range of combustible fuel-air mixtures, [[buoyancy]], and its ability to [[hydrogen embrittlement|embrittle metals]] that must be accounted for to ensure safe operation. [[Liquid hydrogen]] poses additional challenges due to its increased [[density]] and the extremely low [[temperature]]s needed to keep it in liquid form.\n\n{{NFPA 704|Health = 0|Flammability = 4|Reactivity = 0|S= SA |caption=The fire diamond hazard sign for both elemental hydrogen gas and its isotope [[deuterium]].<ref>http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/8729</ref><ref>http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/3073</ref>}}\n\n==Summary==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n* For over 40 years, [[industry]] has used hydrogen in vast quantities as an industrial [[chemical]] and [[fuel]] for [[space exploration]]. During that time, industry has developed an infrastructure to produce, store, transport and utilize hydrogen safely.\n*Hydrogen gas is an extremely high-powered fuel.  It burns with incredible speed and can produce incredible force and is used mostly for applications that require vast amounts of instantaneous power - such as [[rocket]]ry and [[spaceflight]].  For instance, it was used to power the [[Space Shuttle]].\n*Liquid hydrogen is sometimes used as an extremely condensed hydrogen fuel.\n*Gaseous hydrogen can be used as a [[coolant]] for electric generators in power stations.  This is because of its high thermal conductivity and low \"windage\", so reducing frictional and turbulence losses.\n*Hydrogen is also used as a feedstock in industrial processes including production of [[ammonia]] and [[methanol]].\n\n==Hydrogen codes and standards==\n[[Hydrogen codes and standards]] are [[Code (law)|code]]s and [[Technical standard|standards]] (RCS) for [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell vehicle]]s, [[stationary fuel cell applications]] and [[portable fuel cell applications]].\n\nAdditional to the codes and standards for [[hydrogen technology]] products, there are codes and standards for hydrogen safety, for the safe handling of hydrogen<ref>[http://www.hysafe.org/download/1710/HYSAFE_D113_version_1.1.pdf HySafe Initial Guidance for Using Hydrogen in Confined Spaces].

By comparison, natural gas is also odorless, colorless and tasteless, but industry adds a sulfur-containing odorant called a mercaptan to make it detectable by people. Currently, all known odorants contaminate fuel cells (a popular application for hydrogen). However, given hydrogen's tendency to rise quickly, a hydrogen leak indoors would briefly collect on the ceiling and eventually move towards the corners and away from places where people might be exposed to it. For that and other reasons, industry often uses hydrogen sensors to help detect hydrogen leaks and has maintained a high safety record using them for decades. Researchers are investigating other methods that might be used for hydrogen detection: tracers, new odorant technology, advanced sensors and others.<ref>http://www.arhab.org/pdfs/h2_safety_fsheet.pdf</ref>\n* Hydrogen leaks can support combustion at very low flow rates, as low as 4 micrograms/s.<ref>M.S.

This mixture may detonate with effects similar to those produced by [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) and other highly explosive materials\"\n\nLiquid Hydrogen requires complex storage technology such as the special thermally insulated containers and requires special handling common to all [[cryogenic]] substances. This is similar to, but more severe than [[liquid oxygen]].  Even with thermally insulated containers it is difficult to keep such a low temperature, and the hydrogen will gradually leak away. (Typically it will evaporate at a rate of 1% per day.<ref>Peter Kushnir.

It also enters pipes and can follow them to their destinations.  Hydrogen pipes should be located above other pipes to prevent this occurrence.  [[Hydrogen sensor]]s allow for rapid detection of hydrogen leaks to ensure that the hydrogen can be vented and the source of the leak tracked down.  As in natural gas, an [[hydrogen odorant|odorant]] can be added to hydrogen sources to enable leaks to be detected by smell. While hydrogen flames can be hard to see with the naked eye, they show up readily on UV/IR [[flame detector]]s. More recently Multi IR detectors have been developed, which have even faster detection on hydrogen-flames.[https://www.fg-detection.com/flamespec-ir3-h2 1][https://www.spectrex.net/en-us/flame-gas-detectors/flame-detectors/40-40-series/40-40m-multi-ir-flame-detector 2] Chemo-chromic indicators can be added to silicone tapes for hydrogen detection purposes.
