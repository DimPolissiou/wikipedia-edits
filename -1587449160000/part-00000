His tenure with the Bulls included their overwhelming dominance of the NBA during the 1990s, led by superstar player [[Michael Jordan]]. The Bulls won six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998, and Krause was a two-time recipient of the [[NBA Executive of the Year Award]]. His career in sports included positions as a [[Scout (sport)|scout]] or general manager for the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]], [[Chicago White Sox]], and the Chicago Bulls.\n\n==Early career==\nKrause was born in 1939 and grew up in [[Chicago]]. He played high school [[baseball]] as a [[catcher]] at [[William Howard Taft High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Taft High School]] in Chicago and attended [[Bradley University]].\n\nAfter college he went to work as a scout with the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]]. Early on Krause gained a reputation of being able to eat hot dogs. He is credited by some for discovering future Hall of Famer [[Earl Monroe]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Halberstam |first=David |authorlink=David Halberstam |title=Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made |year=1999 |publisher=Random House |location=New York City |isbn=0-679-41562-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/playingforkeepsm00halb/page/196 196] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/playingforkeepsm00halb/page/196 }}</ref>\n\nWhile with the Bullets, he urged the team to pick [[North Dakota Fighting Sioux|North Dakota]] forward [[Phil Jackson]] in the [[1967 NBA draft]]. The Bullets did not draft him, but Krause continued to keep in touch during Jackson's playing career and into his first years as a coach. Their relationship flourished during the 1970s and 1980s; notably, when Jackson was coaching the [[Albany Patroons]] in the [[Continental Basketball Association]], Krause once called him requesting an analysis of the league's players, which Jackson provided in great detail.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 198.</ref>\n\nAfter a few years with Baltimore, Krause worked as a scout with the [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Philadelphia 76ers]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Chicago Bulls]] in the 1970s before he left pro basketball to scout pro baseball instead. He was scouting for the [[Chicago White Sox]] when he received a call from new [[Chicago Bulls]] owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] to join the Bulls as their new General Manager and once again work in pro basketball.\n\n==Chicago Bulls==\nKrause succeeded [[Rod Thorn]] as [[Chicago Bulls]] GM in 1985, and managed the franchise as [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Phil Jackson]] ascended to elite status in their respective positions.\n\n===Drafting===\nJerry made a number of moves on being named GM that immediately began building the foundation for the team that would dominate the 1990s. He traded away undesirable players, turned over the Bulls roster and built up a collection of draft picks that would result in 2 significant additions to the team in 1987. Krause found two gems in the 1987 draft: [[Scottie Pippen]], a small forward from the [[University of Central Arkansas]]; and [[Horace Grant]], a power forward from [[Clemson University|Clemson]]. The two were, along with Jordan, cornerstones of the Bulls' 1991\u20131993 championship teams.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 200\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 200.</ref>  They were also culled from relative hoops obscurity; this went back to Krause's strength for finding players who were not well-received or even known by mainstream scouts.\n\nHowever, Krause also made many picks that did not help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on selecting a tall forward named [[Brad Sellers]] in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick to pass up, as he handled the ball very well for a big man, and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] named [[Johnny Dawkins]]. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even as late as the morning of the draft; the coaches and players had made it clear that they wanted him and not Sellers, and Krause did not particularly have a problem with Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]], even told Duke coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]] the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.\n\nSellers was one of many Krause draft picks to underperform; others included [[Stacey King]], [[Mark Randall (basketball)|Mark Randall]], [[Will Perdue]] and [[Marcus Fizer]]. King and Perdue would serve as backup players on the Bulls' 1991\u20131993 Championship teams, but both players would later be traded away. During the 1993\u201394 NBA season, King was traded to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in exchange for 7'2\" Australian-born center [[Luc Longley]].<ref name=\"longley\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/alltime_transactions.html|title=Chicago Bulls All-Time Transactions|work=www.nba.com|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref> Longley's emergence for the Bulls during the 1994\u201395 season made Perdue expendable.

It was clear that the Bulls needed a center if they were to contend for a title, so Krause dealt [[Charles Oakley]] to New York for [[Bill Cartwright]]. Oakley, who happened to be Jordan's best friend on the team,<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 246\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 246.</ref> was extremely tough, particularly on the boards and on defense. When the Pistons came after Jordan with their physical players, Oakley was his bodyguard. Cartwright was a true center, unlike the power forward Oakley, but was much older. Although Cartwright did not have Oakley's reputation as a lockdown defender, he was very effective at preventing opposing centers from dominating games,<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 279-80.</ref> and was a more capable inside scorer. Jordan despised the trade, not only because of the players involved but also because of how they learned of it: via television, while he and Oakley were on their way to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to see a [[Mike Tyson]] fight.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 200\"/> Cartwright turned out to be everything the Bulls needed, however, providing a presence in the middle for all three Bulls championships from 1991\u20131993. Perhaps most importantly, Cartwright proved to be the league's best center at defending [[Patrick Ewing]], the [[New York Knicks]]' star who was the key player on the Bulls' most important early-1990s conference rival.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 246\"/>\n\nOne of the most notable ways was demonstrated in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]], when the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]], including Jordan and Pippen, took on [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatia]] for the gold medal. The Croatia team featured [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], a young star whom Krause had discovered through European contacts and was courting to a degree that some of the Bulls found annoying.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 288-89.</ref> Jordan biographer [[David Halberstam]] said that Jordan and Pippen \"seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta\", and that \"in the end, it was as if they had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause.\"<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 289\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 289.</ref> Jordan would later be quoted as saying: \"The trade of Oakley was good, and the best thing he did was to get Pippen and Grant.

Krause attempted to replace Jordan with defensive specialist [[Pete Myers]] and free agent [[Ron Harper]], but neither proved capable of leading Chicago to a championship, although Harper would play an invaluable role in the second \"three-peat\". Just before Jordan announced his retirement, Krause was finally able to persuade Kuko\u010d to buy himself out of his European contract and join the Bulls.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 289\"/> The 1993\u201394 Bulls made it to the conference semi-finals, where they lost to the New York Knicks in seven games. The Bulls had beaten the Knicks in the playoffs the three previous years.\n\nWhen Jordan returned to the NBA at the end of the 1995 season, Krause once again went to work in assembling what has been labeled the best team in NBA history after offseason acquisition of [[Dennis Rodman]] from the Spurs. The Bulls won a then-NBA record 72 games and Krause was named [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year]] for the second time. The next year, they achieved a then second best-ever NBA season with 69 wins and repeated as champions.\n\n===\"The Last Dance\"===\nKrause and head coach [[Phil Jackson]] had been friends for years, but their relationship was, in Jackson's opinion, shattered early in the 1990s after ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reporter Sam Smith (whom Krause despised) published a book on the 1991 title team, ''[[The Jordan Rules (book)|The Jordan Rules]]''. The book detailed the tension that already existed between Krause and the players, and ultimately drove a wedge between Krause and Jackson.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 311-15.</ref> Regardless of the success Jackson had as head coach of the Bulls, the tension between Jackson and Krause grew in the succeeding years, and by the 1997\u201398 season, was especially illustrated by the following incidents:\n\n*During the summer of 1997, Krause's stepdaughter got married. All of the Bulls assistant coaches and their wives were invited to the wedding, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then the head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], whom Krause was openly courting as Jackson's successor (and who would eventually succeed Jackson). Jackson and his then wife, June, were not even told of the wedding, much less invited, only finding out about the event when the wife of Cartwright, who by that time had become a Bulls assistant, asked June what she would be wearing to the reception.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 249.</ref>\n*After contentious negotiations between Jackson and the Bulls in that same period, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing in what Chicago media widely considered to be a mean-spirited manner, emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. That triggered an argument between Jackson and Krause in which Jackson essentially told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side and not the Bulls. At that point, Krause told Jackson, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 41. The \"82\" refers to the number of regular-season games each NBA team plays.</ref>\n*Krause was widely quoted as saying, \"Players and coaches don't win championships; organizations win championships.\" The statement particularly offended Michael Jordan. However, Krause said that his original phrasing was \"Players and coaches ''alone'' don\u2019t win championships; organizations win championships.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/article/2017/03/27/morning-tip-remembering-jerry-krause-legacy-chicago-bulls|author=Aldridge, David|work=nba.com|title=Chicago Bulls' golden era a reflection of Jerry Krause's words, deeds|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again, but after he took a year off he decided to give it another chance with the Lakers.

Few major players were added though (other than from drafts).<ref name=\"blogabull.com\">[https://www.blogabull.com/2017/3/24/15044772/the-true-story-of-jerry-krause-breakup-of-the-bulls-michael-jordan-phil-jackson-scottie-pippen]</ref>\n\n===Younger talent===\nThe draft brought prolific collegiate players such as [[Elton Brand]], [[Ron Artest]], [[Marcus Fizer]], [[Jamal Crawford]], and [[Jay Williams (basketball)|Jay Williams]] to the Bulls but it would be the 2001 draft that stood out. After finishing 15\u201367 during the 2000\u20132001 season, Krause decided to gamble and trade away his best player in Brand for high schooler [[Tyson Chandler]] who was hyped as \"the next Kevin Garnett\", and draft another high schooler in [[Eddy Curry]] who, similarly, was hyped as a slightly smaller version of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], with the fourth overall pick in the draft.\n\nKrause believed that the tandem of Chandler and Curry would develop into elite players and provide the foundation for another dynasty. A mid-season trade the following year brought scorer [[Jalen Rose]] to the Bulls in exchange for [[Brad Miller (basketball player)|Brad Miller]] and Artest which cleared playing time for the two rookies. After drafting Jay Williams during the offseason, the Bulls had a roster with Rose, Crawford, Curry, Chandler, Williams, and Fizer that fulfilled Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team. The Bulls showed some improvement the following year.\n\n==Later years and death==\nIn 2003, Krause resigned as GM. He explained, \"The rigors and stress of the job have caused me some minor physical problems in the past few years.\"<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/sports/basketball-bulls-builder-krause-resigns-after-18-years.html |title=Bulls Builder Krause Resigns After 18 Years|author=Liz Robbins|work=[[The New York Times]] |date = April 8, 2003}}</ref> The Bulls fell to 23\u201359 in the next season, and Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team imploded with all of his acquisitions traded or out of the league within three years.

The next year, they achieved a then second best-ever NBA season with 69 wins and repeated as champions.\n\n===\"The Last Dance\"===\nKrause and head coach [[Phil Jackson]] had been friends for years, but their relationship was, in Jackson's opinion, shattered early in the 1990s after ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reporter Sam Smith (whom Krause despised) published a book on the 1991 title team, ''[[The Jordan Rules (book)|The Jordan Rules]]''. The book detailed the tension that already existed between Krause and the players, and ultimately drove a wedge between Krause and Jackson.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 311-15.</ref> Regardless of the success Jackson had as head coach of the Bulls, the tension between Jackson and Krause grew in the succeeding years, and by the 1997\u201398 season, was especially illustrated by the following incidents:\n\n*During the summer of 1997, Krause's stepdaughter got married. All of the Bulls assistant coaches and their wives were invited to the wedding, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then the head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], whom Krause was openly courting as Jackson's successor (and who would eventually succeed Jackson). Jackson and his then wife, June, were not even told of the wedding, much less invited, only finding out about the event when the wife of Cartwright, who by that time had become a Bulls assistant, asked June what she would be wearing to the reception.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 249.</ref>\n*After contentious negotiations between Jackson and the Bulls in that same period, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing in what Chicago media widely considered to be a mean-spirited manner, emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. That triggered an argument between Jackson and Krause in which Jackson essentially told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side and not the Bulls. At that point, Krause told Jackson, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 41. The \"82\" refers to the number of regular-season games each NBA team plays.</ref>\n*Krause was widely quoted as saying, \"Players and coaches don't win championships; organizations win championships.\" The statement particularly offended Michael Jordan. However, Krause said that his original phrasing was \"Players and coaches ''alone'' don\u2019t win championships; organizations win championships.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/article/2017/03/27/morning-tip-remembering-jerry-krause-legacy-chicago-bulls|author=Aldridge, David|work=nba.com|title=Chicago Bulls' golden era a reflection of Jerry Krause's words, deeds|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again, but after he took a year off he decided to give it another chance with the Lakers.

After finishing 15\u201367 during the 2000\u20132001 season, Krause decided to gamble and trade away his best player in Brand for high schooler [[Tyson Chandler]] who was hyped as \"the next Kevin Garnett\", and draft another high schooler in [[Eddy Curry]] who, similarly, was hyped as a slightly smaller version of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], with the fourth overall pick in the draft.\n\nKrause believed that the tandem of Chandler and Curry would develop into elite players and provide the foundation for another dynasty. A mid-season trade the following year brought scorer [[Jalen Rose]] to the Bulls in exchange for [[Brad Miller (basketball player)|Brad Miller]] and Artest which cleared playing time for the two rookies. After drafting Jay Williams during the offseason, the Bulls had a roster with Rose, Crawford, Curry, Chandler, Williams, and Fizer that fulfilled Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team. The Bulls showed some improvement the following year.\n\n==Later years and death==\nIn 2003, Krause resigned as GM. He explained, \"The rigors and stress of the job have caused me some minor physical problems in the past few years.\"<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/sports/basketball-bulls-builder-krause-resigns-after-18-years.html |title=Bulls Builder Krause Resigns After 18 Years|author=Liz Robbins|work=[[The New York Times]] |date = April 8, 2003}}</ref> The Bulls fell to 23\u201359 in the next season, and Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team imploded with all of his acquisitions traded or out of the league within three years.

Capitulation Treaties also permitted the registration of marriages and divorces in the British, German, American and other consulates during the Ottoman period. Jewish religious matters were handled by the [[Hakham Bashi]] and the Jewish courts.\n\nArticle 14 of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] required the mandatory administration to establish a commission to study, define, and determine the rights and claims relating to the different religious communities in Palestine. Article 15 required the mandatory administration to see to it that complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship were permitted. Those mandates were never enforced or put into effect. The High Commissioner established the Orthodox Rabbinate and retained a modified millet system that recognized eleven religious communities: [[Sunni Islam]], [[Orthodox Judaism]], and nine Christian denominations. All those who were not members of these recognised communities were excluded from the millet arrangement, and \"marriages\" conducted in Palestine outside these communities were not recognised. Consular marriages remained customary during the British Mandate and civil divorces granted in other countries were registered and recognized by the mandatory administration. Provision was made for the registration of marriages, but not for the manner in which marriages would be conducted.\n\n===Jewish community===\n{{see also|Jewish views of marriage}}\n\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 2709 wedding \u05d7\u05ea\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd.jpg|thumb|Jewish wedding in Israel, early 1950s]]\n\nIn 1947 [[David Ben-Gurion]] and the religious parties reached an agreement that included an understanding that matters of personal status in Israel, which included marriage, would continue to be determined by religious authorities. This arrangement has been termed the [[Status quo (Israel)|status quo]] agreement and has been maintained despite numerous changes of government since. Under the arrangement, the Mandate period confessional system would continue, with membership in the Jewish community being on the basis of membership of a body called \"[[Knesset Israel]]\", which was a voluntary organization that managed registrations of people who were related to it\u2014that is, those recognised as Jews. There does not seem to have been any dispute at the time of [[Who is a Jew|who was a Jew]]. However, in 1953 [[rabbinical court]]s were established under the jurisdiction of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] with jurisdiction over marriage and divorce for all Jews in Israel. The rabbinate's standards and interpretations in these matters are generally used by the Israeli Interior Ministry in registering marriages and divorces.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n''Halakhic'' restrictions on marriage are applied in Israel. So, for example, a [[kohen]] may not marry a convert to Judaism. Similarly, [[mamzer|children of adulterous and incestuous unions]] are restricted as to whom they can marry.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Orthodox ''halachic'' rules apply to converts who want to marry in Israel. Under these rules, a conversion to Judaism must strictly follow ''halachic'' standards to be recognised as valid. Non-Orthodox conversions are not recognized, as are some Orthodox conversions that do not meet the requirements of the Chief Rabbinate.

Capitulation Treaties also permitted the registration of marriages and divorces in the British, German, American and other consulates during the Ottoman period. Jewish religious matters were handled by the [[Hakham Bashi]] and the Jewish courts.\n\nArticle 14 of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] required the mandatory administration to establish a commission to study, define, and determine the rights and claims relating to the different religious communities in Palestine. Article 15 required the mandatory administration to see to it that complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship were permitted. Those mandates were never enforced or put into effect. The High Commissioner established the Orthodox Rabbinate and retained a modified millet system that recognized eleven religious communities: [[Sunni Islam]], [[Orthodox Judaism]], and nine Christian denominations. All those who were not members of these recognised communities were excluded from the millet arrangement, and \"marriages\" conducted in Palestine outside these communities were not recognised. Consular marriages remained customary during the British Mandate and civil divorces granted in other countries were registered and recognized by the mandatory administration. Provision was made for the registration of marriages, but not for the manner in which marriages would be conducted.\n\n===Jewish community===\n{{see also|Jewish views of marriage}}\n\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 2709 wedding \u05d7\u05ea\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd.jpg|thumb|Jewish wedding in Israel, early 1950s]]\n\nIn 1947 [[David Ben-Gurion]] and the religious parties reached an agreement that included an understanding that matters of personal status in Israel, which included marriage, would continue to be determined by religious authorities. This arrangement has been termed the [[Status quo (Israel)|status quo]] agreement and has been maintained despite numerous changes of government since. Under the arrangement, the Mandate period confessional system would continue, with membership in the Jewish community being on the basis of membership of a body called \"[[Knesset Israel]]\", which was a voluntary organization that managed registrations of people who were related to it\u2014that is, those recognised as Jews. There does not seem to have been any dispute at the time of [[Who is a Jew|who was a Jew]]. However, in 1953 [[rabbinical court]]s were established under the jurisdiction of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] with jurisdiction over marriage and divorce for all Jews in Israel. The rabbinate's standards and interpretations in these matters are generally used by the Israeli Interior Ministry in registering marriages and divorces.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n''Halakhic'' restrictions on marriage are applied in Israel. So, for example, a [[kohen]] may not marry a convert to Judaism. Similarly, [[mamzer|children of adulterous and incestuous unions]] are restricted as to whom they can marry.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Orthodox ''halachic'' rules apply to converts who want to marry in Israel. Under these rules, a conversion to Judaism must strictly follow ''halachic'' standards to be recognised as valid. Non-Orthodox conversions are not recognized, as are some Orthodox conversions that do not meet the requirements of the Chief Rabbinate. For example, a man who converted to Orthodox Judaism in the United States was denied an official marriage in Israel because the Orthodox rabbi who converted him is not recognized in Israel.<ref name=\"jstandard\">{{cite news|url=http://www.jstandard.com/articles/1101/1/Israel%92s-Chief-Rabbinate-rejects-some-diaspora-Orthodox-conversions|title=Israel\u2019s Chief Rabbinate Rejects some Diaspora Orthodox Conversions|last=Tigay|first=Chanan|date=2006-05-26|newspaper=New Jersey Jewish Standard|accessdate=2008-07-17}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"meyers\">{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/6943/edition_id/131/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Are Israel\u2019s Marriage Laws \u2018Archaic and Irrelevant\u2019?|last=Meyers|first=Nechemia|date=1997-07-12|publisher=Jewish News Weekly|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> If a person's Jewish status is in doubt, then formal conversion is required in order to be allowed to marry according to the Orthodox rules, which govern all marriages between Jews in Israel.

It was released in June 1982 by Neutron Records in the United Kingdom, by [[Mercury Records]] in the United States and Japan, and by [[Vertigo Records]] in Canada and Europe. The album entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number one and has been certified platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) and gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It features four UK top-20 singles, including \"[[Tears Are Not Enough (ABC song)|Tears Are Not Enough]]\", \"[[Poison Arrow]]\", \"[[The Look of Love (ABC song)|The Look of Love]]\" and \"[[All of My Heart]]\".\n\nThough not a [[concept album]],<ref>{{cite interview |last= |first= |subjectlink= |interviewer=[[Stuart Maconie]] |title=BBC 6 Music interview with Martin Fry|date= |work=Radcliffe and Maconie|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> the album features repeated themes in which the singer experiences heartache as he tries and fails to have a meaningful relationship. A longform music video/film, ''[[Mantrap (1983 film)|Mantrap]]'', featuring songs from the album was released in 1983.\n\n==Background==\n''The Lexicon of Love'' was ABC's debut album. The band had formed a few years earlier as [[Vice Versa (band)|Vice Versa]] and released their first single as ABC \"[[Tears Are Not Enough (ABC song)|Tears Are Not Enough]]\" in 1981.\n\nThe songs on the album were written collectively by the band, with arranger [[Anne Dudley]] given songwriting credits on some tracks. Martin Fry said that the band's ambition was to fuse [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[disco]], music that was more sophisticated but still had some attitude. Lyrically, the songs are all about the matters of the heart. \"Most of the other people were writing about electric pylons. We wanted to hark back to [[Cole Porter]] and his ilk, but in a very modern way\", Fry said. The title ''The Lexicon of Love'' originated from a headline of a live review of ABC in ''[[NME]]''.<ref name=\"Deluxe edition booklet\" />\n\n==Recording and release dates==\nThe majority of the album was recorded at [[Sarm East Studios]] in London, as well as at [[Abbey Road Studios]], [[Townhouse Studios]], [[RAK Studios]] and [[Good Earth Studios]]. The production includes both orchestral arrangements and the use of the then latest technology.<ref name=\"Deluxe edition booklet\">''The Lexicon of Love'' Deluxe Edition Booklet, 2004</ref>\n\nThe album was produced by [[Trevor Horn]], engineered by [[Gary Langan]] and features [[orchestration]]s by [[Anne Dudley]] and [[Fairlight CMI]] programming by [[J. J. Jeczalik]]; Horn, Langan, Dudley and Jeczalik would later form the [[Art of Noise]] a year after the release of this album. Indeed, most of the production team and session players on the album would form the basis for the [[ZTT Records|ZTT]] label, and their work with Horn meant all concerned would be in constant demand throughout the industry in years to come.

The album reached No. 1 on the UK charts and peaked at No. 24 in the US charts.\n\nThe album was followed by a tour with the band extended to an 11-piece on stage, reaching Europe, USA and Japan. The shows at [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in November 1982 were recorded for inclusion in ABC's forthcoming film ''[[Mantrap (1983 film)|Mantrap]]''.<ref name=\"Deluxe edition booklet\" />\n\nIn 2004, a two-disc deluxe reissue including previously unreleased outtakes and early demos and a live performance of the album from 1982 was released by Neutron Records.\n\nIn 2009, ABC performed the entire album at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, accompanied by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and conducted by arranger and composer [[Anne Dudley]]. They were joined onstage by the album's producer [[Trevor Horn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jrvgg |title=ABC and The BBC Concert Orchestra present The Lexicon of Love |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n''The Lexicon of Love'' was again performed live in its entirety on 18 December 2012 at [[Theatre Royal Drury Lane]]. This marked the 30th anniversary of the album's release and once again featured Dudley as conductor, performing with the Southbank Sinfonia Orchestra. The same line-up (with Dudley and Southbank Sinfonia) concluded a four-date mini-tour at this same venue on 30 March 2014 performing the album in its entirety. [[Martin Fry]] and band were once more accompanied by the Southbank Sinfonia Orchestra for dates at Liverpool's [[Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool|Philharmonic Hall]], [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]], [[Sheffield City Hall]], the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London and [[Symphony Hall, Birmingham]], between November 4th and 9th, 2015.\n\nA sequel album ''[[The Lexicon of Love II]]'' was released on 27 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.superdeluxeedition.com/news/abc-to-release-lexicon-of-love-ii/ |title=ABC to release The Lexicon of Love II |publisher=superdeluxeedition.com |accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| noprose    = yes\n| rev1       = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score  = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-lexicon-of-love-mw0000649803 |title=''The Lexicon of Love'' \u2013 ABC |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=1 October 2011 |last=Ruhlmann |first=William}}</ref>\n| rev2       = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n| rev2score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.blender.com/reviews/review_807.html |title=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |journal=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |accessdate=5 July 2016 |last=Himmelsbach |first=Erik |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031215182122/http://www.blender.com/reviews/review_807.html |archivedate=15 December 2003}}</ref>\n| rev3       = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n| rev3Score  = A\u2212<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15 |chapter=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |title=Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |year=1990 |isbn=0-679-73015-X|title-link=Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s }}</ref>\n| rev4       = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4Score  = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-85712-595-8|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music }}</ref>\n| rev5       = ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''\n| rev5Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |issue= |date= |page=124 |quote=[Including] songs as perfect as 'The Look Of Love' \u2013 replete with knowingly absurd talkover \u2013 or the jaw-dropping 'All of My Heart,' still one of the '80s most underrated singles...}}</ref>\n| rev6       = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev6Score  = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |issue=360 |date=July 2016 |page=117}}</ref>\n| rev7       = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev7Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/248814/review/5943342/thelexiconoflove |title=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=378 |date=16 September 1982 |accessdate=1 October 2011 |last=Fricke |first=David |authorlink=David Fricke |issn=0035-791X |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707125519/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/248814/review/5943342 |archivedate=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n| rev8       = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev8Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book |chapter=ABC |last=Sheffield |first=Rob |authorlink=Rob Sheffield |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |edition=4th |editor1-last=Brackett |editor1-first=Nathan |editor2-last=Hoard |editor2-first=Christian |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/2 2] |title-link=The Rolling Stone Album Guide }}</ref>\n| rev9       = ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''\n| rev9Score  = 4/5<ref>{{cite journal |title=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |journal=[[Select (magazine)|Select]] |issue=71 |date=May 1996 |last=Harrison |first=Ian |page=102}}</ref>\n| rev10      = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n| rev10Score = 9/10<ref name=\"Spin\">{{harvnb|Weisbard|Marks|1995|p=4}}</ref>\n}}\nThe album was a critical and commercial success.

It features four UK top-20 singles, including \"[[Tears Are Not Enough (ABC song)|Tears Are Not Enough]]\", \"[[Poison Arrow]]\", \"[[The Look of Love (ABC song)|The Look of Love]]\" and \"[[All of My Heart]]\".\n\nThough not a [[concept album]],<ref>{{cite interview |last= |first= |subjectlink= |interviewer=[[Stuart Maconie]] |title=BBC 6 Music interview with Martin Fry|date= |work=Radcliffe and Maconie|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> the album features repeated themes in which the singer experiences heartache as he tries and fails to have a meaningful relationship. A longform music video/film, ''[[Mantrap (1983 film)|Mantrap]]'', featuring songs from the album was released in 1983.\n\n==Background==\n''The Lexicon of Love'' was ABC's debut album. The band had formed a few years earlier as [[Vice Versa (band)|Vice Versa]] and released their first single as ABC \"[[Tears Are Not Enough (ABC song)|Tears Are Not Enough]]\" in 1981.\n\nThe songs on the album were written collectively by the band, with arranger [[Anne Dudley]] given songwriting credits on some tracks. Martin Fry said that the band's ambition was to fuse [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[disco]], music that was more sophisticated but still had some attitude. Lyrically, the songs are all about the matters of the heart. \"Most of the other people were writing about electric pylons. We wanted to hark back to [[Cole Porter]] and his ilk, but in a very modern way\", Fry said. The title ''The Lexicon of Love'' originated from a headline of a live review of ABC in ''[[NME]]''.<ref name=\"Deluxe edition booklet\" />\n\n==Recording and release dates==\nThe majority of the album was recorded at [[Sarm East Studios]] in London, as well as at [[Abbey Road Studios]], [[Townhouse Studios]], [[RAK Studios]] and [[Good Earth Studios]]. The production includes both orchestral arrangements and the use of the then latest technology.<ref name=\"Deluxe edition booklet\">''The Lexicon of Love'' Deluxe Edition Booklet, 2004</ref>\n\nThe album was produced by [[Trevor Horn]], engineered by [[Gary Langan]] and features [[orchestration]]s by [[Anne Dudley]] and [[Fairlight CMI]] programming by [[J. J. Jeczalik]]; Horn, Langan, Dudley and Jeczalik would later form the [[Art of Noise]] a year after the release of this album. Indeed, most of the production team and session players on the album would form the basis for the [[ZTT Records|ZTT]] label, and their work with Horn meant all concerned would be in constant demand throughout the industry in years to come.

The album reached No. 1 on the UK charts and peaked at No. 24 in the US charts.\n\nThe album was followed by a tour with the band extended to an 11-piece on stage, reaching Europe, USA and Japan. The shows at [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in November 1982 were recorded for inclusion in ABC's forthcoming film ''[[Mantrap (1983 film)|Mantrap]]''.<ref name=\"Deluxe edition booklet\" />\n\nIn 2004, a two-disc deluxe reissue including previously unreleased outtakes and early demos and a live performance of the album from 1982 was released by Neutron Records.\n\nIn 2009, ABC performed the entire album at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, accompanied by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and conducted by arranger and composer [[Anne Dudley]]. They were joined onstage by the album's producer [[Trevor Horn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jrvgg |title=ABC and The BBC Concert Orchestra present The Lexicon of Love |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n''The Lexicon of Love'' was again performed live in its entirety on 18 December 2012 at [[Theatre Royal Drury Lane]]. This marked the 30th anniversary of the album's release and once again featured Dudley as conductor, performing with the Southbank Sinfonia Orchestra. The same line-up (with Dudley and Southbank Sinfonia) concluded a four-date mini-tour at this same venue on 30 March 2014 performing the album in its entirety. [[Martin Fry]] and band were once more accompanied by the Southbank Sinfonia Orchestra for dates at Liverpool's [[Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool|Philharmonic Hall]], [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]], [[Sheffield City Hall]], the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London and [[Symphony Hall, Birmingham]], between November 4th and 9th, 2015.\n\nA sequel album ''[[The Lexicon of Love II]]'' was released on 27 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.superdeluxeedition.com/news/abc-to-release-lexicon-of-love-ii/ |title=ABC to release The Lexicon of Love II |publisher=superdeluxeedition.com |accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| noprose    = yes\n| rev1       = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score  = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-lexicon-of-love-mw0000649803 |title=''The Lexicon of Love'' \u2013 ABC |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=1 October 2011 |last=Ruhlmann |first=William}}</ref>\n| rev2       = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n| rev2score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.blender.com/reviews/review_807.html |title=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |journal=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |accessdate=5 July 2016 |last=Himmelsbach |first=Erik |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031215182122/http://www.blender.com/reviews/review_807.html |archivedate=15 December 2003}}</ref>\n| rev3       = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n| rev3Score  = A\u2212<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=15 |chapter=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |title=Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |year=1990 |isbn=0-679-73015-X|title-link=Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s }}</ref>\n| rev4       = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4Score  = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-85712-595-8|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music }}</ref>\n| rev5       = ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''\n| rev5Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |issue= |date= |page=124 |quote=[Including] songs as perfect as 'The Look Of Love' \u2013 replete with knowingly absurd talkover \u2013 or the jaw-dropping 'All of My Heart,' still one of the '80s most underrated singles...}}</ref>\n| rev6       = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev6Score  = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |issue=360 |date=July 2016 |page=117}}</ref>\n| rev7       = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev7Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/248814/review/5943342/thelexiconoflove |title=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=378 |date=16 September 1982 |accessdate=1 October 2011 |last=Fricke |first=David |authorlink=David Fricke |issn=0035-791X |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707125519/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/248814/review/5943342 |archivedate=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n| rev8       = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev8Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite book |chapter=ABC |last=Sheffield |first=Rob |authorlink=Rob Sheffield |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |year=2004 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |edition=4th |editor1-last=Brackett |editor1-first=Nathan |editor2-last=Hoard |editor2-first=Christian |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/2 2] |title-link=The Rolling Stone Album Guide }}</ref>\n| rev9       = ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''\n| rev9Score  = 4/5<ref>{{cite journal |title=ABC: ''The Lexicon of Love'' |journal=[[Select (magazine)|Select]] |issue=71 |date=May 1996 |last=Harrison |first=Ian |page=102}}</ref>\n| rev10      = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n| rev10Score = 9/10<ref name=\"Spin\">{{harvnb|Weisbard|Marks|1995|p=4}}</ref>\n}}\nThe album was a critical and commercial success.

The crew abandoned the approach due to technical difficulties and the aircraft circled to attempt a second approach.
