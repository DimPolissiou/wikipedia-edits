WKOX-FM was the Boston area's first FM top 40 station featuring live [[disc jockey]]s, including hosts Bill Thomas, Brother Bill Heizer, FM Douglas, program director Dick Stevens, John Leisher, Alan Fraser, J. William Charles, with Kenny McKay and Jimmy Conlee. WKOX-FM converted to [[Stereophonic sound|stereo broadcasting]] that July.\n\n===WVBF (1971-1993)===\n{{Distinguish||text=Middleborough Center, Massachusetts radio station [[WVBF]]}}\nWKOX and WKOX-FM were acquired by Fairbanks Communications in July 1971. After the sale, WKOX-FM became WVBF (also known as the ''Electronic Mama''), as a hybrid top 40/rock station, initially retaining some of the WKOX-FM personalities. The call letters officially stood for \"Welcome, Virginia Brown Fairbanks\", the wife of station owner Richard M. Fairbanks; Richard also had a station named after himself, [[WRMF]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. WVBF improved its signal coverage, targeting the [[Greater Boston]] area. Some hosts added to WVBF during their early months included Buddy Ballou, John \"Big John\" Gillis, Bill \"BLF Bash\" Freeman and Charlie Kendall.\n\nDuring Fairbanks ownership in the 1970s, WVBF evolved from being a high energy top 40/rock hybrid station in 1971/1972, to becoming a mainstream [[top 40]] station by 1975, and eventually evolved into a [[hot adult contemporary]] format over the years. WVBF also had many different nicknames in that era, including ''WVBF FM 105'', ''WVBF Stereo 105'', ''F105 WVBF'' and ''The New WVBF Boston 105''.\n\nWVBF debuted a morning show in 1981 hosted by the team of Loren Owens and Wally Brine; eventually joined on-air by [[character actor]]/[[Parody music|parody musician]] Tom Doyle, newscaster Lauren Beckham Falcone, traffic reporter Hank Morse and producer Brian \"Lung Boy\" Bell. ''Loren and Wally'' would continue to air on the station even with multiple ownership, format and call letter changes until Brine's retirement in 2016.<ref name=\"tbg-landw2001\">{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Clea|title=Loren and Wally: 20 years on air|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8668570.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924201610/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8668570.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 24, 2015|accessdate=December 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=July 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, [[Delilah Rene|Delilah]] was a host on WVBF before she moved to [[Seattle]] and entered national syndication.\n\n===WCLB/WKLB (1993-1996)===\n{{For|the current incarnation of WKLB on 102.5 FM|WKLB-FM}} \n{{Distinguish||text=Manchester, Kentucky radio station [[WKLB (AM)]]}}\nOn February 12, 1993, citing the growing popularity of [[country music]], WVBF became WCLB, \"The Country Club\".<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-02-19.pdf</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_roUYfhZ24/ 105.7 WCLB TV Commercials 1993]</ref> The format change was made in an effort to throw off [[Greater Media]] from launching a country format on newly acquired [[WBQT (FM)|WCDJ (96.9 FM)]]; that station's format switch to WBCS happened anyway. Confusion with other FM stations and [[WCVB-TV]] led to a call sign change to WKLB in 1995.\n\nIn 1995, WKLB was to be sold to Evergreen Media, and was widely expected to become a talk station. However, a series of subsequent trades in 1996 placed WKLB under common ownership with WBCS via Greater Media.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/403763793.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+15%2C+1996&author=Bickelhaupt%2C+Susan&pub=Boston+Globe&edition=&startpage=23&desc=WBCS-FM+owners+to+take+over+WKLB-FM/ WBCS-FM owners to take over WKLB-FM], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', June 15, 1996</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 1996, the intellectual property of WKLB \"merged\" with WBCS, with the newly merged country station utilizing the 96.9 frequency of WBCS along with the WKLB call letters, combining personalities from both stations. Some WKLB personalities remained at the station for the new format, including ''Loren and Wally''. The two stations simulcast for eleven days.\n\n===WROR (1996-present)===\nAfter the simulcast ended, on September 5, 1996, Greater Media changed WKLB's call letters to WROR, and changed the station's format to [[oldies]].<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/290798345.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+5%2C+1996&author=Bickelhaupt%2C+Susan&pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&edition=&startpage=E.8&desc=%27ROR-FM+back+in+letter+and+spirit/ ROR-FM back in letter and spirit], ''Boston Globe'', September 5, 1996</ref> The WROR callsign had previously been used on [[WBZ-FM|98.5 FM]] until 1991, later being been \"[[Domain parking|parked]]\" first on [[WMFN|WMFN (640 AM)]] in [[Zeeland, Michigan]], then on [[WWDJ|WROR (1150 AM)]]; the latter was also owned by Greater Media at the time.\n\nThe \"new\" WROR played 1970s pop and rock oldies, [[disco]], some 1960s oldies, 1980s soft rock and top-40 crossovers, along with some [[classic rock]], and hired several staffers connected to the \"old\" WROR. Leading broadcasters involved with WROR in the 1970s and early 1980s included program director [[Gary Berkowitz]] and personalities such as: Joe Martell, Phil Redo, Larry Justice, Frank Kingston Smith, and current WROR General Manager Tom Baker.\n\nBy 1999, the format had been modified to classic rock, similar to co-owned [[WMGK]] in [[Philadelphia]], but gradually moved back to more of a pop-based classic hits format in 2006, emphasizing pop adult rock hits while mixing in some R&B, disco, and harder rock songs.

(Doyle was let go on November 19, 2014.)

Owens did his final show on June 28, 2019, citing an inability to reach terms on a contract extension.  WROR now has \"The ROR Morning Show\" as its wake-up program, hosted by Bob Bronson (formerly with [[WLTW]] [[New York City]] and [[WZID]] [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]) joined by Lauren Beckham Falcone as co-host and Brian Bell as producer.\n\nThe Loren & Wally Show had several segments:\n\n===Men from Maine===\n'''Men from Maine''' was a one- to two-minute comedy segment, opening with [[soap opera]] organ music and Loren stating something varying along the lines of, \"Welcome to another thrilling episode of the exciting adventures of Men from Maine. As today's action packed drama begins...\". Episodes typically revolve around the two main characters Lem (played by Tom) and Ephus (played by Wally), and other residents of [[Bangor, Maine]], such as Ephus' wife Effie and son Ephus Junior, Doc Cider (after Dock Sider shoes) and Pastor Fazool (after ''[[pasta e fagioli]]''). The same characters have been used in songs about Maine on the segment \"Tom's Townie Tunes\" (see below). The humor of the segment is at its root generic \"[[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] humor\", but set in very rural, backwoods Maine as opposed to the [[American South]]. Episode themes can run all the way from industrial accidents handled in incompetent ways (many residents, including Lem and Ephus work in the local [[sawmill]]), to bestiality. In all cases, the humor comes from the stupidity of the characters, and their obliviousness to it. Every episode ends with the characters going \"Ayuh!\"\n\nAt least one listener has found the show offensive, as heard on the first Men from Maine CD (sold during the holiday season to raise money for charity). Offended by the humor poking fun at her home state, a woman called the station, threatening to continue protesting the show until it is taken off the air. But the segment continued on the Loren and Wally show until Owens' departure from the program. Some can still be found as a \"Loren & Wally Podcast of the Day\" on iTunes and 2 episodes are posted on [[YouTube]].\n\n===Tom's Townie Tunes===\n'''Tom's Townie Tunes''' is a segment created by morning crew member Tom Doyle that spoofs [[classic rock]] hits, using humorous lyrics to poke fun at towns in Massachusetts (and an additional few songs about the surrounding region, such as Maine). Often the songs are about high crime rates, poverty, and the general misery of residents in low class areas, while other songs satirize [[Harvard]] graduates and [[Kerry Healey]]'s failed run for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of \"[[867-5309 (Jenny)]]\" by [[Tommy Tutone]]). The first ever Townie Tune was about [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of [[Funkytown]]). Doyle's sports-related songs have occasionally gained airplay on other stations during championship seasons. During the holiday season, Tom often sings parodies of classic Christmas songs.\n\nOther Townie Tunes include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Townie Tune\n!

WKOX-FM was the Boston area's first FM top 40 station featuring live [[disc jockey]]s, including hosts Bill Thomas, Brother Bill Heizer, FM Douglas, program director Dick Stevens, John Leisher, Alan Fraser, J.

After the sale, WKOX-FM became WVBF (also known as the ''Electronic Mama''), as a hybrid top 40/rock station, initially retaining some of the WKOX-FM personalities. The call letters officially stood for \"Welcome, Virginia Brown Fairbanks\", the wife of station owner Richard M. Fairbanks; Richard also had a station named after himself, [[WRMF]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. WVBF improved its signal coverage, targeting the [[Greater Boston]] area. Some hosts added to WVBF during their early months included Buddy Ballou, John \"Big John\" Gillis, Bill \"BLF Bash\" Freeman and Charlie Kendall.\n\nDuring Fairbanks ownership in the 1970s, WVBF evolved from being a high energy top 40/rock hybrid station in 1971/1972, to becoming a mainstream [[top 40]] station by 1975, and eventually evolved into a [[hot adult contemporary]] format over the years. WVBF also had many different nicknames in that era, including ''WVBF FM 105'', ''WVBF Stereo 105'', ''F105 WVBF'' and ''The New WVBF Boston 105''.\n\nWVBF debuted a morning show in 1981 hosted by the team of Loren Owens and Wally Brine; eventually joined on-air by [[character actor]]/[[Parody music|parody musician]] Tom Doyle, newscaster Lauren Beckham Falcone, traffic reporter Hank Morse and producer Brian \"Lung Boy\" Bell.

The station continues to emphasize the 1970s and 1980s, but also plays some well-known 1960s and 1990s hits.

(Doyle was let go on November 19, 2014.)

Owens did his final show on June 28, 2019, citing an inability to reach terms on a contract extension.  WROR now has \"The ROR Morning Show\" as its wake-up program, hosted by Bob Bronson (formerly with [[WLTW]] [[New York City]] and [[WZID]] [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]) joined by Lauren Beckham Falcone as co-host and Brian Bell as producer.\n\nThe Loren & Wally Show had several segments:\n\n===Men from Maine===\n'''Men from Maine''' was a one- to two-minute comedy segment, opening with [[soap opera]] organ music and Loren stating something varying along the lines of, \"Welcome to another thrilling episode of the exciting adventures of Men from Maine. As today's action packed drama begins...\". Episodes typically revolve around the two main characters Lem (played by Tom) and Ephus (played by Wally), and other residents of [[Bangor, Maine]], such as Ephus' wife Effie and son Ephus Junior, Doc Cider (after Dock Sider shoes) and Pastor Fazool (after ''[[pasta e fagioli]]''). The same characters have been used in songs about Maine on the segment \"Tom's Townie Tunes\" (see below). The humor of the segment is at its root generic \"[[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] humor\", but set in very rural, backwoods Maine as opposed to the [[American South]]. Episode themes can run all the way from industrial accidents handled in incompetent ways (many residents, including Lem and Ephus work in the local [[sawmill]]), to bestiality. In all cases, the humor comes from the stupidity of the characters, and their obliviousness to it. Every episode ends with the characters going \"Ayuh!\"\n\nAt least one listener has found the show offensive, as heard on the first Men from Maine CD (sold during the holiday season to raise money for charity). Offended by the humor poking fun at her home state, a woman called the station, threatening to continue protesting the show until it is taken off the air. But the segment continued on the Loren and Wally show until Owens' departure from the program. Some can still be found as a \"Loren & Wally Podcast of the Day\" on iTunes and 2 episodes are posted on [[YouTube]].\n\n===Tom's Townie Tunes===\n'''Tom's Townie Tunes''' is a segment created by morning crew member Tom Doyle that spoofs [[classic rock]] hits, using humorous lyrics to poke fun at towns in Massachusetts (and an additional few songs about the surrounding region, such as Maine). Often the songs are about high crime rates, poverty, and the general misery of residents in low class areas, while other songs satirize [[Harvard]] graduates and [[Kerry Healey]]'s failed run for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of \"[[867-5309 (Jenny)]]\" by [[Tommy Tutone]]). The first ever Townie Tune was about [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] (sung to the tune of [[Funkytown]]). Doyle's sports-related songs have occasionally gained airplay on other stations during championship seasons. During the holiday season, Tom often sings parodies of classic Christmas songs.\n\nOther Townie Tunes include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Townie Tune\n!

In 1919, he was on the staff of the German delegation that was to receive the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1933, he emigrated and eventually moved to the [[United States]] where he became an advocate for the peaceful resolution of conflicts.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life in the German Empire===\nWilhelm Sollmann was born on 2 April 1881 in {{Interlanguage link multi|Oberlind|de|3=Oberlind (Sonneberg)|lt=Oberlind}}, [[Saxe-Meiningen]] (today a part of [[Sonneberg]], [[Thuringia]]). His father was Johan Jakob Sollmann, a brewer and farmer in Oberlind and after 1889 tenant of the ''Ratskeller'' at [[Coburg, Germany|Coburg]]. His mother was Christiane Sollmann, inn keeper. After the move to Coburg, Wilhelm attended the Casimirianum [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] from 1891 to 1897, when he had to leave due to the family's financial difficulties. That year, his family moved to [[Cologne]]. There, he began work as an apprentice (''kaufm\u00e4nnische Lehre''). From 1901-11 he worked as a ''Handlungsgehilfe'' whilst attending night school at the ''Handelshochschule K\u00f6ln''. Originally rooted in Lutheran Christianity, he was a member of the ''[[International Organisation of Good Templars|Internationaler Guttempler-Orden]]'' and the [[YMCA|CVJM]].

He was also a member of the ''Angestelltengwerkschaft'' (white-collar workers' union). In 1906, Sollmann married Anna Katharina (K\u00e4the, Kate) n\u00e9e Gr\u00fcmmer (born 1883, died before 1975).

For clarity in radio communications, each digit in the runway name is pronounced individually: runway one-five, runway three-three, etc. (instead of \"fifteen\" or \"thirty-three\"). \n\nA leading zero, for example in \"runway zero-six\" or \"runway zero-one-left\", is included for all ICAO and some [[United States armed forces|U.S.&nbsp;military]] airports (such as [[Edwards Air Force Base]]). However, most U.S.&nbsp;[[civil aviation]] airports drop the leading zero as required by FAA regulation.<ref>{{cite web | title = FAA Advisory Circular AC 150/5340-1L - Standards for Airport Markings; Chapter 2.3.e.(2) [page 17] states \"A single-digit runway landing designation number is never preceded by a zero.\" | url = http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1022266}}</ref> This also includes some military airfields such as [[Cairns Army Airfield]]. This American anomaly may lead to inconsistencies in conversations between American pilots and controllers in other countries. It is very common in a country such as Canada for a controller to clear an incoming American aircraft to, for example, runway 04, and the pilot read back the clearance as runway&nbsp;4. In [[Flight simulator|flight simulation programs]] those of American origin might apply U.S. usage to airports around the world. For example, runway&nbsp;05 at [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport|Halifax]] will appear on the program as the single digit 5 rather than 05.\n\nIf there is more than one runway pointing in the same direction (parallel runways), each runway is identified by appending left&nbsp;(L), center&nbsp;(C) and right&nbsp;(R) to the number to identify its position (when facing its direction)\u2014for example, runways one-five-left&nbsp;(15L), one-five-center&nbsp;(15C), and one-five-right&nbsp;(15R). Runway zero-three-left&nbsp;(03L) becomes runway two-one-right&nbsp;(21R) when used in the opposite direction (derived from adding 18 to the original number for the 180\u00b0 difference when approaching from the opposite direction). In some countries, regulations mandate that where parallel runways are too close to each other, only one may be used at a time under certain conditions (usually adverse [[weather]]).\n\nAt large airports with four or more parallel runways (for example, at [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County]], [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta]], [[Denver International Airport|Denver]], [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas-Fort Worth]] and [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]]), some runway identifiers are shifted by 1 to avoid the ambiguity that would result with more than three parallel runways. For example, in Los Angeles, this system results in runways 6L, 6R, 7L, and 7R, even though all four runways are actually parallel at approximately 69\u00b0. At [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]], there are five parallel runways, named 17L, 17C, 17R, 18L, and 18R, all oriented at a heading of 175.4\u00b0. Occasionally, an airport with only three parallel runways may use different runway identifiers, such as when a third parallel runway was opened at [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]] in 2000 to the south of existing 8R/26L\u200a\u2014\u2009rather than confusingly becoming the \"new\" 8R/26L it was instead designated 7R/25L, with the former 8R/26L becoming 7L/25R and 8L/26R becoming 8/26.\n\n[[File:15R-33L - Aeropuerto de Madrid-Barajas - detail.jpg|thumb|Runway sign at [[Madrid-Barajas Airport]], Spain]]\nRunway designations may change over time because Earth's magnetic lines slowly drift on the surface and the magnetic direction changes. Depending on the airport location and how much drift occurs, it may be necessary to change the runway designation. As runways are designated with headings rounded to the nearest 10\u00b0, this affects some runways sooner than others. For example, if the magnetic heading of a runway is 233\u00b0, it is designated Runway&nbsp;23. If the magnetic heading changes downwards by 5&nbsp;degrees to 228\u00b0, the runway remains Runway&nbsp;23. If on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226\u00b0 (Runway&nbsp;23), and the heading decreased by only 2&nbsp;degrees to 224\u00b0, the runway becomes Runway&nbsp;22. Because magnetic drift itself is slow, runway designation changes are uncommon, and not welcomed, as they require an accompanying change in [[aeronautical chart]]s and descriptive documents. When runway designations do change, especially at major airports, it is often changed at night as [[taxiway]] signs need to be changed and the huge numbers at each end of the runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators. In July&nbsp;2009 for example, [[London Stansted Airport]] in the United Kingdom changed its runway designations from 05/23 to 04/22 during the night.\n\nFor [[fixed-wing aircraft]], it is advantageous to perform takeoffs and landings into the wind to reduce takeoff or landing roll and reduce the [[ground speed]] needed to attain [[Airspeed|flying speed]]. Larger airports usually have several runways in different directions, so that one can be selected that is most nearly aligned with the wind. Airports with one runway are often constructed to be aligned with the [[prevailing winds|prevailing wind]]. Compiling a [[wind rose]] is in fact one of the preliminary steps taken in constructing airport runways.<ref>[http://www.enviroware.com/windrose-pro-for-airports-runway-design] Retrieved on 2012-02-24.</ref> Note that [[wind direction]] is given as the direction the wind is coming ''from'': a plane taking off from runway 09 faces east, into an \"east wind\" blowing from 090\u00b0. \n\nOriginally in the 1920s and 1930s, airports and air bases\u2014particularly in the United Kingdom\u2014were built in a triangle-like pattern of three runways at 60\u00b0 angles to each other. The reason was that back then aviation was only starting, and as a result although it was known that winds affect runway distance required, etc. not much was known about wind behaviour. As a result, three runways in a triangle-like pattern were built, and the runway with the heaviest traffic on it would eventually expand into an airport's main runway, while the other two runways would be either abandoned or converted into taxiways.<ref>https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/61396/when-and-why-was-runway-07-25-at-kai-tak-removed</ref> For example [[Bristol Airport]] has only one runway - 09/27 (9/27) - and two taxiways that form a 'V' which may have been runways on the original 1930s [[RAF Lulsgate Bottom]] airbase. {{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Declared distances == <!-- Disambiguation pages and redirects link to this section. --><!-- Which ones?

It is kept free from any obstacles that might impede flight or ground roll of aircraft.\n* The '''runway''' is the surface from threshold to threshold, which typically features threshold markings, numbers, and centerlines, but not overrun areas at both ends.{{Anchor|blastpad}}\n* '''Blast pads''', also known as overrun areas or stopways, are often constructed just before the start of a runway where [[jet blast]] produced by large planes during the takeoff roll could otherwise erode the ground and eventually damage the runway. '''Overrun areas''' are also constructed at the end of runways as emergency space to slowly stop planes that overrun the runway on a landing that has not gone to plan, or to slowly stop a plane on a [[rejected takeoff]] or a takeoff that has not gone to plan. Blast pads are often not as strong as the main paved surface of the runway and are marked with yellow [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]]. Regardless of circumstances regarding blast pad use, usage of the blast pad for [[taxiing]], [[Takeoff|take off]] or [[landing]], save for an emergency, is not permitted.\n[[File:Runway diagram, Blast pad.png|700px|center]]\n* '''[[Displaced threshold]]s''' may be used for taxiing, takeoff, and landing rollout, but not for touchdown. A [[displaced threshold]] often exists because obstacles just before the runway, runway strength, or noise restrictions may make the beginning section of runway unsuitable for landings.<ref>Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge FAA-H-8083-25A, p. 306</ref> It is marked with white paint arrows that lead up to the beginning of the landing portion of the runway. Like with blast pads, landings on displaced thresholds of the runway are not permitted save for an emergency or any other circumstance that may require displaced threshold use.\n[[File:Runway diagram, Displaced threshold.png|700px|center]]\n\n==Runway markings==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nThere are runway markings and signs on most large runways. Larger runways have a distance remaining sign (black box with white numbers). This sign uses a single number to indicate the remaining distance of the runway in thousands of feet. For example, a 7 will indicate {{Convert|7000|ft|abbr=on|0}} remaining. The runway threshold is marked by a line of green lights.\n\n[[File:RunwayDiagram.png|650px]]\n\nThere are three types of runways:\n* Visual runways are used at small airstrips and are usually just a strip of grass, gravel, ice, asphalt, or concrete. Although there are usually no markings on a visual runway, they may have threshold markings, designators, and centerlines. Additionally, they do not provide an instrument-based landing procedure; pilots must be able to see the runway to use it. Also, radio communication may not be available and pilots must be self-reliant.\n* Non-precision instrument runways are often used at small- to medium-size airports. These runways, depending on the surface, may be marked with threshold markings, designators, centerlines, and sometimes a {{Convert|1000|ft|abbr=on|0}} mark (known as an aiming point, sometimes installed at {{Convert|1500|ft|abbr=on|0}}). While centerlines provide horizontal position guidance, aiming point markers provide vertical position guidance to planes on visual approach.\n* Precision instrument runways, which are found at medium- and large-size airports, consist of a blast pad/stopway (optional, for airports handling jets), threshold, designator, centerline, aiming point, and {{Convert|500|ft|abbr=on|0}}, {{Convert|1000|ft|abbr=on|0}}/{{Convert|1500|ft|abbr=on|0}}, {{Convert|2000|ft|abbr=on|0}}, {{Convert|2500|ft|abbr=on|0}}, and {{Convert|3000|ft|abbr=on|0}} touchdown zone marks. Precision runways provide both horizontal and vertical guidance for instrument approaches.\n\n===National variants===\n* In Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom,<ref>[http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP637.PDF CAP637, Visual aids handbook, chapter 2, page 3, Issue 2, May 2007, Civil Aviation Authority]</ref> as well as some other countries or territories ([[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) all 3-stripe and 2-stripe touchdown zones for precision runways are replaced with one-stripe touchdown zones.\n* In some South American countries like [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]], one 3-stripe is added and a 2-stripe is replaced with the aiming point.\n* Some European countries replace the aiming point with a 3-stripe touchdown zone.\n* Runways in Norway have yellow markings instead of the usual white ones. This also occurs in some airports in Japan, Sweden, and Finland. The yellow markings are used to ensure better contrast against snow.\n* Runways may have different types on each end. To cut costs, many airports do not install precision guidance equipment on both ends. Runways with one precision end and any other type of end can install the full set of touchdown zones, even if some are past the midpoint. Runways with precision markings on both ends omit touchdown zones within {{Convert|900|ft|abbr=on|0}} of the midpoint, to avoid ambiguity over the end with which the zone is associated.\n\n== Runway lighting ==\n[[File:Runway Landing Light.jpg|thumb|upright|A runway landing light from 1945]]\n\nA line of lights on an airfield or elsewhere to guide aircraft in taking off or coming in to land or an illuminated runway is sometimes also known as a [[Approach lighting system|flare path]].\n\n=== Technical specifications ===\n<!-- Disambiguation pages and redirects link to this section. --><!-- Which ones?

This also avoids the cost of having the lighting system on for extended periods. Smaller airports may not have lighted runways or runway markings. Particularly at private airfields for light planes, there may be nothing more than a [[windsock]] beside a landing strip.\n\n== Runway safety ==\n{{Main|Runway safety}}\n\nTypes of runway [[Aviation safety|safety]] incidents include:\n* '''Runway excursion''' - an incident involving only a single aircraft, where it makes an inappropriate exit from the runway (e.g. [[Thai Airways#Accidents and incidents|Thai Airways Flight 679]]).\n** '''Runway overrun''' (also known as an '''overshoot''') -  a type of excursion where the aircraft is unable to stop before the end of the runway (e.g. [[Air France Flight 358]], [[TAM Airlines Flight 3054]]).\n* '''[[Runway incursion]]''' - an incident involving incorrect presence of a vehicle, person or another aircraft on the runway (e.g. [[Aeroflot Flight 3352]], [[Linate Airport disaster|Linate Airport disaster (Scandinavian Airlines Flight 686)]]).\n* '''Runway confusion''' - an aircraft makes use of the wrong runway for landing or takeoff (e.g. [[Singapore Airlines Flight 006]], [[Western Airlines Flight 2605]]).\n* '''Runway undershoot''' - an aircraft that lands short of the runway (e.g. [[British Airways Flight 38]], [[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]]).\n\n== Pavement ==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}} {{Globalize|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n[[File:Pista Congonhas03.jpg|thumb|Runway surface at [[Congonhas Airport]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. The grooves increase friction and reduce the risk of [[Hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaning]].]]\nThe choice of material used to construct the runway depends on the use and the local ground conditions. For a major airport, where the ground conditions permit, the most satisfactory type of pavement for long-term minimum maintenance is [[concrete]]. Although certain airports have used reinforcement in concrete pavements, this is generally found to be unnecessary, with the exception of [[expansion joint]]s across the runway where a [[dowel]] assembly, which permits relative movement of the concrete slabs, is placed in the concrete. Where it can be anticipated that major settlements of the runway will occur over the years because of unstable ground conditions, it is preferable to install [[asphalt]]ic concrete surface, as it is easier to patch on a periodic basis. Fields with very low traffic of light planes may use a sod surface. Some runways make use of salt flats.\n\nFor pavement designs, borings are taken to determine the subgrade condition, and based on the relative [[bearing capacity]] of the subgrade, the specifications are established. For heavy-duty commercial aircraft, the pavement thickness, no matter what the top surface, varies from {{convert|10|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4|ft|abbr=on|0}}, including subgrade.\n\nAirport pavements have been designed by two methods. The first, ''Westergaard'', is based on the assumption that the pavement is an elastic plate supported on a heavy fluid base with a uniform reaction [[coefficient]] known as the [[Hooke's law|K value]]. Experience has shown that the ''K'' values on which the formula was developed are not applicable for newer aircraft with very large footprint pressures.\n\nThe second method is called the ''[[California bearing ratio]]'' and was developed in the late 1940s. It is an extrapolation of the original test results, which are not applicable to modern aircraft pavements or to modern aircraft [[landing gear]]. Some designs were made by a mixture of these two design theories. A more recent method is an analytical system based on the introduction of vehicle response as an important design parameter. Essentially it takes into account all factors, including the traffic conditions, service life, materials used in the construction, and, especially important, the dynamic response of the vehicles using the landing area.\n\nBecause airport pavement construction is so expensive, manufacturers aim to minimize aircraft stresses on the pavement. Manufacturers of the larger planes design landing gear so that the weight of the plane is supported on larger and more numerous tires. Attention is also paid to the characteristics of the landing gear itself, so that adverse effects on the pavement are minimized. Sometimes it is possible to reinforce a pavement for higher loading by applying an overlay of asphaltic concrete or [[portland cement]] concrete that is bonded to the original slab. Post-tensioning concrete has been developed for the runway surface. This permits the use of thinner pavements and should result in longer concrete pavement life. Because of the susceptibility of thinner pavements to [[Frost heaving|frost heave]], this process is generally applicable only where there is no appreciable [[Weathering#Frost weathering|frost action]].\n\n===Pavement surface===\n[[File:Mahan Air A310 EP-MNO.jpg|thumb|A [[Mahan Air]] [[Airbus A310]] using [[reverse thrust]] in rainy weather at [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]]]]\n\nRunway pavement surface is prepared and maintained to maximize friction for wheel braking. To minimize [[hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaning]] following heavy rain, the pavement surface is usually grooved so that the surface water film flows into the grooves and the peaks between grooves will still be in contact with the aircraft tires. To maintain the macrotexturing built into the runway by the grooves, maintenance crews engage in [[airfield rubber removal]] or [[hydrocleaning]] in order to meet required [[FAA]] friction levels.\n\n==={{anchor|surface_types}} Surface type codes===\n[[File:Grass airstrip at badminton england arp.jpg|thumb|The grass airstrip on the Badminton estate, [[Badminton, Gloucestershire|Badminton]], [[South Gloucestershire]], [[England]]. The strip is very simple: no lighting, no centreline, and no approach aids. The edge is marked by simple posts.]]\n\nIn [[aviation]] charts, the surface type is usually abbreviated to a three-letter code.\n\nThe most common hard surface types are asphalt and concrete. The most common soft surface types are grass and gravel.\n\n{|\n|-\n| width=\"55px\" | * ASP\n| [[Asphalt concrete|Asphalt]]\n|-\n| * BIT\n| [[Bitumen|Bitumin]]ous asphalt or tarmac\n|-\n| * BRI\n| [[Brick]]s (no longer in use, covered with asphalt or concrete now)\n|-\n| * CLA\n| [[Clay]]\n|-\n| * COM\n| Composite\n|-\n| * CON\n| [[Concrete]]\n|-\n| * COP\n| Composite\n|-\n| * COR\n| [[Coral]] (fine crushed coral reef structures)\n|-\n| * GRE\n| Graded or rolled earth, grass on graded earth\n|-\n| * GRS\n| [[Grass]] or earth not graded or rolled\n|-\n| * GVL\n| [[Gravel]]\n|-\n| * ICE\n| [[Ice]]\n|-\n| * LAT\n| [[Laterite]]\n|-\n| * MAC\n| [[Macadam]]\n|-\n| * PEM\n| Partially concrete, asphalt or bitumen-bound macadam\n|-\n| * PER\n| Permanent surface, details unknown\n|-\n| * PSP\n| [[Marston Matting]] (derived from pierced/perforated steel planking)\n|-\n| * SAN\n| [[Sand]]\n|-\n| * SMT\n| [[Sommerfeld Tracking]]\n|-\n| * SNO\n| [[Snow]]\n|-\n| * U\n| Unknown surface\n|}\n\nWater runways do not have a type code as they do not have physical markings, and are thus not registered as specific runways.\n\n== Runway length ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\n{{Main|List of longest runways}}\nA runway of at least {{Convert|6000|ft|abbr=on}} in length is usually adequate for [[aircraft]] weights below approximately {{convert|200000|lb|abbr=on}}. Larger aircraft including [[Wide-body aircraft|widebodies]] will usually require at least {{Convert|8000|ft|abbr=on}} at sea level and somewhat more at higher [[altitude]] airports. International widebody flights, which carry substantial amounts of fuel and are therefore heavier, may also have landing requirements of {{convert|10000|ft|abbr=on}} or more and takeoff requirements of {{convert|13000|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Boeing 747]] is considered to have the longest takeoff distance of the more common aircraft types and has set the standard for runway lengths of larger international airports.\n\nAt [[sea level]], {{convert|10000|ft|abbr=on}} can be considered an adequate length to land virtually any aircraft. For example, at [[O'Hare International Airport]], when landing simultaneously on 4L/22R and 10/28 or parallel 9R/27L, it is routine for arrivals from [[East Asia]], which would normally be vectored for 4L/22R ({{Convert|7500|ft|abbr=on|0}}) or 9R/27L ({{Convert|7967|ft|abbr=on|0}}) to request 28R ({{Convert|13000|ft|abbr=on|0}}). It is always accommodated, although occasionally with a delay. Another example is that the [[Lule\u00e5 Airport]] in Sweden was extended to {{convert|10990|ft|abbr=on|0}} to allow any fully loaded freight aircraft to take off.\n\nAn aircraft taking off at a higher altitude must do so at reduced weight due to decreased [[density]] of air at higher altitudes, which reduces engine power and wing lift. An aircraft must also take off at a reduced weight in hotter or more humid conditions (see [[density altitude]]). Most commercial aircraft carry manufacturer's tables showing the adjustments required for a given temperature.\n\nWind rose diagrams have been proved to be very useful nowadays in the design of airport runway.\n\nIn India, recommendations of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are now followed more often. For landing, only altitude correction is  done for runway length whereas for take-off, all types of correction are  taken into consideration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Runway_Incursion_and_Airport_Design|title=Runway Incursion and Airport Design - SKYbrary Aviation Safety|website=www.skybrary.aero|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>\n\n[[File:950318 STS67 Endeavour landing.jpg|thumb|right|A parachute is used to slow down craft, in this case the [[Space Shuttle]]]]\n\nThe world's longest paved runway, at [[Qamdo Bamda Airport]] in Tibet (China), has a total length of {{Convert|5500|m|abbr=on|0}}.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Lbiarunwayflyover.jpg|In the 1980s, [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]] extended its runway to take wide bodied planes by building an [[overpass]] over the [[A658 road]].\nFile:Sumburgh Airport Barrier.webm|Road crossing of ([[Shetland]]) A970 with [[Sumburgh Airport|Sumburgh]] airport's runway.

Runways may be a man-made surface (often [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]], [[concrete]], or a mixture of both) or a natural surface ([[sod|grass]], [[soil|dirt]], [[gravel]], [[ice]], [[sand]] or [[road salt|salt]]). Runways, as well as taxiways and ramps, are sometimes referred to as \u201ctarmac,\u201d though very few runways are built using [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]].

This heading differs from [[true north]] by the local [[magnetic declination]]. A runway numbered 09 points east (90\u00b0), runway 18 is south (180\u00b0), runway 27 points west (270\u00b0) and runway 36 points to the north (360\u00b0 rather than 0\u00b0).<ref>[http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/Chap2/aim0203.html Federal Aviation Administration Aeronautical Information Manual, Chapter 2, Section 3 Airport Marking Aids and Signs part 3b] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118165015/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/Chap2/aim0203.html |date=2012-01-18 }}</ref> When taking off from or landing on runway 09, a plane is heading around 90\u00b0 (east).\n\nA runway can normally be used in both directions, and is named for each direction separately: e.g., \"runway 15\" in one direction is \"runway 33\" when used in the other. The two numbers differ by 18 (= 180\u00b0). For clarity in radio communications, each digit in the runway name is pronounced individually: runway one-five, runway three-three, etc. (instead of \"fifteen\" or \"thirty-three\"). \n\nA leading zero, for example in \"runway zero-six\" or \"runway zero-one-left\", is included for all ICAO and some [[United States armed forces|U.S.&nbsp;military]] airports (such as [[Edwards Air Force Base]]). However, most U.S.&nbsp;[[civil aviation]] airports drop the leading zero as required by FAA regulation.<ref>{{cite web | title = FAA Advisory Circular AC 150/5340-1L - Standards for Airport Markings; Chapter 2.3.e.(2) [page 17] states \"A single-digit runway landing designation number is never preceded by a zero.\" | url = http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1022266}}</ref> This also includes some military airfields such as [[Cairns Army Airfield]]. This American anomaly may lead to inconsistencies in conversations between American pilots and controllers in other countries. It is very common in a country such as Canada for a controller to clear an incoming American aircraft to, for example, runway 04, and the pilot read back the clearance as runway&nbsp;4. In [[Flight simulator|flight simulation programs]] those of American origin might apply U.S. usage to airports around the world. For example, runway&nbsp;05 at [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport|Halifax]] will appear on the program as the single digit 5 rather than 05.\n\nIf there is more than one runway pointing in the same direction (parallel runways), each runway is identified by appending left&nbsp;(L), center&nbsp;(C) and right&nbsp;(R) to the number to identify its position (when facing its direction)\u2014for example, runways one-five-left&nbsp;(15L), one-five-center&nbsp;(15C), and one-five-right&nbsp;(15R). Runway zero-three-left&nbsp;(03L) becomes runway two-one-right&nbsp;(21R) when used in the opposite direction (derived from adding 18 to the original number for the 180\u00b0 difference when approaching from the opposite direction). In some countries, regulations mandate that where parallel runways are too close to each other, only one may be used at a time under certain conditions (usually adverse [[weather]]).\n\nAt large airports with four or more parallel runways (for example, at [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County]], [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta]], [[Denver International Airport|Denver]], [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas-Fort Worth]] and [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]]), some runway identifiers are shifted by 1 to avoid the ambiguity that would result with more than three parallel runways. For example, in Los Angeles, this system results in runways 6L, 6R, 7L, and 7R, even though all four runways are actually parallel at approximately 69\u00b0. At [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]], there are five parallel runways, named 17L, 17C, 17R, 18L, and 18R, all oriented at a heading of 175.4\u00b0. Occasionally, an airport with only three parallel runways may use different runway identifiers, such as when a third parallel runway was opened at [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]] in 2000 to the south of existing 8R/26L\u200a\u2014\u2009rather than confusingly becoming the \"new\" 8R/26L it was instead designated 7R/25L, with the former 8R/26L becoming 7L/25R and 8L/26R becoming 8/26.\n\n[[File:15R-33L - Aeropuerto de Madrid-Barajas - detail.jpg|thumb|Runway sign at [[Madrid-Barajas Airport]], Spain]]\nRunway designations may change over time because Earth's magnetic lines slowly drift on the surface and the magnetic direction changes. Depending on the airport location and how much drift occurs, it may be necessary to change the runway designation. As runways are designated with headings rounded to the nearest 10\u00b0, this affects some runways sooner than others. For example, if the magnetic heading of a runway is 233\u00b0, it is designated Runway&nbsp;23. If the magnetic heading changes downwards by 5&nbsp;degrees to 228\u00b0, the runway remains Runway&nbsp;23. If on the other hand the original magnetic heading was 226\u00b0 (Runway&nbsp;23), and the heading decreased by only 2&nbsp;degrees to 224\u00b0, the runway becomes Runway&nbsp;22. Because magnetic drift itself is slow, runway designation changes are uncommon, and not welcomed, as they require an accompanying change in [[aeronautical chart]]s and descriptive documents. When runway designations do change, especially at major airports, it is often changed at night as [[taxiway]] signs need to be changed and the huge numbers at each end of the runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators. In July&nbsp;2009 for example, [[London Stansted Airport]] in the United Kingdom changed its runway designations from 05/23 to 04/22 during the night.\n\nFor [[fixed-wing aircraft]], it is advantageous to perform takeoffs and landings into the wind to reduce takeoff or landing roll and reduce the [[ground speed]] needed to attain [[Airspeed|flying speed]]. Larger airports usually have several runways in different directions, so that one can be selected that is most nearly aligned with the wind. Airports with one runway are often constructed to be aligned with the [[prevailing winds|prevailing wind]]. Compiling a [[wind rose]] is in fact one of the preliminary steps taken in constructing airport runways.<ref>[http://www.enviroware.com/windrose-pro-for-airports-runway-design] Retrieved on 2012-02-24.</ref> Note that [[wind direction]] is given as the direction the wind is coming ''from'': a plane taking off from runway 09 faces east, into an \"east wind\" blowing from 090\u00b0. \n\nOriginally in the 1920s and 1930s, airports and air bases\u2014particularly in the United Kingdom\u2014were built in a triangle-like pattern of three runways at 60\u00b0 angles to each other. The reason was that back then aviation was only starting, and as a result although it was known that winds affect runway distance required, etc. not much was known about wind behaviour. As a result, three runways in a triangle-like pattern were built, and the runway with the heaviest traffic on it would eventually expand into an airport's main runway, while the other two runways would be either abandoned or converted into taxiways.<ref>https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/61396/when-and-why-was-runway-07-25-at-kai-tak-removed</ref> For example [[Bristol Airport]] has only one runway - 09/27 (9/27) - and two taxiways that form a 'V' which may have been runways on the original 1930s [[RAF Lulsgate Bottom]] airbase. {{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Declared distances == <!-- Disambiguation pages and redirects link to this section. --><!-- Which ones?

'''Overrun areas''' are also constructed at the end of runways as emergency space to slowly stop planes that overrun the runway on a landing that has not gone to plan, or to slowly stop a plane on a [[rejected takeoff]] or a takeoff that has not gone to plan. Blast pads are often not as strong as the main paved surface of the runway and are marked with yellow [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]]. Regardless of circumstances regarding blast pad use, usage of the blast pad for [[taxiing]], [[Takeoff|take off]] or [[landing]], save for an emergency, is not permitted.\n[[File:Runway diagram, Blast pad.png|700px|center]]\n* '''[[Displaced threshold]]s''' may be used for taxiing, takeoff, and landing rollout, but not for touchdown. A [[displaced threshold]] often exists because obstacles just before the runway, runway strength, or noise restrictions may make the beginning section of runway unsuitable for landings.<ref>Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge FAA-H-8083-25A, p. 306</ref> It is marked with white paint arrows that lead up to the beginning of the landing portion of the runway. Like with blast pads, landings on displaced thresholds of the runway are not permitted save for an emergency or any other circumstance that may require displaced threshold use.\n[[File:Runway diagram, Displaced threshold.png|700px|center]]\n\n==Runway markings==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nThere are runway markings and signs on most large runways. Larger runways have a distance remaining sign (black box with white numbers). This sign uses a single number to indicate the remaining distance of the runway in thousands of feet. For example, a 7 will indicate {{Convert|7000|ft|abbr=on|0}} remaining. The runway threshold is marked by a line of green lights.\n\n[[File:RunwayDiagram.png|650px]]\n\nThere are three types of runways:\n* Visual runways are used at small airstrips and are usually just a strip of grass, gravel, ice, asphalt, or concrete. Although there are usually no markings on a visual runway, they may have threshold markings, designators, and centerlines. Additionally, they do not provide an instrument-based landing procedure; pilots must be able to see the runway to use it. Also, radio communication may not be available and pilots must be self-reliant.\n* Non-precision instrument runways are often used at small- to medium-size airports. These runways, depending on the surface, may be marked with threshold markings, designators, centerlines, and sometimes a {{Convert|1000|ft|abbr=on|0}} mark (known as an aiming point, sometimes installed at {{Convert|1500|ft|abbr=on|0}}). While centerlines provide horizontal position guidance, aiming point markers provide vertical position guidance to planes on visual approach.\n* Precision instrument runways, which are found at medium- and large-size airports, consist of a blast pad/stopway (optional, for airports handling jets), threshold, designator, centerline, aiming point, and {{Convert|500|ft|abbr=on|0}}, {{Convert|1000|ft|abbr=on|0}}/{{Convert|1500|ft|abbr=on|0}}, {{Convert|2000|ft|abbr=on|0}}, {{Convert|2500|ft|abbr=on|0}}, and {{Convert|3000|ft|abbr=on|0}} touchdown zone marks. Precision runways provide both horizontal and vertical guidance for instrument approaches.\n\n===National variants===\n* In Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom,<ref>[http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP637.PDF CAP637, Visual aids handbook, chapter 2, page 3, Issue 2, May 2007, Civil Aviation Authority]</ref> as well as some other countries or territories ([[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) all 3-stripe and 2-stripe touchdown zones for precision runways are replaced with one-stripe touchdown zones.\n* In some South American countries like [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]] one 3-stripe is added and a 2-stripe is replaced with the aiming point.\n* Some European countries replace the aiming point with a 3-stripe touchdown zone.\n* Runways in Norway have yellow markings instead of the usual white ones. This also occurs in some airports in Japan, Sweden, and Finland. The yellow markings are used to ensure better contrast against snow.\n* Runways may have different types on each end. To cut costs, many airports do not install precision guidance equipment on both ends. Runways with one precision end and any other type of end can install the full set of touchdown zones, even if some are past the midpoint. Runways with precision markings on both ends omit touchdown zones within {{Convert|900|ft|abbr=on|0}} of the midpoint, to avoid ambiguity over the end with which the zone is associated.\n\n== Runway lighting ==\n[[File:Runway Landing Light.jpg|thumb|upright|A runway landing light from 1945]]\n\nA line of lights on an airfield or elsewhere to guide aircraft in taking off or coming in to land or an illuminated runway is sometimes also known as a [[Approach lighting system|flare path]].\n\n=== Technical specifications ===\n<!-- Disambiguation pages and redirects link to this section. --><!-- Which ones?

This also avoids the cost of having the lighting system on for extended periods. Smaller airports may not have lighted runways or runway markings. Particularly at private airfields for light planes, there may be nothing more than a [[windsock]] beside a landing strip.\n\n== Runway safety ==\n{{Main|Runway safety}}\n\nTypes of runway [[Aviation safety|safety]] incidents include:\n* '''Runway excursion''' - an incident involving only a single aircraft, where it makes an inappropriate exit from the runway (e.g. [[Thai Airways#Accidents and incidents|Thai Airways Flight 679]]).\n** '''Runway overrun''' (also known as an '''overshoot''') -  a type of excursion where the aircraft is unable to stop before the end of the runway (e.g. [[Air France Flight 358]], [[TAM Airlines Flight 3054]]).\n* '''[[Runway incursion]]''' - an incident involving incorrect presence of a vehicle, person or another aircraft on the runway (e.g. [[Aeroflot Flight 3352]], [[Linate Airport disaster|Linate Airport disaster (Scandinavian Airlines Flight 686)]]).\n* '''Runway confusion''' - an aircraft makes use of the wrong runway for landing or takeoff (e.g. [[Singapore Airlines Flight 006]], [[Western Airlines Flight 2605]]).\n* '''Runway undershoot''' - an aircraft that lands short of the runway (e.g. [[British Airways Flight 38]], [[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]]).\n\n== Pavement ==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}} {{Globalize|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n[[File:Pista Congonhas03.jpg|thumb|Runway surface at [[Congonhas Airport]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. The grooves increase friction and reduce the risk of [[Hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaning]].]]\nThe choice of material used to construct the runway depends on the use and the local ground conditions. For a major airport, where the ground conditions permit, the most satisfactory type of pavement for long-term minimum maintenance is [[concrete]]. Although certain airports have used reinforcement in concrete pavements, this is generally found to be unnecessary, with the exception of [[expansion joint]]s across the runway where a [[dowel]] assembly, which permits relative movement of the concrete slabs, is placed in the concrete. Where it can be anticipated that major settlements of the runway will occur over the years because of unstable ground conditions, it is preferable to install [[asphalt]]ic concrete surface, as it is easier to patch on a periodic basis. Fields with very low traffic of light planes may use a sod surface. Some runways make use of salt flats.\n\nFor pavement designs, borings are taken to determine the subgrade condition, and based on the relative [[bearing capacity]] of the subgrade, the specifications are established. For heavy-duty commercial aircraft, the pavement thickness, no matter what the top surface, varies from {{convert|10|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4|ft|abbr=on|0}}, including subgrade.\n\nAirport pavements have been designed by two methods. The first, ''Westergaard'', is based on the assumption that the pavement is an elastic plate supported on a heavy fluid base with a uniform reaction [[coefficient]] known as the [[Hooke's law|K value]]. Experience has shown that the ''K'' values on which the formula was developed are not applicable for newer aircraft with very large footprint pressures.\n\nThe second method is called the ''[[California bearing ratio]]'' and was developed in the late 1940s. It is an extrapolation of the original test results, which are not applicable to modern aircraft pavements or to modern aircraft [[landing gear]]. Some designs were made by a mixture of these two design theories. A more recent method is an analytical system based on the introduction of vehicle response as an important design parameter. Essentially it takes into account all factors, including the traffic conditions, service life, materials used in the construction, and, especially important, the dynamic response of the vehicles using the landing area.\n\nBecause airport pavement construction is so expensive, manufacturers aim to minimize aircraft stresses on the pavement. Manufacturers of the larger planes design landing gear so that the weight of the plane is supported on larger and more numerous tires. Attention is also paid to the characteristics of the landing gear itself, so that adverse effects on the pavement are minimized. Sometimes it is possible to reinforce a pavement for higher loading by applying an overlay of asphaltic concrete or [[portland cement]] concrete that is bonded to the original slab. Post-tensioning concrete has been developed for the runway surface. This permits the use of thinner pavements and should result in longer concrete pavement life. Because of the susceptibility of thinner pavements to [[Frost heaving|frost heave]], this process is generally applicable only where there is no appreciable [[Weathering#Frost weathering|frost action]].\n\n===Pavement surface===\n[[File:Mahan Air A310 EP-MNO.jpg|thumb|A [[Mahan Air]] [[Airbus A310]] using [[reverse thrust]] in rainy weather at [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]]]]\n\nRunway pavement surface is prepared and maintained to maximize friction for wheel braking. To minimize [[hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaning]] following heavy rain, the pavement surface is usually grooved so that the surface water film flows into the grooves and the peaks between grooves will still be in contact with the aircraft tires. To maintain the macrotexturing built into the runway by the grooves, maintenance crews engage in [[airfield rubber removal]] or [[hydrocleaning]] in order to meet required [[FAA]] friction levels.\n\n==={{anchor|surface_types}} Surface type codes===\n[[File:Grass airstrip at badminton england arp.jpg|thumb|The grass airstrip on the Badminton estate, [[Badminton, Gloucestershire|Badminton]], [[South Gloucestershire]], [[England]]. The strip is very simple: no lighting, no centreline, and no approach aids. The edge is marked by simple posts.]]\n\nIn [[aviation]] charts, the surface type is usually abbreviated to a three-letter code.\n\nThe most common hard surface types are asphalt and concrete. The most common soft surface types are grass and gravel.\n\n{|\n|-\n| width=\"55px\" | * ASP\n| [[Asphalt concrete|Asphalt]]\n|-\n| * BIT\n| [[Bitumen|Bitumin]]ous asphalt or tarmac\n|-\n| * BRI\n| [[Brick]]s (no longer in use, covered with asphalt or concrete now)\n|-\n| * CLA\n| [[Clay]]\n|-\n| * COM\n| Composite\n|-\n| * CON\n| [[Concrete]]\n|-\n| * COP\n| Composite\n|-\n| * COR\n| [[Coral]] (fine crushed coral reef structures)\n|-\n| * GRE\n| Graded or rolled earth, grass on graded earth\n|-\n| * GRS\n| [[Grass]] or earth not graded or rolled\n|-\n| * GVL\n| [[Gravel]]\n|-\n| * ICE\n| [[Ice]]\n|-\n| * LAT\n| [[Laterite]]\n|-\n| * MAC\n| [[Macadam]]\n|-\n| * PEM\n| Partially concrete, asphalt or bitumen-bound macadam\n|-\n| * PER\n| Permanent surface, details unknown\n|-\n| * PSP\n| [[Marston Matting]] (derived from pierced/perforated steel planking)\n|-\n| * SAN\n| [[Sand]]\n|-\n| * SMT\n| [[Sommerfeld Tracking]]\n|-\n| * SNO\n| [[Snow]]\n|-\n| * U\n| Unknown surface\n|}\n\nWater runways do not have a type code as they do not have physical markings, and are thus not registered as specific runways.\n\n== Runway length ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\n{{Main|List of longest runways}}\nA runway of at least {{Convert|6000|ft|abbr=on}} in length is usually adequate for [[aircraft]] weights below approximately {{convert|200000|lb|abbr=on}}. Larger aircraft including [[Wide-body aircraft|widebodies]] will usually require at least {{Convert|8000|ft|abbr=on}} at sea level and somewhat more at higher [[altitude]] airports. International widebody flights, which carry substantial amounts of fuel and are therefore heavier, may also have landing requirements of {{convert|10000|ft|abbr=on}} or more and takeoff requirements of {{convert|13000|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Boeing 747]] is considered to have the longest takeoff distance of the more common aircraft types and has set the standard for runway lengths of larger international airports.\n\nAt [[sea level]], {{convert|10000|ft|abbr=on}} can be considered an adequate length to land virtually any aircraft. For example, at [[O'Hare International Airport]], when landing simultaneously on 4L/22R and 10/28 or parallel 9R/27L, it is routine for arrivals from [[East Asia]], which would normally be vectored for 4L/22R ({{Convert|7500|ft|abbr=on|0}}) or 9R/27L ({{Convert|7967|ft|abbr=on|0}}) to request 28R ({{Convert|13000|ft|abbr=on|0}}). It is always accommodated, although occasionally with a delay. Another example is that the [[Lule\u00e5 Airport]] in Sweden was extended to {{convert|10990|ft|abbr=on|0}} to allow any fully loaded freight aircraft to take off.\n\nAn aircraft taking off at a higher altitude must do so at reduced weight due to decreased [[density]] of air at higher altitudes, which reduces engine power and wing lift. An aircraft must also take off at a reduced weight in hotter or more humid conditions (see [[density altitude]]). Most commercial aircraft carry manufacturer's tables showing the adjustments required for a given temperature.\n\nWind rose diagrams have been proved to be very useful nowadays in the design of airport runway.\n\nIn India, recommendations of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are now followed more often. For landing, only altitude correction is  done for runway length whereas for take-off, all types of correction are  taken into consideration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Runway_Incursion_and_Airport_Design|title=Runway Incursion and Airport Design - SKYbrary Aviation Safety|website=www.skybrary.aero|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref>\n\n[[File:950318 STS67 Endeavour landing.jpg|thumb|right|A parachute is used to slow down craft, in this case the [[Space Shuttle]]]]\n\nThe world's longest paved runway, at [[Qamdo Bamda Airport]] in Tibet (China), has a total length of {{Convert|5500|m|abbr=on|0}}.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Lbiarunwayflyover.jpg|In the 1980s, [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]] extended its runway to take wide bodied planes by building an [[overpass]] over the [[A658 road]].\nFile:Sumburgh Airport Barrier.webm|Road crossing of ([[Shetland]]) A970 with [[Sumburgh Airport|Sumburgh]] airport's runway.

Solar deities and Sun worship can be found throughout most of [[recorded history]] in various forms. The Sun is sometimes referred to by its [[Latin]] name ''Sol'' or by its [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''[[Helios]]''. The [[English language|English]] word ''sun'' stems from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''sunn\u01ed''.<ref>In most romance languages the word for \"sun\" is masculine (e.g. ''le soleil'' in French, ''el sol'' in Spanish, ''Il Sole'' in Italian).\nIn most Germanic languages it is feminine (e.g. ''Die Sonne'' in German). In [[Proto-Indo-European]], its gender was inanimate.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe [[Neolithic]] concept of a  \"solar barge\" (also \"solar bark\", \"solar barque\", \"solar boat\" and \"sun boat\", a mythological representation of the Sun riding in a [[boat]]) is found in the later myths of [[ancient Egypt]], with [[Ra]] and [[Horus]]. Predynasty Egyptian beliefs attribute [[Atum]] as the sun-god and Horus as a god of the sky and Sun. As the [[Old Kingdom]] [[theocracy]] gained power, early beliefs were incorporated with the expanding popularity of Ra and the Osiris-Horus mythology. Atum became Ra-Atum, the rays of the setting Sun. [[Osiris]] became the divine heir to Atum's power on Earth and passes his divine authority to his son Horus.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ancient Civilizations- Egypt- Land and lives of Pharaohs revealed|publisher=Global Book Publishing|isbn=1740480562|pages=79|date=30 October 2005}}</ref> Early Egyptian myths imply the Sun is within the lioness, [[Sekhmet]], at night and is reflected in her eyes; or that it is within the cow, [[Hathor]], during the night, being reborn each morning as her son (''bull'').\n\nMesopotamian [[Shamash]] plays an important role during the [[Bronze Age]], and \"my Sun\" is eventually used as an address to royalty. Similarly, South American cultures have a tradition of Sun worship, as with the Incan [[Inti]].\n\n[[Proto-Indo-European religion]] has a solar chariot, the Sun as traversing the sky in a [[chariot]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kristiansen |first1=Kristian |title=The Nebra find and early Indo-European religion }}{{dead link|date=March 2019}}</ref> In Germanic mythology this is ''[[S\u00f3l (Sun)|Sol]]'', in Vedic [[Surya]], and in Greek [[Helios]] (occasionally referred to as [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]) and (sometimes) as [[Apollo]]. In Proto-indo-European mythology the sun appears to be a multilayered figure, manifested as a goddess but also perceived as the eye of the sky father [[Dyeus]].<ref>Dexter, Miriam Robbins (Fall\u2013Winter 1984). \"Proto-Indo-European Sun Maidens and Gods of the Moon\".

In [[late antiquity]], the theological centrality of the Sun in some Imperial religious systems suggest a form of a \"solar [[monotheism]]\". The religious commemorations on December 25 were replaced under Christian domination of the Empire with the birthday of Christ.<ref>\"Sun worship.\" [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2009</ref>\n\n===Africa===\n[[File:Egypt.IsisHorus.01.png|100px|thumb|left|[[Isis]], bearing her solar disk and horns nurses her infant, Horus]]\n\nThe [[Tiv people]] consider the Sun to be the son of the [[God|supreme being]] [[Awondo]] and the Moon Awondo's daughter. The [[Lozi people|Barotse tribe]] believes that the Sun is inhabited by the sky god [[Nyambi]] and the Moon is his wife.\nSome [[Sara people]] also worship the Sun.\nEven where the sun god is equated with the supreme being, in some African mythologies he or she does not have any special functions or privileges as compared to other deities. The ancient Egyptian god of creation, [[Amun]] is also believed to reside inside the sun. So is the [[Akan people|Akan]] creator deity, [[Nyame]] and the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] deity of creation, Nommo. Also in Egypt, there was a religion that worshipped the Sun directly, and was among the first monotheistic religions: [[Atenism]].\n\nSun worship was prevalent in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. The earliest deities associated with the Sun are all goddesses: [[Wadjet]], [[Sekhmet]], [[Hathor]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Bast (mythology)|Bast]], [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], and [[Menhit]]. First Hathor, and then Isis, give birth to and nurse [[Horus]] and [[Ra]]. Hathor the horned-cow is one of the 12 daughters of Ra, gifted with joy and is a wet-nurse to Horus.\n\nFrom at least the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th Dynasty]] of [[ancient Egypt]], the Sun was worshipped as the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Ra|Re]] (pronounced probably as Riya, meaning simply {{'}}'''the sun'''{{'}}), and portrayed as a falcon headed god surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent.  Re supposedly gave warmth to the living body, symbolised as an [[ankh]]: a \"T\" shaped [[amulet]] with a looped upper half.  The ankh, it was believed, was surrendered with death, but could be preserved in the corpse with appropriate mummification and [[funerary cult|funerary rites]]. The supremacy of Re in the Egyptian [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] was at its highest with the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|5th Dynasty]], when open air solar temples became common. In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], Ra lost some of his preeminence to [[Osiris]], lord of the West, and judge of the dead. In the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Empire]] period, the Sun became identified with the [[dung beetle]], whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the Sun. In the form of the sun disc [[Aten]], the Sun had a brief resurgence during the [[Amarna Period]] when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaton]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Teeter|first1=Emily|title=Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780521848558}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Frankfort|first1=Henri|title=Ancient Egyptian Religion: an Interpretation|date=2011|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0486411385}}</ref>\n\nThe Sun's movement across the sky represents a struggle between the Pharaoh's soul and an avatar of Osiris. Ra travels across the sky in his solar-boat; at dawn he drives away the demon king [[Apep]]. The \"solarisation\" of several local gods (Hnum-Re, Min-Re, Amon-Re) reaches its peak in the period of the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|fifth dynasty]].\n\n{{Hiero|Akhet (horizon)|<hiero>N27</hiero>|align=right|era=egypt}}\nRituals to the god Amun who became identified with the sun god Ra were often carried out on the top of temple [[Pylon (architecture)|pylons]]. A Pylon mirrored the hieroglyph for 'horizon' or ''[[akhet (hieroglyph and season)|akhet]]'', which was a depiction of two hills \"between which the sun rose and set\",<ref>Wilkinson, op. cit., p.195</ref> associated with recreation and rebirth. On the first Pylon of the temple of Isis at [[Philae]], the pharaoh is shown slaying his enemies in the presence of Isis, Horus and Hathor.\nIn the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth dynasty]], the earliest-known monotheistic head of state, [[Akhenaten]] changed the polytheistic religion of Egypt to a monotheistic one, Atenism of the solar-disk and is the first recorded state monotheism. All other deities were replaced by the Aten, including [[Amun-Ra]], the reigning sun god of Akhenaten's own region. Unlike other deities, the Aten did not have multiple forms. His only image was a disk\u2014a symbol of the Sun.\n\nSoon after Akhenaten's death, worship of the traditional deities was reestablished by the religious leaders (Ay the High-Priest of Amen-Ra, mentor of Tutankhaten/Tutankhamen) who had adopted the Aten during the reign of Akhenaten.\n\n===Armenia===\nIn [[Armenian mythology]] and in the vicinity of [[Carahunge]], the ancient site of interest in the field of [[archaeoastronomy]], people worshiped a powerful deity or intelligence called Ara, embodied as the sun (Ar<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w36gAAAAMAAJ&dq=Armenians+and+Old+Armenia&q=god|title=Armenians and old Armenia: archaeoastronomy, linguistics, oldest history|last=Herouni|first=Paris M.|date=2004|publisher=Tigran Metz Publishing House|language=en|page=127}}</ref> or Arev).

The [[Aztec]] people considered him the leader of ''[[Tollan]]'' ([[heaven]]). He was also known as the fifth sun, because the Aztecs believed that he was the sun that took over when the fourth sun was expelled from the sky. According to their [[cosmology]], each sun was a god with its own cosmic era. According to the Aztecs, they were still in Tonatiuh's era. According to the Aztec [[creation myth]], the god demanded [[human sacrifice]] as tribute and without it would refuse to move through the sky. The Aztecs were fascinated by the Sun and carefully observed it, and had a [[solar calendar]] similar to that of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Many of today's remaining Aztec monuments have structures aligned with the Sun.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diccionario de Mitolog\u00eda Nahua|editor=Biblioteca Porr\u00faa.

Together with [[Medicine Buddha|Bhai\u1e63ajyaguru Buddha]] (Chinese: ''Yaoshi Fo'') these two bodhisattvas constitute the ''Dongfang San Sheng'' (Three Holy Sages of the Eastern Quarter).\n\nThe [[deva (Buddhism)|devas]] [[Surya]] and [[Chandra|Candra]] are also recognized as deities that embody the Sun and Moon, respectively.\n\n===Chinese mythology===\n[[File:TaiYangXingJun.jpg|thumb|right|Taiyang Shen, the Chinese solar deity]]\n[[File:Xi He.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of the sun goddess [[Xihe (deity)|Xihe]] charioteering the sun, being pulled by a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], in [[Hangzhou]]]]\nIn [[Chinese mythology]] (cosmology), there were originally ten suns in the sky, who were all brothers. They were supposed to emerge one at a time as commanded by the Jade Emperor. They were all very young and loved to fool around. Once they decided to all go into the sky to play, all at once.  This made the world too hot for anything to grow. A hero named [[Hou Yi]], honored to this day, shot down nine of them with a bow and arrow to save the people of the Earth.\n\nIn another myth, the [[solar eclipse]] was caused by the magical dog of heaven biting off a piece of the Sun. The referenced event is said to have occurred around 2,160BCE.  There was a tradition in China to make lots of loud celebratory sounds during a solar eclipse to scare the sacred \"dog\" away.\n\nThe Deity of the Sun in Chinese mythology is Ri Gong Tai Yang Xing Jun (Tai Yang Gong / Grandfather Sun) or Star Lord of the Solar Palace, Lord of the Sun. In some mythologies, Tai Yang Xing Jun is believed to be Hou Yi.\nTai Yang Xing Jun is usually depicted with the Star Lord of the Lunar Palace, Lord of the Moon, Yue Gong Tai Yin Xing Jun (Tai Yin Niang Niang / Lady Tai Yin). Worship of the [[moon goddess]] [[Chang'e]] and her festivals are very popular among followers of [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Taoism]]. Similar to [[Santa Claus]] and [[Christmas]] in the West, the goddess and her holy days are ingrained in [[Chinese popular culture]].\n\n===Baltic mythology===\nThose who practice [[Dievtur\u012bba]], beliefs of traditional [[Latvian culture]], celebrate the Sun [[goddess]], [[Saul\u0117|Saule]], known in traditional [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanian]] beliefs as Saul\u0117.

In the [[Vedas]], numerous hymns are dedicated to [[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Savitr]] etc.\n\nHymn 7.99 of [[Rigveda]], Indra-Vishnu produces the sun, his discus is a vestige of his solar creation, equivalent to the sun, the Vishnu purana identifies the Discus chakra with the following: 'thoughts, like the chakra, flow faster than even the mightiest wind.'.\n\nEven the [[Gayatri mantra]], which is regarded as one of the most sacred of the Vedic hymns is dedicated to [[Savitr]], one of the principal \u0100dityas. The Adityas are a group of solar deities, from the [[Brahmana]] period numbering twelve. The ritual of ''[[Surya Namask\u0101r|Surya Namaskaar]]'', performed by [[Hindu]]s, is an elaborate set of hand gestures and body movements, designed to greet and revere the Sun.\n\nThe sun god in [[Hinduism]] is an ancient and revered deity. In later Hindu usage, all the Vedic \u0100dityas lost identity and metamorphosed into one composite deity, [[Surya]], the Sun. The attributes of all other \u0100dityas merged into that of Surya and the names of all other [[\u0100dityas]] became synonymous with, or epithets of, Surya.\n\nThe ''[[Ramayana]]'' has [[Rama]] as a direct descendant of the [[Surya]], thus belonging to the [[Suryavansha]] or the clan of the Sun. The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' describes one of its warrior heroes, [[Karna]], as being the son of the Pandava mother [[Kunti]] and [[Surya]].\n\nThe sun god is said to be married to the goddess Ranaadeh, also known as Sanjnya. She is depicted in dual form, being both sunlight and shadow, personified. The goddess is revered in Gujarat and Rajasthan.\n\nThe charioteer of Surya is [[Aru\u1e47a|Aruna]], who is also personified as the redness that accompanies the sunlight in dawn and dusk. The sun god is driven by a seven-horsed Chariot depicting the seven days of the week and the seven colours of rainbow which are seen due to the dispersion by [[Surya]]'s rays.\n\nIn India, at [[Konark]], in the state of [[Odisha]], a temple is dedicated to Surya. The [[Konark Sun Temple]] has been declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Surya is the most prominent of the ''[[navagrahas]]'' or nine celestial objects of the Hindus. ''Navagrahas'' can be found in almost all Hindu temples. There are  further temples dedicated to Surya, one in Arasavilli, Srikakulam District in AndhraPradesh, one in Gujarat at [[Modhera]]  and another in Rajasthan. The temple at Arasavilli was constructed in such a way that on the day of Radhasaptami, the Sun's rays directly fall on the feet of the Sri Suryanarayana Swami, the deity at the temple.\n\n[[Chhath]] (Hindi: \u091b\u0920, also called ''Dala Chhath'') is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to Surya, the chief solar deity, unique to [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and the [[Terai]]. This major festival is also celebrated in the northeast region of [[India]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and parts of [[Chhattisgarh]]. Hymns to the Sun can be found in the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. Practiced in different parts of India, the worship of the Sun has been described in the Rigveda. There is another festival called Sambha-Dasami, which is celebrated in the state of Odisha for the ''surya''.\n\n===Indian mythology===\nThe sun is prayed to by South Indians during the harvest festival.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jain Chanchreek|author2=K.L.

For example, Michael Alan Anderson writes:\n<blockquote>Both the sun and Christ were said to be born anew on December 25. But while the solar associations with the birth of Christ created powerful metaphors, the surviving evidence does not support such a direct association with the Roman solar festivals. The earliest documentary evidence for the feast of Christmas makes no mention of the coincidence with the winter solstice. Thomas Talley has shown that, although the Emperor Aurelian's dedication of a temple to the sun god in the Campus Martius (C.E. 274) probably took place on the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' on December 25, the cult of the sun in pagan Rome ironically did not celebrate the winter solstice nor any of the other quarter-tense days, as one might expect. The origins of Christmas, then, may not be expressly rooted in the Roman festival.<ref>Michael Alan Anderson, ''Symbols of Saints'' (ProQuest 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-54956551-2}}), pp. 45\u201346</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same point is made by Hijmans: \"It is cosmic symbolism...which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the southern solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ ... While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas.\"<ref>Hijmans (2009), p. 595</ref> He also states that, \"while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas\".<ref>Hijmans (2009), p. 588</ref>\n\nA study of [[Augustine of Hippo]] remarks that his exhortation in a Christmas sermon, \"Let us celebrate this day as a feast not for the sake of this sun, which is beheld by believers as much as by ourselves, but for the sake of him who created the sun\", shows that he was aware of the coincidence of the celebration of Christmas and the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun, although this pagan festival was celebrated at only a few places and was originally a peculiarity of the Roman city calendar. It adds: \"He also believes, however, that there is a reliable tradition which gives 25 December as the actual date of the birth of our Lord.\"<ref>F. van der Meer, Brian Battershaw, G. R.

In some cases the Sun is revered as a \"father\" or \"founder\" of the tribe. This may apply for the whole tribe or only for the royal and ruling families. This practise is more common in Australia and on the island of Timor, where the tribal leaders are seen as direct heirs to the sun god.\n\nSome of the initiation rites include the second reincarnation of the rite's subject as a \"son of the Sun\", through a symbolic death and a rebirth in the form of a Sun. These rituals hint that the Sun may have an important role in the sphere of funerary beliefs. Watching the Sun's path has given birth to the idea in some societies that the deity of the Sun descends in to the underworld without dying and is capable of returning afterward. This is the reason for the Sun being associated with functions such as guide of the deceased tribe members to the underworld, as well as with revival of perished. The Sun is a mediator between the planes of the living and the dead.\n\n===Modern mythology===\n[[Copernicus]] describing the Sun mythologically, drawing from Greco-Roman examples:\n{{quote|In the middle of all sits the Sun on his throne. In this loveliest of temples, could we place the luminary in any more appropriate place so that he may light the whole simultaneously.

The most famous of these is the ''[[Atet]]'', the barge of the [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian]] sun god [[Ra (god)|Ra]]. The \"[[Khufu ship]]\", a 43.6-meter-long vessel that was sealed into a pit in the [[Giza pyramid complex]] at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] around 2500 BC, is a full-size surviving example which may have fulfilled the symbolic function of a solar barque. This boat was rediscovered in May 1954 when archeologist Kamal el-Mallakh and inspector Zaki Nur found two ditches sealed off by about 40 blocks weighing 17 to 20 tonnes each. This boat was disassembled into 1,224 pieces and took over 10 years to reassemble.

The concept is younger than that of the solar barge, and typically [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], corresponding with the Indo-European expansion after the invention of the chariot in the 2nd millennium BC.\n\nExamples include these:\n* In Norse mythology, the chariot of the goddess [[S\u00f3l (Sun)|S\u00f3l]], drawn by [[Arvak and Alsvid]].

The [[cobra]] (of Pharaoh Son of Ra), the [[lion]]ess (daughter of Ra), the [[cow]] (daughter of Ra), the dominant symbols of the most ancient Egyptian deities, carried their relationship to the sun atop their heads; they were female and their cults remained active throughout the history of the culture. Later a ''sun god'' (Aten) was established in the [[eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth dynasty]] on top of the other solar deities, before the \"aberration\" was stamped out and the old pantheon re-established. When male deities became associated with the sun in that culture, they began as the offspring of a mother (except Ra, King of the Gods who gave birth to himself).\n\nIn [[Germanic mythology]] the Sun is female and the Moon is male. The corresponding Old English name is Si\u021del {{IPA-ang|\u02c8s\u026ajel|}}, continuing Proto-Germanic *S\u00f4wil\u00f4 or *Saewel\u00f4. The Old High German Sun goddess is [[S\u00f3l (sun)|Sunna]]. In the Norse traditions, S\u00f3l rode through the sky on her chariot every day, pulled by two horses named Arvak and Alsvid. S\u00f3l also was called Sunna and Frau Sunne.\n\nOther cultures that have sun goddesses include the Lithuanians ([[Saul\u0117]]) and Latvians (Saule), the Finns ([[P\u00e4iv\u00e4t\u00e4r]], [[Beiwe]]) and the related Hungarians. Sun goddesses are found around the world in Australia ([[Bila (deity)|Bila]], [[Walo (deity)|Walo]]), India ([[Bisal-Mariamna]], [[Bomong]], [[Kn Sgni]]), among the Hittites ([[Wurusemu]]), and Egyptians ([[Sekhmet]]), in the Canary Islands ([[Chaxiraxi]])/([[Magek]]), in Native America, among the Cherokee ([[Unelanuhi]]), Natchez ([[Wal Sil]]), Inuit ([[Malina (mythology)|Malina]]), and Miwok ([[Hekoolas]]), and in Asia among the Japanese ([[Amaterasu]]).\n{{clearleft}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Abram Smythe Palmer]]\n* [[Amaterasu]]\n* [[Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto]]\n* [[Ancient Egyptian solar ships]]\n* [[Beaivi]]\n* [[Belenos]]\n* [[Black Sun (symbol)]]\n* ''[[Canticle of the Sun]]''\n* [[Eki (goddess)]]\n* [[Fire worship]]\n* [[Five Suns]]\n* [[Giza Solar boat museum]]\n* [[Guaraci]]\n* [[Golden hat]]\n* [[Heliocentrism]]\n* [[Inti]]\n* [[July Morning]]\n* [[Konark Sun Temple]]\n* [[List of solar deities]]\n* [[Lunar deity]]\n* [[Nature worship]]\n* [[Order of the Solar Temple]]\n* [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]\n* [[Solar calendar]]\n* [[Solar symbol]]\n* [[Stonehenge]]\n* [[Thelema]]\n* [[White horse (mythology)]]\n* [[Winged sun]]\n* [[Zunbils]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Azize, Joseph (2005) ''The Phoenician Solar Theology''.

The Sun is sometimes referred to by its [[Latin]] name ''Sol'' or by its [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''[[Helios]]''. The [[English language|English]] word ''sun'' stems from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''sunn\u01ed''.<ref>In most romance languages the word for \"sun\" is masculine (e.g. ''le soleil'' in French, ''el sol'' in Spanish, ''Il Sole'' in Italian).\nIn most Germanic languages it is feminine (e.g. ''Die Sonne'' in German).

Predynasty Egyptian beliefs attribute [[Atum]] as the sun-god and Horus as a god of the sky and Sun. As the [[Old Kingdom]] [[theocracy]] gained power, early beliefs were incorporated with the expanding popularity of Ra and the Osiris-Horus mythology. Atum became Ra-Atum, the rays of the setting Sun. [[Osiris]] became the divine heir to Atum's power on Earth and passes his divine authority to his son Horus.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ancient Civilizations- Egypt- Land and lives of Pharaohs revealed|publisher=Global Book Publishing|isbn=1740480562|pages=79|date=30 October 2005}}</ref> Early Egyptian myths imply the Sun is within the lioness, [[Sekhmet]], at night and is reflected in her eyes; or that it is within the cow, [[Hathor]], during the night, being reborn each morning as her son (''bull'').\n\nMesopotamian [[Shamash]] plays an important role during the [[Bronze Age]], and \"my Sun\" is eventually used as an address to royalty.

The [[Lozi people|Barotse tribe]] believes that the Sun is inhabited by the sky god [[Nyambi]] and the Moon is his wife.\nSome [[Sara people]] also worship the Sun.\nEven where the sun god is equated with the supreme being, in some African mythologies he or she does not have any special functions or privileges as compared to other deities. The ancient Egyptian god of creation, [[Amun]] is also believed to reside inside the sun. So is the [[Akan people|Akan]] creator deity, [[Nyame]] and the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] deity of creation, Nommo. Also in Egypt, there was a religion that worshipped the Sun directly, and was among the first monotheistic religions: [[Atenism]].\n\nSun worship was prevalent in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. The earliest deities associated with the Sun are all goddesses: [[Wadjet]], [[Sekhmet]], [[Hathor]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Bast (mythology)|Bast]], [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], and [[Menhit]]. First Hathor, and then Isis, give birth to and nurse [[Horus]] and [[Ra]]. Hathor the horned-cow is one of the 12 daughters of Ra, gifted with joy and is a wet-nurse to Horus.\n\nFrom at least the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th Dynasty]] of [[ancient Egypt]], the Sun was worshipped as the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Ra|Re]] (pronounced probably as Riya, meaning simply {{'}}'''the sun'''{{'}}), and portrayed as a falcon headed god surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent.  Re supposedly gave warmth to the living body, symbolised as an [[ankh]]: a \"T\" shaped [[amulet]] with a looped upper half.  The ankh, it was believed, was surrendered with death, but could be preserved in the corpse with appropriate mummification and [[funerary cult|funerary rites]]. The supremacy of Re in the Egyptian [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] was at its highest with the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|5th Dynasty]], when open air solar temples became common. In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], Ra lost some of his preeminence to [[Osiris]], lord of the West, and judge of the dead. In the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Empire]] period, the Sun became identified with the [[dung beetle]], whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the Sun. In the form of the sun disc [[Aten]], the Sun had a brief resurgence during the [[Amarna Period]] when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaton]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Teeter|first1=Emily|title=Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780521848558}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Frankfort|first1=Henri|title=Ancient Egyptian Religion: an Interpretation|date=2011|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=978-0486411385}}</ref>\n\nThe Sun's movement across the sky represents a struggle between the Pharaoh's soul and an avatar of Osiris. Ra travels across the sky in his solar-boat; at dawn he drives away the demon king [[Apep]].

On the first Pylon of the temple of Isis at [[Philae]], the pharaoh is shown slaying his enemies in the presence of Isis, Horus and Hathor.\nIn the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth dynasty]], the earliest-known monotheistic head of state, [[Akhenaten]] changed the polytheistic religion of Egypt to a monotheistic one, Atenism of the solar-disk and is the first recorded state monotheism. All other deities were replaced by the Aten, including [[Amun-Ra]], the reigning sun god of Akhenaten's own region. Unlike other deities, the Aten did not have multiple forms. His only image was a disk\u2014a symbol of the Sun.\n\nSoon after Akhenaten's death, worship of the traditional deities was reestablished by the religious leaders (Ay the High-Priest of Amen-Ra, mentor of Tutankhaten/Tutankhamen) who had adopted the Aten during the reign of Akhenaten.\n\n===Armenia===\nIn [[Armenian mythology]] and in the vicinity of [[Carahunge]], the ancient site of interest in the field of [[archaeoastronomy]], people worshiped a powerful deity or intelligence called Ara, embodied as the sun (Ar<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w36gAAAAMAAJ&dq=Armenians+and+Old+Armenia&q=god|title=Armenians and old Armenia: archaeoastronomy, linguistics, oldest history|last=Herouni|first=Paris M.|date=2004|publisher=Tigran Metz Publishing House|language=en|page=127}}</ref> or Arev).

The [[Aztec]] people considered him the leader of ''[[Tollan]]'' ([[heaven]]). He was also known as the fifth sun, because the Aztecs believed that he was the sun that took over when the fourth sun was expelled from the sky. According to their [[cosmology]], each sun was a god with its own cosmic era. According to the Aztecs, they were still in Tonatiuh's era. According to the Aztec [[creation myth]], the god demanded [[human sacrifice]] as tribute and without it would refuse to move through the sky. The Aztecs were fascinated by the Sun and carefully observed it, and had a [[solar calendar]] similar to that of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Many of today's remaining Aztec monuments have structures aligned with the Sun.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diccionario de Mitolog\u00eda Nahua|editor=Biblioteca Porr\u00faa.

Together with [[Medicine Buddha|Bhai\u1e63ajyaguru Buddha]] (Chinese: ''Yaoshi Fo'') these two bodhisattvas constitute the ''Dongfang San Sheng'' (Three Holy Sages of the Eastern Quarter).\n\nThe [[deva (Buddhism)|devas]] [[Surya]] and [[Chandra|Candra]] are also recognized as deities that embody the Sun and Moon, respectively.\n\n===Chinese mythology===\n[[File:TaiYangXingJun.jpg|thumb|right|Taiyang Shen, the Chinese solar deity]]\n[[File:Xi He.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of the sun goddess [[Xihe (deity)|Xihe]] charioteering the sun, being pulled by a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], in [[Hangzhou]]]]\nIn [[Chinese mythology]] (cosmology), there were originally ten suns in the sky, who were all brothers. They were supposed to emerge one at a time as commanded by the Jade Emperor. They were all very young and loved to fool around. Once they decided to all go into the sky to play, all at once.  This made the world too hot for anything to grow. A hero named [[Hou Yi]], honored to this day, shot down nine of them with a bow and arrow to save the people of the Earth.\n\nIn another myth, the [[solar eclipse]] was caused by the magical dog of heaven biting off a piece of the Sun. The referenced event is said to have occurred around 2,160BCE.  There was a tradition in China to make lots of loud celebratory sounds during a solar eclipse to scare the sacred \"dog\" away.\n\nThe Deity of the Sun in Chinese mythology is Ri Gong Tai Yang Xing Jun (Tai Yang Gong / Grandfather Sun) or Star Lord of the Solar Palace, Lord of the Sun. In some mythologies, Tai Yang Xing Jun is believed to be Hou Yi.\nTai Yang Xing Jun is usually depicted with the Star Lord of the Lunar Palace, Lord of the Moon, Yue Gong Tai Yin Xing Jun (Tai Yin Niang Niang / Lady Tai Yin). Worship of the [[moon goddess]] [[Chang'e]] and her festivals are very popular among followers of [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Taoism]]. Similar to [[Santa Claus]] and [[Christmas]] in the West, the goddess and her holy days are ingrained in [[Chinese popular culture]].\n\n===Baltic mythology===\nThose who practice [[Dievtur\u012bba]], beliefs of traditional [[Latvian culture]], celebrate the Sun [[goddess]], [[Saul\u0117|Saule]], known in traditional [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanian]] beliefs as Saul\u0117.

In the [[Vedas]], numerous hymns are dedicated to [[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Savitr]] etc.\n\nHymn 7.99 of [[Rigveda]], Indra-Vishnu produces the sun, his discus is a vestige of his solar creation, equivalent to the sun, the Vishnu purana identifies the Discus chakra with the following: 'thoughts, like the chakra, flow faster than even the mightiest wind.'.\n\nEven the [[Gayatri mantra]], which is regarded as one of the most sacred of the Vedic hymns is dedicated to [[Savitr]], one of the principal \u0100dityas. The Adityas are a group of solar deities, from the [[Brahmana]] period numbering twelve. The ritual of ''[[Surya Namask\u0101r|Surya Namaskaar]]'', performed by [[Hindu]]s, is an elaborate set of hand gestures and body movements, designed to greet and revere the Sun.\n\nThe sun god in [[Hinduism]] is an ancient and revered deity. In later Hindu usage, all the Vedic \u0100dityas lost identity and metamorphosed into one composite deity, [[Surya]], the Sun. The attributes of all other \u0100dityas merged into that of Surya and the names of all other [[\u0100dityas]] became synonymous with, or epithets of, Surya.\n\nThe ''[[Ramayana]]'' has [[Rama]] as a direct descendant of the [[Surya]], thus belonging to the [[Suryavansha]] or the clan of the Sun. The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' describes one of its warrior heroes, [[Karna]], as being the son of the Pandava mother [[Kunti]] and [[Surya]].\n\nThe sun god is said to be married to the goddess Ranaadeh, also known as Sanjnya. She is depicted in dual form, being both sunlight and shadow, personified. The goddess is revered in Gujarat and Rajasthan.\n\nThe charioteer of Surya is [[Aru\u1e47a|Aruna]], who is also personified as the redness that accompanies the sunlight in dawn and dusk. The sun god is driven by a seven-horsed Chariot depicting the seven days of the week and the seven colours of rainbow which are seen due to the dispersion by [[Surya]]'s rays.\n\nIn India, at [[Konark]], in the state of [[Odisha]], a temple is dedicated to Surya. The [[Konark Sun Temple]] has been declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Surya is the most prominent of the ''[[navagrahas]]'' or nine celestial objects of the Hindus. ''Navagrahas'' can be found in almost all Hindu temples. There are  further temples dedicated to Surya, one in Arasavilli, Srikakulam District in AndhraPradesh, one in Gujarat at [[Modhera]]  and another in Rajasthan. The temple at Arasavilli was constructed in such a way that on the day of Radhasaptami, the Sun's rays directly fall on the feet of the Sri Suryanarayana Swami, the deity at the temple.\n\n[[Chhath]] (Hindi: \u091b\u0920, also called ''Dala Chhath'') is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to Surya, the chief solar deity, unique to [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and the [[Terai]]. This major festival is also celebrated in the northeast region of [[India]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and parts of [[Chhattisgarh]]. Hymns to the Sun can be found in the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. Practiced in different parts of India, the worship of the Sun has been described in the Rigveda. There is another festival called Sambha-Dasami, which is celebrated in the state of Odisha for the ''surya''.\n\n===Indian mythology===\nThe sun is prayed to by South Indians during the harvest festival.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jain Chanchreek|author2=K.L.

For example, Michael Alan Anderson writes:\n<blockquote>Both the sun and Christ were said to be born anew on December 25. But while the solar associations with the birth of Christ created powerful metaphors, the surviving evidence does not support such a direct association with the Roman solar festivals. The earliest documentary evidence for the feast of Christmas makes no mention of the coincidence with the winter solstice. Thomas Talley has shown that, although the Emperor Aurelian's dedication of a temple to the sun god in the Campus Martius (C.E. 274) probably took place on the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' on December 25, the cult of the sun in pagan Rome ironically did not celebrate the winter solstice nor any of the other quarter-tense days, as one might expect. The origins of Christmas, then, may not be expressly rooted in the Roman festival.<ref>Michael Alan Anderson, ''Symbols of Saints'' (ProQuest 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-54956551-2}}), pp. 45\u201346</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same point is made by Hijmans: \"It is cosmic symbolism...which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the southern solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ ... While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas.\"<ref>Hijmans (2009), p. 595</ref> He also states that, \"while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas\".<ref>Hijmans (2009), p. 588</ref>\n\nA study of [[Augustine of Hippo]] remarks that his exhortation in a Christmas sermon, \"Let us celebrate this day as a feast not for the sake of this sun, which is beheld by believers as much as by ourselves, but for the sake of him who created the sun\", shows that he was aware of the coincidence of the celebration of Christmas and the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun, although this pagan festival was celebrated at only a few places and was originally a peculiarity of the Roman city calendar. It adds: \"He also believes, however, that there is a reliable tradition which gives 25 December as the actual date of the birth of our Lord.\"<ref>F. van der Meer, Brian Battershaw, G. R.

In some cases the Sun is revered as a \"father\" or \"founder\" of the tribe. This may apply for the whole tribe or only for the royal and ruling families. This practise is more common in Australia and on the island of Timor, where the tribal leaders are seen as direct heirs to the sun god.\n\nSome of the initiation rites include the second reincarnation of the rite's subject as a \"son of the Sun\", through a symbolic death and a rebirth in the form of a Sun. These rituals hint that the Sun may have an important role in the sphere of funerary beliefs. Watching the Sun's path has given birth to the idea in some societies that the deity of the Sun descends in to the underworld without dying and is capable of returning afterward. This is the reason for the Sun being associated with functions such as guide of the deceased tribe members to the underworld, as well as with revival of perished. The Sun is a mediator between the planes of the living and the dead.\n\n===Modern mythology===\n[[Copernicus]] describing the Sun mythologically, drawing from Greco-Roman examples:\n{{quote|In the middle of all sits the Sun on his throne. In this loveliest of temples, could we place the luminary in any more appropriate place so that he may light the whole simultaneously. Rightly is he called the Lamp, the Mind, the Ruler of the Universe: Hermes Trismegistus entitles him the God Visible. Sophocles' Electra names him the All-seeing.

The most famous of these is the ''[[Atet]]'', the barge of the [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian]] sun god [[Ra (god)|Ra]]. The \"[[Khufu ship]]\", a 43.6-meter-long vessel that was sealed into a pit in the [[Giza pyramid complex]] at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] around 2500 BC, is a full-size surviving example which may have fulfilled the symbolic function of a solar barque. This boat was rediscovered in May 1954 when archeologist Kamal el-Mallakh and inspector Zaki Nur found two ditches sealed off by about 40 blocks weighing 17 to 20 tonnes each. This boat was disassembled into 1,224 pieces and took over 10 years to reassemble. A nearby museum was built to house this boat.<ref>Siliotti, Alberto, Zahi Hawass, 1997 ''Guide to the Pyramids of Egypt'', p. 54-55</ref>\n\nOther sun boats were found in Egypt dating to different pharonic dynasties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/egyptian_solar_boat.htm |title=Egypt solar boats |author= |date= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nExamples include:\n* Neolithic [[petroglyph]]s which (it has been speculated) show solar barges\n* The many early Egyptian goddesses who are related as sun deities and the later gods [[Ra]] and [[Horus]] depicted as riding in a [[Atet|solar barge]]. In Egyptian myths of the afterlife, Ra rides in an underground channel from west to east every night so that he can rise in the east the next morning.\n* The [[Nebra sky disk]], which is thought to show a depiction of a solar barge.\n* [[Nordic Bronze Age]] petroglyphs, including those found in [[Tanumshede]] often contains barges and [[sun cross]]es in different constellations.\n\nA \"sun chariot\" is a [[mythology|mythological]] representation of the Sun riding in a [[chariot]]. The concept is younger than that of the solar barge, and typically [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], corresponding with the Indo-European expansion after the invention of the chariot in the 2nd millennium BC.\n\nExamples include these:\n* In Norse mythology, the chariot of the goddess [[S\u00f3l (Sun)|S\u00f3l]], drawn by [[Arvak and Alsvid]]. The [[Trundholm sun chariot]] dates to the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], more than 2,500 years earlier than the Norse myth, but is often associated with it.\n* Greek [[Helios]] (or [[Apollo]]) riding in a chariot,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Helios.html |title=Helios |author= |date= |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref> (see also [[Phaethon|Pha\u00ebton]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thanasis.com/helios.htm |title=Helios & Phaethon |author= |date= |publisher=Thanasis.com |accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Sol Invictus]] depicted riding a [[quadriga]] on the reverse of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] coin.<ref>[[:File:ProbusCoin.jpg|Probus Coin]]</ref>\n* Vedic [[Surya]] riding in a chariot drawn by seven horses\n\nThe Sun itself also was compared to a wheel, possibly in Proto-Indo-European, Greek ''h\u0113liou kuklos'', Sanskrit ''suryasya cakram'', Anglo-Saxon ''sunnan hweogul'' ([[PIE]] {{PIE|*swelyosyo kukwelos}}).\n\nIn Chinese culture, the sun chariot is associated with the passage of time.

The [[cobra]] (of Pharaoh Son of Ra), the [[lion]]ess (daughter of Ra), the [[cow]] (daughter of Ra), the dominant symbols of the most ancient Egyptian deities, carried their relationship to the sun atop their heads; they were female and their cults remained active throughout the history of the culture. Later a ''sun god'' (Aten) was established in the [[eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|eighteenth dynasty]] on top of the other solar deities, before the \"aberration\" was stamped out and the old pantheon re-established. When male deities became associated with the sun in that culture, they began as the offspring of a mother (except Ra, King of the Gods who gave birth to himself).\n\nIn [[Germanic mythology]] the Sun is female and the Moon is male. The corresponding Old English name is Si\u021del {{IPA-ang|\u02c8s\u026ajel|}}, continuing Proto-Germanic *S\u00f4wil\u00f4 or *Saewel\u00f4. The Old High German Sun goddess is [[S\u00f3l (sun)|Sunna]]. In the Norse traditions, S\u00f3l rode through the sky on her chariot every day, pulled by two horses named Arvak and Alsvid. S\u00f3l also was called Sunna and Frau Sunne.\n\nOther cultures that have sun goddesses include the Lithuanians ([[Saul\u0117]]) and Latvians (Saule), the Finns ([[P\u00e4iv\u00e4t\u00e4r]], [[Beiwe]]) and the related Hungarians. Sun goddesses are found around the world in Australia ([[Bila (deity)|Bila]], [[Walo (deity)|Walo]]), India ([[Bisal-Mariamna]], [[Bomong]], [[Kn Sgni]]), among the Hittites ([[Wurusemu]]), and Egyptians ([[Sekhmet]]), in the Canary Islands ([[Chaxiraxi]])/([[Magek]]), in Native America, among the Cherokee ([[Unelanuhi]]), Natchez ([[Wal Sil]]), Inuit ([[Malina (mythology)|Malina]]), and Miwok ([[Hekoolas]]), and in Asia among the Japanese ([[Amaterasu]]).\n{{clearleft}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Abram Smythe Palmer]]\n* [[Amaterasu]]\n* [[Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto]]\n* [[Ancient Egyptian solar ships]]\n* [[Beaivi]]\n* [[Belenos]]\n* [[Black Sun (symbol)]]\n* ''[[Canticle of the Sun]]''\n* [[Eki (goddess)]]\n* [[Fire worship]]\n* [[Five Suns]]\n* [[Giza Solar boat museum]]\n* [[Guaraci]]\n* [[Golden hat]]\n* [[Heliocentrism]]\n* [[Inti]]\n* [[July Morning]]\n* [[Konark Sun Temple]]\n* [[List of solar deities]]\n* [[Lunar deity]]\n* [[Nature worship]]\n* [[Order of the Solar Temple]]\n* [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]\n* [[Solar calendar]]\n* [[Solar symbol]]\n* [[Stonehenge]]\n* [[Thelema]]\n* [[White horse (mythology)]]\n* [[Winged sun]]\n* [[Zunbils]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Azize, Joseph (2005) ''The Phoenician Solar Theology''.
