The album was recorded in 1977, with the same band lineup as the previous album, ''[[Spitfire (Jefferson Starship album)|Spitfire]]'' and released in 1978.\n\nThe band had not toured in 1977, partly due to [[Marty Balin]]'s reluctance to commit to the band. The song \"[[Count On Me (Jefferson Starship song)|Count on Me]]\" became a Top 10 single, peaking at No. 8. The album hit No. 5 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. A US and European tour followed. A riot in West Germany occurred after the band decided not to play without [[Grace Slick]], who was ill. They lost their guitars and equipment during the riot and played one more tense show on West German TV in Hamburg, after which Slick left the band for one album. Marty Balin led the band for one more show at a Genesis concert at the Knebworth Festival in England using rented equipment. When they returned to the US, drummer [[John Barbata]] left the band after a serious car accident. This would be the end of the 1970s line-up and several new members joined the band, as well as a new record producer. Success of this album led to Jefferson Starship being contracted to provide a song for the ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]''.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline        = Side A\n| title1          = Love Too Good\n| note1           = \n| lyrics1         = Gabriel Robles\n| music1          = [[Craig Chaquico]]\n| length1         = 6:03\n| title2          = [[Count On Me (Jefferson Starship song)|Count on Me]]\n| note2           = \n| lyrics2         = Jesse Barish\n| music2          = Barish\n| length2         = 3:14\n| title3          = Take Your Time\n| note3           = \n| lyrics3         = [[Grace Slick]]\n| music3          = [[Pete Sears]]\n| length3         = 4:08\n| title4          = Crazy Feelin'\n| note4           = \n| lyrics4         = Barish\n| music4          = Barish\n| length4         = 3:38\n| title5          = Skateboard\n| note5           = \n| lyrics5         = Slick, Chaquico\n| music5          = Chaquico\n| length5         = 3:18\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline        = Side B\n| title1          = Fire\n| note1           = \n| lyrics1         = [[Marty Balin]], Trish Robbins\n| music1          = [[David Freiberg]], Sears\n| length1         = 4:44\n| title2          = Show Yourself\n| note2           = \n| lyrics2         = Slick\n| music2          = Slick\n| length2         = 4:36\n| title3          = [[Runaway_(Jefferson_Starship_song) |Runaway]]\n| note3           = \n| lyrics3         = N.

In 2014 after 4 years spent in ROTAX Junior category, winning multiple championship titles, he switched to Rotax DD2. He qualified three times for the [[Rotax Max Challenge]] Grand Finals (Portimao \u2013 2012, New Orleans \u2013 2013, Valencia \u2013 2014)\n\n;Results\n* 2014 \u2013 Austrian champion in Rotax DD2, 12th place in the Rotax Max Challenge Grand Finals in Valencia, Spain\n* 2013 \u2013 Hungarian Champion and Lower Austrian Champion, Central-Eastern European vice-champion in Rotax Junior,\n10th place in the Rotax Max Challenge Grand Finals in New Orleans, USA\n* 2012 \u2013 Lower Austrian Champion,  33rd place in the RMC World Finals in Portimao, Portugal\n\n===Formula Renault 1.6 NEC===\nIn 2014, Habsburg made his d\u00e9but in single seaters, taking part in the Formula Renault 1.6 NEC Championship with [[Lechner Racing]]. He finished 4th with a 100% finishing rate in 15 races.\n\n===Toyota Racing Series===\nFor 2015, Habsburg contested New Zealand's [[Toyota Racing Series]] in January and February 2015 with Victory Motor Racing, finishing 11th in the championship and 5th in the rookie class with two podium finishes. He would return to the series with Giles Motorsport for 2016 and finished fourth in the championship behind [[Lando Norris]], [[Jehan Daruvala]] and [[Brendon Leitch]] with four podium finishes.\n\n===Formula Renault 2.0 NEC===\nFor 2015, Habsburg decided to switch to the Formula Renault 2.0 NEC for [[Fortec Motorsports]].\n\n===FIA European Formula 3===\nFor 2017, Habsburg stepped up to the FIA European F3 Championship, racing for [[Carlin Motorsport|Carlin]]. He had a highly successful season, taking four podiums and a first series win at Spa. However his most impressive drive came in the end of year [[Macau Grand Prix]]. In the main race, he battled hard for the lead with Brazilian [[S\u00e9rgio Sette C\u00e2mara]], but was unable to pass. On the final lap, Habsburg took the lead around the outside of the final corner at Fisherman's Bend, but braked too late and understeered into the barriers on the exit of the corner, with Sette C\u00e2mara doing exactly the same thing, handing the race win to C\u00e2mara's teammate [[Dan Ticktum]]. Habsburg eventually limped across the line fourth despite broken front suspension. Nonetheless, the Austrian would gain much praise from both his team boss and journalists for his final lap maneuver, along with his great season as a whole. He is returning to the series again in 2018.\n\n==Art car==\nTogether with his mother [[Francesca von Habsburg]], Habsburg launched a unique interpretation of racing and art in 2014.

He would return to the series with Giles Motorsport for 2016 and finished fourth in the championship behind [[Lando Norris]], [[Jehan Daruvala]] and [[Brendon Leitch]] with four podium finishes.\n\n===Formula Renault 2.0 NEC===\nFor 2015, Habsburg decided to switch to the Formula Renault 2.0 NEC for [[Fortec Motorsports]].\n\n===FIA European Formula 3===\nFor 2017, Habsburg stepped up to the FIA European F3 Championship, racing for [[Carlin Motorsport|Carlin]]. He had a highly successful season, taking four podiums and a first series win at Spa. However his most impressive drive came in the end of year [[Macau Grand Prix]]. In the main race, he battled hard for the lead with Brazilian [[S\u00e9rgio Sette C\u00e2mara]], but was unable to pass. On the final lap, Habsburg took the lead around the outside of the final corner at Fisherman's Bend, but braked too late and understeered into the barriers on the exit of the corner, with Sette C\u00e2mara doing exactly the same thing, handing the race win to C\u00e2mara's teammate [[Dan Ticktum]]. Habsburg eventually limped across the line fourth despite broken front suspension. Nonetheless, the Austrian would gain much praise from both his team boss and journalists for his final lap maneuver, along with his great season as a whole. He is returning to the series again in 2018.\n\n==Art car==\nTogether with his mother [[Francesca von Habsburg]], Habsburg launched a unique interpretation of racing and art in 2014. The famous Swiss designer group, Lang-Baumann, designed and painted his race car.<ref name=\"langbaumann\">{{cite web|url=http://langbaumann.com/|title=LB|website=Langbaumann.com|accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n[[File:Ferdinand Habsburg 2019 DTM Hockenheim (May) FP2.jpg|thumb|Habsburg competing for [[Aston Martin Vantage DTM|Aston Martin]] in the [[2019 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]]]]\n[[File:Ferdinand Habsburg Macau 2019.jpg|thumb|Habsburg at [[2019 Macau Grand Prix]]]]\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\"\n!

In 1987, he helped the [[Salt Lake City Trappers]] set a professional baseball record of 29 consecutive victories.\n\nIn 1991, Savage received his bachelor's degree in secondary education from the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]].\n\nSavage's coaching career started at his alma mater [[Reno High School|Reno (NV) High School]] as a pitching coach in 1988. Between 1992 and 2000, Savage served as an assistant coach at [[Nevada Wolf Pack|Nevada]] and [[USC Trojans baseball|USC]]. During this period, his teams won one [[1998 College World Series|national championship]], played in five [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|regionals]] and advanced to two NCAA Super Regionals.\n\n==Head coaching career==\n===Background===\nSavage has served as UCLA's head baseball coach since the summer of 2004. Through 15 seasons at UCLA, Savage has led the Bruins to 11 NCAA Tournament appearances and three College World Series trips. Savage guided UCLA to its first and only NCAA Championship in baseball in June 2013. While at UCLA, Savage has compiled a 42-23 record in the postseason (.646 winning percentage), securing the most postseason victories of any head coach in program history.\n\nSavage has become one of six college baseball head coaches to have won the College World Series (2013), produced the No. 1 overall selection in the MLB Draft ([[Gerrit Cole]] in 2011) and coached the winner of the annual Golden Spikes Award ([[Trevor Bauer]] in 2011).\n\nWhile at UCLA, 13 of his 15 recruiting classes have been ranked among the top 25 by Baseball America.\n\nThrough his 15 seasons at UCLA, he has helped produce 105 total MLB Draft selections. The Bruins' 2019 squad had 13 MLB Draft selections, the largest single-year total of any baseball team in program history. Savage has seen 18 of his former UCLA players advance to play Major League Baseball. \n\nPrior to his time at UCLA, he served as head coach for the [[UC Irvine Anteaters baseball]] program (2002-04). Under Savage, UC Irvine compiled a record of 88-84-1 (32-34 conference) through three seasons and participated in the [[2004 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament#Long Beach Super Regional|South Bend Regional]] in 2004. He helped to revive a then-dormant baseball program at UC Irvine, building up the program during the 2001-02 school year.\n===Year-by-year results ===\nSavage helped take UCLA to the postseason in 2006, his second year with the program. After the Bruins went 15-41 in 2005, they posted a 33-25 overall record in 2006, advancing to the NCAA Malibu Regional, where they went 1-2 with an opening game victory over UC Irvine. In 2007, his third year at UCLA, Savage steered the Bruins to their first [[2007 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|NCAA Super Regional]] appearance since 2000. The Bruins went 33-28 overall, securing a No. 2 seed in NCAA Regional action at Long Beach State. UCLA's team swept the Long Beach Regional with wins over Pepperdine, Illinois-Chicago and Long Beach State, but lost the Super Regional to Cal State Fullerton.\n\nUCLA's 2008 squad advanced to the [[2008 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], marking the first time in program history that the Bruins had earned three consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament. The Bruins were ranked No. 1 in the preseason Baseball America poll  that year. During the regular season, UCLA played 18 games against teams ranked in Baseball America's weekly top-25 poll. Savage helped lead the Bruins to series victories in three of the team's four Pac-10 road series.\n\nIn 2010, Savage's team advanced to the [[2010 College World Series|College World Series]] by defeating the defending [[2009 College World Series|National Champion]] [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU Tigers]] in the Los Angeles Regional and the [[Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball|Cal State Fullerton Titans]] in the Los Angeles Super Regional. The Bruins finished the season in second place, losing two games to the [[South Carolina Gamecocks baseball|South Carolina Gamecocks]] in the Championship Series. He was named the National Coach of the Year by CollegeBaseballInsider.com in 2010.<ref>[http://www.collegebaseballinsider.com/10Postseason/SavageCOY.html Savage Named CBI Coach of the Year], ''CollegeBaseballInsider.com'', June 28, 2010</ref> He was also named 2010 NCAA Division I Western Regional Coach of the Year  by the [[American Baseball Coaches Association]] (ABCA).\n\nIn 2011, UCLA again returned to postseason play, backed by the strong pitching of Gerrit Cole, Trevor Bauer and freshman Adam Plutko. The Bruins compiled a 35-24 overall record and won the Pac-10 Conference with an 18-9 mark in league play.\n\nIn 2012, he led UCLA to the [[2012 College World Series|College World Series]] by defeating [[TCU Horned Frogs baseball|TCU]] in the Los Angeles Super Regional. The Bruins went 1-2 in their trip to the College World Series, defeating Stony Brook before dropping consecutive games to [[2012 Arizona Wildcats baseball team|Arizona]] and [[2012 Florida State Seminoles baseball team|Florida State]] in the second round.\n\nIn 2013, he guided UCLA to the [[2013 College World Series|College World Series]] by defeating [[2013 Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball team|Cal State Fullerton]] in the Super Regional. This was the team's third appearance in the College World Series in four years. The team defeated No. 1-seed [[2013 North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team|North Carolina]] (4\u20131) to advance to the Championship series where they beat [[2013 Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball team|Mississippi State]] to win the NCAA national title.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/06/25/3469041/ucla-one-win-away-from-first-cws.html | title=UCLA finally adds baseball to record title haul | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | work=[[Miami Herald]] | date=2013-06-25 | accessdate=2013-06-26 | author=Olson, Eric}}</ref> Savage was named the National Coach of the Year by [[Collegiate Baseball Newspaper]] and Baseball America, and the [[American Baseball Coaches Association|ABCA]] West Region Coach of the Year.<ref>[http://baseballnews.com/slider/uclas-savage-named-collegiate-baseball-coach-of-year/ UCLA\u2019s Savage Named Coach Of The Year], ''Baseballnews.com'', June 27, 2013</ref> After winning the first national CWS championship, Savage agreed to extend his contract with UCLA to 2025 with an increase in salary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/03/sports/la-sp-ucla-john-savage-ucla-20130704|title=John Savage to stay as UCLA's baseball coach|publisher=[[LA Times]]|first=Mike|last=Hiserman|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailybruin.com/2013/09/25/ucla-extends-john-savages-contract-with-1-125-million-max-compensation/|title=UCLA extends John Savage\u2019s contract with $1.125 million max compensation|publisher=[[Daily Bruin]]|first=Andrew|last=Erickson|date=September 25, 2013|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Savage guided the Bruins back to postseason play, earning the No. 1 overall seed in the [[2015 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. UCLA hosted the NCAA Los Angeles Regional at Jackie Robinson Stadium, but was eliminated in regional play. UCLA's 2015 squad finished the season with an overall record of 45-16.\n\nIn 2017, UCLA went 30-27 en route to the [[2017_NCAA_Division_I_Baseball_Tournament#Long_Beach_Super_Regional|NCAA Long Beach Regional]].\n\nIn 2018, Savage guided the Bruins to a 38-21 overall record and a 19-11 mark in Pac-12 play. UCLA ranked sixth in the nation in team ERA and was seventh in WHIP. The Bruins were just one of two teams, nationally, to rank among the top 10 in both ERA and team fielding percentage.\n\nIn 2019, Savage earned Pac-12 Coach of the Year and ABCA West Region Coach of the Year honors after leading the Bruins to one of the most successful seasons in program history. UCLA went 52-11 (setting a school record for wins), claimed the Pac-12 title, spent a program-record 12 consecutive weeks atop the national rankings, and earned the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament for the second time ever. UCLA won all 14 of its regular-season series, a first in program history.\n\nSavage picked up a pair of milestone wins during the 2019 season, earning his 500th career victory at UCLA after a Friday night win against Oregon State (March 15). He notched career win No. 600 when the Bruins defeated East Carolina (April 12). Savage managed a pitching staff that led the NCAA in team ERA (2.60). No other team finished with an ERA under 3.00 and only one team logged an ERA within one half-run of UCLA. The Bruins also paced the nation in shutouts (throwing a program-record 11), hits allowed per nine innings (6.18), and WHIP (1.05) while ranking in the top-10 in strikeout-to-walk ratio (3.13, fourth) and strikeouts per nine innings (10.2, seventh). Junior right-hander Ryan Garcia (10-1, 1.44 ERA) was named the Pac-12 Pitcher of the Year and a consensus first team All-America selection. Sophomore closer Holden Powell (17 saves, 1.84 ERA) was dubbed the NCBWA Stopper of the Year. A program-record 13 Bruins were selected in the 2019 MLB First-Year Player Draft, including Michael Toglia (23rd overall, Colorado) who became UCLA's first position player to be picked in the first round since Chase Utley in 2000. UCLA had the most day one picks of any NCAA team, and finished tied with Vanderbilt for the most selections overall.\n\nIn 2020, the Bruins opened the season with a 13-2 overall record. UCLA won its first 11 games of the season and had gone 13-2 before the season was suspended due to the outbreak of a global pandemic. The season was not resumed, postseason play was canceled, and UCLA concluded its abbreviated baseball season with 13 wins in 15 games. Under Savage's direction, UCLA's pitching staff had compiled a 1.88 ERA. The Bruins' offense had batted .308 through 15 games. \n\n===Record===\n[[File:Florida and UCLA play at the 2010 CWS.jpg|thumb|UCLA vs. Florida at the [[2010 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament#College World Series|2010 CWS]]]]\n[[File:UCLA baseball 2013.jpg|thumb|The [[Cal Poly Mustangs baseball|Cal Poly Mustangs]] vs. the [[UCLA Bruins]] at the [[2013 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament#Fullerton Super Regional|2013 L.A.

In 1987, he helped the [[Salt Lake City Trappers]] set a professional baseball record of 29 consecutive victories.\n\nIn 1991, Savage received his bachelor's degree in secondary education from the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]].\n\nSavage's coaching career started at his alma mater [[Reno High School|Reno (NV) High School]] as a pitching coach in 1988. Between 1992 and 2000, Savage served as an assistant coach at [[Nevada Wolf Pack|Nevada]] and [[USC Trojans baseball|USC]]. During this period, his teams won one [[1998 College World Series|national championship]], played in five [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|regionals]] and advanced to two NCAA Super Regionals.\n\n==Head coaching career==\n===Background===\nSavage has served as UCLA's head baseball coach since the summer of 2004. Through 15 seasons at UCLA, Savage has led the Bruins to 11 NCAA Tournament appearances and three College World Series trips. Savage guided UCLA to its first and only NCAA Championship in baseball in June 2013. While at UCLA, Savage has compiled a 42-23 record in the postseason (.646 winning percentage), securing the most postseason victories of any head coach in program history.\n\nSavage has become one of six college baseball head coaches to have won the College World Series (2013), produced the No. 1 overall selection in the MLB Draft ([[Gerrit Cole]] in 2011) and coached the winner of the annual Golden Spikes Award ([[Trevor Bauer]] in 2011).\n\nWhile at UCLA, 13 of his 15 recruiting classes have been ranked among the top 25 by Baseball America.\n\nThrough his 15 seasons at UCLA, he has helped produce 105 total MLB Draft selections. The Bruins' 2019 squad had 13 MLB Draft selections, the largest single-year total of any baseball team in program history. Savage has seen 18 of his former UCLA players advance to play Major League Baseball. \n\nPrior to his time at UCLA, he served as head coach for the [[UC Irvine Anteaters baseball]] program (2002-04). Under Savage, UC Irvine compiled a record of 88-84-1 (32-34 conference) through three seasons and participated in the [[2004 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament#Long Beach Super Regional|South Bend Regional]] in 2004. He helped to revive a then-dormant baseball program at UC Irvine, building up the program during the 2001-02 school year.\n===Year-by-year results ===\nSavage helped take UCLA to the postseason in 2006, his second year with the program. After the Bruins went 15-41 in 2005, they posted a 33-25 overall record in 2006, advancing to the NCAA Malibu Regional, where they went 1-2 with an opening game victory over UC Irvine. In 2007, his third year at UCLA, Savage steered the Bruins to their first [[2007 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|NCAA Super Regional]] appearance since 2000. The Bruins went 33-28 overall, securing a No. 2 seed in NCAA Regional action at Long Beach State. UCLA's team swept the Long Beach Regional with wins over Pepperdine, Illinois-Chicago and Long Beach State, but lost the Super Regional to Cal State Fullerton.\n\nUCLA's 2008 squad advanced to the [[2008 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], marking the first time in program history that the Bruins had earned three consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament. The Bruins were ranked No. 1 in the preseason Baseball America poll  that year. During the regular season, UCLA played 18 games against teams ranked in Baseball America's weekly top-25 poll. Savage helped lead the Bruins to series victories in three of the team's four Pac-10 road series.\n\nIn 2010, Savage's team advanced to the [[2010 College World Series|College World Series]] by defeating the defending [[2009 College World Series|National Champion]] [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU Tigers]] in the Los Angeles Regional and the [[Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball|Cal State Fullerton Titans]] in the Los Angeles Super Regional. The Bruins finished the season in second place, losing two games to the [[South Carolina Gamecocks baseball|South Carolina Gamecocks]] in the Championship Series. He was named the National Coach of the Year by CollegeBaseballInsider.com in 2010.<ref>[http://www.collegebaseballinsider.com/10Postseason/SavageCOY.html Savage Named CBI Coach of the Year], ''CollegeBaseballInsider.com'', June 28, 2010</ref> He was also named 2010 NCAA Division I Western Regional Coach of the Year  by the [[American Baseball Coaches Association]] (ABCA).\n\nIn 2011, UCLA again returned to postseason play, backed by the strong pitching of Gerrit Cole, Trevor Bauer and freshman Adam Plutko. The Bruins compiled a 35-24 overall record and won the Pac-10 Conference with an 18-9 mark in league play.\n\nIn 2012, he led UCLA to the [[2012 College World Series|College World Series]] by defeating [[TCU Horned Frogs baseball|TCU]] in the Los Angeles Super Regional. The Bruins went 1-2 in their trip to the College World Series, defeating Stony Brook before dropping consecutive games to [[2012 Arizona Wildcats baseball team|Arizona]] and [[2012 Florida State Seminoles baseball team|Florida State]] in the second round.\n\nIn 2013, he guided UCLA to the [[2013 College World Series|College World Series]] by defeating [[2013 Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball team|Cal State Fullerton]] in the Super Regional. This was the team's third appearance in the College World Series in four years. The team defeated No. 1-seed [[2013 North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team|North Carolina]] (4\u20131) to advance to the Championship series where they beat [[2013 Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball team|Mississippi State]] to win the NCAA national title.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/06/25/3469041/ucla-one-win-away-from-first-cws.html | title=UCLA finally adds baseball to record title haul | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | work=[[Miami Herald]] | date=2013-06-25 | accessdate=2013-06-26 | author=Olson, Eric}}</ref> Savage was named the National Coach of the Year by [[Collegiate Baseball Newspaper]] and Baseball America, and the [[American Baseball Coaches Association|ABCA]] West Region Coach of the Year.<ref>[http://baseballnews.com/slider/uclas-savage-named-collegiate-baseball-coach-of-year/ UCLA\u2019s Savage Named Coach Of The Year], ''Baseballnews.com'', June 27, 2013</ref> After winning the first national CWS championship, Savage agreed to extend his contract with UCLA to 2025 with an increase in salary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/03/sports/la-sp-ucla-john-savage-ucla-20130704|title=John Savage to stay as UCLA's baseball coach|publisher=[[LA Times]]|first=Mike|last=Hiserman|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailybruin.com/2013/09/25/ucla-extends-john-savages-contract-with-1-125-million-max-compensation/|title=UCLA extends John Savage\u2019s contract with $1.125 million max compensation|publisher=[[Daily Bruin]]|first=Andrew|last=Erickson|date=September 25, 2013|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Savage guided the Bruins back to postseason play, earning the No. 1 overall seed in the [[2015 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. UCLA hosted the NCAA Los Angeles Regional at Jackie Robinson Stadium, but was eliminated in regional play. UCLA's 2015 squad finished the season with an overall record of 45-16.\n\nIn 2017, UCLA went 30-27 en route to the [[2017_NCAA_Division_I_Baseball_Tournament#Long_Beach_Super_Regional|NCAA Long Beach Regional]].\n\nIn 2018, Savage guided the Bruins to a 38-21 overall record and a 19-11 mark in Pac-12 play. UCLA ranked sixth in the nation in team ERA and was seventh in WHIP. The Bruins were just one of two teams, nationally, to rank among the top 10 in both ERA and team fielding percentage.\n\nIn 2019, Savage earned Pac-12 Coach of the Year and ABCA West Region Coach of the Year honors after leading the Bruins to one of the most successful seasons in program history. UCLA posted a 52-11 overall record (school record for wins), claimed the Pac-12 title, spent a program-record 12 consecutive weeks atop the national rankings, and earned the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament for the second time ever. UCLA won all 14 of its regular season series, a first in program history. Savage picked up a pair of milestone wins during the 2019 season, earning his 500 career victory at UCLA after a Friday night victory over Oregon State on Mar. 15 and his 600th career win overall after topping East Carolina on Apr. 12. Savage managed a pitching staff that led the NCAA in team ERA (2.60); no other team finished below 3.00 and only one team logged an ERA within a half-run of UCLA. The Bruins also paced the nation in shutouts (program-record 11), hits allowed per nine innings (6.18), and WHIP (1.05) while ranking in the top-10 in strikeout-to-walk ratio (3.13, fourth) and strikeouts per nine innings (10.2, seventh). Under his tutelage, junior righty Ryan Garcia (10-1, 1.44 ERA) was named the Pac-12 Pitcher of the Year and a consensus First Team All-American while sophomore closer Holden Powell (17 saves, 1.84 ERA) was dubbed the NCBWA Stopper of the Year. A program-record 13 Bruins were selected in the 2019 MLB First-Year Player Draft, including Michael Toglia (23rd overall, Colorado) who became UCLA's first position player to be picked in the first round since Chase Utley in 2000. UCLA had the most day one picks of any NCAA team, and finished tied with Vanderbilt for the most selections overall. \n\n===Record===\n[[File:Florida and UCLA play at the 2010 CWS.jpg|thumb|UCLA vs. Florida at the [[2010 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament#College World Series|2010 CWS]]]]\n[[File:UCLA baseball 2013.jpg|thumb|The [[Cal Poly Mustangs baseball|Cal Poly Mustangs]] vs. the [[UCLA Bruins]] at the [[2013 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament#Fullerton Super Regional|2013 L.A.

The show was produced for [[CBBC]] by [[Lion Television]] with Citrus Television and ran from 2009 to 2013 for five series of thirteen half-hour episodes, with additional one-off seasonal and Olympic specials.\n\nThe TV show carries over the graphic style and much of the content of the [[Horrible Histories (book series)|''Horrible Histories'' book series]]. It maintains the franchise's overall irreverent but accurate focus on the dark, gruesome or scatological aspects of British and other [[Western world]] history, spanning from the [[Stone Age]] to the post-[[World War II]] era. Individual historical eras or civilisations are defined and named as in the books, with sketches from several different time periods combined within a single episode. [[Live-action]] sketches\u2014which often parody other UK media or celebrities\u2014and music videos are intercut with animations and quizzes. The starring troupe are [[Mathew Baynton]], [[Simon Farnaby]], [[Martha Howe-Douglas]], [[Jim Howick]], [[Laurence Rickard]], [[Sarah Hadland]] and [[Ben Willbond]], alongside a large supporting cast headed by [[Katy Wix]], [[Lawry Lewin]], [[Alice Lowe]] and [[Dominique Moore]]. The black rat puppet \"host\", Rattus Rattus, appears in short bridging segments, explaining the factual basis for each sketch.\n\nThe [[Horrible Histories troupe|creative team]] was largely recruited from the mainstream adult UK comedy scene. They took inspiration from such quintessentially British historical-comedy classics as ''[[Blackadder]]'' and the [[Monty Python]] films. The series was a critical and ratings success, eventually gaining a wide all ages audience through its non-condescending and inclusive approach. It has won numerous domestic and international awards and has been named among the greatest British children's television series of all time.\n\nIn 2011, a spin-off game show, ''[[Horrible Histories: Gory Games]]'', was launched on CBBC. In the same year, the original show was repackaged for main channel [[BBC One]] as ''[[Horrible Histories with Stephen Fry]]'', with [[Stephen Fry|Fry]] replacing the puppet, Rattus Rattus, as presenter. [[Horrible Histories (2015 TV series)|A new series of special episodes]] began airing in 2015, featuring a new format and cast. Although the original series has ended, it continues to be frequently repeated on the [[CBBC Channel]] daily.\n\n==Background==\n''Horrible Histories'' is based on [[Horrible Histories (book series)|the British children's historical-comedy book series]] by [[Terry Deary]], first published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic UK]] in 1993 and since expanded into a [[Horrible Histories|multimedia franchise]].

Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director [[Dominic Brigstocke]] concluded that the material was strong enough to stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" /> Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it.

This stance sometimes encompassed traditionally accepted if not actually well-documented anecdotes, such as those involving [[Caligula]].<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /><ref name=\"histex_a\" /> All the material used on the show was vetted by production assistant and self-described \"tyrannical pedant\" Greg Jenner during both writing and filming; he says that he has counted only eight errors out of more than 4,000 facts presented over the course of the show's run.<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /> Costuming and makeup were likewise painstakingly recreated based on primary historical sources where available.<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /><ref name=\"bfi5\"/>\n\nWhen an error was discovered, the effort was made to correct it whenever possible. This process is perhaps most noticeable in the evolution of a song featuring the four [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King Georges: lyrics in the original 2009 video incorrectly saying that [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] had \"died on the [[Close stool|loo]]\" were correctly reassigned to [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] for the song's reprise at the show's 2011 BBC Prom concert.<ref name=\"histex_a\" />\n\nTaking cues from what Deary describes as his \"seriously subversive\" attitude towards the mainstream British history education model<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /> meant that the show inevitably incorporated sociopolitical comment. Perhaps most explicitly, Scots-Jamaican nurse [[Mary Seacole]] was deliberately championed in both a sketch and later song as a forgotten heroine in the shadow of [[Florence Nightingale]]. The activities of African-American activists [[Harriet Tubman]] and [[Rosa Parks]] were also showcased, as was ex-slave boxer [[Bill Richmond]].<ref name=\"histex_a\" /> According to Norris, a desire to include more women's stories was hampered by the traditionally male-dominated viewpoint of historical records.<ref name=\"guardblog_a\" /> The show did make an attempt to counteract this by giving showcase songs to the British [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] movement and [[Home front during World War II#Mobilisation of women|women's work on the British homefront during World War II]], and wherever possible highlighting strong-willed, dynamic female figures, including [[Queen Victoria]], [[Elizabeth I]] and [[Boudicca]]. Religious controversies, class divisions, the ethics of conquest, and labour conditions were likewise touched on.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" />\n\nThe association with a proven and popular children's brand focusing on potentially sensitive subjects enabled the TV series to deflect any serious controversy regarding the same subjects, as they had demonstrably already been presented to children without any ill effects.<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /> Senior writer [[Steve Punt]] said that there were in fact very few complaints regarding the initial series' content, adding that \"everyone was very relieved\".<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" /> The producers did consider some topics intrinsically unsuited for an irreverent comic treatment, as for instance the [[Holocaust]] or the harsher details of slavery, and avoided them accordingly.<ref name=\"express_a\" /><ref name=\"histex_a\" /> Norris has described her personal criteria for age suitability as whether she would be nervous watching it with a ten-year-old.<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /> While BBC executives in large part were willing to concede the requirements of reflecting historical realities, some topics, notably suicide, needed careful handling to avoid potentially negative impact on younger viewers.<ref name=\"histex_a\" /> The show sometimes acknowledged particularly emotive subject matter (the World War I [[Christmas truce]], for example) by following up the sketch not with a joke, but a more sombre elaboration of the less comedic details.<ref name=\"guardblog_a\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe TV series used the [[Horrible Histories]] brand, logo and associated trademarks under licence from publisher [[Scholastic Books]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Loveday, Samantha|url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/horrible-histories-heading-to-tv/038035|title=Horrible Histories heading to TV|work=Licensing.biz|date=11 October 2007|accessdate=8 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112185858/http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/horrible-histories-heading-to-tv/038035|archive-date=12 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was produced for the BBC by LionTV and Citrus Television,{{refn|[http://citrustelevision.com/ Citrus Television] was formed by several of the ''Horrible Histories'' producers during the show's first series, and is credited alongside LionTV from the second series onward.|group=note}} with post-production being handled by Platform Post Production.

It's quite amusing, though whether it will pique an interest in the subject, or\u2014as some say\u2014merely encourage children to learn more about defecation, gluttony, murder and torture, we cannot know.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Hoggart, Simon |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/arts/6050573/shakespeare-in-school/ |title=Shakespeare in school|work=[[The Spectator]] |date=2 June 2010|accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nMore specifically, in September 2014, responding to a complaint from the Nightingale Society, the BBC Trust determined that the show had breached editorial guidelines in the sketch highlighting the controversy surrounding Mary Seacole's role in nursing history. In this sketch, Florence Nightingale says that she rejected the Jamaican-born Seacole's application to Nightingale's Crimean nursing corps because it was open to \"British girls\" only. This was held to be imputing racially discriminatory motives to Nightingale\u2014and thus implying them to be historical fact\u2014without sufficient proof. In response, the BBC pulled the offending sketch from their website and announced it would be removed from future showings of the episode.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC rapped over Horrible Histories Florence Nightingale sketch|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29426242|accessdate=22 October 2014|work=BBC News|date=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn a 20th-anniversary retrospective of the franchise in ''The Telegraph'', [[David Horspool]], the history editor of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', defended the show's overall viewpoint, saying, \"There's no particular reason why grown-up historians shouldn't like ''Horrible Histories'' too&nbsp;... They simplify, and they have a definite point of view, but all historians are guilty of that to some degree.\" He further said that \"Getting children interested in the past isn't necessarily easy, and ''Horrible Histories'' does it extremely effectively\u2014and those who come to history because it's fun seem far more likely to stay with it in the long run.\"<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /> Writing for entertainment website DorkAdore, Anna Lowman added that \"Terry Deary had the fine idea of getting kids into history by giving the facts a human face and a joke or two&nbsp;...

Episodes centred around the life of one prominent historical figure played by an established comedy actor. It was in 2016 that a seventh series began with just three specials before  the full series in 2017. The three specials marked anniversaries through the year: 400 years since Shakespeare died, the BBCs 'Love to Read' campaign and 350 years since the Great Fire of London. There was a slight change in cast where the main stars [[Jalaal Hartley]], [[Tom Stourton]] and [[Jessica Ransom]] continued with new members. This was the first series where none of the main original cast were present.\n\n==Films==\nOn 18 September 2015 ''[[Bill (2015 film)|Bill]]'', a 2015 BBC comedy film based loosely around the early life of [[William Shakespeare]], was released. The film, though not officially related to the series, reunited and starred the original core performers of ''Horrible Histories'' in starring roles.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/bbc-films-bill-press-release.html|title=Stars of Horrible Histories to make Shakespeare film|date=22 March 2013|work=BBC Media Centre|accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/film/bill/details/ | title=Bill: production details | publisher=comedy.co.uk | work=British Comedy Guide | accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[Altitude Film Distribution|Altitude Film Entertainment]] and Citrus Films were producing a film adaptation.

The show was produced for [[CBBC]] by [[Lion Television]] with Citrus Television and ran from 2009 to 2013 for five series of thirteen half-hour episodes, with additional one-off seasonal and Olympic specials.\n\nThe TV show carries over the graphic style and much of the content of the [[Horrible Histories (book series)|''Horrible Histories'' book series]]. It maintains the franchise's overall irreverent but accurate focus on the dark, gruesome or scatological aspects of British and other [[Western world]] history, spanning from the [[Stone Age]] to the post-[[World War II]] era. Individual historical eras or civilisations are defined and named as in the books, with sketches from several different time periods combined within a single episode. [[Live-action]] sketches\u2014which often parody other UK media or celebrities\u2014and music videos are intercut with animations and quizzes. The starring troupe are [[Mathew Baynton]], [[Simon Farnaby]], [[Martha Howe-Douglas]], [[Jim Howick]], [[Laurence Rickard]], [[Sarah Hadland]] and [[Ben Willbond]], alongside a large supporting cast headed by [[Katy Wix]], [[Lawry Lewin]], [[Alice Lowe]] and [[Dominique Moore]]. The black rat puppet \"host\", Rattus Rattus, appears in short bridging segments, explaining the factual basis for each sketch.\n\nThe [[Horrible Histories troupe|creative team]] was largely recruited from the mainstream adult UK comedy scene. They took inspiration from such quintessentially British historical-comedy classics as ''[[Blackadder]]'' and the [[Monty Python]] films. The series was a critical and ratings success, eventually gaining a wide all ages audience through its non-condescending and inclusive approach. It has won numerous domestic and international awards and has been named among the greatest British children's television series of all time.\n\nIn 2011, a spin-off game show, ''[[Horrible Histories: Gory Games]]'', was launched on CBBC. In the same year, the original show was repackaged for main channel [[BBC One]] as ''[[Horrible Histories with Stephen Fry]]'', with [[Stephen Fry|Fry]] replacing the puppet, Rattus Rattus, as presenter. [[Horrible Histories (2015 TV series)|A new series of special episodes]] began airing in 2015, featuring a new format and cast. Although the original series has ended, it continues to be frequently repeated on the [[CBBC Channel]] daily.\n\n==Background==\n''Horrible Histories'' is based on [[Horrible Histories (book series)|the British children's historical-comedy book series]] by [[Terry Deary]], first published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic UK]] in 1993 and since expanded into a [[Horrible Histories|multimedia franchise]]. The books and subsequent spin-off materials are intended to pique young children's interest in history via short, factually based but humorously told anecdotes highlighting aspects of the subject not usually covered in more traditional educational sources.<ref name=\"scanlon\">{{cite journal | title=History beyond the academy: humor and horror in children's history books | journal=New Review of Children's Literature and Librarianship, 16:2, 69\u201391|volume = 16| issue=2| pages=69\u201391|year=2011| author=Scanlon, Margaret| doi=10.1080/13614541.2010.540197 }}</ref>\n\nLionTV executive producer Richard Bradley, whose company had previously produced several adult history-themed programmes and whose son was a fan of the ''Horrible Histories'' books, was the initial driving force behind a new TV adaptation.<ref name=\"guardian_a\">{{cite web|author=Hickman, Leo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/17/horrible-histories-huge-hit |title=How Horrible Histories became a huge hit|work=The Guardian |date=17 March 2011|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> Deary was initially sceptical, having had a negative experience with the [[Horrible Histories (2001 TV series)|2001 animated series]], which had only loosely incorporated his concept. He finally agreed to the new project on the condition that it be explicitly \"horrible, funny and true\". While disclaiming any active role in developing the subsequent series, he would eventually contribute to the writing as well as appearing in several small roles.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" />\n\nThe producers were determined that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director [[Dominic Brigstocke]] concluded that the material was strong enough to stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" /> Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.<ref name=\"bcg_a\">{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/horrible_histories/about/ | title=About: Horrible Histories | work=[[British Comedy Guide]] | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo do the material full justice, Brigstocke and series producer Caroline Norris used their industry contacts to put together a creative team consisting mostly of veterans of the adult UK comedy community.<ref name=\"bcg_a\" /><ref name=\"telegraph_a\"/> The BBC readily agreed to this cross-demographic experiment.

This stance sometimes encompassed traditionally accepted if not actually well-documented anecdotes, such as those involving [[Caligula]].<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /><ref name=\"histex_a\" /> All the material used on the show was vetted by production assistant and self-described \"tyrannical pedant\" Greg Jenner during both writing and filming; he says that he has counted only eight errors out of more than 4,000 facts presented over the course of the show's run.<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /> Costuming and makeup were likewise painstakingly recreated based on primary historical sources where available.<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /><ref name=\"bfi5\"/>\n\nWhen an error was discovered, the effort was made to correct it whenever possible. This process is perhaps most noticeable in the evolution of a song featuring the four [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King Georges: lyrics in the original 2009 video incorrectly saying that [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] had \"died on the [[Close stool|loo]]\" were correctly reassigned to [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] for the song's reprise at the show's 2011 BBC Prom concert.<ref name=\"histex_a\" />\n\nTaking cues from what Deary describes as his \"seriously subversive\" attitude towards the mainstream British history education model<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /> meant that the show inevitably incorporated sociopolitical comment. Perhaps most explicitly, Scots-Jamaican nurse [[Mary Seacole]] was deliberately championed in both a sketch and later song as a forgotten heroine in the shadow of [[Florence Nightingale]]. The activities of African-American activists [[Harriet Tubman]] and [[Rosa Parks]] were also showcased, as was ex-slave boxer [[Bill Richmond]].<ref name=\"histex_a\" /> According to Norris, a desire to include more women's stories was hampered by the traditionally male-dominated viewpoint of historical records.<ref name=\"guardblog_a\" /> The show did make an attempt to counteract this by giving showcase songs to the British [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] movement and [[Home front during World War II#Mobilisation of women|women's work on the British homefront during World War II]], and wherever possible highlighting strong-willed, dynamic female figures, including [[Queen Victoria]], [[Elizabeth I]] and [[Boudicca]]. Religious controversies, class divisions, the ethics of conquest, and labour conditions were likewise touched on.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" />\n\nThe association with a proven and popular children's brand focusing on potentially sensitive subjects enabled the TV series to deflect any serious controversy regarding the same subjects, as they had demonstrably already been presented to children without any ill effects.<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /> Senior writer [[Steve Punt]] said that there were in fact very few complaints regarding the initial series' content, adding that \"everyone was very relieved\".<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" /> The producers did consider some topics intrinsically unsuited for an irreverent comic treatment, as for instance the [[Holocaust]] or the harsher details of slavery, and avoided them accordingly.<ref name=\"express_a\" /><ref name=\"histex_a\" /> Norris has described her personal criteria for age suitability as whether she would be nervous watching it with a ten-year-old.<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /> While BBC executives in large part were willing to concede the requirements of reflecting historical realities, some topics, notably suicide, needed careful handling to avoid potentially negative impact on younger viewers.<ref name=\"histex_a\" /> The show sometimes acknowledged particularly emotive subject matter (the World War I [[Christmas truce]], for example) by following up the sketch not with a joke, but a more sombre elaboration of the less comedic details.<ref name=\"guardblog_a\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe TV series used the [[Horrible Histories]] brand, logo and associated trademarks under licence from publisher [[Scholastic Books]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Loveday, Samantha|url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/horrible-histories-heading-to-tv/038035|title=Horrible Histories heading to TV|work=Licensing.biz|date=11 October 2007|accessdate=8 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112185858/http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/horrible-histories-heading-to-tv/038035|archive-date=12 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was produced for the BBC by LionTV and Citrus Television,{{refn|[http://citrustelevision.com/ Citrus Television] was formed by several of the ''Horrible Histories'' producers during the show's first series, and is credited alongside LionTV from the second series onward.|group=note}} with post-production being handled by Platform Post Production. Under series producer Norris and directors Brigstocke, Steve Connelly and Chloe Thomas, each series of thirteen episodes took approximately one year to produce.

In this sketch, Florence Nightingale says that she rejected the Jamaican-born Seacole's application to Nightingale's Crimean nursing corps because it was open to \"British girls\" only. This was held to be imputing racially discriminatory motives to Nightingale\u2014and thus implying them to be historical fact\u2014without sufficient proof.

launched on CBBC.

Episodes centred around the life of one prominent historical figure played by an established comedy actor. It was in 2016 that a seventh series began with just three specials before  the full series in 2017. The three specials marked anniversaries through the year: 400 years since Shakespeare died, the BBCs 'Love to Read' campaign and 350 years since the Great Fire of London. There was a slight change in cast where the main stars [[Jalaal Hartley]], [[Tom Stourton]] and [[Jessica Ransom]] continued with new members. This was the first series where none of the main original cast were present.\n\n==Films==\nOn 18 September 2015 ''[[Bill (2015 film)|Bill]]'', a 2015 BBC comedy film based loosely around the early life of [[William Shakespeare]], was released. The film, though not officially related to the series, reunited and starred the original core performers of ''Horrible Histories'' in starring roles.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/bbc-films-bill-press-release.html|title=Stars of Horrible Histories to make Shakespeare film|date=22 March 2013|work=BBC Media Centre|accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/film/bill/details/ | title=Bill: production details | publisher=comedy.co.uk | work=British Comedy Guide | accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[Altitude Film Distribution|Altitude Film Entertainment]] and Citrus Films were producing a film adaptation.

There were a total of [[List of Super Friends episodes|109 episodes]] and two [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilot|backdoor-pilot]] episodes of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', with [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] appearing in \"The Dynamic Scooby-Doo Affair\" and \"The Caped Crusader Caper\".\n\n==Series titles==\nOver the years, the show existed under several titles:\n* ''[[Super Friends (1973 TV series)|Super Friends]]'' (1973\u20131974)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/sf |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814154304/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/sf/ |archivedate=August 14, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' (1977\u20131978)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/ansfh |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209082751/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/ansfh/ |archivedate=December 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' (1978\u20131979)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/cotsf |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209083212/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/cotsf/ |archivedate=December 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'' (1979\u20131980)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/wgsf |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209083715/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/wgsf/ |archivedate=December 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* ''[[Super Friends (1980 TV series)|Super Friends]]'' (1980\u20131983)\n* ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' (1984\u20131985)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/sftlsps |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119185913/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/sftlsps/ |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' (1985\u20131986)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/tsptgg |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209173900/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/tsptgg/ |archivedate=December 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nPlot lines for the later series involved many of the familiar [[DC Comics]] super-villains that the first incarnation of the ''Super Friends'' did not. Instead, like the comic books, they focused on the far-fetched schemes of mad scientists and aliens, who were invariably revealed as being well-intentioned, and simply pursuing their goals through unlawful or disreputable means.<ref name=\"Vault\">{{cite book |page=10 |title=The DC Vault |first=Martin |last=Pasko |publisher=Running Press |year=2008}}</ref> Typically, at the end of each story, a peaceful and reasonable discussion would be performed by the heroes to convince the antagonists to adopt more reasonable methods.<ref>{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p4.html|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\n''The All-New Super Friends Hour'' departed somewhat from the previous series' formula by featuring villains using more elaborate methods to further their goals; as a rule they could not be reasoned with, requiring the heroes to use direct force to stop them. Beginning with ''Challenge of the Super Friends'', several of the heroes' arch-villains from the comic books (such as [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Riddler|The Riddler]]) began to feature prominently in comic-style stories. Throughout the series, plots often wrapped themselves up neatly in the final minutes of an episode in the fashion of the typical comic books and [[deus ex machina]].<ref name=\"Vault\"/>\n\n==Production history==\nWhen animation company [[Hanna-Barbera]] acquired rights to the DC Comics characters and adapted the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' comic book for [[television]] it made several changes in the transition, including the change of name to ''Super Friends.'' Nevertheless, team members sometimes referred to themselves as the Justice League on the show. The violence common in [[superhero]] [[Comic book|comics]] was toned down for a younger audience and to adhere to broadcast standards governing violence in 1970s [[Saturday morning cartoon|children's television]].\n\nAs a DC Comics-based show, the ''Super Friends'' franchise was owned by DC's parent company [[Warner Bros.]], who later put the series into syndication. [[Cartoon Network]], which had the rights to air most of the rest of the Hanna-Barbera library from its inception in 1992, was not able to air ''Super Friends'' until after the merger of Warner Bros.' parent company, [[Time Warner]] and Cartoon Network's parent company, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] was completed in 1996. This merger also led to Warner Bros. taking control of Hanna-Barbera and all of its other assets as well. The series was owned by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, [[DC Comics|DC Comics Entertainment]], [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], and [[Warner Bros. Animation]].\n\n===1973\u20131974 series===\n{{Main|Super Friends (1973 TV series)}}\n''Super Friends'' first aired on ABC on September 8, 1973,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |last=Rupprecht |first=Michael C. |url=http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#superfriends73-74 |title=Hanna-Barbera Superfriends Chronology |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128000006/http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#superfriends73-74 |archivedate=January 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> featuring well-known DC characters [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Aquaman]]. Superman, Batman and Robin, and Aquaman had each previously appeared in their own animated series produced by [[Filmation]], and voice talent from these prior programs was brought in to work on the new show (with the exception of [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]] who was replaced by [[Norman Alden]] as the voice of Aquaman). Shortly before the ''Super Friends'' series was developed, Superman and Wonder Woman also guest-starred in two episodes of ''[[The Brady Kids]]'' (voiced by Bud Collyer and Jane Webb under [[Filmation]]), while Batman and Robin appeared in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''.\n\nIn addition to the superheroes, a trio of sidekicks was introduced, each of whom were new characters not drawn from the comic books: [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wendy and Marvin]] (voiced by [[Sherry Alberoni|Sherri Alberoni]] and [[Frank Welker]]) and [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wonder Dog]] (also voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), none of whom had any special abilities (save the dog's unexplained ability to reason and talk). The trio\u2014or at least its human members\u2014were depicted as detectives and/or superheroes-in-training; the \"teen detectives and their talking animal\" [[trope (literature)|clich\u00e8]], originally popularized by  ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' , and was typical in Hanna-Barbera cartoons of the mid/late 1970s.\n\nEach episode began with the heroes responding to an emergency detected by the massive TroubAlert computer in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]], which served as the headquarters of the team. Colonel Wilcox, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] official, was a recurring character who would act as a government liaison with the Super Friends during emergencies. Colonel Wilcox was voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]].\nConflicts were usually resolved with the antagonists persuaded to adapt more reasonable methods to achieve their aims (with the assistance of the heroes). Natural disasters triggered by human (or alien) activity were often shown, and environmental themes featured strongly in the program. Three other DC Comics superheroes were featured as guest stars during this season: [[Flash (Barry Allen)|the Flash]], [[Plastic Man]], and [[Green Arrow]].\n\nThis first run of ''Super Friends'', consisting of 16 one-hour episodes which were rerun several times, concluded on August 24, 1974. At this point, the series was cancelled. However, interest in superheroes among ABC's prime-time viewers (with the success of ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and the live-action ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' series) caused the network to revive ''Super Friends''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The original 16 episodes of the series were rebroadcast as a mid-season replacement, running from February 7, 1976, to September 3, 1977.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> These episodes were edited into half-hour versions. At the same time, DC Comics published a ''Super Friends'' comic, which used Wendy and Marvin from issue #1 (November 1976) to #6 (August 1977). In the meantime, Hanna-Barbera began production on a revamped version of the show.\n\n===1977\u20131978 season: ''The All-New Super Friends Hour''===\n{{Main|The All-New Super Friends Hour}}\n''The All-New Super Friends Hour'' featured four animated shorts per program. Wendy, Marvin, and Wonder Dog were dropped from this and all future TV iterations of ''Super Friends'', and were replaced by [[Wonder Twins]] Zan and Jayna, and their pet monkey, [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]]. Unlike Wendy and Marvin, Zan and Jayna had actual super powers. A total of 15 episodes were produced. [[Darrell McNeil]] of the Hanna-Barbera animation studios later explained the change in cast: {{quote|When the decision was made by ABC to renew ''Super Friends'' three years after the first series' 1973 production, ABC and Hanna-Barbara wanted to ramp up (as much as they could) the series' action content. And since we were ramping ''that'' up, that meant making all of our cast a bit more serious, and giving our five leads a bit more backup than three non-powered sidekicks. [New sidekicks] also helped emphasize the 'New' in ''All-New Super Friends''.

The first segment of every show featured two of the heroes (for the purposes of the team-ups in the first and fourth segments, Batman and Robin were considered \"one hero\") teaming up in a separate mini-story. The second segment featured a story with the Wonder Twins. The third segment was considered the \"primary\" adventure of the week, featuring the entire Super Friends roster (including the Wonder Twins) in a longer adventure. The fourth and final segment featured a story with one of the primary lineup and a \"special guest star\". This segment typically featured a problem that was solved using the guest star's unique abilities.\n\nBetween segments there were short spots with members of the Super Friends giving basic safety lessons, providing first-aid advice, demonstrating magic tricks, creating crafts, and presenting a two-part riddle featuring the week's primary plot line. This was the first season to feature two villains appearing in the comic books, [[Black Manta]] and [[Gentleman Ghost]]. Each appeared in only one episode this season and each was somewhat modified for television. Black Manta's costume was not black and he was only referred to as \"Manta\". The Gentleman Ghost was referred to as \"Gentleman Jim Craddock\".\n\n===1978\u20131979 season ''Super Friends'' / ''Challenge of the Super Friends''===\n{{Main|Challenge of the Super Friends}}\nThe next season of ''Super Friends'' featured two segments:\n\n====First segment: ''Super Friends'' episodes====\nThe first segment of the program featured the established group of heroes: Superman, Batman and Robin, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and the Wonder Twins and Gleek.  They were rerun with intro from the ''All-New Super Friends'' Hour when in syndication in the early 1980s, but they are seldom seen in syndication since then.\n\n====Second segment: ''Challenge of the Super Friends''====\nThe second half-hour of the show introduced the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]], a team of 13 recurring foes who are the Super Friends' worst enemies. They used a swamp-based mechanical flying headquarters, the Hall of Doom (resembling the helmet of [[Darth Vader]]), as a contrast to the Super Friends' gleaming Hall of Justice. A total of 16 episodes were produced.\n\nAdditional heroes who had previously appeared as guest stars were added to the roster as well, to make a total of 11. These included [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], and [[Hawkman]] from DC Comics and three Hanna-Barbera creations: [[Black Vulcan]], [[Apache Chief]], and [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]]. Despite the Riddler showing a set of playing cards with (from left to right) Gleek, Zan, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Robin, Batman, and Superman (which he then burns to ashes in his introduction in \"Wanted: The Super Friends\"), the Wonder Twins and Gleek did not appear in ''Challenge''. Enthusiasts have expressed the view that the storylines for the ''Challenge'' episodes were the ''Super Friends'' era's best portrayal of the DC heroes.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n''The'' ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' segment was expanded to 90 minutes mid-season, with reruns of earlier episodes filling out the last half-hour.<ref name=\"Back38\"/>\n\n===1979\u20131980 season: ''The World's Greatest Super Friends''===\n{{Main|The World's Greatest Super Friends}}\n\nIn the fall of 1979, the ''Super Friends'' returned to their prior format, bringing back the original set of five DC superheroes and Zan, Jayna, and Gleek. Eight half-hour episodes were created for this run, with the majority of the season consisting of repeats of ''The All-New Super Friends Hour'' from 1977 to 1978 and The Super Friends segments from ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' from 1978 to 1979. Renamed ''The World's Greatest Super Friends'', this series began on September 22, 1979, and ran until September 27, 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#worldsgreatest |title=Hanna-Barbera Superfriends Chronology |publisher=Members.aol.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1980\u20131982 seasons: ''Super Friends''===\n{{Main|Super Friends (1980 TV series)}}\nRenamed ''[[Super Friends (1980 TV series)|Super Friends]]'' in 1980, the series changed formats again, abandoning the production of half-hour episodes and producing seven-minute shorts. Each episode of ''Super Friends'' would feature a rerun from one of the previous six years and three new shorts. These new adventures featured appearances by the core group of five Super Friends and  Zan, Jayna, & Gleek. There were also guest appearances from members previously depicted in ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' and the Hanna-Barbera-created hero [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|El Dorado]], who was added to the show in 1981 to provide cultural diversity.\n\nThis would prove to be one of the longer-lived incarnations of the series (three years). A total of 22 episodes were produced.\n\n===1982\u20131983 season: ''The Best of the Super Friends'' (reruns)===\nFor the 1982\u20131983 television season ABC ran half-hour reruns of shows from the previous seven seasons, with none of the seven-minute shorts rebroadcast. ABC called the rerun package ''The Best of the Super Friends''.\n\n===1983\u20131984 season: Cancellation and the \"lost episodes\"===\nHanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. had created a [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] package of the earlier ''Super Friends'' series (co-distributed by [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company|LBS Communications]]); these were picked up by stations across the United States and typically broadcast on weekday afternoons. Not wishing to compete with the syndication programming, ABC dropped the series from the 1983\u20131984 Saturday morning television line-up. For the second time, ''Super Friends'' was cancelled.\n\nHowever, during this time Hanna-Barbera continued to produce new episodes with the Super Friends, with ABC's approval and funding.<ref name=\"Back38\"/> In total, 24 \"lost episodes\" were produced, but not aired in the United States that season; the series appeared in Australia. Three of these episodes were aired when ''Super Friends'' returned to Saturday-morning ABC television the following year. The remainder aired on the USA network in 1995, as part of the ''[[The Superman/Batman Adventures|Superman/Batman Adventures]]'' show. The 1983 Lost Episodes of ''Super Friends'' were released on DVD by [[Warner Home Entertainment]] (via [[DC Comics|DC Comics Entertainment]], [[Hanna-Barbera Cartoons]], and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]]) in April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#lost83-84 |title=Hanna-Barbera Superfriends Chronology |publisher=Members.aol.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1984\u20131985 season: ''Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show''===\n{{Main|Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show|Super Powers Collection}}\n\n''Super Friends'' returned to ABC Saturday, September 8, 1984, with a new 30-minute program typically featuring two 11-minute stories per episode. This incarnation featured Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, and the Wonder Twins and Gleek, this time teamed up with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]. In addition to this core group, episodes during this season also featured cameos by old (and new) Super Friends. The series ended August 31, 1985, and featured comic-book villains such as [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], [[Lex Luthor]], [[Mirror Master]], [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mr. Mxyzptlk]], [[Darkseid]], and his henchmen from [[Apokolips]]. This season and the next featured the \"Super Powers\" tagline, which was part of a marketing tie-in with a [[Super Powers Collection|toy line of the same name]] produced by [[Kenner]].<ref name=\"Back38\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://toyotter.com/sp/ |title=Super Powers Archive |publisher=Toy Otter |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010052808/http://www.toyotter.com/sp/ |date=September 9, 2004 |archivedate=October 10, 2004}}</ref>\n\n===1985 - 1986 season: ''The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians''===\n{{Main|The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians}}\n\nIn fall 1985, the next version of Hanna-Barbera's depiction of the DC Comics heroes began, although it no longer carried the ''Super Friends'' name. This series returned to a conventional lineup for the team, with a focus on teen members [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and Firestorm. Once again headquartered at the Hall of Justice in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the heroes battled such familiar foes as [[Lex Luthor]], [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and recurring villain [[Darkseid]]. It also contained the only appearances by [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]], [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]], the [[Royal Flush Gang]], and [[Felix Faust]].\n\nMost notably, it is in this series that Batman's origin is depicted for the first time outside of comics and the first cartoon series to touch upon the serious topic of the death of Bruce Wayne's parents in a flashback which is triggered after Batman and Robin chase The Scarecrow into Crime Alley where Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered. Additionally, in the same episode, Professor Jonathan Crane appears as the Scarecrow's secret identity, which was unknown to the authorities, allowing Scarecrow to use it to secretly sabotage the Super Friends' investigations until Batman managed to deduce his identity, leading to his arrest.\n\n''The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians'' lasted one season before being canceled. The final new episode aired was \"Escape From Space City\" on October 26, 1985. This third cancellation would be the final one, and ''Galactic Guardians'' marked the end of Hanna-Barbera's 13-year run of the series on October 26, 1985.\n\n==Characters==\n{{cleanup list|section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Main|List of Super Friends members|List of Super Friends villains}}\n\n===The Justice League of America===\nThe core group of five heroes made up the \"Super Friends\":\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* [[Aquaman]]\n* [[Batman]]\n* [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]\n* [[Superman]]\n* [[Wonder Woman]]\n|}\n\nAdditional Justice League members included:\n* [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|The Atom]] (1977; 1980\u20131983)\n* [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] (1984\u20131985)\n* [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]] (1973; 1977\u20131985)\n* [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] (1977\u20131985)\n* [[Hawkgirl]] (1977; 1980; 1983)\n* [[Hawkman]] (1977\u20131978; 1980\u20131985)\n\nDC Comics characters who were not Justice League members in comics (at the time), only on the series:\n* [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] (1985)\n* [[Rima|Rima the Jungle Girl]] (1977; 1980)\n\nJustice League members created for the series:\n* [[Apache Chief]] (1977\u20131978; 1980\u20131984)\n* [[Black Vulcan]] (1977\u20131978; 1980\u20131984)\n* [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|El Dorado]] (1982\u20131985)\n* [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]] (1977\u20131978; 1980\u20131985)\n\nOne-shot Justice League appearances were made by:\n* [[Abin Sur]] (1978)\n* [[Green Arrow]] (1973\u20131974)\n* [[Plastic Man]] (1973\u20131974)\n* [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] (1978; 1983)\n\nThe teen sidekicks and their pets:\n* Pets:\n** [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] (1977\u20131984)\n** [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wonder Dog]] (1973\u20131975)\n* Wendy and Marvin:\n** [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wendy Harris]] (1973\u20131975)\n** [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Marvin White]] (1973\u20131975)\n* Wonder Twins:\n** [[Wonder Twins|Jayna]] (1977\u20131984)\n** [[Wonder Twins|Zan]] (1977\u20131984)\n\nOther DC comic characters that appeared in the series:\n* [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]]\n* [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]]\n* [[Lois Lane]]\n* [[Jimmy Olsen]]\n* [[Alfred Pennyworth]]\n* [[Solovar]] (ruler of [[Gorilla City]])\n* [[Steve Trevor]]\n\n===Legion of Doom===\nThirteen villains composed the [[Legion of Doom]] during the ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' season.

The opening credits of ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' names the Super Friends as the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. In addition to the appearance of a JLA emblem on a communicator and a reference to a mission to repair the Justice League satellite, the Super Friends are often linked with the JLA. The Justice League satellite under repair is clearly the same design as the [[Justice League Satellite]] that appeared in the comics at the time, but was shown to be substantially smaller than its comic book counterpart.\n\n==Notable voice actors==\nThe voice of the Narrator was provided by actor [[Ted Knight]] during the early hour-long episodes.  [[Bill Woodson]] took over with the revival of the series in 1977.  His signature line was \"Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice...\". The voices of Marvin and Wonder Dog as well as Mr. Mxyzptlk, Toyman, The Dollmaker, Darkseid, Kalibak, and The Joker were performed by [[Frank Welker]]. [[Adam West]] provided the voice of Batman in ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]''. [[Casey Kasem]] provided the voice of Robin (and many others in the show). [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] lends his voice as Desaad.\n\n==Reception==\nIn January 2009, [[IGN]] listed ''Super Friends'' as the 50th best animated television series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/50.html |title=IGN - 50.

The first special, subtitled \"The Challenge\", was loosely based on the Super Friends and the 1960s ''Batman'' series (played for laughs, but this time, including a laugh track) and included several other DC characters who replaced Samurai, Black Vulcan, and Apache Chief: [[Black Canary]], the E-2 [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] Helena Wayne (a new DC character, gathering her own following in ''All-Star'' and ''Adventure Comics'' JSA runs as a JSA member), and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] (who had previously had his own live action series through Filmation studios). The second special, entitled \"The Roast\", featured [[Ed McMahon]] as emcee of the roast, along the lines of ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' specials. Due to Warner Bros.' contracts on Wonder Woman (already being used in her own live action series; [[Lynda Carter]]) and Superman (in his own live-action theatrical movie at the time; [[Christopher Reeve]]), they were unable to be featured on the specials.\n\n===''The Plastic Man Comedy Adventure Show''===\n{{Main|The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show}}\nPlastic Man first appeared in the first season of ''Super Friends'', in one episode. Later, [[Ruby-Spears|Ruby-Spears Productions]] released a series starring the character in his own solo adventures.\n\n===''Batman''===\nA Batman animated series was also considered in the mid-1980s, presumably with [[Adam West]] reprising his role as the voice of Batman.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} \"The Fear\" was written as a pilot episode for the series, but it was instead adapted in to an episode of ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]''.\n\n===''The New Teen Titans''===\nIn 1983, a cartoon based upon ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' comics began development. It was created as a companion for the ''Super Friends'', to be set in the same continuity. Robin was not going to be featured in the cartoon though, at least not as a regular, since in the ''Super Friends'' universe, he was a member of the Justice League. Like ''Super Friends'', the show was to be developed by Hanna-Barbera for ABC, but since shows like ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (airing on [[NBC]]) were so popular at the time, this show was never picked up by the network. The show would have featured [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]] as the leader, along with [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Beast Boy|Changeling]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]]. Although the show failed to get picked up, a television commercial with a [[substance abuse]] theme did feature the Titans, as they would have appeared in the animated series, along with a new superhero named \"The Protector\" who would have been the replacement character for Robin. A Teen Titans animated TV program was eventually [[Teen Titans (TV series)|produced]], adding Robin and removing Wonder Girl, Kid Flash and The Protector.\n\n===''DC Super Friends''===\n{{Main|Imaginext#DC Super Friends}}\n[[Fisher-Price]] developed a toy line named DC Super Friends featuring DC Comics characters as toys for young children. A comic book series and direct-to-video original animation called ''The Joker's Playhouse'' (2010) was developed to tie-in. The video features the World's Greatest Super Friends theme, allusions to the Legion of Doom, and the Super Friends and their Hall of Justice.

Nelson Bridwell]] and artist [[Alex Toth]].<ref>{{cite journal|last= Franklin|first= Chris|title= The Kids in the Hall (of Justice) A Whirlwind Tour with the Super Friends|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 61|pages= 24\u201328|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date = December 2012|quote=  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/68956/ ''Limited Collectors' Edition'' #C-41] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> DC published a [[comic book]] version of the ''Super Friends'' from November 1976 to August 1981.

Scribe E. Nelson Bridwell and artist Ric Estrada crafted the inaugural issue.}}</ref> Zan and Jayna were given back stories and secret identities as a pair of blond-haired high school kids; they were more competent heroes than their cartoon counterparts.\n\nWhile the television cartoons were not part of the same fictional universe as the DC comic books, writer E. Nelson Bridwell made the comic book accord with the other DC titles via [[footnote]]s. An example of trying to fit ''Super Friends'' into the DC Universe:\n* Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog were the only ones active at the Hall of Justice, because the Justice League are in the 30th Century with the [[Justice Society]] (as shown in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #147\u2013148). Robin was busy helping the Titans in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #50-52. Bridwell also gave them last names and ties to the other characters' histories; Wendy Harris was the niece of detective Harvey Harris (who helped train [[Batman]]) and Marvin White was the son of Diana Prince (the woman who helped provide [[Wonder Woman]] with a secret identity upon her arrival in America). While the show never explained the departure of Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog, the story was found in ''Super Friends'' #6\u20139.\n\nThe argument for the comic being part of the Earth-One continuity also included the fact that certain elements of the series impacted other books in the DC line:\n\n1.  TNT's appearance in Kandor in an issue of ''[[Superman Family]]'' that references events exclusively from ''Super Friends'' issue #12\n\n2.  Sinestro's lack of a power ring in an issue of ''[[The Brave and The Bold]]'' after the ring was destroyed in ''Super Friends'' issue #46.\n\n3.  Superman already being familiar with Dr. Mist and the international heroes in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' after meeting them in ''Super Friends'' issues 7 - 9 and 12-13.\n\nBecause the Super Friends stories were referenced in and the events in them remembered by the characters in the core DC superhero titles - for example, in ''Justice League of America'' #155 (June 1978 - Red Tornado remembers using his powers to break the time barrier, which he did in Super Friends issue #8) - they have to be considered part of the Pre-Crisis Earth 1 ensemble of stories.\n\nIn 2008, DC began publishing a new ''[[Imaginext#DC Super Friends|Super Friends]]'' comic book starring Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash ([[Wally West]]) and Green Lantern ([[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]). Based on the eponymous [[Imaginext]] toyline; it is aimed at children, with an art style reminiscent to that of Marvel's ''[[Super Hero Squad]]''.\n\n'''Collected Editions'''\n* ''Super Friends: For Justice!'' (collects #1-7)\n* ''Super Friends: Calling All Super Friends'' (collects #8-14)\n* ''Super Friends: Head of the Class'' (collects #15-21)\n* ''Super Friends: Mystery In Space'' (collects #22-28)\n\n===''Extreme Justice''===\nIn the comics, the Wonder Twins were members of the short-lived ''[[Justice League International|JLI]]'' offshoot, ''[[Extreme Justice]]''.\n\n===''Young Justice''===\n''[[Young Justice]]'' was a comic series that followed the adventures of a group composed of the latest teen superheroes of the late 1990s and early 2000s, including [[Tim Drake|Robin]], [[Superboy]], [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] and [[Wonder Girl]].  Towards the end of the run, Young Justice was involved in a mission which required them to invade an island whose population was made up of super-villains.  In order to conduct a successful attack, the core team assembled all the then-known teen heroes (including the [[Wonder Twins]]).  As in ''Extreme Justice'', neither spoke English and both seemed to enjoy eating CDs.  Unlike their cartoon counterparts, the Wonder Twins were rude and sarcastic.\n\n===''Super Buddies''===\n{{Main|Super Buddies}}\nThe lighthearted nature of the show was spoofed in the 2000s with two DC [[miniseries]], ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'' and ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League!'' (although these series were more direct take-offs on the 1980s [[Blue Beetle]]/[[Booster Gold]]-era [[Justice League]]). In these miniseries the group is known as the \"Super Buddies\", and consists of a team of ex-Justice League members. A television advertisement for the team shows them posing in the postures of the original ''Super Friends'' title card.\n\n===''Teen Titans''===\nAs of issue #34 (2006), Wendy and Marvin were part of the DC continuity. They are now [[fraternal twin]]s (a nod to their ''Super Friends'' successors, the Wonder Twins), engineering geniuses (having graduated from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] at age 16), and are employed at [[Titans Tower]] as maintenance crew and mechanical troubleshooters. They were responsible for restoring Titans member [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] to full functionality after he sustained damage to his artificial body parts during the events of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series.  Wonder Dog was also introduced into the series, although (unlike the cartoon) he was not a lovable sidekick and pet, but a murderous, shape-shifting demon dog who was sent to Titans Tower to kill the team. Wonder Dog killed Marvin and attacked Wendy, leaving her crippled from the waist down.  Wendy is a supporting character in the ''[[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Batgirl]]'' series, where she receives help accepting her disabilities from former Batgirl [[Barbara Gordon]].\n\n===''Justice League of America''===\nDuring the events of the 2005 company-wide ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover the [[Justice League Watchtower]] was destroyed by [[Superboy-Prime]], leaving the JLA without a base of operations. To that end, the team established the Hall of Justice in Washington, D.C. to act as an embassy for the team and an emergency base of operations if needed. In the continuity of the comics, the Hall was designed by [[Green Lantern (John Stewart)|Green Lantern]] and Wonder Woman. In ''Justice League of America'' #46 (2010) [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]] made his first appearance in the [[DC Universe]], where he was shown as one of the heroes driven temporarily insane by [[Alan Scott]].\n\n===''Wizard'' magazine===\nIssue #77 of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine parodied the Super Friends; the JLA was sent through a dimensional rift and met some of the Super Friends. After [[Martian Manhunter]] used his Martian vision to melt the villain and his machine (much to Green Lantern's dismay: \"You have to trick him into leaving, or shutting off his machine, NOT direct physical violence!\"), the Super Friends decided to send the Justice Leaguers back to their own dimension. As a jest, the magazine also ran an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool's]] promotion for a Wonder Twins special by painter [[Alex Ross]]. The book, entitled ''Wonder Twins: Form of Water'', was to be one of Alex Ross' oversized books chronicling the Justice League. The plot would see Zan and Jayna using their powers to help the Earth's famine- and drought-stricken nations after their monkey, Gleek, contracted super-rabies from severe dehydration.\n\n===''Superman and Batman: World's Funnest''===\nIn the [[Elseworlds]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''[[Superman and Batman: World's Funnest]]'', [[Bat-Mite]] and Mr. Mxyzptlk travel to different worlds within the DC Universe. On one of them, they encounter the Super Friends.\n\n==The Super Friends in other DC media==\n\n===''Justice League''===\nAt the end of \"Secret Origins,\" the premiere three-episode arc of ''Justice League'', Superman proposes the formation of a superhero coalition including himself, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash (Wally West), the Green Lantern (John Stewart), the Martian Manhunter, and Hawkgirl. In a direct reference (and perhaps a criticism of the somewhat silly name), the Flash jokingly asks if such a team would be called \"Super Friends\". Superman relabels the guild as the \"Justice League\".\n\n===''Justice League Unlimited''===\nIn the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Gorilla Grodd reforms his [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] this time an even larger group of villains. While not called \"The Legion of Doom\", their [[headquarters]] is a craft similar to the Hall of Doom, located in a swamp. Additionally, the Justice League's Metro Tower headquarters in Metropolis strongly resembled the Hall of Justice.\n\nThe '''Ultimen''', loosely based on characters created for the Super Friends, were briefly allies and later antagonists to the JLU. The Ultimen consisted of '''Long Shadow''' (based on [[Apache Chief]]), '''Juice''' (based on [[Black Vulcan]]), '''Wind Dragon''' (based on [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]]), '''Downpour and Shifter''' (based on the [[Wonder Twins]]). The group appeared in the episode \"Ultimatum\", where it is revealed that they are clones created by [[Project Cadmus]].\n\n===''The Batman''===\nThe animated series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' featured a modified version of the [[JLA Watchtower]] which closely resembled the Hall of Justice.\n\n===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===\nThe Hall of Justice appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Sidekicks Assemble!\", with a pastiche of the music played when the Hall appeared in ''Super Friends''.\n\n===''Smallville''===\nThe Wonder Twins appeared in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode \"Idol\", with Zan played by [[David Gallagher]] and Jayna played by [[Allison Scagliotti]]. Gleek did not appear physically, but a cartoonish image of him was shown on each of the twins' cellphones.\n\n===''Young Justice''===\nThe Hall of Justice was featured in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' as the Justice League's decoy base of operations. Additionally, Wendy and Marvin appear as classmates of [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] and [[Miss Martian|Megan Morse]]. The members of the [[Injustice League]] operate out of a base resembling the Legion's Hall of Doom.\n\nIn the second season, approximations of the minority members created for ''Super Friends'' (similar to the Ultimen example above) are introduced as teenagers given powers by the [[Reach (comics)|Reach]]. The group consists of '''Tye Longshadow''' (Apache Chief), '''Asami \"Sam\" Koizumi''' (Samurai) and '''Eduardo \"Ed\" Dorado Jr.''' (El Dorado). The exception is Black Vulcan, whose place is taken by [[Milestone Media]] hero '''[[Static (DC Comics)|Static]]''' (Black Lightning also appears in the series).\n\n===''DC Nation Shorts''===\nThe title of the ''Super Best Friends Forever'' [[DC Nation Shorts]] is a play on the title ''Super Friends''. Additionally, Black Vulcan's costume can be seen in the background of the first ''[[Black Lightning]]'' short. The ''[[Just'a Lotta Animals|Farm League]]'' carries several homages to the Super Friends including its narrator, characters used and graphics.\n\n=== ''Teen Titans Go!'' ===\nIn the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' ''Two-Parter'' episode, the Titans go to the Hall of Justice to use the pool, as later, they become members of the Justice League to save the Justice League members from Darkseid, this sequence parodies the introduction of the super heroes as in the ''Super Friends'' series.\n\nIn the episode \"You're Fired\", Beast Boy is fired from the Teen Titans, and a competition is held to find his replacement.  The eventual winners are the Wonder Twins.\n\n===''Supergirl''===\nIn the pilot episode of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', Winn Schott considers calling the group of Kara Zor'El and her allies (himself, [[Jimmy Olsen|James Olsen]], and Alex Danvers) \"The Super Friends\". In the fourth season episode, \"What\u2019s So Funny About Truth, Justice, And The American Way?\", Kara forms a small team of heroes that includes herself, [[Brainiac 5]], Dreamer, and the Martian Manhunter and directly calls them \"The Super Friends\". In the fifth season episode, \"Back From the Future - Part One\", the Star L.A.B.S base is now called the Hall of Justice.\n\n===''The Flash''===\nIn the \"[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion]]\" cross-over event, across ''Supergirl'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and DC's ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', the secret STAR Labs base used by the heroes was based on the Hall of Justice. Also later on in that season, Barry and Supergirl sing a duet called \"Super Friends\" in order to escape the Music Meister\u2019s musical.\n\n===''Legends of Tomorrow''===\nIn the episode \"Doomworld\", The new design of S.T.A.R. Labs is a reference to the Hall of Doom, which in the comics is the headquarters for the Legion of Doom. In the final scene of \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Five]]\", Barry repurposed the secret S.T.A.R. Labs base as the headquarters for him and his team. In the final moments of the crossover, the unnamed team is disrupted by the confusing sound of laughter (revealed to be an escaped Gleek, hinting at a possible future inclusion of the character and/or Wonder Twins). Afterwards, the camera pans out to the headquarters as music similar to the original series plays in the background.\n\n===''The Lego Batman Movie''===\nIn ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', the cast of the ''Super Friends'' are seen celebrating an anniversary party in the Fortress of Solitude, which Batman wasn't invited to.\n\n==Video games==\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nThe Hall of Justice is a playable stage in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.\n\n==Toys==\n\n===Super Powers Collection===\n{{Main|Super Powers Collection}}\nThe Super Powers toy line (and associated tie-in merchandise) was based on the final two seasons of ''Super Friends''. Samurai, an original character from the show, and the Hall of Justice were both released. Plans for future waves from Super Powers would have also included Apache Chief, El Dorado, Black Vulcan and the Wonder Twins.\n\n===''Justice League Unlimited''===\n{{Main|DC Universe: Justice League Unlimited Fan Collection}}\nThe toy line based on ''Justice League Unlimited'' released a three pack of figures from characters created for ''Super Friends'', namely Black Vulcan, Apache Chief and Samurai. They were chosen over the Ultimen characters that actually appeared in the JLU animated series: Juice, Long Shadow and Wind Dragon.\n\n===''DC Super Friends''===\nFisher-Price began to produce DC Comics characters in a kid-friendly toyline named after the ''Super Friends''.\n\n===''DC Universe Classics''===\n{{Main|DC Universe Classics}}\nPaying homage to Super Powers, DC Universe Classics produced original ''Super Friends'' characters such as Apache Chief, Black Vulcan, El Dorado, Samurai and the Wonder Twins.\n\n===''Figures Toy Company''===\n\nFigures Toy Company is a company that produces a number of 'nostalgia' figures based on TV shows and comic books.  The figures are vinyl dolls with removable outfits.  They have released a line of figures that includes a near complete Legion of Doom (only Giganta has not been released).  They have announced a Rima the Jungle Girl figure, and were the first company to release figures for Wendy & Marvin.  To date, figures have been released for:  Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Robin, Aquaman, Wendy, Marvin, Zan, Jayna, Gleek, Black Vulcan, Samurai, Apache Chief, El Dorado, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Atom, Firestom, and Cyborg\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0069641|title=Super Friends}}\n* {{tv.com show|super-friends|Super Friends}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080603141807/http://user1291318.sites.myregisteredsite.com/willsultimatesuperfriendsepisodeguide/index.html Will's Ultimate ''Super Friends'' Episode Guide!]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100814154304/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/sf/ ''Super Friends'' @ BatmanYTB.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070622090537/http://www.pazsaz.com/superfr.html ''Super Friends'' at Pazsaz.com]\n* [http://www.legionsofgotham.org/TOONSsf.html ''Super Friends'' at Legions of Gotham]\n\n{{Superfriends series}}\n\n{{Justice League in popular media|state=collapsed}}\n{{Justice League}}\n{{Aquaman}}\n{{Children's programming on the American Broadcasting Company}}\n{{Toonami-anime}}\n\n[[Category:1973 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1986 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1970s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:1970s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:Animated Batman television series]]\n[[Category:Animated Superman television series]]\n[[Category:Wonder Woman in other media]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superhero teams]]\n[[Category:DC Comics titles]]\n[[Category:1976 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Super Friends]]\n[[Category:Toonami]]\n[[Category:Animated Justice League television series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated action television series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated science fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated superhero television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about robots]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

It was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] and was based on the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] and associated [[comic book]] characters published by [[DC Comics]].\n\nThe name of the program (and the Justice League members featured with the Super Friends) has been variously represented (as ''Super Friends'' and ''Challenge of the Super Friends'', for example) at different points in its broadcast history. There were a total of [[List of Super Friends episodes|109 episodes]] and two [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilot|backdoor-pilot]] episodes of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', with [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] appearing in \"The Dynamic Scooby-Doo Affair\" and \"The Caped Crusader Caper\".\n\n==Series titles==\nOver the years, the show existed under several titles:\n* ''[[Super Friends (1973 TV series)|Super Friends]]'' (1973\u20131974)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/sf |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814154304/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/sf/ |archivedate=August 14, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' (1977\u20131978)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/ansfh |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209082751/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/ansfh/ |archivedate=December 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' (1978\u20131979)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/cotsf |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209083212/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/cotsf/ |archivedate=December 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'' (1979\u20131980)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/wgsf |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209083715/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/wgsf/ |archivedate=December 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* ''[[Super Friends (1980 TV series)|Super Friends]]'' (1980\u20131983)\n* ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' (1984\u20131985)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/sftlsps |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date=November 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119185913/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/sftlsps/ |archivedate=January 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' (1985\u20131986)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/tsptgg |title=Batman: Yesterday, Today, And Beyond ~ The Batman Homepage ~ The Largest Batman Site on the Net! |publisher=Batmanytb.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209173900/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/tsptgg/ |archivedate=December 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nPlot lines for the later series involved many of the familiar [[DC Comics]] super-villains that the first incarnation of the ''Super Friends'' did not. Instead, like the comic books, they focused on the far-fetched schemes of mad scientists and aliens, who were invariably revealed as being well-intentioned, and simply pursuing their goals through unlawful or disreputable means.<ref name=\"Vault\">{{cite book |page=10 |title=The DC Vault |first=Martin |last=Pasko |publisher=Running Press |year=2008}}</ref> Typically, at the end of each story, a peaceful and reasonable discussion would be performed by the heroes to convince the antagonists to adopt more reasonable methods.<ref>{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p4.html|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\n''The All-New Super Friends Hour'' departed somewhat from the previous series' formula by featuring villains using more elaborate methods to further their goals; as a rule they could not be reasoned with, requiring the heroes to use direct force to stop them. Beginning with ''Challenge of the Super Friends'', several of the heroes' arch-villains from the comic books (such as [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Riddler|The Riddler]]) began to feature prominently in comic-style stories. Throughout the series, plots often wrapped themselves up neatly in the final minutes of an episode in the fashion of the typical comic books and [[deus ex machina]].<ref name=\"Vault\"/>\n\n==Production history==\nWhen animation company [[Hanna-Barbera]] acquired rights to the DC Comics characters and adapted the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' comic book for [[television]] it made several changes in the transition, including the change of name to ''Super Friends.'' Nevertheless, team members sometimes referred to themselves as the Justice League on the show. The violence common in [[superhero]] [[Comic book|comics]] was toned down for a younger audience and to adhere to broadcast standards governing violence in 1970s [[Saturday morning cartoon|children's television]].\n\nAs a DC Comics-based show, the ''Super Friends'' franchise was owned by DC's parent company [[Warner Bros.]], who later put the series into syndication. [[Cartoon Network]], which had the rights to air most of the rest of the Hanna-Barbera library from its inception in 1992, was not able to air ''Super Friends'' until after the merger of Warner Bros.' parent company, [[Time Warner]] and Cartoon Network's parent company, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] was completed in 1996. This merger also led to Warner Bros. taking control of Hanna-Barbera and all of its other assets as well. The series was owned by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, [[DC Comics|DC Comics Entertainment]], [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], and [[Warner Bros. Animation]].\n\n===1973\u20131974 series===\n{{Main|Super Friends (1973 TV series)}}\n''Super Friends'' first aired on ABC on September 8, 1973,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |last=Rupprecht |first=Michael C. |url=http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#superfriends73-74 |title=Hanna-Barbera Superfriends Chronology |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128000006/http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#superfriends73-74 |archivedate=January 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> featuring well-known DC characters [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Aquaman]]. Superman, Batman and Robin, and Aquaman had each previously appeared in their own animated series produced by [[Filmation]], and voice talent from these prior programs was brought in to work on the new show (with the exception of [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]] who was replaced by [[Norman Alden]] as the voice of Aquaman). Shortly before the ''Super Friends'' series was developed, Superman and Wonder Woman also guest-starred in two episodes of ''[[The Brady Kids]]'' (voiced by Bud Collyer and Jane Webb under [[Filmation]]), while Batman and Robin appeared in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''.\n\nIn addition to the superheroes, a trio of sidekicks was introduced, each of whom were new characters not drawn from the comic books: [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wendy and Marvin]] (voiced by [[Sherry Alberoni|Sherri Alberoni]] and [[Frank Welker]]) and [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wonder Dog]] (also voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), none of whom had any special abilities (save the dog's unexplained ability to reason and talk). The trio\u2014or at least its human members\u2014were depicted as detectives and/or superheroes-in-training; the \"teen detectives and their talking animal\" [[trope (literature)|clich\u00e8]], originally popularized by  ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' , and was typical in Hanna-Barbera cartoons of the mid/late 1970s.\n\nEach episode began with the heroes responding to an emergency detected by the massive TroubAlert computer in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]], which served as the headquarters of the team. Colonel Wilcox, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] official, was a recurring character who would act as a government liaison with the Super Friends during emergencies. Colonel Wilcox was voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]].\nConflicts were usually resolved with the antagonists persuaded to adapt more reasonable methods to achieve their aims (with the assistance of the heroes). Natural disasters triggered by human (or alien) activity were often shown, and environmental themes featured strongly in the program. Three other DC Comics superheroes were featured as guest stars during this season: [[Flash (Barry Allen)|the Flash]], [[Plastic Man]], and [[Green Arrow]].\n\nThis first run of ''Super Friends'', consisting of 16 one-hour episodes which were rerun several times, concluded on August 24, 1974. At this point, the series was cancelled. However, interest in superheroes among ABC's prime-time viewers (with the success of ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and the live-action ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' series) caused the network to revive ''Super Friends''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The original 16 episodes of the series were rebroadcast as a mid-season replacement, running from February 7, 1976, to September 3, 1977.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> These episodes were edited into half-hour versions. At the same time, DC Comics published a ''Super Friends'' comic, which used Wendy and Marvin from issue #1 (November 1976) to #6 (August 1977). In the meantime, Hanna-Barbera began production on a revamped version of the show.\n\n===1977\u20131978 season: ''The All-New Super Friends Hour''===\n{{Main|The All-New Super Friends Hour}}\n''The All-New Super Friends Hour'' featured four animated shorts per program. Wendy, Marvin, and Wonder Dog were dropped from this and all future TV iterations of ''Super Friends'', and were replaced by [[Wonder Twins]] Zan and Jayna, and their pet monkey, [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]]. Unlike Wendy and Marvin, Zan and Jayna had actual super powers. A total of 15 episodes were produced. [[Darrell McNeil]] of the Hanna-Barbera animation studios later explained the change in cast: {{quote|When the decision was made by ABC to renew ''Super Friends'' three years after the first series' 1973 production, ABC and Hanna-Barbara wanted to ramp up (as much as they could) the series' action content. And since we were ramping ''that'' up, that meant making all of our cast a bit more serious, and giving our five leads a bit more backup than three non-powered sidekicks.

The first segment of every show featured two of the heroes (for the purposes of the team-ups in the first and fourth segments, Batman and Robin were considered \"one hero\") teaming up in a separate mini-story. The second segment featured a story with the Wonder Twins. The third segment was considered the \"primary\" adventure of the week, featuring the entire Super Friends roster (including the Wonder Twins) in a longer adventure. The fourth and final segment featured a story with one of the primary lineup and a \"special guest star\". This segment typically featured a problem that was solved using the guest star's unique abilities.\n\nBetween segments there were short spots with members of the Super Friends giving basic safety lessons, providing first-aid advice, demonstrating magic tricks, creating crafts, and presenting a two-part riddle featuring the week's primary plot line. This was the first season to feature two villains appearing in the comic books, [[Black Manta]] and [[Gentleman Ghost]]. Each appeared in only one episode this season and each was somewhat modified for television. Black Manta's costume was not black and he was only referred to as \"Manta\". The Gentleman Ghost was referred to as \"Gentleman Jim Craddock\".\n\n===1978\u20131979 season ''Super Friends'' / ''Challenge of the Super Friends''===\n{{Main|Challenge of the Super Friends}}\nThe next season of ''Super Friends'' featured two segments:\n\n====First segment: ''Super Friends'' episodes====\nThe first segment of the program featured the established group of heroes: Superman, Batman and Robin, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and the Wonder Twins and Gleek.  They were rerun with intro from the ''All-New Super Friends'' Hour when in syndication in the early 1980s, but they are seldom seen in syndication since then.\n\n====Second segment: ''Challenge of the Super Friends''====\nThe second half-hour of the show introduced the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]], a team of 13 recurring foes who are the Super Friends' worst enemies. They used a swamp-based mechanical flying headquarters, the Hall of Doom (resembling the helmet of [[Darth Vader]]), as a contrast to the Super Friends' gleaming Hall of Justice. A total of 16 episodes were produced.\n\nAdditional heroes who had previously appeared as guest stars were added to the roster as well, to make a total of 11. These included [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], and [[Hawkman]] from DC Comics and three Hanna-Barbera creations: [[Black Vulcan]], [[Apache Chief]], and [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]]. Despite the Riddler showing a set of playing cards with (from left to right) Gleek, Zan, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Robin, Batman, and Superman (which he then burns to ashes in his introduction in \"Wanted: The Super Friends\"), the Wonder Twins and Gleek did not appear in ''Challenge''. Enthusiasts have expressed the view that the storylines for the ''Challenge'' episodes were the ''Super Friends'' era's best portrayal of the DC heroes.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n''The'' ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' segment was expanded to 90 minutes mid-season, with reruns of earlier episodes filling out the last half-hour.<ref name=\"Back38\"/>\n\n===1979\u20131980 season: ''The World's Greatest Super Friends''===\n{{Main|The World's Greatest Super Friends}}\n\nIn the fall of 1979, the ''Super Friends'' returned to their prior format, bringing back the original set of five DC superheroes and Zan, Jayna, and Gleek. Eight half-hour episodes were created for this run, with the majority of the season consisting of repeats of ''The All-New Super Friends Hour'' from 1977 to 1978 and The Super Friends segments from ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' from 1978 to 1979. Renamed ''The World's Greatest Super Friends'', this series began on September 22, 1979, and ran until September 27, 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#worldsgreatest |title=Hanna-Barbera Superfriends Chronology |publisher=Members.aol.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1980\u20131982 seasons: ''Super Friends''===\n{{Main|Super Friends (1980 TV series)}}\nRenamed ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' in 1980, the series changed formats again, abandoning the production of half-hour episodes and producing seven-minute shorts. Each episode of ''Super Friends'' would feature a rerun from one of the previous six years and three new shorts. These new adventures featured appearances by the core group of five Super Friends and  Zan, Jayna, & Gleek. There were also guest appearances from members previously depicted in ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' and the Hanna-Barbera-created hero [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|El Dorado]], who was added to the show in 1981 to provide cultural diversity.\n\nThis would prove to be one of the longer-lived incarnations of the series (three years). A total of 22 episodes were produced.\n\n===1982\u20131983 season: ''The Best of the Super Friends'' (reruns)===\nFor the 1982\u20131983 television season ABC ran half-hour reruns of shows from the previous seven seasons, with none of the seven-minute shorts rebroadcast. ABC called the rerun package ''The Best of the Super Friends''.\n\n===1983\u20131984 season: Cancellation and the \"lost episodes\"===\nHanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. had created a [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] package of the earlier ''Super Friends'' series (co-distributed by [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company|LBS Communications]]); these were picked up by stations across the United States and typically broadcast on weekday afternoons. Not wishing to compete with the syndication programming, ABC dropped the series from the 1983\u20131984 Saturday morning television line-up. For the second time, ''Super Friends'' was cancelled.\n\nHowever, during this time Hanna-Barbera continued to produce new episodes with the Super Friends, with ABC's approval and funding.<ref name=\"Back38\"/> In total, 24 \"lost episodes\" were produced, but not aired in the United States that season; the series appeared in Australia. Three of these episodes were aired when ''Super Friends'' returned to Saturday-morning ABC television the following year. The remainder aired on the USA network in 1995, as part of the ''[[The Superman/Batman Adventures|Superman/Batman Adventures]]'' show. The 1983 Lost Episodes of ''Super Friends'' were released on DVD by [[Warner Home Entertainment]] (via [[DC Comics|DC Comics Entertainment]], [[Hanna-Barbera Cartoons]], and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]]) in April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#lost83-84 |title=Hanna-Barbera Superfriends Chronology |publisher=Members.aol.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1984\u20131985 season: ''Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show''===\n{{Main|Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show|Super Powers Collection}}\n\n''Super Friends'' returned to ABC Saturday, September 8, 1984, with a new 30-minute program typically featuring two 11-minute stories per episode. This incarnation featured Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, and the Wonder Twins and Gleek, this time teamed up with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]. In addition to this core group, episodes during this season also featured cameos by old (and new) Super Friends. The series ended August 31, 1985, and featured comic-book villains such as [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], [[Lex Luthor]], [[Mirror Master]], [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mr. Mxyzptlk]], [[Darkseid]], and his henchmen from [[Apokolips]]. This season and the next featured the \"Super Powers\" tagline, which was part of a marketing tie-in with a [[Super Powers Collection|toy line of the same name]] produced by [[Kenner]].<ref name=\"Back38\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://toyotter.com/sp/ |title=Super Powers Archive |publisher=Toy Otter |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010052808/http://www.toyotter.com/sp/ |date=September 9, 2004 |archivedate=October 10, 2004}}</ref>\n\n===1985 - 1986 season: ''The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians''===\n{{Main|The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians}}\n\nIn fall 1985, the next version of Hanna-Barbera's depiction of the DC Comics heroes began, although it no longer carried the ''Super Friends'' name. This series returned to a conventional lineup for the team, with a focus on teen members [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and Firestorm. Once again headquartered at the Hall of Justice in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the heroes battled such familiar foes as [[Lex Luthor]], [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and recurring villain [[Darkseid]]. It also contained the only appearances by [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]], [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]], the [[Royal Flush Gang]], and [[Felix Faust]].\n\nMost notably, it is in this series that Batman's origin is depicted for the first time outside of comics and the first cartoon series to touch upon the serious topic of the death of Bruce Wayne's parents in a flashback which is triggered after Batman and Robin chase The Scarecrow into Crime Alley where Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered. Additionally, in the same episode, Professor Jonathan Crane appears as the Scarecrow's secret identity, which was unknown to the authorities, allowing Scarecrow to use it to secretly sabotage the Super Friends' investigations until Batman managed to deduce his identity, leading to his arrest.\n\n''The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians'' lasted one season before being canceled. The final new episode aired was \"Escape From Space City\" on October 26, 1985. This third cancellation would be the final one, and ''Galactic Guardians'' marked the end of Hanna-Barbera's 13-year run of the series on October 26, 1985.\n\n==Characters==\n{{cleanup list|section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Main|List of Super Friends members|List of Super Friends villains}}\n\n===The Justice League of America===\nThe core group of five heroes made up the \"Super Friends\":\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* [[Aquaman]]\n* [[Batman]]\n* [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]\n* [[Superman]]\n* [[Wonder Woman]]\n|}\n\nAdditional Justice League members included:\n* [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|The Atom]] (1977; 1980\u20131983)\n* [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] (1984\u20131985)\n* [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]] (1973; 1977\u20131985)\n* [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] (1977\u20131985)\n* [[Hawkgirl]] (1977; 1980; 1983)\n* [[Hawkman]] (1977\u20131978; 1980\u20131985)\n\nDC Comics characters who were not Justice League members in comics (at the time), only on the series:\n* [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] (1985)\n* [[Rima|Rima the Jungle Girl]] (1977; 1980)\n\nJustice League members created for the series:\n* [[Apache Chief]] (1977\u20131978; 1980\u20131984)\n* [[Black Vulcan]] (1977\u20131978; 1980\u20131984)\n* [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|El Dorado]] (1982\u20131985)\n* [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]] (1977\u20131978; 1980\u20131985)\n\nOne-shot Justice League appearances were made by:\n* [[Abin Sur]] (1978)\n* [[Green Arrow]] (1973\u20131974)\n* [[Plastic Man]] (1973\u20131974)\n* [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] (1978; 1983)\n\nThe teen sidekicks and their pets:\n* Pets:\n** [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] (1977\u20131984)\n** [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wonder Dog]] (1973\u20131975)\n* Wendy and Marvin:\n** [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wendy Harris]] (1973\u20131975)\n** [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Marvin White]] (1973\u20131975)\n* Wonder Twins:\n** [[Wonder Twins|Jayna]] (1977\u20131984)\n** [[Wonder Twins|Zan]] (1977\u20131984)\n\nOther DC comic characters that appeared in the series:\n* [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]]\n* [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]]\n* [[Lois Lane]]\n* [[Jimmy Olsen]]\n* [[Alfred Pennyworth]]\n* [[Solovar]] (ruler of [[Gorilla City]])\n* [[Steve Trevor]]\n\n===Legion of Doom===\nThirteen villains composed the [[Legion of Doom]] during the ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' season.

The opening credits of ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' names the Super Friends as the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. In addition to the appearance of a JLA emblem on a communicator and a reference to a mission to repair the Justice League satellite, the Super Friends are often linked with the JLA. The Justice League satellite under repair is clearly the same design as the [[Justice League Satellite]] that appeared in the comics at the time, but was shown to be substantially smaller than its comic book counterpart.\n\n==Notable voice actors==\nThe voice of the Narrator was provided by actor [[Ted Knight]] during the early hour-long episodes.  [[Bill Woodson]] took over with the revival of the series in 1977.  His signature line was \"Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice...\". The voices of Marvin and Wonder Dog as well as Mr. Mxyzptlk, Toyman, The Dollmaker, Darkseid, Kalibak, and The Joker were performed by [[Frank Welker]]. [[Adam West]] provided the voice of Batman in ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]''. [[Casey Kasem]] provided the voice of Robin (and many others in the show). [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] lends his voice as Desaad.\n\n==Reception==\nIn January 2009, [[IGN]] listed ''Super Friends'' as the 50th best animated television series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/50.html |title=IGN - 50.

The first special, subtitled \"The Challenge\", was loosely based on the Super Friends and the 1960s ''Batman'' series (played for laughs, but this time, including a laugh track) and included several other DC characters who replaced Samurai, Black Vulcan, and Apache Chief: [[Black Canary]], the E-2 [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] Helena Wayne (a new DC character, gathering her own following in ''All-Star'' and ''Adventure Comics'' JSA runs as a JSA member), and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] (who had previously had his own live action series through Filmation studios). The second special, entitled \"The Roast\", featured [[Ed McMahon]] as emcee of the roast, along the lines of ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' specials. Due to Warner Bros.' contracts on Wonder Woman (already being used in her own live action series; [[Lynda Carter]]) and Superman (in his own live-action theatrical movie at the time; [[Christopher Reeve]]), they were unable to be featured on the specials.\n\n===''The Plastic Man Comedy Adventure Show''===\n{{Main|The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show}}\nPlastic Man first appeared in the first season of ''Super Friends'', in one episode. Later, [[Ruby-Spears|Ruby-Spears Productions]] released a series starring the character in his own solo adventures.\n\n===''Batman''===\nA Batman animated series was also considered in the mid-1980s, presumably with [[Adam West]] reprising his role as the voice of Batman.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} \"The Fear\" was written as a pilot episode for the series, but it was instead adapted in to an episode of ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]''.\n\n===''The New Teen Titans''===\nIn 1983, a cartoon based upon ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' comics began development. It was created as a companion for the ''Super Friends'', to be set in the same continuity. Robin was not going to be featured in the cartoon though, at least not as a regular, since in the ''Super Friends'' universe, he was a member of the Justice League. Like ''Super Friends'', the show was to be developed by Hanna-Barbera for ABC, but since shows like ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (airing on [[NBC]]) were so popular at the time, this show was never picked up by the network. The show would have featured [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]] as the leader, along with [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Beast Boy|Changeling]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]]. Although the show failed to get picked up, a television commercial with a [[substance abuse]] theme did feature the Titans, as they would have appeared in the animated series, along with a new superhero named \"The Protector\" who would have been the replacement character for Robin. A Teen Titans animated TV program was eventually [[Teen Titans (TV series)|produced]], adding Robin and removing Wonder Girl, Kid Flash and The Protector.\n\n===''DC Super Friends''===\n{{Main|Imaginext#DC Super Friends}}\n[[Fisher-Price]] developed a toy line named DC Super Friends featuring DC Comics characters as toys for young children. A comic book series and direct-to-video original animation called ''The Joker's Playhouse'' (2010) was developed to tie-in. The video features the World's Greatest Super Friends theme, allusions to the Legion of Doom, and the Super Friends and their Hall of Justice.

Nelson Bridwell]] and artist [[Alex Toth]].<ref>{{cite journal|last= Franklin|first= Chris|title= The Kids in the Hall (of Justice) A Whirlwind Tour with the Super Friends|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 61|pages= 24\u201328|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date = December 2012|quote=  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/68956/ ''Limited Collectors' Edition'' #C-41] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> DC published a [[comic book]] version of the ''Super Friends'' from November 1976 to August 1981.

Scribe E. Nelson Bridwell and artist Ric Estrada crafted the inaugural issue.}}</ref> Zan and Jayna were given back stories and secret identities as a pair of blond-haired high school kids; they were more competent heroes than their cartoon counterparts.\n\nWhile the television cartoons were not part of the same fictional universe as the DC comic books, writer E. Nelson Bridwell made the comic book accord with the other DC titles via [[footnote]]s. An example of trying to fit ''Super Friends'' into the DC Universe:\n* Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog were the only ones active at the Hall of Justice, because the Justice League are in the 30th Century with the [[Justice Society]] (as shown in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #147\u2013148). Robin was busy helping the Titans in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #50-52. Bridwell also gave them last names and ties to the other characters' histories; Wendy Harris was the niece of detective Harvey Harris (who helped train [[Batman]]) and Marvin White was the son of Diana Prince (the woman who helped provide [[Wonder Woman]] with a secret identity upon her arrival in America). While the show never explained the departure of Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog, the story was found in ''Super Friends'' #6\u20139.\n\nThe argument for the comic being part of the Earth-One continuity also included the fact that certain elements of the series impacted other books in the DC line:\n\n1.  TNT's appearance in Kandor in an issue of ''[[Superman Family]]'' that references events exclusively from ''Super Friends'' issue #12\n\n2.  Sinestro's lack of a power ring in an issue of ''[[The Brave and The Bold]]'' after the ring was destroyed in ''Super Friends'' issue #46.\n\n3.  Superman already being familiar with Dr. Mist and the international heroes in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' after meeting them in ''Super Friends'' issues 7 - 9 and 12-13.\n\nBecause the Super Friends stories were referenced in and the events in them remembered by the characters in the core DC superhero titles - for example, in ''Justice League of America'' #155 (June 1978 - Red Tornado remembers using his powers to break the time barrier, which he did in Super Friends issue #8) - they have to be considered part of the Pre-Crisis Earth 1 ensemble of stories.\n\nIn 2008, DC began publishing a new ''[[Imaginext#DC Super Friends|Super Friends]]'' comic book starring Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash ([[Wally West]]) and Green Lantern ([[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]). Based on the eponymous [[Imaginext]] toyline; it is aimed at children, with an art style reminiscent to that of Marvel's ''[[Super Hero Squad]]''.\n\n'''Collected Editions'''\n* ''Super Friends: For Justice!'' (collects #1-7)\n* ''Super Friends: Calling All Super Friends'' (collects #8-14)\n* ''Super Friends: Head of the Class'' (collects #15-21)\n* ''Super Friends: Mystery In Space'' (collects #22-28)\n\n===''Extreme Justice''===\nIn the comics, the Wonder Twins were members of the short-lived ''[[Justice League International|JLI]]'' offshoot, ''[[Extreme Justice]]''.\n\n===''Young Justice''===\n''[[Young Justice]]'' was a comic series that followed the adventures of a group composed of the latest teen superheroes of the late 1990s and early 2000s, including [[Tim Drake|Robin]], [[Superboy]], [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] and [[Wonder Girl]].  Towards the end of the run, Young Justice was involved in a mission which required them to invade an island whose population was made up of super-villains.  In order to conduct a successful attack, the core team assembled all the then-known teen heroes (including the [[Wonder Twins]]).  As in ''Extreme Justice'', neither spoke English and both seemed to enjoy eating CDs.  Unlike their cartoon counterparts, the Wonder Twins were rude and sarcastic.\n\n===''Super Buddies''===\n{{Main|Super Buddies}}\nThe lighthearted nature of the show was spoofed in the 2000s with two DC [[miniseries]], ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'' and ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League!'' (although these series were more direct take-offs on the 1980s [[Blue Beetle]]/[[Booster Gold]]-era [[Justice League]]). In these miniseries the group is known as the \"Super Buddies\", and consists of a team of ex-Justice League members. A television advertisement for the team shows them posing in the postures of the original ''Super Friends'' title card.\n\n===''Teen Titans''===\nAs of issue #34 (2006), Wendy and Marvin were part of the DC continuity. They are now [[fraternal twin]]s (a nod to their ''Super Friends'' successors, the Wonder Twins), engineering geniuses (having graduated from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] at age 16), and are employed at [[Titans Tower]] as maintenance crew and mechanical troubleshooters. They were responsible for restoring Titans member [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] to full functionality after he sustained damage to his artificial body parts during the events of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series.  Wonder Dog was also introduced into the series, although (unlike the cartoon) he was not a lovable sidekick and pet, but a murderous, shape-shifting demon dog who was sent to Titans Tower to kill the team. Wonder Dog killed Marvin and attacked Wendy, leaving her crippled from the waist down.  Wendy is a supporting character in the ''[[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Batgirl]]'' series, where she receives help accepting her disabilities from former Batgirl [[Barbara Gordon]].\n\n===''Justice League of America''===\nDuring the events of the 2005 company-wide ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover the [[Justice League Watchtower]] was destroyed by [[Superboy-Prime]], leaving the JLA without a base of operations. To that end, the team established the Hall of Justice in Washington, D.C. to act as an embassy for the team and an emergency base of operations if needed. In the continuity of the comics, the Hall was designed by [[Green Lantern (John Stewart)|Green Lantern]] and Wonder Woman. In ''Justice League of America'' #46 (2010) [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]] made his first appearance in the [[DC Universe]], where he was shown as one of the heroes driven temporarily insane by [[Alan Scott]].\n\n===''Wizard'' magazine===\nIssue #77 of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine parodied the Super Friends; the JLA was sent through a dimensional rift and met some of the Super Friends. After [[Martian Manhunter]] used his Martian vision to melt the villain and his machine (much to Green Lantern's dismay: \"You have to trick him into leaving, or shutting off his machine, NOT direct physical violence!\"), the Super Friends decided to send the Justice Leaguers back to their own dimension. As a jest, the magazine also ran an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool's]] promotion for a Wonder Twins special by painter [[Alex Ross]]. The book, entitled ''Wonder Twins: Form of Water'', was to be one of Alex Ross' oversized books chronicling the Justice League. The plot would see Zan and Jayna using their powers to help the Earth's famine- and drought-stricken nations after their monkey, Gleek, contracted super-rabies from severe dehydration.\n\n===''Superman and Batman: World's Funnest''===\nIn the [[Elseworlds]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''[[Superman and Batman: World's Funnest]]'', [[Bat-Mite]] and Mr. Mxyzptlk travel to different worlds within the DC Universe. On one of them, they encounter the Super Friends.\n\n==The Super Friends in other DC media==\n\n===''Justice League''===\nAt the end of \"Secret Origins,\" the premiere three-episode arc of ''Justice League'', Superman proposes the formation of a superhero coalition including himself, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash (Wally West), the Green Lantern (John Stewart), the Martian Manhunter, and Hawkgirl. In a direct reference (and perhaps a criticism of the somewhat silly name), the Flash jokingly asks if such a team would be called \"Super Friends\". Superman relabels the guild as the \"Justice League\".\n\n===''Justice League Unlimited''===\nIn the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Gorilla Grodd reforms his [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] this time an even larger group of villains. While not called \"The Legion of Doom\", their [[headquarters]] is a craft similar to the Hall of Doom, located in a swamp. Additionally, the Justice League's Metro Tower headquarters in Metropolis strongly resembled the Hall of Justice.\n\nThe '''Ultimen''', loosely based on characters created for the Super Friends, were briefly allies and later antagonists to the JLU. The Ultimen consisted of '''Long Shadow''' (based on [[Apache Chief]]), '''Juice''' (based on [[Black Vulcan]]), '''Wind Dragon''' (based on [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]]), '''Downpour and Shifter''' (based on the [[Wonder Twins]]). The group appeared in the episode \"Ultimatum\", where it is revealed that they are clones created by [[Project Cadmus]].\n\n===''The Batman''===\nThe animated series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' featured a modified version of the [[JLA Watchtower]] which closely resembled the Hall of Justice.\n\n===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===\nThe Hall of Justice appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Sidekicks Assemble!\", with a pastiche of the music played when the Hall appeared in ''Super Friends''.\n\n===''Smallville''===\nThe Wonder Twins appeared in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode \"Idol\", with Zan played by [[David Gallagher]] and Jayna played by [[Allison Scagliotti]]. Gleek did not appear physically, but a cartoonish image of him was shown on each of the twins' cellphones.\n\n===''Young Justice''===\nThe Hall of Justice was featured in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' as the Justice League's decoy base of operations. Additionally, Wendy and Marvin appear as classmates of [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] and [[Miss Martian|Megan Morse]]. The members of the [[Injustice League]] operate out of a base resembling the Legion's Hall of Doom.\n\nIn the second season, approximations of the minority members created for ''Super Friends'' (similar to the Ultimen example above) are introduced as teenagers given powers by the [[Reach (comics)|Reach]]. The group consists of '''Tye Longshadow''' (Apache Chief), '''Asami \"Sam\" Koizumi''' (Samurai) and '''Eduardo \"Ed\" Dorado Jr.''' (El Dorado). The exception is Black Vulcan, whose place is taken by [[Milestone Media]] hero '''[[Static (DC Comics)|Static]]''' (Black Lightning also appears in the series).\n\n===''DC Nation Shorts''===\nThe title of the ''Super Best Friends Forever'' [[DC Nation Shorts]] is a play on the title ''Super Friends''. Additionally, Black Vulcan's costume can be seen in the background of the first ''[[Black Lightning]]'' short. The ''[[Just'a Lotta Animals|Farm League]]'' carries several homages to the Super Friends including its narrator, characters used and graphics.\n\n=== ''Teen Titans Go!'' ===\nIn the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' ''Two-Parter'' episode, the Titans go to the Hall of Justice to use the pool, as later, they become members of the Justice League to save the Justice League members from Darkseid, this sequence parodies the introduction of the super heroes as in the ''Super Friends'' series.\n\nIn the episode \"You're Fired\", Beast Boy is fired from the Teen Titans, and a competition is held to find his replacement.  The eventual winners are the Wonder Twins.\n\n===''Supergirl''===\nIn the pilot episode of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', Winn Schott considers calling the group of Kara Zor'El and her allies (himself, [[Jimmy Olsen|James Olsen]], and Alex Danvers) \"The Super Friends\". In the fourth season episode, \"What\u2019s So Funny About Truth, Justice, And The American Way?\", Kara forms a small team of heroes that includes herself, [[Brainiac 5]], Dreamer, and the Martian Manhunter and directly calls them \"The Super Friends\". In the fifth season episode, \"Back From the Future - Part One\", the Star L.A.B.S base is now called the Hall of Justice.\n\n===''The Flash''===\nIn the \"[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion]]\" cross-over event, across ''Supergirl'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and DC's ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', the secret STAR Labs base used by the heroes was based on the Hall of Justice. Also later on in that season, Barry and Supergirl sing a duet called \"Super Friends\" in order to escape the Music Meister\u2019s musical.\n\n===''Legends of Tomorrow''===\nIn the episode \"Doomworld\", The new design of S.T.A.R. Labs is a reference to the Hall of Doom, which in the comics is the headquarters for the Legion of Doom. In the final scene of \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Five]]\", Barry repurposed the secret S.T.A.R. Labs base as the headquarters for him and his team. In the final moments of the crossover, the unnamed team is disrupted by the confusing sound of laughter (revealed to be an escaped Gleek, hinting at a possible future inclusion of the character and/or Wonder Twins). Afterwards, the camera pans out to the headquarters as music similar to the original series plays in the background.\n\n===''The Lego Batman Movie''===\nIn ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', the cast of the ''Super Friends'' are seen celebrating an anniversary party in the Fortress of Solitude, which Batman wasn't invited to.\n\n==Video games==\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nThe Hall of Justice is a playable stage in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.\n\n==Toys==\n\n===Super Powers Collection===\n{{Main|Super Powers Collection}}\nThe Super Powers toy line (and associated tie-in merchandise) was based on the final two seasons of ''Super Friends''. Samurai, an original character from the show, and the Hall of Justice were both released. Plans for future waves from Super Powers would have also included Apache Chief, El Dorado, Black Vulcan and the Wonder Twins.\n\n===''Justice League Unlimited''===\n{{Main|DC Universe: Justice League Unlimited Fan Collection}}\nThe toy line based on ''Justice League Unlimited'' released a three pack of figures from characters created for ''Super Friends'', namely Black Vulcan, Apache Chief and Samurai. They were chosen over the Ultimen characters that actually appeared in the JLU animated series: Juice, Long Shadow and Wind Dragon.\n\n===''DC Super Friends''===\nFisher-Price began to produce DC Comics characters in a kid-friendly toyline named after the ''Super Friends''.\n\n===''DC Universe Classics''===\n{{Main|DC Universe Classics}}\nPaying homage to Super Powers, DC Universe Classics produced original ''Super Friends'' characters such as Apache Chief, Black Vulcan, El Dorado, Samurai and the Wonder Twins.\n\n===''Figures Toy Company''===\n\nFigures Toy Company is a company that produces a number of 'nostalgia' figures based on TV shows and comic books.  The figures are vinyl dolls with removable outfits.  They have released a line of figures that includes a near complete Legion of Doom (only Giganta has not been released).  They have announced a Rima the Jungle Girl figure, and were the first company to release figures for Wendy & Marvin.  To date, figures have been released for:  Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Robin, Aquaman, Wendy, Marvin, Zan, Jayna, Gleek, Black Vulcan, Samurai, Apache Chief, El Dorado, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Atom, Firestom, and Cyborg\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0069641|title=Super Friends}}\n* {{tv.com show|super-friends|Super Friends}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080603141807/http://user1291318.sites.myregisteredsite.com/willsultimatesuperfriendsepisodeguide/index.html Will's Ultimate ''Super Friends'' Episode Guide!]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100814154304/http://www.batmanytb.com/animated/sf/ ''Super Friends'' @ BatmanYTB.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070622090537/http://www.pazsaz.com/superfr.html ''Super Friends'' at Pazsaz.com]\n* [http://www.legionsofgotham.org/TOONSsf.html ''Super Friends'' at Legions of Gotham]\n\n{{Superfriends series}}\n\n{{Justice League in popular media|state=collapsed}}\n{{Justice League}}\n{{Aquaman}}\n{{Children's programming on the American Broadcasting Company}}\n{{Toonami-anime}}\n\n[[Category:1973 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1986 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1970s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:1970s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:Animated Batman television series]]\n[[Category:Animated Superman television series]]\n[[Category:Wonder Woman in other media]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superhero teams]]\n[[Category:DC Comics titles]]\n[[Category:1976 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Super Friends]]\n[[Category:Toonami]]\n[[Category:Animated Justice League television series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated action television series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated science fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated superhero television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about robots]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

Its proper name is generally considered to originate from the mythological [[Canopus (mythology)|Canopus]], who was a navigator for [[Menelaus]], king of [[Sparta]]. Canopus has the [[Bayer designation]] '''\u03b1&nbsp;Carinae''', which is [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to '''Alpha&nbsp;Carinae''' and abbreviated '''Alpha Car''' or '''\u03b1&nbsp;Car'''. It is the [[list of brightest stars|second-brightest star]] in the [[night sky]], after [[Sirius]]. Canopus' [[visual apparent magnitude]] is \u22120.74, and it has an [[absolute magnitude]] of \u22125.71.\n\nCanopus is an aging [[bright giant]] of [[spectral type A9]] or [[spectral type F0|F0]], so it is essentially white when seen with the naked eye. Canopus is undergoing [[stellar core|core]] [[helium fusion|helium burning]] and is currently in the so-called [[blue loop]] phase of its [[stellar evolution|evolution]], having already passed through the [[red-giant branch]] after exhausting the hydrogen in its core. Canopus has eight times the [[mass of the Sun]] and has expanded to 71 times the [[Sun's radius]]. It is radiating over 10,000 times the [[luminosity of the Sun]] from its enlarged [[photosphere]] at an [[effective temperature]] of around 7,000&nbsp;K. Canopus is an [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray source]], which is likely being emitted from its [[stellar corona|corona]].\n\nThe prominent appearance of Canopus means it has been the subject of mythological lore among many ancient peoples. The [[acronychal rising]] marked the date of the Ptolemaia festival in Egypt. In Hinduism, it was named [[Agastya]] after the revered [[Vedas|Vedic]] sage. For Chinese astronomers, it was known as the [[Old Man of the South Pole]].\n\n==Observation==\nIn the [[Southern Hemisphere]], Canopus and [[Sirius]] are both visible high in the sky simultaneously, and reach a meridian just 21&nbsp;minutes apart. Brighter than [[first-magnitude star|first magnitude]], Canopus can be seen by naked eye in the early twilight. Most visible in summer in the Southern Hemisphere, Canopus culminates at midnight on December 27,<ref name=\"motz\" /> and at 9 PM on February 11.<ref name=\"Schaaf257\">Schaaf, p. 257.</ref>\n\nIt is a [[circumpolar star]] when seen from points with latitude south of 37\u00b018'&nbsp;S; for example, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]], Australia; [[Auckland]] and south of it, New Zealand; [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]], Argentina; and [[Valdivia]], Chile, and south of these cities in South America. Since Canopus is so far south in the sky, it never rises in mid- to far-northern latitudes; in theory the northern limit of visibility is latitude 37\u00b018' north. This is just south of [[Athens]], [[Richmond, Virginia]] (USA), and [[San Francisco]], and very close to [[Seville]] and [[Agrigento]]. It is almost exactly the latitude of [[Lick Observatory]] on [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mt. Hamilton, California]], from which it is readily visible because of the effects of elevation and [[atmospheric refraction]], which add another degree to its apparent altitude. Under ideal conditions, it can be spotted as far north as latitude 37\u00b031' from the Pacific coast.<ref>D.

Canopus' spectral type has been given as F0 and more recently A9. It is less yellow than [[Altair]] or [[Procyon]], with indices measured as 0.22 and 0.42, respectively. It may be that some observers have perceived Canopus as yellow-tinged because it is low in the sky and hence subject to atmospheric effects.<ref name=\"Schaaf112\">Schaaf, pp. 112\u201313.</ref> [[Patrick Moore]] said that it never appeared anything but white to him.<ref name=\"moore2000\">{{cite book | first1=Patrick | last1=Moore | title=Exploring the night sky with binoculars | edition=4th | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2000 | isbn=9780521793902 | page=[https://archive.org/details/exploringnightsk00moor/page/69 69] | url=https://archive.org/details/exploringnightsk00moor| url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==Physical characteristics==\nBefore the launch of the [[Hipparcos]] satellite telescope, distance estimates for Canopus varied widely, from 96 [[light-year]]s to 1200 light-years.

Its proper name is generally considered to originate from the mythological [[Canopus (mythology)|Canopus]], who was a navigator for [[Menelaus]], king of [[Sparta]]. Canopus has the [[Bayer designation]] '''\u03b1&nbsp;Carinae''', which is [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to '''Alpha&nbsp;Carinae''' and abbreviated '''Alpha Car''' or '''\u03b1&nbsp;Car'''. It is the [[list of brightest stars|second-brightest star]] in the [[night sky]], after [[Sirius]]. Canopus' [[visual apparent magnitude]] is \u22120.74, and it has an [[absolute magnitude]] of \u22125.71.\n\nCanopus is an aging [[bright giant]] of [[spectral type A9]] or [[spectral type F0|F0]], so it is essentially white when seen with the naked eye. Canopus is undergoing [[stellar core|core]] [[helium fusion|helium burning]] and is currently in the so-called [[blue loop]] phase of its [[stellar evolution|evolution]], having already passed through the [[red-giant branch]] after exhausting the hydrogen in its core. Canopus has eight times the [[mass of the Sun]] and has expanded to 71 times the [[Sun's radius]]. It is radiating over 10,000 times the [[luminosity of the Sun]] from its enlarged [[photosphere]] at an [[effective temperature]] of around 7,000&nbsp;K. Canopus is an [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray source]], which is likely being emitted from its [[corona]].\n\nThe prominent appearance of Canopus means it has been the subject of mythological lore among many ancient peoples. The [[acronychal rising]] marked the date of the Ptolemaia festival in Egypt. In Hinduism, it was named [[Agastya]] after the revered [[Vedas|Vedic]] sage. For Chinese astronomers, it was known as the [[Old Man of the South Pole]].\n\n==Observation==\nIn the [[Southern Hemisphere]], Canopus and [[Sirius]] are both visible high in the sky simultaneously, and reach a meridian just 21&nbsp;minutes apart. Brighter than [[first-magnitude star|first magnitude]], Canopus can be seen by naked eye in the early twilight. Most visible in summer in the Southern Hemisphere, Canopus culminates at midnight on December 27,<ref name=\"motz\" /> and at 9 PM on February 11.<ref name=\"Schaaf257\">Schaaf, p. 257.</ref>\n\nIt is a [[circumpolar star]] when seen from points with latitude south of 37\u00b018'&nbsp;S; for example, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]], Australia; [[Auckland]] and south of it, New Zealand; [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]], Argentina; and [[Valdivia]], Chile, and south of these cities in South America. Since Canopus is so far south in the sky, it never rises in mid- to far-northern latitudes; in theory the northern limit of visibility is latitude 37\u00b018' north. This is just south of [[Athens]], [[Richmond, Virginia]] (USA), and [[San Francisco]], and very close to [[Seville]] and [[Agrigento]]. It is almost exactly the latitude of [[Lick Observatory]] on [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mt. Hamilton, California]], from which it is readily visible because of the effects of elevation and [[atmospheric refraction]], which add another degree to its apparent altitude. Under ideal conditions, it can be spotted as far north as latitude 37\u00b031' from the Pacific coast.<ref>D.
