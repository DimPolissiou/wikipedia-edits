Previously the 20th [[vice president of the United States|vice president]], he succeeded to the presidency upon the [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|death of President James A. Garfield]] in September 1881, two months after Garfield was shot by an assassin.\n\nArthur was born in [[Canada]], grew up in [[upstate New York]], and practiced law in [[New York City]]. He served as quartermaster general of the [[New York Army National Guard|New York Militia]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Following the war, he devoted more time to Republican politics and quickly rose in [[New York (state)|New York]] Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]]'s political organization. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] appointed him to the post of [[Collector of the Port of New York]] in 1871, and he was an important supporter of Conkling and the [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] faction of the Republican Party. In 1878, President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] fired Arthur as part of a plan to reform the federal patronage system in New York. Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]], and Arthur was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket as an Eastern Stalwart. Four months into his term, Garfield was shot by an assassin; he died 11 weeks later, and Arthur assumed the presidency.\n\nAt the outset, Arthur struggled to overcome a negative reputation as a Stalwart and product of Conkling's organization. To the surprise of reformers, he advocated and enforced the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]]. He presided over the [[History of the United States Navy#\"New Navy\"|rebirth]] of the US Navy, but he was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus which had been accumulating since the end of the Civil War. Arthur reluctantly signed the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], which barred the entry of Chinese laborers. The 1875 [[Page Act]] barred Chinese women from entering the country and was the first total ban on a nation or ethnic group from immigrating to the country.\n\nSuffering from poor health, Arthur made only a limited effort to secure the Republican Party's nomination in 1884, and he retired at the end of his term. Journalist [[Alexander McClure]] wrote, \"No man ever entered the Presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur, and no one ever retired\u2026 more generally respected, alike by political friend and foe.\"<ref>Alexander K. McClure, ''Colonel Alexander K. McClure's recollections of Half a Century'' (1902) p 115 [https://archive.org/details/colonelalexande01mcclgoog/page/n9/mode/2up  online] </ref> Arthur's failing health and political temperament combined to make his administration less active than a modern presidency, yet he earned praise among contemporaries for his solid performance in office. The ''New York World'' summed up Arthur's presidency at his death in 1886: \"No duty was neglected in his administration, and no adventurous project alarmed the nation.\"{{sfn|Reeves|1975|p=423}} [[Mark Twain]] wrote of him, \"It would be hard indeed to better President Arthur's administration.\"{{sfn|Feldman|p=95}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Birth and family===\n[[File:Fairfield ChesterArthur Nov2007.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Arthur's birthplace in [[Fairfield, Vermont]]]]\nChester Alan Arthur was born October 5, 1829, in [[Fairfield, Vermont]].{{efn|Some older sources list the date as October 5, 1830,{{sfn|Howe|p=5}} but biographer [[Thomas C.

In addition, contemporary newspaper articles, including the 1871 stories about his appointment as Collector of the Port of New York, all indicate that he was born in Vermont, though some incorrectly give his birthplace as [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]]. Hinman failed to explain why Arthur would have fabricated these records and the biographical information he provided to newspapers to conceal a Canadian birth when the only thing being born in Canada might possibly affect was Arthur's eligibility for the presidency, which no one at the time of his birth or in the years between his birth and his nomination for vice president in 1880 had any reason to think he would aspire to.}}{{sfn|Reeves (Autumn 1970)|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\n===Education===\nArthur spent some of his childhood years living in the New York towns of [[York, New York|York]], [[Perry, New York|Perry]], [[Greenwich (town), New York|Greenwich]], [[Lansingburgh, New York|Lansingburgh]], [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and [[Hoosick, New York|Hoosick]].{{sfn|Ferris|1999|p=127}} One of his first teachers said Arthur was a boy \"frank and open in manners and genial in disposition.\"{{sfn|Howe|p=7}} During his time at school, he gained his first political inclinations and supported the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].

Previously the 20th [[vice president of the United States|vice president]], he succeeded to the presidency upon the [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|death of President James A. Garfield]] in September 1881, two months after Garfield was shot by an assassin.\n\nArthur was born in [[Fairfield, Vermont]], grew up in [[upstate New York]], and practiced law in [[New York City]]. He served as quartermaster general of the [[New York Army National Guard|New York Militia]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Following the war, he devoted more time to Republican politics and quickly rose in [[New York (state)|New York]] Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]]'s political organization. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] appointed him to the post of [[Collector of the Port of New York]] in 1871, and he was an important supporter of Conkling and the [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] faction of the Republican Party. In 1878, President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] fired Arthur as part of a plan to reform the federal patronage system in New York. Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]], and Arthur was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket as an Eastern Stalwart. Four months into his term, Garfield was shot by an assassin; he died 11 weeks later, and Arthur assumed the presidency.\n\nAt the outset, Arthur struggled to overcome a negative reputation as a Stalwart and product of Conkling's organization. To the surprise of reformers, he advocated and enforced the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]]. He presided over the [[History of the United States Navy#\"New Navy\"|rebirth]] of the US Navy, but he was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus which had been accumulating since the end of the Civil War. Arthur reluctantly signed the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], which barred the entry of Chinese laborers. The 1875 [[Page Act]] barred Chinese women from entering the country and was the first total ban on a nation or ethnic group from immigrating to the country.\n\nSuffering from poor health, Arthur made only a limited effort to secure the Republican Party's nomination in 1884, and he retired at the end of his term. Journalist [[Alexander McClure]] wrote, \"No man ever entered the Presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur, and no one ever retired\u2026 more generally respected, alike by political friend and foe.\"<ref>Alexander K. McClure, ''Colonel Alexander K. McClure's recollections of Half a Century'' (1902) p 115 [https://archive.org/details/colonelalexande01mcclgoog/page/n9/mode/2up  online] </ref> Arthur's failing health and political temperament combined to make his administration less active than a modern presidency, yet he earned praise among contemporaries for his solid performance in office. The ''New York World'' summed up Arthur's presidency at his death in 1886: \"No duty was neglected in his administration, and no adventurous project alarmed the nation.\"{{sfn|Reeves|1975|p=423}} [[Mark Twain]] wrote of him, \"It would be hard indeed to better President Arthur's administration.\"{{sfn|Feldman|p=95}} \n==Early life==\n\n===Birth and family===\n[[File:Fairfield ChesterArthur Nov2007.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Arthur's birthplace in [[Fairfield, Vermont]]]]\nChester Alan Arthur was born October 5, 1829, in [[Fairfield, Vermont]].{{efn|Some older sources list the date as October 5, 1830,{{sfn|Howe|p=5}} but biographer [[Thomas C.
