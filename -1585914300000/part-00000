He also served, until he became its Vice Chancellor, as the head of the Department of History as well as the dean of the Faculty of Arts. Between 1924 and 1936 he was Provost of [[Jagannath Hall]]. Then he became the Vice Chancellor of that University, for five years from 1937 to 1942. From 1950, he was [[Dean (education)|Principal]] of the College of Indology, [[Benares Hindu University]].

After extensive travels to Southeast Asia and research, he wrote detailed histories of Champa (1927), Suvarnadvipa (1929) and Kambuja Desa. On the initiative of [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Educational Trust|Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]], he took up the mantle of editing a multi-volume tome on Indian history. Starting in 1951, he toiled for twenty-six long years to describe the history of the Indian people from the Vedic Period to the present day in eleven volumes. In 1955, Majumdar established the College of Indology of [[Nagpur University]] and joined as Principal. In 1958-59, he taught Indian history in the [[University of Chicago]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He was also the president of the Asiatic Society (1966\u201368) and the [[Bangiya Sahitya Parishad]] (1968\u201369), and also the [[Sheriff of Calcutta]] (1967\u201368).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nWhen the final volume of \"[[The History and Culture of the Indian People]]\" was published in 1977, he had turned eighty-eight.

They formed in 1993 with lead vocalist [[Benjamin Kowalewicz]], guitarist [[Ian D'Sa]], bassist [[Jon Gallant]], and drummer [[Aaron Solowoniuk]]. There have been no lineup changes, although Solowoniuk is currently taking a hiatus from the band due to an MS relapse, and [[Jordan Hastings]] from [[Alexisonfire]], [[Cunter (band)|Cunter]], and Say Yes is currently filling in for him. In the 25 years since their inception, Billy Talent has sold over 900,000 physical albums in Canada alone and nearly 3 million albums internationally. Between 1995 and 2016, Billy Talent were the 27th best-selling Canadian artist in Canada and among the top 10 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada.<ref>{{cite website|url=https://bdsradio.com/pd/docs/Nielsen_Canadian150_2017_vs2.pdf|title=NIELSEN MUSIC & BILLBOARD PRESENT CANADA 150 CHARTS|website=bdsradio.com|p=28|accessdate=January 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band existed for almost a decade before mainstream success. The members met and played in [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School]] under the name '''Pezz''' and remained underground in [[Toronto]]'s indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with an employee of [[Warner Music Canada]]'s [[A&R]] department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success.<ref name=\"Accessmag\"/> Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada<ref name=CRIA0107>\n{{cite web|date=January 2007|title=CRIA Gold and Platinum Certifications for January 2007|url=http://www.cria.ca/gold/0107_g.php|publisher=[[Canadian Recording Industry Association]]|accessdate=July 4, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526084701/http://www.cria.ca/gold/0107_g.php|archivedate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> and continues to expand their success overseas; this included touring for 20 months supporting their [[Billy Talent II|second album]]. They released their third album, ''[[Billy Talent III]]'', on July 14, 2009, and their fourth album, ''[[Dead Silence (album)|Dead Silence]]'', on September 4, 2012. ''Dead Silence'' was followed up by a full UK tour throughout October and November 2012.<ref name=\"4thalbum\">{{cite web|date=March 2012|title=New album planned for July 2012|url=http://www.billytalent.de/news/2012-02-19/groezrock-festival-absage|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref> To commemorate the longevity since the release of their [[Billy Talent (album)|first studio album]], the band has released a greatest hits album entitled ''[[Hits (Billy Talent album)|Hits]]'' on November 4, 2014. In 2015, they began to prepare material for their fifth studio album. Just before entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk decided to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with [[multiple sclerosis]]. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings was quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk's studio stand-in, and, in early 2016, the group completed work on ''[[Afraid of Heights (Billy Talent album)|Afraid of Heights]]'', which was released in July of that year.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins as Pezz (1993\u20131999)===\n<!-- {{Listen|type=sound|filename=Pezz - M & M.ogg|title=M & M|description=A sample of \"M & M\" from the album ''[[Watoosh!]]'', the band's first album.

Pezz began writing, performing songs, and gaining attention and credibility at first locally, and soon in [[Toronto]]'s broader [[Independent music|indie music]] scene. Their first recording was a cheap 4-track demo. It was recorded in Ian D'Sa's basement in July 1994 and was named ''Demoluca'', after a friend of the band named Jason Deluca had stopped by the house, banging on a basement window while the band was recording.

During this time, Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst, at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]], the Toronto radio station he worked at. She had seen the band perform as Pezz, and he asked her to check out the band's performance at a club.

They formed in 1993 with lead vocalist [[Benjamin Kowalewicz]], guitarist [[Ian D'Sa]], bassist [[Jon Gallant]], and drummer [[Aaron Solowoniuk]]. There have been no lineup changes, although Solowoniuk is currently taking a hiatus from the band due to an MS relapse, and [[Jordan Hastings]] from [[Alexisonfire]], [[Cunter (band)|Cunter]], and Say Yes is currently filling in for him. In the 25 years since their inception, Billy Talent has sold over 900,000 physical albums in Canada alone and nearly 3 million albums internationally. Between 1995 and 2016, Billy Talent were the 27th best-selling Canadian artist in Canada and among the top 10 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada.<ref>{{cite website|url=https://bdsradio.com/pd/docs/Nielsen_Canadian150_2017_vs2.pdf|title=NIELSEN MUSIC & BILLBOARD PRESENT CANADA 150 CHARTS|website=bdsradio.com|p=28|accessdate=January 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band existed for almost a decade before mainstream success. The members met and played in [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School]] under the name '''Pezz''' and remained underground in [[Toronto]]'s indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with an employee of [[Warner Music Canada]]'s [[A&R]] department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success.<ref name=\"Accessmag\"/> Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada<ref name=CRIA0107>\n{{cite web|date=January 2007|title=CRIA Gold and Platinum Certifications for January 2007|url=http://www.cria.ca/gold/0107_g.php|publisher=[[Canadian Recording Industry Association]]|accessdate=July 4, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526084701/http://www.cria.ca/gold/0107_g.php|archivedate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> and continues to expand their success overseas; this included touring for 20 months supporting their [[Billy Talent II|second album]]. They released their third album, ''[[Billy Talent III]]'', on July 14, 2009, and their fourth album, ''[[Dead Silence (album)|Dead Silence]]'', on September 4, 2012.

In 2015, they began to prepare material for their fifth studio album. Just before entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk decided to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with [[multiple sclerosis]]. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings was quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk's studio stand-in, and, in early 2016, the group completed work on ''[[Afraid of Heights (Billy Talent album)|Afraid of Heights]]'', which was released in July of that year.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins as Pezz (1993\u20131999)===\n<!-- {{Listen|type=sound|filename=Pezz - M & M.ogg|title=M & M|description=A sample of \"M & M\" from the album ''[[Watoosh!]]'', the band's first album.

Pezz began writing, performing songs, and gaining attention and credibility at first locally, and soon in [[Toronto]]'s broader [[Independent music|indie music]] scene. Their first recording was a cheap 4-track demo. It was recorded in Ian D'Sa's basement in July 1994 and was named ''Demoluca'', after a friend of the band named Jason Deluca had stopped by the house, banging on a basement window while the band was recording. Soon after, on January 1995, they all put in money to record another demo of better quality with engineer/producer Dave Tedesco at the \"Signal to Noise\" studio which they called ''[[Dudebox]]''.<ref name=BeforeFamous>\"Before They Were Famous\". {{cite web |url=http://www.exploremusic.com/ongoing-history-of-new-music/2009-05-27/Ongoing-History-On-Air-Schedule-Since-1993 |title=The Ongoing History of New Music |date=November 11, 2005 |publisher=[[CFNY]] }}</ref> Originally, two tracks from ''Demoluca'' and four newly recorded tracks were compiled onto it, but a year later the band recorded four more tunes live in the studio and re-released it.

Gallant almost finished a business degree. Kowalewicz was in between jobs, one which included working at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]]. Solowoniuk worked at [[Chrysler Canada]]. But during this, each member found the time and finances to max-out their credit cards, and record their first full-length album in 1999.<ref name=BeforeFamous/> They laid down twelve tracks at a studio called \"Great Big Music\", collaborating with [[Juno Award|Juno]]-nominated music producer [[Brad Nelson]]. Kowalewicz started singing in melody with D'Sa. The music began to transform from \"raw rap-rock\" songs into \"catchy and angst-ridden pop-punk anthems\". With that, ''[[Watoosh!]]'' was born and independently released.<ref name=PezzBio/> While popular within Toronto's [[indie (music)|indie]] scene, it did not reach large mainstream sales levels.<ref name=BeforeFamous/>\n\n=== Billy Talent and success (1999\u20132004) ===\nIn 1999, the Canadian Pezz received documentation from an American band named Pezz proving that the latter had held the name internationally since 1989. The Canadian band had no legal claim to their old name and thus changed it to Billy Talent, inspired by the guitarist \"Billy Tallent\"<!-- This name was seen in a vision that Ben had involving riding a platypus going to the planet unicorn. When asked about this experience further Ben said \" Dude you just had to be there\" --> from [[Michael Turner (musician)|Michael Turner]]'s novel ''[[Hard Core Logo]]''.

During this time, Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst, at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]], the Toronto radio station he worked at. She had seen the band perform as Pezz, and he asked her to check out the band's performance at a club. This would prove to pay off, as Hirst was later hired by [[Warner Music Canada]] to work in [[A&R]]. This connection would get the band their producer [[Gavin Brown (musician)|Gavin Brown]], and a demo deal with the label. Before the demos were recorded, a local manager called [[Atlantic Records]] A&R executives, who were already in Toronto, to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space.<ref name=Accessmag/>\n\n[[File: Billy Talent at Rock Am See 2007.jpg|right|thumb|The band found much success in their home country, with their debut album going [[Music Canada|3x platinum]] in Canada.<ref name=CRIA0107/>]]\n\nIn 2002, the band met with record executives, and ended up signing a co-venture agreement with [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Warner Music Canada]].<ref name=Accessmag/> In the fall of 2003, the band released their full-length self-titled album, ''[[Billy Talent (album)|Billy Talent]]''.

The band played sold-out shows in Canada and the United States and had success in Europe. The band received a [[Juno Award|Juno]], (They won two Junos, Best Album of the Year, and Best Band of the Year) and [[MuchMusic Video Award]] nominations and awards, and spent late 2004 and most of 2005 touring. ''Billy Talent'' went on to be certified 3x platinum in Canada.<ref name=CRIA0107/>\n\nA track from the album titled \"This Is How It Goes\" was about Aaron Solowoniuk's fight with [[multiple sclerosis]]. On March 17, 2006, Aaron Solowoniuk revealed in a personal letter to fans that he was the friend in that song. Solowoniuk was confirmed to have the disease, which causes anything from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision, in January 1999. His [[neurologist]] prescribed him medication that he would have to self inject three times a week, possibly for the rest of his life.

In the last match of the season against [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]], Benayoun got a penalty kick in the 90th minute. Haifa's [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], [[Nir Davidovich]], saved the shot but Benayoun scored the rebound to give his team the win. However, their relegation rival had won their match, meaning that his team would be relegated nonetheless. Seconds after scoring, while celebrating the winning and what he thought to be a league survival goal, Benayoun found out about the relegation and burst into tears.<ref name = \"sbase\">{{soccerbase}}</ref>  Benayoun finished as the league's joint fourth-leading goalscorer that season, with 15 goals in 25 appearances.\n\n===Maccabi Haifa===\nAfter that season, Benayoun moved to Maccabi Haifa in a deal signed by [[Ya'akov Shahar]] (Maccabi Haifa's president) and Eli Zino (the former Be'er Sheva president), and it was agreed that the two clubs would share the profits from selling Benayoun to a European club.\n\nIn 1998, under the guidance of [[Dusan Uhrin]] and [[Daniel Brailovsky]], Benayoun and Haifa reached the quarterfinals of the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], and he scored a late equaliser against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and also against [[SV Ried]] in a 4\u20131 victory.\n\nBenayoun also scored 16 goals in 29 matches for Haifa in the [[Liga Leumit 1998\u201399|1998\u201399 Liga Leumit]], finishing the season as the equal eighth leading goalscorer for his team.\n\nIn 1999, he confronted his manager [[Eli Cohen (footballer born 1951)|Eli Cohen]], when Benayoun allegedly refused to be substituted during a match.

At the age of 11 he was labelled a genius, and by 13, his face appeared on the cover of Israeli magazines. Benayoun began to play  with [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.|Hapoel Be'er Sheva]]. To attend training, he hitchhiked the 60&nbsp;km roundtrip with his father.<ref name=uefa>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=512/newsid=319108.html |title=Benayoun the kid for Hammers |publisher=UEFA |date=22 July 2005 |accessdate=11 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013092928/http://uefa.com/magazine/news/kind%3D512/newsid%3D319108.html |archivedate=13 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWhen he was 15, [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] invited Benayoun and his family to the Netherlands. By his 16th birthday, he was the Ajax youth team's highest scorer and best player, and Ajax duly offered Benayoun a four-year professional contract.<ref name=independent>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/the-kid-from-the-negev-desert-314820.html|title=The Kid from the Negev Desert|first=Jason|last=Burt|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=24 September 2005|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref> However, Benayoun and his family found the adjustment to  [[Amsterdam]] difficult, and they returned to Israel after eight months.\n\n==Football career==\n\n===Hapoel Be'er Sheva===\nAt the age of 16, he was promoted to the Hapoel Be'er Sheva senior team for the [[1997\u201398 Liga Leumit]], but could not prevent the club from being relegated to Israel's second division. In the last match of the season against [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]], Benayoun got a penalty kick in the 90th minute. Haifa's [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], [[Nir Davidovich]], saved the shot but Benayoun scored the rebound to give his team the win. However, their relegation rival had won their match, meaning that his team would be relegated nonetheless. Seconds after scoring, while celebrating the winning and what he thought to be a league survival goal, Benayoun found out about the relegation and burst into tears.<ref name = \"sbase\">{{soccerbase}}</ref>  Benayoun finished as the league's joint fourth-leading goalscorer that season, with 15 goals in 25 appearances.\n\n===Maccabi Haifa===\nAfter that season, Benayoun moved to Maccabi Haifa in a deal signed by [[Ya'akov Shahar]] (Maccabi Haifa's president) and Eli Zino (the former Be'er Sheva president), and it was agreed that the two clubs would share the profits from selling Benayoun to a European club.\n\nIn 1998, under the guidance of [[Dusan Uhrin]] and [[Daniel Brailovsky]], Benayoun and Haifa reached the quarterfinals of the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], and he scored a late equaliser against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and also against [[SV Ried]] in a 4\u20131 victory.\n\nBenayoun also scored 16 goals in 29 matches for Haifa in the [[Liga Leumit 1998\u201399|1998\u201399 Liga Leumit]], finishing the season as the equal eighth leading goalscorer for his team.\n\nIn 1999, he confronted his manager [[Eli Cohen (footballer born 1951)|Eli Cohen]], when Benayoun allegedly refused to be substituted during a match. This incident, plus a bad month for the club, ultimately caused Cohen's resignation.  In the first ever [[Israeli Premier League]] of 1999 to 2000, (this league replaced the Liga Leumit which then became the second tier of club football), Benayoun scored 19 goals in 38 matches for [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]], and was the league's third highest goalscorer.\n\nIn the [[Israeli Premier League 2000\u201301|2000\u201301 season]] under the guidance of [[Avram Grant]], Benayoun led Haifa to a first championship after seven years and was chosen as the [[Most Valuable Player]] of the season, after amassing 13 goals in 37 matches. Another successful season placed him as the league's equal sixth highest goalscorer.\n\nThe [[Israeli Premier League 2001\u201302|next season]], Benayoun helped Maccabi Haifa win another championship, despite suffering from an injury in the beginning of the season. When he returned to play, he combined well with [[\u0110ovani Roso]], [[Raimondas \u017dutautas]], and [[Yakubu (footballer)|Yakubu]] to win the championship. In his last season with [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]], Benayoun scored 7 times in 33 matches.\n\nBenayoun made 130 appearances for Haifa, scoring 55 goals.<ref name=\"sbase\"/>\n\n===Racing de Santander===\nIn 2002, Benayoun moved to [[Racing de Santander]] in Spain's [[La Liga]], scoring five goals in 31 matches his first season ([[La Liga 2002\u201303|2002\u201303 La Liga]]), seven goals in 35 matches his second ([[2003\u201304 La Liga]]), and nine goals in 35 matches his third ([[La Liga 2004-05|2004\u201305 La Liga]]), the latter including a hat-trick against [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a|Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a]] in a 4\u20131 away victory.\n\nIn total, he made 101 appearances for Racing, scoring 21 goals.<ref name=\"sbase\"/>\n\nSantander opted to cash in on Benayoun by selling him to his agents [[Pini Zahavi]] and Ronen Katsav for \u20ac3.5 million.

Rimini, a town on the Adriatic coast of Italy, anchored the Rimini Line, a German defensive line which was the third such line forming the [[Gothic Line]] defences.\n\nRimini, which had been hit previously by 373 air raids, had 1,470,000 rounds fired against it by allied land forces; by the end of the battle, only 2 % of all buildings in the city were still undamaged.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/rimini_res-c2072ce3-87e6-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/ Enciclopedia Treccani]</ref>\n\n{{quote|The battle of Rimini was one of the hardest battles of Eighth Army. The fighting was comparable to [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], [[Operation Pugilist|Mareth]] and the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Gustav Line (Monte-Cassino)]].|sign=Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese, commander of the Eighth Army|}}\n\n==Background==\nOn 23 August 1944 the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] launched Operation ''Olive'', attacking on a three Corps front up the eastern flank of Italy into the Gothic Line defences. By the first week in September the offensive had broken through the forward defences of the Gothic Line and the defensive positions of the Green I line and United States Fifth Army entered the offensive in central Italy attacking towards [[Bologna]].\n\nIn the Eighth Army's centre 1st Canadian Corps had broken through Green II on the right of its front advancing to pinch out the Polish Corps on the very right of the army (and allowing the latter to be withdrawn to army reserve) but inland in the hills the Corps' advance had been held up by stubborn defence at Coriano and [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] on the army's left flank had been halted at Croce and [[Battle of Gemmano|Gemmano]]. A new attack to clear the Green II positions in the hills and destroy the Rimini Line running from the port of Rimini inland to [[San Marino]] was scheduled to start on 12 September.<ref>Jackson, p.274.</ref>\n\n==Battle of Rimini==\nJust south of Rimini, attached to  [[1st Canadian Division]], was [[3rd Greek Mountain Brigade]] ({{lang-el|\u0399\u0399\u0399 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae \u03a4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1}}, \u0399\u0399\u0399 \u0395.\u039f.\u03a4.), a unit of [[mountain infantry]] formed by the [[Greek government in exile]] on 1 July 1944 in Lebanon under the command of Colonel [[Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos]]. Near the village of [[Cattolica]] they pushed back two strong German attacks on 8 and 10 September. On 13 September the brigade, supported by the combined armour and infantry of B squadron, 20th New Zealand Armoured Regiment and 22 New Zealand Motor Battalion from [[2nd New Zealand Division]], launched a counterattack to take Rimini. Also supporting the brigade were infantry, mortars and machine guns from the Canadian Saskatoon Light Infantry (SLI) and New Zealand 33 Anti-tank battery fielding [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|17pdr guns]].\n\nThe initial attack on 13 September saw the Greeks attacking two small farm settlements on the Marano road. The two settlements (Monaldini and Monticelli) were defended by 1st Parachute Regiment (''1. [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]] Regiment'') and some ''[[Osttruppen]]'' described as Turkomen (likely a Turkestani ''[[Ostlegion]]'' battalion from the [[162nd Turkoman Division]]). The Germans were well prepared and held off the Greeks.\n\nThe following day 7 and 8 Troop of the B Squadron, 20th Armoured Regiment were added to the attack on Monaldini, while soon after a platoon from 22nd Motor Battalion aided the attack on Monticelli with the support of 5 and 6 Troops' [[Sherman tank]]s. By 2000 hours the Monaldini farm had been taken, with only light casualties. The focus then turned to Monticelli, where the Greeks and New Zealanders once again attacked. The German defenders cleared out of the position as soon as the attackers approached and the farm was in Allied hands a short time later.\n\nOn 15 September the Greeks launched an assault on the Rimini airfield. The 1st Greek Battalion crossed the Marano River (a stream with only a gentle flow of water) at 1000 hours, and immediately came under intense fire from German positions around the airfield. The Greeks halted to re-organise themselves for an attack. C Squadron, 18th New Zealand Armoured Regiment relieved B Squadron 20th Armoured Regiment in the line supporting the Greeks.<ref>Kay (1967), [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-2Ita-c5-4.html#n222 p. 222]</ref> Air support was called in and Allied fighter/bombers attacked the western side of the airfield, and the Greeks attacked shortly afterwards.\n\nThe 1st Greek Battalion attacked the airfield itself, the 2nd Greek Battalion then attacked up the Route 16 road and the 3rd Battalion attacked the small village of Casalecchio.\n\nThe 1st Greek Battalion once more ran into stiff resistance from the airfield defenders. Fire from airfield inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing Greeks, however support from the New Zealand tanks and infantry was better co-ordinated as one of the New Zealand officers spoke Greek. The tanks were able to fire on each house lining the south of the airfield to ensure they weren't occupied. As the Greeks and New Zealanders approached the defensive positions they came under fire from infantry, anti-tank rockets (''[[Panzerschreck]]s''), self-propelled guns, and emplaced [[Panzer V|Panther]] turrets. The heavy fire pinned the advance just short of the airfield. Meanwhile, the tanks edged around a hedgerow to avoid the anti-tank fire, but soon found themselves at the forefront of the attack. A German self-propelled gun knocked out a Sherman, but the New Zealanders continued forward and knocked out enemy positions with high-explosives and grenades, forcing the Germans to withdraw from their positions. The crew of a Panther turret abandoned it during the night.\n\nThe 2nd Greek Battalion, on the right of the brigade, attacked up the Route 16 road, but became separated from their supporting New Zealand tanks. The Greeks were halted by mines and heavy defensive fire from the east side of the airfield and nearby houses. The 3rd Greek Battalion attacked the village of Casalecchio on the left flank, supported by New Zealand tanks and infantry. The little village stood on a crossroads with a few houses and a church. The Greek infantry quickly cleared the houses, but the paratroops in the church proved harder to move. The church was finally cleared when a combined attack by Greek and New Zealand infantry and tanks drove the paratroopers out. However heavy machine-gun and mortar fire from the airfield halted any further advance. The following day (16 September) the Greeks continued to mop up around the airfield, most of which they held, though one Panther turret was still in operation. The 3rd Greek Battalion advanced up the left through the hedges and ditches beyond Casalecchio until they came level with the 1st Greek Battalion in the centre. Their task was made difficult as they had occasionally to clear minefields and were under constant fire. The 2nd Greek Battalion advanced up the right flank of the airfield. Anti-tank fire was lighter than the previous day.\n\nThe following day (17 September) the three battalions continued their advance. Several attempts were made to knock out the remaining Panther turret with aircraft and artillery, but it finally fell to one of the New Zealand Shermans working around its flank. It fired several anti-tank rounds into the turret before the crew eventually evacuated.<ref>Kay (1967), [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-2Ita-c5-4.html#n223 p. 223]</ref> Once the airfield was taken the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade turned its attention towards Rimini itself.  On 18 September the 2nd and 3rd Battalions pushed on to Rimini, towards the coastal suburbs of the town. They encountered heavy resistance once again from the German paratroops, but with the aid of New Zealand and Canadian support were finally able to push into the outskirts of the town on 20 September. They pushed on into Rimini from the south, only to find the city abandoned by the Germans who had been forced to withdraw by the outflanking threat created by the fall of San Fortunato to 1st Canadian Division.<ref name=\"Kay225\">Kay (1967), [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-2Ita-c5-5.html#n225 p. 225]</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 21 September the 2nd Greek Battalion reached the city centre via the Ausa River and raised the Greek flag on the balcony of the municipal building. At 7:45 of 21 September the mayor unconditionally surrendered the city to the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade with an official protocol that is written in Greek, English and Italian.<ref name=\"Kay225\"/>\n\nThe actions of the Greek brigade during the battle earned it the honorific title \"Rimini Brigade\" ({{lang|el|\"\u03a4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 \u03a1\u03af\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\"}}).\n\n==Notes==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n;References\n* {{cite book| last1=Jackson| first1=General Sir William| last2=Gleave| first2=Group Captain T.P.|editor-last=Butler| editor-first=Sir James| editor-link=James Ramsay Montagu Butler | series=History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series| title=The Mediterranean and Middle East, Volume VI: Victory in the Mediterranean, Part 2 - June to October 1944| publisher=Naval & Military Press |location=Uckfield, UK |year=2004| origyear=1st. pub.

Rimini, a town on the Adriatic coast of Italy, anchored the Rimini Line, a German defensive line which was the third such line forming the [[Gothic Line]] defences.\n\nRimini, which had been hit previously by 373 air raids, had 1,470,000 rounds fired against it by allied land forces; by the end of the battle, only 2 % of all buildings in the city were still undamaged.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/rimini_res-c2072ce3-87e6-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/ Enciclopedia Treccani]</ref>\n\n{{quote|The battle of Rimini was one of the hardest battles of Eighth Army. The fighting was comparable to [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], [[Operation Pugilist|Mareth]] and the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Gustav Line (Monte-Cassino)]].|sign=Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese, commander of the Eighth Army|}}\n\n==Background==\nOn 23 August 1944 the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] launched Operation ''Olive'', attacking on a three Corps front up the eastern flank of Italy into the Gothic Line defences. By the first week in September the offensive had broken through the forward defences of the Gothic Line and the defensive positions of the Green I line and United States Fifth Army entered the offensive in central Italy attacking towards [[Bologna]].\n\nIn the Eighth Army's centre 1st Canadian Corps had broken through Green II on the right of its front advancing to pinch out the Polish Corps on the very right of the army (and allowing the latter to be withdrawn to army reserve) but inland in the hills the Corps' advance had been held up by stubborn defence at Coriano and [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] on the army's left flank had been halted at Croce and [[Battle of Gemmano|Gemmano]]. A new attack to clear the Green II positions in the hills and destroy the Rimini Line running from the port of Rimini inland to [[San Marino]] was scheduled to start on 12 September.<ref>Jackson, p.274.</ref>\n\n==Battle of Rimini==\nJust south of Rimini, attached to  [[1st Canadian Division]], was [[3rd Greek Mountain Brigade]] ({{lang-el|\u0399\u0399\u0399 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u039f\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae \u03a4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1}}, \u0399\u0399\u0399 \u0395.\u039f.\u03a4.), a unit of [[mountain infantry]] formed by the [[Greek government in exile]] on 1 July 1944 in Lebanon under the command of Colonel [[Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos]]. Near the village of [[Cattolica]] they pushed back two strong German attacks on 8 and 10 September. On 13 September the brigade, supported by the combined armour and infantry of B squadron, 20th New Zealand Armoured Regiment and 22 New Zealand Motor Battalion from [[2nd New Zealand Division]], launched a counterattack to take Rimini. Also supporting the brigade were infantry, mortars and machine guns from the Canadian Saskatoon Light Infantry (SLI) and New Zealand 33 Anti-tank battery fielding [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|17pdr guns]].\n\nThe initial attack on 13 September saw the Greeks attacking two small farm settlements on the Marano road. The two settlements (Monaldini and Monticelli) were defended by 1st Parachute Regiment (''1. [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]] Regiment'') and some ''[[Osttruppen]]'' described as Turkomen (likely a Turkestani ''[[Ostlegion]]'' battalion from the [[162nd Turkoman Division]]). The Germans were well prepared and held off the Greeks.\n\nThe following day 7 and 8 Troop of the B Squadron, 20th Armoured Regiment were added to the attack on Monaldini, while soon after a platoon from 22nd Motor Battalion aided the attack on Monticelli with the support of 5 and 6 Troops' [[Sherman tank]]s. By 2000 hours the Monaldini farm had been taken, with only light casualties. The focus then turned to Monticelli, where the Greeks and New Zealanders once again attacked. The German defenders cleared out of the position as soon as the attackers approached and the farm was in Allied hands a short time later.\n\nOn 15 September the Greeks launched an assault on the Rimini airfield. The 1st Greek Battalion crossed the Marano River (a stream with only a gentle flow of water) at 1000 hours, and immediately came under intense fire from German positions around the airfield. The Greeks halted to re-organise themselves for an attack. C Squadron, 18th New Zealand Armoured Regiment relieved B Squadron 20th Armoured Regiment in the line supporting the Greeks.<ref>Kay (1967), [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-2Ita-c5-4.html#n222 p. 222]</ref> Air support was called in and Allied fighter/bombers attacked the western side of the airfield, and the Greeks attacked shortly afterwards.\n\nThe 1st Greek Battalion attacked the airfield itself, the 2nd Greek Battalion then attacked up the Route 16 road and the 3rd Battalion attacked the small village of Casalecchio.\n\nThe 1st Greek Battalion once more ran into stiff resistance from the airfield defenders. Fire from airfield inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing Greeks, however support from the New Zealand tanks and infantry was better co-ordinated as one of the New Zealand officers spoke Greek. The tanks were able to fire on each house lining the south of the airfield to ensure they weren't occupied. As the Greeks and New Zealanders approached the defensive positions they came under fire from infantry, anti-tank rockets (''[[Panzerschreck]]s''), self-propelled guns, and emplaced [[Panzer V|Panther]] turrets. The heavy fire pinned the advance just short of the airfield. Meanwhile, the tanks edged around a hedgerow to avoid the anti-tank fire, but soon found themselves at the forefront of the attack. A German self-propelled gun knocked out a Sherman, but the New Zealanders continued forward and knocked out enemy positions with high-explosives and grenades, forcing the Germans to withdraw from their positions. The crew of a Panther turret abandoned it during the night.\n\nThe 2nd Greek Battalion, on the right of the brigade, attacked up the Route 16 road, but became separated from their supporting New Zealand tanks. The Greeks were halted by mines and heavy defensive fire from the east side of the airfield and nearby houses. The 3rd Greek Battalion attacked the village of Casalecchio on the left flank, supported by New Zealand tanks and infantry. The little village stood on a crossroads with a few houses and a church. The Greek infantry quickly cleared the houses, but the paratroops in the church proved harder to move. The church was finally cleared when a combined attack by Greek and New Zealand infantry and tanks drove the paratroopers out. However heavy machine-gun and mortar fire from the airfield halted any further advance. The following day (16 September) the Greeks continued to mop up around the airfield, most of which they held, though one Panther turret was still in operation. The 3rd Greek Battalion advanced up the left through the hedges and ditches beyond Casalecchio until they came level with the 1st Greek Battalion in the centre. Their task was made difficult as they had occasionally to clear minefields and were under constant fire. The 2nd Greek Battalion advanced up the right flank of the airfield. Anti-tank fire was lighter than the previous day.\n\nThe following day (17 September) the three battalions continued their advance. Several attempts were made to knock out the remaining Panther turret with aircraft and artillery, but it finally fell to one of the New Zealand Shermans working around its flank. It fired several anti-tank rounds into the turret before the crew eventually evacuated.<ref>Kay (1967), [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-2Ita-c5-4.html#n223 p. 223]</ref> Once the airfield was taken the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade turned its attention towards Rimini itself.  On 18 September the 2nd and 3rd Battalions pushed on to Rimini, towards the coastal suburbs of the town. They encountered heavy resistance once again from the German paratroops, but with the aid of New Zealand and Canadian support were finally able to push into the outskirts of the town on 20 September. They pushed on into Rimini from the south, only to find the city abandoned by the Germans who had been forced to withdraw by the outflanking threat created by the fall of San Fortunato to 1st Canadian Division.<ref name=\"Kay225\">Kay (1967), [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-2Ita-c5-5.html#n225 p. 225]</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 21 September the 2nd Greek Battalion reached the city centre via the Ausa River and raised the Greek flag on the balcony of the municipal building. At 7:45 of 21 September the mayor unconditionally surrendered the city to the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade with an official protocol that is written in Greek, English and Italian.<ref name=\"Kay225\"/>\n\nThe actions of the Greek brigade during the battle earned it the honorific title \"Rimini Brigade\" ({{lang|el|\"\u03a4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 \u03a1\u03af\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\"}}).\n\n==Notes==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n;References\n* {{cite book| last1=Jackson| first1=General Sir William| last2=Gleave| first2=Group Captain T.P.|editor-last=Butler| editor-first=Sir James| editor-link=James Ramsay Montagu Butler | series=History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series| title=The Mediterranean and Middle East, Volume VI: Victory in the Mediterranean, Part 2 - June to October 1944| publisher=Naval & Military Press |location=Uckfield, UK |year=2004| origyear=1st. pub.

Her first success was followed by a second, ''[[Pioneers in Ingolstadt|Pionere in Ingolstadt]]'' (Pioneers in Ingolstadt) (1929), which scandalized the public through Brecht's unauthorized changes, transforming the piece into an explicitly anti-militaristic and sexually daring satire of ''petit bourgeois'' mores and small-town life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Discussed in many of the major German newspapers of the time, the scandal caused an uproar in her hometown: the mayor published a rebuttal, distancing the city from its now most famous daughter, while Flei\u00dfer's father temporarily disowned her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nDuring this tumultuous period, which would prove to be the apex of her fame during her lifetime, Flei\u00dfer also published a collection of short stories, ''Ein Pfund Orangen'' (A Pound of Oranges, 1929), and became engaged to a local swimming star in Ingolstadt, Bepp Haindl, which was later called off in 1929.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fleisser.net/|title=Marieluise-Flei\u00dfer-Gesellschaft Ingolstadt e.V.|language=de-DE|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> After moving to Berlin, she worked as a freelance journalist and author, publishing a travelogue about her journey [[Andorra]] with her then fianc\u00e9, the arch-conservative journalist and poet [[Hellmut Draws-Tychsen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> She sunk further into intellectual and social isolation and financial troubles due to her liaison with the notorious conservative, and her subsequent works published in the early 1930s, such as the novel ''Ein Zierde f\u00fcr den Verein'' was met with tepid reviews and sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> This culminated in an attempted suicide in 1932 and her move back to Ingolstadt, where she married her first fianc\u00e9, the shop owner Bepp Haindl, who forbid her from writing and demanded that she work in his tobacco shop; her fall into contemporary obscurity was sealed in 1935, when she partially forbidden to write by the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] due to her leftist political sympathies and innovative modernist style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> The 1930s and 1940s were a difficult period for Flei\u00dfer, who suffered from mental illness and unhappiness caused by the stresses and deprivations of war and the work demands placed on her by her husband; after the fall of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] in 1945, she managed to write little, such as the play ''Karl Stuart'' (1944).\n\nIt was only from the mid-1950s onwards that Flei\u00dfer began her gradual reemergence as a known and celebrated writer. After the death of her husband in 1958, she began writing in earnest again, such as the short story \"Avantgarde\" (1963) and the play ''Der starke Stamm'' (1966), which premiered at the [[Schaub\u00fchne]] in West Berlin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fleisser.net/|title=Marieluise-Flei\u00dfer-Gesellschaft Ingolstadt e.V.|language=de-DE|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Awarded a literary prize by the [[Bayerische Akademie der Sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste|Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1953 and invited to join in 1954, Flei\u00dfer was \"rediscovered\" by a trio of famous young male playwrights and critics, [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Martin Sperr]], and [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]] (whom she nicknamed her \"sons\"), who brought her major works of fiction and theater back into the public eye throughout the 1960s and 1970s. For example, ''Pioneers in Ingolstadt'' was adapted as a TV film by Fassbinder in 1971.

The plays, which feature lower-class characters from small town Bavaria, deal with abusive, sometimes violent relationships between men and women. Among literary scholars, the plays are categorized as \"critical Volksst\u00fccke,\" a genre that references and engages critically with the conventions of the popular \"Volksst\u00fcck\" (literally people's play, also \"milieu plays\"). Like the original \"Volksst\u00fcck,\" Flei\u00dfer's dramas feature regional (Bavarian) dialect, lower-class characters, and deal with everyday themes and relationships, but unlike the originals, Flei\u00dfer exposes unequal power relationships between men and women.\n\n[[Bertolt Brecht]] persuaded the director [[Moriz Seeler]] to stage the first play, which Seeler retitled; Flei\u00dfer's original title was ''The Washing of Feet''. Brecht then encouraged her to write ''Pioneers''.

Brecht would subsequently help her throughout the decade to secure publishing opportunities and support for her plays; conversely, Brecht often felt the liberty, without her permission, to revise and take from her work, which caused considerable strain on their relationship as well as Flei\u00dfer's reputation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Due to financial difficulties and the pressure of her father, who wanted her to become a teacher, Flei\u00dfer returned to Ingolstadt in 1924, where she would remain until moving to [[Berlin]] in 1926.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> What was a personally fraught time for the young author was artistically rich, as Flei\u00dfer wrote her first major play that would ensure her breakthrough in Weimar Germany, ''Fegefeuer in Ingolstadt'' (''Purgatory in Ingolstadt'') (1926). Her first success was followed by a second, ''[[Pioneers in Ingolstadt|Pionere in Ingolstadt]]'' (Pioneers in Ingolstadt) (1929), which scandalized the public through Brecht's unauthorized changes, transforming the piece into an explicitly anti-militaristic and sexually daring satire of ''petit bourgeois'' mores and small-town life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Discussed in many of the major German newspapers of the time, the scandal caused an uproar in her hometown: the mayor published a rebuttal, distancing the city from its now most famous daughter, while Flei\u00dfer's father temporarily disowned her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nDuring this tumultuous period, which would prove to be the apex of her fame during her lifetime, Flei\u00dfer also published a collection of short stories, ''Ein Pfund Orangen'' (A Pound of Oranges, 1929), and became engaged to a local swimming star in Ingolstadt, Bepp Haindl, which was later called off in 1929.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fleisser.net/|title=Marieluise-Flei\u00dfer-Gesellschaft Ingolstadt e.V.|language=de-DE|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> After moving to Berlin, she worked as a freelance journalist and author, publishing a travelogue about her journey [[Andorra]] with her then fianc\u00e9, the arch-conservative journalist and poet [[Hellmut Draws-Tychsen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> She sunk further into intellectual and social isolation and financial troubles due to her liaison with the notorious conservative, and her subsequent works published in the early 1930s, such as the novel ''Ein Zierde f\u00fcr den Verein'' was met with tepid reviews and sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> This culminated in an attempted suicide in 1932 and her move back to Ingolstadt, where she married her first fianc\u00e9, the shop owner Bepp Haindl, who forbid her from writing and demanded that she work in his tobacco shop; her fall into contemporary obscurity was sealed in 1935, when she partially forbidden to write by the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] due to her leftist political sympathies and innovative modernist style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fembio.org/english/biography.php/woman/biography/marieluise-fleisser/|title=Marieluise Flei\u00dfer|website=www.fembio.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> The 1930s and 1940s were a difficult period for Flei\u00dfer, who suffered from mental illness and unhappiness caused by the stresses and deprivations of war and the work demands placed on her by her husband; after the fall of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] in 1945, she managed to write little, such as the play ''Karl Stuart'' (1944).\n\nIt was only from the mid-1950s onwards that Flei\u00dfer began her gradual reemergence as a known and celebrated writer. After the death of her husband in 1958, she began writing in earnest again, such as the short story \"Avantgarde\" (1963) and the play ''Der starke Stamm'' (1966), which premiered at the [[Schaub\u00fchne]] in West Berlin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fleisser.net/|title=Marieluise-Flei\u00dfer-Gesellschaft Ingolstadt e.V.|language=de-DE|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Awarded a literary prize by the [[Bayerische Akademie der Sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste|Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1953 and invited to join in 1954, Flei\u00dfer was \"rediscovered\" by a trio of famous young male playwrights and critics, [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Martin Sperr]], and [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]] (whom she nicknamed her \"sons\"), who brought her major works of fiction and theater back into the public eye throughout the 1960s and 1970s. For example, ''Pioneers in Ingolstadt'' was adapted as a TV film by Fassbinder in 1971. Upon the publication of her complete works, ''Gesammelte Werke'' (1972), by the renowned [[Suhrkamp Verlag]], she was award the [[Bavarian Order of Merit]] in 1973, before dying on February 2, 1974.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fleisser.net/|title=Marieluise-Flei\u00dfer-Gesellschaft Ingolstadt e.V.|language=de-DE|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Statue von Marieluise Flei\u00dfer.jpg|thumb|Marieluise Flei\u00dfer, Statue by Elisabeth Wagner]]\nFlei\u00dfer's best-known works are two plays, ''Purgatory in Ingolstadt'' (1924) and ''[[Pioneers in Ingolstadt]]'' (1928). The plays, which feature lower-class characters from small town Bavaria, deal with abusive, sometimes violent relationships between men and women. Among literary scholars, the plays are categorized as \"critical Volksst\u00fccke,\" a genre that references and engages critically with the conventions of the popular \"Volksst\u00fcck\" (literally people's play, also \"milieu plays\"). Like the original \"Volksst\u00fcck,\" Flei\u00dfer's dramas feature regional (Bavarian) dialect, lower-class characters, and deal with everyday themes and relationships, but unlike the originals, Flei\u00dfer exposes unequal power relationships between men and women. \n\n[[Bertolt Brecht]] persuaded the director [[Moriz Seeler]] to stage the first play, which Seeler retitled; Flei\u00dfer's original title was ''The Washing of Feet''. Brecht then encouraged her to write ''Pioneers''. Premiered in Berlin, the plays caused a scandal, especially in her home town, and were attacked by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], who had not yet come to power.\n\nFlei\u00dfer was rediscovered in the 1970s by a later generation, among them the theatre director [[Peter Stein]] and the playwright [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]].

To the north and south lie the [[Dark Peak]] highlands, which are made up of millstone grit and are [[Calluna|heather]]-covered moorlands, rugged and bleak. These include Chinley Churn and South Head with, a little further off, [[Kinder Scout]], which looms above the whole area. To the east is the gentler and more [[pastoral]] [[White Peak]], consisting largely of [[limestone]] grasslands, nevertheless with spectacular bluffs and the occasional [[Canyon|gorge]]. [[Combs Moss]], a gritstone 'edge', dominates the valley in which Chapel lies from the south and [[Eccles Pike]] rises sharply above the town to its west and provides a commanding 360\u00b0 viewpoint.\n\n==Church of St Thomas Becket==\nThe first chapel in the town (now the Church of St. [[Thomas Becket]]) was originally built by the [[Normans]] but was replaced with a larger building a hundred years later. It stands at the highest point in the town proper. The current building is now almost entirely of 18th-century construction above a crypt of 1225. Buried in the churchyard are soldiers of the Scottish army of the [[Duke of Hamilton]] who marched south in support of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1648. After their [[Battle of Preston (1648)|defeat at Preston]], they were marched to Chapel and imprisoned in the church for sixteen days in such squalid conditions that forty died; a further ten died when they were marched towards [[Cheshire]]. The Eccles Pike Cross stands in the churchyard, having been moved here from Ollerenshaw Farm in 1925. It is believed to be [[Anglo-Saxon]] and is covered in very worn carvings.<ref name=\"Sharpe2002\">{{cite book| last=Sharpe |first=Neville T.| title=Crosses of the Peak District |publisher=Landmark Collectors Library |year=2002 |isbn=9781843060192}}</ref>\n[[File:Church Brow - geograph.org.uk - 901985.jpg|thumb|Church Brow in the town centre]]\n[[File:Church Tower - geograph.org.uk - 901964.jpg|thumb|Church of Thomas Becket]]\n\n==John Wesley==\n[[John Wesley]] has links to the town, visiting four times between 1740 and 1786. His journal documents his first visit on 28 May 1745 preaching in the hamlet of [[Chapel Milton]], where the miller purportedly tried to drown him out with the sound of the watermill. On his following visit twenty years later he preached in a field at Townend, and by his subsequent visit on 1 April 1782 a chapel had been built.

Subsequently, Grace married John Bennett, preacher and resident of Chapel-en-le-frith, and John's last visit to Chapel-en-le-frith on 3 April 1786 at the age of 86 was at Grace's request. Grace and John Bennett are buried in Chinley Independent Chapel in Chapel Milton.<ref name=\"Bunting\" />\n\n==Industry==\nThere is a certain amount of industry&nbsp;\u2013 especially behind the church in the lowest part of the town, where the brake-lining manufacturer [[Ferodo]] was a family concern for over a hundred years; it is now part of the international conglomerate [[Federal-Mogul]].\n\nThere is a regular [[market place]], [[cobblestone|cobbled]] and raised above the High Street, which is still used every Thursday to host the local market (though due to the current retail climate the number of stalls present has declined considerably). A [[market cross]] has a faint date which may read 1636, but the cross itself is considerably older.<ref name=\"Sharpe2002\"/>\n\n==Institutions==\nChapel Poor Law Union was established in December 1837.

To the north and south lie the [[Dark Peak]] highlands, which are made up of millstone grit and are [[Calluna|heather]]-covered moorlands, rugged and bleak. These include Chinley Churn and South Head with, a little further off, [[Kinder Scout]], which looms above the whole area. To the east is the gentler and more [[pastoral]] [[White Peak]], consisting largely of [[limestone]] grasslands, nevertheless with spectacular bluffs and the occasional [[Canyon|gorge]]. [[Combs Moss]], a gritstone 'edge', dominates the valley in which Chapel lies from the south and [[Eccles Pike]] rises sharply above the town to its west and provides a commanding 360\u00b0 viewpoint.\n\n==Church of St Thomas Becket==\nThe first chapel in the town (now the Church of St. [[Thomas Becket]]) was originally built by the [[Normans]] but was replaced with a larger building a hundred years later. It stands at the highest point in the town proper. The current building is now almost entirely of 18th-century construction above a crypt of 1225. Buried in the churchyard are soldiers of the Scottish army of the [[Duke of Hamilton]] who marched south in support of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1648. After their [[Battle of Preston (1648)|defeat at Preston]], they were marched to Chapel and imprisoned in the church for sixteen days in such squalid conditions that forty died; a further ten died when they were marched towards [[Cheshire]]. The Eccles Pike Cross stands in the churchyard, having been moved here from Ollerenshaw Farm in 1925. It is believed to be [[Anglo-Saxon]] and is covered in very worn carvings.<ref name=\"Sharpe2002\">{{cite book| last=Sharpe |first=Neville T.| title=Crosses of the Peak District |publisher=Landmark Collectors Library |year=2002 |isbn=9781843060192}}</ref>\n[[File:Church Brow - geograph.org.uk - 901985.jpg|thumb|Church Brow in the town centre]]\n[[File:Church Tower - geograph.org.uk - 901964.jpg|thumb|Church of Thomas Becket]]\n\n==John Wesley==\n[[John Wesley]] has links to the town, visiting four times between 1740 and 1786. His journal documents his first visit on 28 May 1745 preaching in the hamlet of [[Chapel Milton]], where the miller purportedly tried to drown him out with the sound of the watermill. On his following visit twenty years later he preached in a field at Townend, and by his subsequent visit on 1 April 1782 a chapel had been built. All that remains of the original chapel is an archway inscribed \"1780\" at the back of the current Townend Methodist Church.<ref name=\"Bunting\">{{cite book|first=William Braylesford|last=Bunting|title=Chapel-en-le-Frith - Its History and its People|date=1940|publisher=Sherratt & Hughes|location=Manchester|pages=277\u2013278|edition=1st|url=http://textarchive.ru/c-1537145-pall.html|accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing an illness in 1748, Wesley was nursed by Grace Murray, a classleader and housekeeper at an orphan house in Newcastle. Taken with Grace, he invited her to travel with him to Ireland in 1749 where he believed them to be betrothed though they were never married. It has been suggested that his brother Charles Wesley objected to the engagement<ref name=\"Collins\">{{cite book|first=Kenneth J|last=Collins|title=John Wesley A Theological Journey|date=2003|publisher=Abingdon Press|location=Nashville Tennessee|isbn=0-687-02788-8|edition=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4yJfG4iqSAC&pg=PT118}}</ref> though this is disputed. Subsequently, Grace married John Bennett, preacher and resident of Chapel-en-le-frith, and John's last visit to Chapel-en-le-frith on 3 April 1786 at the age of 86 was at Grace's request. Grace and John Bennett are buried in Chinley Independent Chapel in Chapel Milton.<ref name=\"Bunting\" />\n\n==Industry==\nThere is a certain amount of industry&nbsp;\u2013 especially behind the church in the lowest part of the town, where the brake-lining manufacturer [[Ferodo]] was a family concern for over a hundred years; it is now part of the international conglomerate [[Federal-Mogul]].\n\nThere is a regular [[market place]], [[cobblestone|cobbled]] and raised above the High Street, which is still used every Thursday to host the local market (though due to the current retail climate the number of stalls present has declined considerably). A [[market cross]] has a faint date which may read 1636, but the cross itself is considerably older.<ref name=\"Sharpe2002\"/>\n\n==Institutions==\nChapel Poor Law Union was established in December 1837. The union [[workhouse]] was built ''c''.1840 on the [[Whaley Bridge]] road ({{gbmapping|SK051805}}).

It is located {{Convert|15|mi|km}} south of [[Manchester]], at the edge of the [[Peak District]], on the eastern side of the [[River Goyt]]. Located between [[Whaley Bridge]] and [[Fernilee]], it is now administered as part of the larger community of Whaley Bridge.<ref>http://www.whaleybridge.com/ Whaley Bridge Website</ref>  The area attracts many outdoors enthusiasts, especially hikers, because of the beauty and variety of the scenery. The country rises steeply as it ascends the Goyt Valley from the canal terminal at Whaley Bridge, past the [[Fernilee Reservoir]], and onto the highlands of [[Axe Edge Moor]].\n\n==History==\nThere is much evidence of ancient settlement in the area, and ancient barrows and stones are found on nearby Ladder Hill.<ref>''Memorials of Old Derbyshire'', Marsden (1907)</ref> In civilized times, the region was settled by Danes who moved to the area from the Danish lands north of the [[River Mersey|Mersey River]]. The village of Shallcross is not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], but it was known before 1108, as it mentioned in the charter bestowed on the [[Lenton Priory]] by [[William Peverel]] before that date:\n<blockquote>''Two parts of the tithes of his demesne pastures in the Peak, namely in Shalcross, Fernilee, Darnall, Quatford, Buxton, Shirebrook, Stanton, Cowdale, Crochil Callow, Dunningestede, Chelmorton, and Sterndale, also the whole tithe of colts and fillies, wherever there was a stud-farm in his Peak demesnes, together with the tithes of his lead and of his venison both in skins and meat, all in Derbyshire.''<ref>''A History of the County of Nottingham'', William Page, (1910)</ref></blockquote>\n\nFrom 1108 onwards, the name occurs in various phonetic variations, both as a village and as a family name, as in Shallcross, Shalcrosse, Shawcross, de Shakelcrosse, and similar on land deeds and church records.<ref>''The Shallcross Pedigree'', William Shawcross, London (1908)</ref>\n\nThe name ''Shallcross'' itself comes from an ancient stone cross, known as the Shall Cross, only the shaft of which is still standing. This cross is traditionally dated to the year 832, when St. Paulinus visited the area, although the existing stone shaft may have been erected at a later date. The name comes from the [[Old Norse]] ''shakal'', denoting a tapering pole, which describes the shape of the shaft. For a time it was removed and used as the pedestal for a sun-dial in the garden of one of the local homes, but it was discovered and has been restored to its original location.<ref>''Crosses of Derbyshire'', Neville Sharpe, Landmark Books (2000)</ref>\n\nShallcross was once a stop on the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] line, which crossed the hills to connect the [[Peak Forest Canal]] terminal at Whaley Bridge with the [[Cromford Canal]] 30 miles to the south. The Shallcross Incline was a notable feature of this line, as the rail cars had to be pulled up the steep incline by a steam engine at the top of the hill. Opened in 1831, the northern end of the railway, including the Shallcross station, was abandoned in 1892, although a short section of the line serving a goods yard, identified on Ordnance Survey maps as Shallcross Yard, remained in use until 1965.<ref>''Lost Railways of Derbyshire,'' George Kingscott, Countryside Books (2007); Ordnance Survey 1:10,560 scale map, dated 1954-5; https://www.flickr.com/photos/136538618@N07/21894544264 (photograph of closure notice, accessed 2016-03-28)</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\nOther notable features in the village included the Shallcross Colliery, a mill, and a large gunpowder factory, all of which are now closed.
