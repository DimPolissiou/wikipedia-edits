She grew up in Philadelphia and was an art history major at Yale, where she notably had sex with her boyfriend, Coleman. They both realized they were [[gay]] shortly after, with Bette developing a crush on her art history professor, Danica Palmer (''Lifesize: 306''). Eventually, she [[came out]] as a lesbian, and fell for her bisexual friend, Kelly. After Kelly rejected her advances, Bette grew depressed to the brink of suicide.\n\nAfter graduation, Bette moved on, and dated [[Alice Pieszecki]] briefly. Bette once [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingered]] Alice while they were at the opera ''[[Lakm\u00e9]]'' (during ''[[The Flower Duet]]''). They remained close friends after they broke up.\n\nBette met her future partner, [[Tina Kennard|Tina]], while Tina was on a date at the Bette Porter Gallery with her then-boyfriend Eric. An instant attraction formed between the two of them. Bette noticed Tina's right earring had fallen off, and Tina supposedly put it back on. Later that night, Tina returned to the gallery to retrieve the lost earring. Bette had kept it for her. While Tina was picking it from her hand, Bette kissed her.\n\n===Season one===\n\nBette and Tina's relationship appears to their friends as very strong. Tina confirms to their closest friends that Bette is her \"first, last, and forever\" love. However, from the very beginning they seem to have problems, and even as they attempt to start a family, it is revealed that they no longer make love. Although they seem to move past this problem as the series progresses, Bette's career in the California Arts Center is shown to come between them, with Bette frequently not having time to spend with Tina.\n \nAt Bette's urging, Tina gives up her own career in order to have a child, leaving Bette as the sole breadwinner. Bette has a difficult family life, with her father Melvin only barely tolerating her relationship with Tina, and flatly refusing to acknowledge Tina's baby as his grandchild. Bette is also shown to be very bossy and domineering with Tina and everyone else. Throughout the entire series, Bette has a reputation for throwing fits and tantrums in public and private when things do not go her way.\n\nIn addition, Bette at first has a difficult relationship with her older half-sister [[Kit Porter|Kit]], a recovering [[alcoholic]] who has often let her down. As the series progresses, however, Bette begins to support Kit's attempts to turn her life around, and their relationship is shown to improve.\n\nTina's miscarriage takes a toll on Bette, and when her partner decides to become involved in a charitable organization, Bette finds that their careers make it almost impossible for them to spend any time together or have sex. At the same time, she finds herself attracted to Candace Jewell, who is temporarily working as a carpenter at the CAC. Bette tries to resist this attraction at first, but is unable to do so when Candace, despite knowing of Bette's relationship, makes a pass at her. Bette subsequently begins an affair with Candace to fulfill her desires. When Tina discovers what is going on, she flies into a rage and, in the ensuing fight, Bette desperately tries to earn Tina's forgiveness by raping her, but Tina leaves Bette and moves out.\n\n===Season two===\nIn the second season, Bette resumes her affair with Candace, but soon becomes desperate to make amends for her betrayal, and finds that her break-up with Tina is disrupting all other elements of her life. Her job becomes an increasing pressure, especially when Tina's new lover, [[Helena Peabody]], is added to the Board of Directors, and her boss hires another curator who threatens Bette's elevated position. However, Tina refuses to forgive Bette, insinuating that she is only trying to mend their relationship because Candace is not sexually fulfilling enough for her.\n\nAt first, Bette feels isolated from Alice (who hypocritically accuses Bette of being a \"sex-addict\" while she herself is having an affair with Dana, who is engaged to be married) and the others, who she feels have mainly taken Tina's side in their argument rather than remain neutral. Although Shane and [[Jenny Schecter|Jenny]] are both supportive of her (mostly because of both Shane and Jenny, also both promiscuous, having cheated on their lovers as well), it takes a while for Bette to feel on good terms with Alice again. After Tina begins to see Helena, however, the group appear to rally around Bette, who is now aware that Tina is pregnant again and has a great desire to raise their child together.\n\nMatters are further complicated when it is revealed that Bette's father Melvin is dying from advanced [[prostate cancer]], and is refusing treatment. A distraught Bette brings him home to die, so that he will not be trapped in a hospital, but this difficult experience leads her to reach out to Tina. Tina, who by now feels trapped by her relationship with Helena, grows closer to Bette again, and although Melvin never really blesses his daughter's homosexual relationship, he does once refer to Tina as 'Tina' rather than 'Miss Kennard' before he dies. His death is a great blow to Bette, who receives news of the loss of her job at Melvin's funeral.\n\nThough upset and furious, Bette continues to derive comfort from her improved relationship with Tina. Bette's relationship with Kit is also vastly improved in this season, with Kit being her main source of comfort at the beginning of the season. She helps Kit to take over [[The L Word|The Planet]] cafe, and begins actively involving herself in Kit's life. Eventually Tina chooses Bette over Helena, and the end of the season shows Tina asking to move back in with Bette. Tina's labor is surprisingly difficult, but their daughter Angelica is eventually born, and the end of the season shows Bette as calm and happy in her new family.\n\n===Season three===\nSix months later, Bette and Tina are feeling the stress of raising Angelica, Bette's unemployment and Tina going back to work for Helena at her film studio. Their relationship experiences difficulties yet again when Tina claims to have a renewed interest in men. Angry and hurt with her belief that Tina was merely experimenting with her for eight years, Bette has her move out. Bette briefly becomes a Buddhist and goes on a silent retreat, but leaves it. In the meantime, Tina begins a relationship with a divorced father, Henry Young. When Henry's son Mikey innocently asks Bette to take a \"family picture\" of himself and Henry with Tina and Angelica, and Tina tells Bette to her face that she no longer wants Bette to adopt Angelica and that she and Henry are going to start a family with the implication that Henry will adopt Angelica, Bette comes to the realization that Tina is only using Henry and Mikey so that she will get full custody of Angelica when she and Bette separate, as she is Angelica's biological mother and deliberately ingratiating herself in what Bette calls the \"safety of a white heterosexual family\", after which she will leave Henry. Desperate not to lose Angelica, Bette hires Joyce Wishnea, a gay civil rights lawyer, in order to file for sole custody, and warns Tina to stop her farce with Henry. This time, most of their friends rally behind Bette, seeing Tina as a traitor to the LGBT community for using her sexuality and the country's homophobic legal system against Bette. Tina, however, stands her ground and considers the possibility of losing all of her friends as the \"bravest thing she has ever done\".\n\nAt [[Shane McCutcheon|Shane]] and [[Carmen de la Pica Morales|Carmen]]'s wedding, Bette begins to have second thoughts about this, but when Tina gets Joyce's letter and begins to take action to separate Bette from Angelica forever, Bette kidnaps Angelica and runs away.\n\n===Season four===\nAfter being implored by her friends, Bette returns with Angelica, and Joyce persuades her and Tina to reach an agreement themselves on the basis that the homophobic court will most likely put Angelica up for adoption or into a heterosexual foster family instead of granting either of them custody. Soon after, Bette becomes the dean of art at a university. Her sexually frustrated boss, [[Phyllis Kroll]], confesses to her that she is a lesbian, despite having a husband, Leonard. Later on, Bette introduces Phyllis to her group of friends, aware that she will end up having sex with one of them; despite their age gap, Phyllis meets and has an affair with Alice, but falls madly in love with her, which makes Bette feel uncomfortable, particularly when Alice refuses to commit to Phyllis and Bette gets caught in the middle. In desperation, Bette puts Phyllis in contact with Joyce to help her divorce Leonard, aware of Joyce's [[Attorney misconduct|reputation for sleeping with her clients]]. Her plan works and Phyllis and Joyce begin a relationship, though Joyce is forced to recuse herself from representing Phyllis when it becomes more serious.\n\nWhile working at the California University School of the Arts as a dean, Bette has an affair with one of her graduate students, Nadia, but soon breaks off the relationship because she realizes it's inappropriate. Then, she begins a sexual relationship with [[Jodi Lerner]], a sculptor who has begun lecturing at the university. Tina and Bette's relationship initially goes through some rough patches, but they gradually become friendlier with each other. Tina confesses to Bette that she still loves her and that she misses her life as a lesbian; when she meets Jodi, Tina realizes how much she wants Bette back and begins to regret ending her relationship with Bette.\n\nTina learns of an affair between Angus (Kit's boyfriend) and Tina's nanny, Hazel, and she informs Bette. This causes major stress to their relationship, as Bette wants to keep this information from her sister and Tina disagrees. Things become even more complicated after a disastrous dinner party, thrown by Bette for Jodi, where she learns Kit\u2014a recovering alcoholic\u2014is drinking again to deal with Angus's [[infidelity]]. Because of Bette's reaction to her sister's drinking, Bette and Jodi get into a heated argument. As a result of the argument, Jodi realizes that Bette's controlling ways are too much for her and takes a job offer in [[New York City]]. In the season finale, Bette, with some encouragement from Tina and help from Alice and Shane, steals a \"17 Reasons Why\" sign from an old building in hopes of getting Jodi back, as Jodi had once told her that she believed it would make a great art piece. She shows it to Jodi, who is touched enough that she decides to remain in Los Angeles with Bette.\n\n===Season five===\nAt the beginning of the fifth season, Bette and Jodi's relationship seems very loving to their friends. However, it doesn't take long before the problems begin to show. When Jodi insists on bringing Bette on her annual vacation with her close friends, Bette finds herself annoyed and upset with Jodi and her friend's activities.\n\nThough Bette continues her relationship with Jodi, she begins to long for the life she shared with Tina, particularly after Tina starts to manipulate Bette by talking about their past life and bragging about her affairs with other women. Bette soon succumbs to Tina's hints and they begin an affair, though they both claim to be unsure if they want anything more than their sexual reconnection. To manipulate Bette further out of sadness and longing, Tina begins a flirtation with Sam, a woman who works on the set of Lez Girls. Due to her own jealousy, Bette becomes angry with Jodi when Jodi decides to have a dinner party and invites Tina and Sam. When Jodi confronts Bette about their distance emotionally and sexually, Bette cannot bring herself to admit that she is still in love with Tina. During rolling blackouts, Bette and Tina are trapped in an elevator on the way to their couples therapy session. During their time in the elevator, Bette and Tina discuss their fears about their relationship and end up making love, during which Bette tells Tina she still loves her, even though Tina was once prepared to destroy their relationship for good through Henry. Bette also reveals to Tina she wants to tell Jodi about their reunion after the Subaru Pink Ride.\n\nMeanwhile, Jodi sees Bette is moody and upset about something but is not sure. By this time, Jodi has resigned from California University after one of her students held a realistic-looking gun made of [[soapstone]] to his head in front of the class as a form of art. While on their Subaru Pink Ride, Jodi learns of the affair during a game of 'I Never' when Alice drunkenly begins calling Bette a \"giant and 'gi-normous' cheater\" for having cheated on Tina and on Alice herself when they were dating. This statement leads Jodi to jokingly ask if Bette is cheating on her. When Bette doesn't respond and Tina gets up and runs away from the group, Jodi finally realizes that Bette is cheating on her and most likely never truly loved her from the start. In private, Kit verbally blasts Bette for her actions, reminding her of Tina's callous behavior while she was with Henry, but Bette confesses that, even though Tina was ready to take their daughter away from her forever, she loves and has always loved Tina, and that she and Jodi \"never had a shot\", effectively confirming that she was merely using Jodi sexually and never loved her.\n\nAfter the truth is revealed, Jodi returns to Bette and completely brushes off Tina. Bette takes Jodi to her house trying to talk things over but Jodi is adamant to get Bette back anyhow, leading to force her to have sex with her. Bette finally pushes her away and they agree to clarify things in Bette's office. It is here that Bette tells Jodi that their relationship will not work because Tina is her true love. Jodi concedes and leaves without further fight. She retrieves her personal items from Bette's place and leaves Bette an early birthday present. At the end of that eventful day, Bette joins Tina and takes both Angelica and Tina back home.\n\nWith her real admiration for Jodi, Bette introduces Jodi at the public exhibition of a new Jodi Lerner piece, entitled \"Core.\" However, it instead turns out to be Jodi's spiteful revenge against Bette for using her: a series of videos of a single Bette saying \"I love you\", as well as things like \"Leave me alone\", \"Go without me\", \"Stop\", and \"Fuck me\", ridiculing Bette for her promiscuity and willingness to use anyone sexually. After the shocking public humiliation, Bette returns to find solace in Tina. Later, Bette and Tina go to ''Lez Girls'' wrap party where their reunion and display of affection is admired by their friends. The sensual dance shows their love and affection for each other, which, their friends when noticing, concur that they have always belonged together.\n\n===Season six===\nTina moves back in with Bette, and they decide to adopt a second child. In preparation, they begin to add an expensive extension to their house.\n\nThe pair finally meet the birth-mother Marci in Nevada, an underprivileged Caucasian woman expecting a half African-American son. Despite the fact that Marci's family rejects the notion of giving the child to a lesbian couple, Marci agrees to give Tina and Bette her child. However, this transaction is threatened when Joyce Wischnia informs the pair that [[LGBT adoption|Nevada law does not permit adoption to same sex couples]]. A solution is reached when Bette and Tina agree to board Marci during her pregnancy, but when they arrive to the Los Angeles bus station to meet her, Marci is not on the bus, having for some reason backed out on the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, as tension continues between Bette and Jodi due to Bette's infidelity, Bette tries to force Jodi to resign and the matter is brought before Phyllis. Jodi refuses to resign and threatens legal action not only against Bette, but against the entire university should anyone fire her. Phyllis privately tries to convince Bette that Bette herself should resign instead, since she had already helped cover up a potential scandal involving Bette's brief fling with Nadia, and that any potential sexual harassment proceedings from Jodi would further endanger the university's reputation. Immediately afterwards, Phyllis makes a drunken pass at Bette at a bar, claiming she was always strongly attracted to her and can now pursue a relationship with her since Bette is no longer her employee, even if it means leaving Joyce. Finally fed up with Phyllis' sexual desperation, Bette rejects her advances and submits her resignation from the university.\n\nBette later reconnects with her bisexual college crush Kelly Wentworth ([[Elizabeth Berkley]]), and the pair open an art gallery together. While Bette had strong feelings for Kelly in college to the point where she was on the brink of suicide when Kelly rejected her, she now seems quite capable of remaining committed to Tina despite the newly divorced Kelly's constant flirtations with her. Tina, however, subtly voices her lack of trust in Bette, especially after Kelly claims that Bette was a \"player\" during their college days, and starts to fear that Bette will eventually cheat on her again. When a drunken Kelly finally makes a pass at Bette in Bette's house, Bette soundly rejects her, but the pair remain on friendly terms. Then Kelly accidentally breaks a glass, and Bette helps her pick up the shards. An on-looking Jenny mistakes this activity for a sexual moment between the pair, and captures it on her cellphone camera. Later, an angry Jenny threatens Bette that she will expose the footage to Tina if Bette does not first confess her \"umpteenth indiscretion\" to Tina.\n\nWhen Tina gets a job offer in New York, she and Bette decide to relocate there and start a new life. Bette is more than happy to do this, partially to escape from the claustrophobic bubble of Los Angeles lesbian intrigue and partially to escape Jenny. She confides all of this to Kit, including Jenny's misconception. While in bed, Bette proposes to Tina, who accepts.\n\nAt Bette and Tina's going away party in their home, Kit threatens Jenny to back off and is in turn shown the incriminating cellphone footage. Kit next confronts Bette, believing the footage to be a valid display of infidelity. Learning about the footage, and knowing that both of their previous affairs with Candace, Jodi and Henry will very easily convince Tina (who by now no longer trusts Bette fully) that she has cheated on her again, Bette finally approaches Jenny with a clear, furious warning to back off. This confrontation is held near a banister with an unfinished railing, and it is the last time Jenny is shown alive. Her body is discovered in the pool shortly afterwards. The series ends with Bette and all her friends being interrogated by police, and the truth of Jenny's death unexplained.\n\n===The Interrogation Tapes===\nSeveral weeks after the television series ends, footage of Bette's police interrogation appears on Showtime's ''L Word'' website (\"The Interrogation Tapes\"). For some reason, this footage leaked onto [[YouTube]] first.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj_hbO8rXJY|title=''The L Word'' Bette Porter Interrogation|accessdate=2009-03-30 |publisher=Showtime/YouTube }}</ref>\nAlthough she does not divulge any information regarding Jenny's death, Bette confesses to being secretly angry and devastated by the fact that Tina never asked her to carry their second child (though it is left unrevealed why Bette herself did not suggest in it the first place).<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/interrogation.do |title=''The L Word'' Interrogation Tapes: Bette |accessdate=2009-03-30 |publisher=Showtime |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090629030202/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/interrogation.do |archivedate=2009-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Generation Q'' ===\nIn ''[[The L Word: Generation Q]]'', set over ten years after Jenny's death, Bette is shown to be running for Mayor of Los Angeles. It is revealed that during the last ten years, Bette and Tina did get married, but also got divorced after Tina left Bette for another woman, Carrie, with Bette getting at least partially custody of Angelica, who now lives with her. Her relationship with Angelica is shown to be somewhat strained, due to Angelica frequently skipping school in secret to spend time smoking cannabis with her friend Jordi. Bette's candidacy is briefly threatened, however, when she refuses campaign funding from Dani N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a PR executive for her father's company which invests in opioids, and when a man, Tyler Adams, openly accuses her of having previously had an affair with his wife Felicity, who at the time was one of Bette's employees, during one of her press conferences. In response, Bette appears on Alice's new talk show to tell her side of the story, and how despite being a biracial divorced lesbian, she essentially sees herself as an ordinary human being and only wants to make a difference to the world. Dani, whose fianc\u00e9 Sophie works for Alice, watches the broadcast and has a change of heart. After learning of the death of the son of one of her company's employees of an overdose, Dani offers to work for Bette, who accepts. On Dani's advice, Bette makes a public appearance for homeless and rejected members of the LGBT community to listen to their stories, and has a meeting with Felicity Adams in order to save her image from further scandal. In the process, Bette reveals to Dani her previous scandals such as her infidelities with both Tina and Jodi, her conflict with Faye Buckley which resulted in her spending one night in jail, and Jenny committing suicide in her swimming pool. In the meantime, Bette meets with Felicity in private at a park, and it is apparent that the two still have feelings for one another. Further trouble arises when Angie gets into a fight at school when one of her racist and homophobic classmates makes remarks about Bette; Angie is suspended by the homophobic school while her classmate is unpunished. Bette brings the subject up in her next mayoral conference and wins a grant from the education board, but at the same time resumes her affair with Felicity, jeopordizing her candidacy even further. Dani confronts Bette over the issue after seeing Felicity enter her bedroom and catching Bette with Felicity's phone, which she had taken by accident, but Bette reveals to Dani that her reason for running for Mayor is Kit's death from a heroin overdose, and that Felicity was the only one who comforted her in the aftermath. Later on, Bette celebrates Shane's 40th birthday at Shane's new gay bar, \"Dana's\". After further pushing from Dani, Bette ends her affair with Felicity, and later attends Angelica's school play. After the play, however, she is confronted by Tyler Adams and the press again, tipped off by a vengeful Felicity (who had actually taken advantage of Kit's death to have an affair with Bette and escape her false heterosexual life with Tyler, while never having any real feelings for Bette), and a scuffle ensues when Tyler tries to hit Angelica but is instead knocked to the ground and injured by Bette, threatening her campaign again. Distraught, Bette prepares to drop out, but is visited by Tina, who was called by Angelica, for support. Bette and Tina reminisce about their past experiences, though Bette remains bitter over Tina abandoning her and not even attending Kit's funeral. Finally, Bette is told by Dani that Tyler will not press charges as long as Bette publicly apologizes, but Bette refuses, on the basis that Tyler started the fight and she was merely defending her daughter, and instead makes a public statement, finally revealing that her reason for running for Mayor was due to Kit's heroin overdose which stemmed from a car accident that left her dependent on opioids, since the hospital, as a favour to the pharmaceutical companies running the country, deliberately did not ask Kit if she had a history of addiction. After the speech, Bette and Tina admit that to a certain degree, they still love each other, and share an embrace, during which Bette asks Tina not to leave. A while later, while at \"Dana's\", Tina asks Bette to dinner. At Bette's house, over dinner, Tina tells Bette that she is moving to Los Angeles. Hoping to rekindle their relationship despite Tina's past manipulative and abusive behavior, Bette invites Tina to move in for the time being, but Tina reveals that she and Carrie are getting married and are moving together in order to be closer to Angelica, and that she wants the three of them to tell Angelica together. Though visibly devastated by the fact that she has lost Tina forever, Bette gives Tina her blessing. Meanwhile, Bette's rival candidate, Jeff Milner, posts a homophobic advert on the internet denouncing Bette as a womanizer with no family values. Despite this, Bette refuses to give up and shares a drink with Dani. Bette ultimately loses the election to Milner, but later learns that Milner wants her to spearhead a campaign investigating the opioid crisis. However, Bette is informed by Dani that she is being set up, and Milner had long-since made a deal with Dani's father for opioid production. In her depression, Bette goes with Angie to the place Kit's ashes were scattered and meets one of the reporters covering her campaign, Maya, who invites her on a dinner date. Bette accepts Maya's invitation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Kera Bolonik, ''The L Word: Welcome to Our Planet''.

She grew up in Philadelphia and was an art history major at Yale, where she notably had sex with her boyfriend, Coleman. They both realized they were [[gay]] shortly after, with Bette developing a crush on her art history professor, Danica Palmer (''Lifesize: 306''). Eventually, she [[came out]] as a lesbian, and fell for her bisexual friend, Kelly. After Kelly rejected her advances, Bette grew depressed to the brink of suicide.\n\nAfter graduation, Bette moved on, and dated [[Alice Pieszecki]] briefly. Bette once [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingered]] Alice while they were at the opera ''[[Lakm\u00e9]]'' (during ''[[The Flower Duet]]''). They remained close friends after they broke up.\n\nBette met her future partner, [[Tina Kennard|Tina]], while Tina was on a date at the Bette Porter Gallery with her then-boyfriend Eric. An instant attraction formed between the two of them. Bette noticed Tina's right earring had fallen off, and Tina supposedly put it back on. Later that night, Tina returned to the gallery to retrieve the lost earring. Bette had kept it for her. While Tina was picking it from her hand, Bette kissed her.\n\n===Season one===\n\nBette and Tina's relationship appears to their friends as very strong. Tina confirms to their closest friends that Bette is her \"first, last, and forever\" love. However, from the very beginning they seem to have problems, and even as they attempt to start a family, it is revealed that they no longer make love. Although they seem to move past this problem as the series progresses, Bette's career in the California Arts Center is shown to come between them, with Bette frequently not having time to spend with Tina.\n \nAt Bette's urging, Tina gives up her own career in order to have a child, leaving Bette as the sole breadwinner. Bette has a difficult family life, with her father Melvin only barely tolerating her relationship with Tina, and flatly refusing to acknowledge Tina's baby as his grandchild. Bette is also shown to be very bossy and domineering with Tina and everyone else. Throughout the entire series, Bette has a reputation for throwing fits and tantrums in public and private when things do not go her way.\n\nIn addition, Bette at first has a difficult relationship with her older half-sister [[Kit Porter|Kit]], a recovering [[alcoholic]] who has often let her down. As the series progresses, however, Bette begins to support Kit's attempts to turn her life around, and their relationship is shown to improve.\n\nTina's miscarriage takes a toll on Bette, and when her partner decides to become involved in a charitable organization, Bette finds that their careers make it almost impossible for them to spend any time together or have sex. At the same time, she finds herself attracted to Candace Jewell, who is temporarily working as a carpenter at the CAC. Bette tries to resist this attraction at first, but is unable to do so when Candace, despite knowing of Bette's relationship, makes a pass at her. Bette subsequently begins an affair with Candace to fulfill her desires. When Tina discovers what is going on, she flies into a rage and, in the ensuing fight, Bette desperately tries to earn Tina's forgiveness by raping her, but Tina leaves Bette and moves out.\n\n===Season two===\nIn the second season, Bette resumes her affair with Candace, but soon becomes desperate to make amends for her betrayal, and finds that her break-up with Tina is disrupting all other elements of her life. Her job becomes an increasing pressure, especially when Tina's new lover, [[Helena Peabody]], is added to the Board of Directors, and her boss hires another curator who threatens Bette's elevated position. However, Tina refuses to forgive Bette, insinuating that she is only trying to mend their relationship because Candace is not sexually fulfilling enough for her.\n\nAt first, Bette feels isolated from Alice (who hypocritically accuses Bette of being a \"sex-addict\" while she herself is having an affair with Dana, who is engaged to be married) and the others, who she feels have mainly taken Tina's side in their argument rather than remain neutral. Although Shane and [[Jenny Schecter|Jenny]] are both supportive of her (mostly because of both Shane and Jenny, also both promiscuous, having cheated on their lovers as well), it takes a while for Bette to feel on good terms with Alice again. After Tina begins to see Helena, however, the group appear to rally around Bette, who is now aware that Tina is pregnant again and has a great desire to raise their child together.\n\nMatters are further complicated when it is revealed that Bette's father Melvin is dying from advanced [[prostate cancer]], and is refusing treatment. A distraught Bette brings him home to die, so that he will not be trapped in a hospital, but this difficult experience leads her to reach out to Tina. Tina, who by now feels trapped by her relationship with Helena, grows closer to Bette again, and although Melvin never really blesses his daughter's homosexual relationship, he does once refer to Tina as 'Tina' rather than 'Miss Kennard' before he dies. His death is a great blow to Bette, who receives news of the loss of her job at Melvin's funeral.\n\nThough upset and furious, Bette continues to derive comfort from her improved relationship with Tina. Bette's relationship with Kit is also vastly improved in this season, with Kit being her main source of comfort at the beginning of the season. She helps Kit to take over [[The L Word|The Planet]] cafe, and begins actively involving herself in Kit's life. Eventually Tina chooses Bette over Helena, and the end of the season shows Tina asking to move back in with Bette. Tina's labor is surprisingly difficult, but their daughter Angelica is eventually born, and the end of the season shows Bette as calm and happy in her new family.\n\n===Season three===\nSix months later, Bette and Tina are feeling the stress of raising Angelica, Bette's unemployment and Tina going back to work for Helena at her film studio. Their relationship experiences difficulties yet again when Tina claims to have a renewed interest in men. Angry and hurt with her belief that Tina was merely experimenting with her for eight years, Bette has her move out. Bette briefly becomes a Buddhist and goes on a silent retreat, but leaves it. In the meantime, Tina begins a relationship with a divorced father, Henry Young. When Henry's son Mikey innocently asks Bette to take a \"family picture\" of himself and Henry with Tina and Angelica, and Tina tells Bette to her face that she no longer wants Bette to adopt Angelica and that she and Henry are going to start a family with the implication that Henry will adopt Angelica, Bette comes to the realization that Tina is only using Henry and Mikey so that she will get full custody of Angelica when she and Bette separate, as she is Angelica's biological mother and deliberately ingratiating herself in what Bette calls the \"safety of a white heterosexual family\", after which she will leave Henry. Desperate not to lose Angelica, Bette hires Joyce Wishnea, a gay civil rights lawyer, in order to file for sole custody, and warns Tina to stop her farce with Henry. This time, most of their friends rally behind Bette, seeing Tina as a traitor to the LGBT community for using her sexuality and the country's homophobic legal system against Bette. Tina, however, stands her ground and considers the possibility of losing all of her friends as the \"bravest thing she has ever done\".\n\nAt [[Shane McCutcheon|Shane]] and [[Carmen de la Pica Morales|Carmen]]'s wedding, Bette begins to have second thoughts about this, but when Tina gets Joyce's letter and begins to take action to separate Bette from Angelica forever, Bette kidnaps Angelica and runs away.\n\n===Season four===\nAfter being implored by her friends, Bette returns with Angelica, and Joyce persuades her and Tina to reach an agreement themselves on the basis that the homophobic court will most likely put Angelica up for adoption or into a heterosexual foster family instead of granting either of them custody. Soon after, Bette becomes the dean of art at a university. Her sexually frustrated boss, [[Phyllis Kroll]], confesses to her that she is a lesbian, despite having a husband, Leonard. Later on, Bette introduces Phyllis to her group of friends, aware that she will end up having sex with one of them; despite their age gap, Phyllis meets and has an affair with Alice, but falls madly in love with her, which makes Bette feel uncomfortable, particularly when Alice refuses to commit to Phyllis and Bette gets caught in the middle. In desperation, Bette puts Phyllis in contact with Joyce to help her divorce Leonard, aware of Joyce's [[Attorney misconduct|reputation for sleeping with her clients]]. Her plan works and Phyllis and Joyce begin a relationship, though Joyce is forced to recuse herself from representing Phyllis when it becomes more serious.\n\nWhile working at the California University School of the Arts as a dean, Bette has an affair with one of her graduate students, Nadia, but soon breaks off the relationship because she realizes it's inappropriate. Then, she begins a sexual relationship with [[Jodi Lerner]], a sculptor who has begun lecturing at the university. Tina and Bette's relationship initially goes through some rough patches, but they gradually become friendlier with each other. Tina confesses to Bette that she still loves her and that she misses her life as a lesbian; when she meets Jodi, Tina realizes how much she wants Bette back and begins to regret ending her relationship with Bette.\n\nTina learns of an affair between Angus (Kit's boyfriend) and Tina's nanny, Hazel, and she informs Bette. This causes major stress to their relationship, as Bette wants to keep this information from her sister and Tina disagrees. Things become even more complicated after a disastrous dinner party, thrown by Bette for Jodi, where she learns Kit\u2014a recovering alcoholic\u2014is drinking again to deal with Angus's [[infidelity]]. Because of Bette's reaction to her sister's drinking, Bette and Jodi get into a heated argument. As a result of the argument, Jodi realizes that Bette's controlling ways are too much for her and takes a job offer in [[New York City]]. In the season finale, Bette, with some encouragement from Tina and help from Alice and Shane, steals a \"17 Reasons Why\" sign from an old building in hopes of getting Jodi back, as Jodi had once told her that she believed it would make a great art piece. She shows it to Jodi, who is touched enough that she decides to remain in Los Angeles with Bette.\n\n===Season five===\nAt the beginning of the fifth season, Bette and Jodi's relationship seems very loving to their friends. However, it doesn't take long before the problems begin to show. When Jodi insists on bringing Bette on her annual vacation with her close friends, Bette finds herself annoyed and upset with Jodi and her friend's activities.\n\nThough Bette continues her relationship with Jodi, she begins to long for the life she shared with Tina, particularly after Tina starts to manipulate Bette by talking about their past life and bragging about her affairs with other women. Bette soon succumbs to Tina's hints and they begin an affair, though they both claim to be unsure if they want anything more than their sexual reconnection. To manipulate Bette further out of sadness and longing, Tina begins a flirtation with Sam, a woman who works on the set of Lez Girls. Due to her own jealousy, Bette becomes angry with Jodi when Jodi decides to have a dinner party and invites Tina and Sam. When Jodi confronts Bette about their distance emotionally and sexually, Bette cannot bring herself to admit that she is still in love with Tina. During rolling blackouts, Bette and Tina are trapped in an elevator on the way to their couples therapy session. During their time in the elevator, Bette and Tina discuss their fears about their relationship and end up making love, during which Bette tells Tina she still loves her, even though Tina was once prepared to destroy their relationship for good through Henry. Bette also reveals to Tina she wants to tell Jodi about their reunion after the Subaru Pink Ride.\n\nMeanwhile, Jodi sees Bette is moody and upset about something but is not sure. By this time, Jodi has resigned from California University after one of her students held a realistic-looking gun made of [[soapstone]] to his head in front of the class as a form of art. While on their Subaru Pink Ride, Jodi learns of the affair during a game of 'I Never' when Alice drunkenly begins calling Bette a \"giant and 'gi-normous' cheater\" for having cheated on Tina and on Alice herself when they were dating. This statement leads Jodi to jokingly ask if Bette is cheating on her. When Bette doesn't respond and Tina gets up and runs away from the group, Jodi finally realizes that Bette is cheating on her and most likely never truly loved her from the start. In private, Kit verbally blasts Bette for her actions, reminding her of Tina's callous behavior while she was with Henry, but Bette confesses that, even though Tina was ready to take their daughter away from her forever, she loves and has always loved Tina, and that she and Jodi \"never had a shot\", effectively confirming that she was merely using Jodi sexually and never loved her.\n\nAfter the truth is revealed, Jodi returns to Bette and completely brushes off Tina. Bette takes Jodi to her house trying to talk things over but Jodi is adamant to get Bette back anyhow, leading to force her to have sex with her. Bette finally pushes her away and they agree to clarify things in Bette's office. It is here that Bette tells Jodi that their relationship will not work because Tina is her true love. Jodi concedes and leaves without further fight. She retrieves her personal items from Bette's place and leaves Bette an early birthday present. At the end of that eventful day, Bette joins Tina and takes both Angelica and Tina back home.\n\nWith her real admiration for Jodi, Bette introduces Jodi at the public exhibition of a new Jodi Lerner piece, entitled \"Core.\" However, it instead turns out to be Jodi's spiteful revenge against Bette for using her: a series of videos of a single Bette saying \"I love you\", as well as things like \"Leave me alone\", \"Go without me\", \"Stop\", and \"Fuck me\", ridiculing Bette for her promiscuity and willingness to use anyone sexually. After the shocking public humiliation, Bette returns to find solace in Tina. Later, Bette and Tina go to ''Lez Girls'' wrap party where their reunion and display of affection is admired by their friends. The sensual dance shows their love and affection for each other, which, their friends when noticing, concur that they have always belonged together.\n\n===Season six===\nTina moves back in with Bette, and they decide to adopt a second child. In preparation, they begin to add an expensive extension to their house.\n\nThe pair finally meet the birth-mother Marci in Nevada, an underprivileged Caucasian woman expecting a half African-American son. Despite the fact that Marci's family rejects the notion of giving the child to a lesbian couple, Marci agrees to give Tina and Bette her child. However, this transaction is threatened when Joyce Wischnia informs the pair that [[LGBT adoption|Nevada law does not permit adoption to same sex couples]]. A solution is reached when Bette and Tina agree to board Marci during her pregnancy, but when they arrive to the Los Angeles bus station to meet her, Marci is not on the bus, having for some reason backed out on the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, as tension continues between Bette and Jodi due to Bette's infidelity, Bette tries to force Jodi to resign and the matter is brought before Phyllis. Jodi refuses to resign and threatens legal action not only against Bette, but against the entire university should anyone fire her. Phyllis privately tries to convince Bette that Bette herself should resign instead, since she had already helped cover up a potential scandal involving Bette's brief fling with Nadia, and that any potential sexual harassment proceedings from Jodi would further endanger the university's reputation. Immediately afterwards, Phyllis makes a drunken pass at Bette at a bar, claiming she was always strongly attracted to her and can now pursue a relationship with her since Bette is no longer her employee, even if it means leaving Joyce. Finally fed up with Phyllis' sexual desperation, Bette rejects her advances and submits her resignation from the university.\n\nBette later reconnects with her bisexual college crush Kelly Wentworth ([[Elizabeth Berkley]]), and the pair open an art gallery together. While Bette had strong feelings for Kelly in college to the point where she was on the brink of suicide when Kelly rejected her, she now seems quite capable of remaining committed to Tina despite the newly divorced Kelly's constant flirtations with her. Tina, however, subtly voices her lack of trust in Bette, especially after Kelly claims that Bette was a \"player\" during their college days, and starts to fear that Bette will eventually cheat on her again. When a drunken Kelly finally makes a pass at Bette in Bette's house, Bette soundly rejects her, but the pair remain on friendly terms. Then Kelly accidentally breaks a glass, and Bette helps her pick up the shards. An on-looking Jenny mistakes this activity for a sexual moment between the pair, and captures it on her cellphone camera. Later, an angry Jenny threatens Bette that she will expose the footage to Tina if Bette does not first confess her \"umpteenth indiscretion\" to Tina.\n\nWhen Tina gets a job offer in New York, she and Bette decide to relocate there and start a new life. Bette is more than happy to do this, partially to escape from the claustrophobic bubble of Los Angeles lesbian intrigue and partially to escape Jenny. She confides all of this to Kit, including Jenny's misconception. While in bed, Bette proposes to Tina, who accepts.\n\nAt Bette and Tina's going away party in their home, Kit threatens Jenny to back off and is in turn shown the incriminating cellphone footage. Kit next confronts Bette, believing the footage to be a valid display of infidelity. Learning about the footage, and knowing that both of their previous affairs with Candace, Jodi and Henry will very easily convince Tina (who by now no longer trusts Bette fully) that she has cheated on her again, Bette finally approaches Jenny with a clear, furious warning to back off. This confrontation is held near a banister with an unfinished railing, and it is the last time Jenny is shown alive. Her body is discovered in the pool shortly afterwards. The series ends with Bette and all her friends being interrogated by police, and the truth of Jenny's death unexplained.\n\n===The Interrogation Tapes===\nSeveral weeks after the television series ends, footage of Bette's police interrogation appears on Showtime's ''L Word'' website (\"The Interrogation Tapes\"). For some reason, this footage leaked onto [[YouTube]] first.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj_hbO8rXJY|title=''The L Word'' Bette Porter Interrogation|accessdate=2009-03-30 |publisher=Showtime/YouTube }}</ref>\nAlthough she does not divulge any information regarding Jenny's death, Bette confesses to being secretly angry and devastated by the fact that Tina never asked her to carry their second child (though it is left unrevealed why Bette herself did not suggest in it the first place).<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/interrogation.do |title=''The L Word'' Interrogation Tapes: Bette |accessdate=2009-03-30 |publisher=Showtime |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090629030202/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/interrogation.do |archivedate=2009-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Generation Q'' ===\nIn ''[[The L Word: Generation Q]]'', set over ten years after Jenny's death, Bette is shown to be running for Mayor of Los Angeles. It is revealed that during the last ten years, Bette and Tina did get married, but also got divorced after Tina left Bette for another woman, Carrie, with Bette getting at least partially custody of Angelica, who now lives with her. Her relationship with Angelica is shown to be somewhat strained, due to Angelica frequently skipping school in secret to spend time smoking cannabis with her friend Jordi. Bette's candidacy is briefly threatened, however, when she refuses campaign funding from Dani N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a PR executive for her father's company which invests in opioids, and when a man, Tyler Adams, openly accuses her of having previously had an affair with his wife Felicity, who at the time was one of Bette's employees, during one of her press conferences. In response, Bette appears on Alice's new talk show to tell her side of the story, and how despite being a biracial divorced lesbian, she essentially sees herself as an ordinary human being and only wants to make a difference to the world. Dani, whose fiance Sophie works for Alice, watches the broadcast and has a change of heart. After learning of the death of the son of one of her company's employees of an overdose, Dani offers to work for Bette, who accepts. On Dani's advice, Bette makes a public appearance for homeless and rejected members of the LGBT community to listen to their stories, and has a meeting with Felicity Adams in order to save her image from further scandal. In the process, Bette reveals to Dani her previous scandals such as her infidelities with both Tina and Jodi, her conflict with Faye Buckley which resulted in her spending one night in jail, and Jenny committing suicide in her swimming pool. In the meantime, Bette meets with Felicity in private at a park, and it is apparent that the two still have feelings for one another. Further trouble arises when Angie gets into a fight at school when one of her racist and homophobic classmates makes remarks about Bette; Angie is suspended by the homophobic school while her classmate is unpunished. Bette brings the subject up in her next mayoral conference and wins a grant from the education board, but at the same time resumes her affair with Felicity, jeopordizing her candidacy even further. Dani confronts Bette over the issue after seeing Felicity enter her bedroom and catching Bette with Felicity's phone, which she had taken by accident, but Bette reveals to Dani that her reason for running for Mayor is Kit's death from a heroin overdose, and that Felicity was the only one who comforted her in the aftermath. Later on, Bette celebrates Shane's 40th birthday at Shane's new gay bar, \"Dana's\". After further pushing from Dani, Bette ends her affair with Felicity, and later attends Angelica's school play. After the play, however, she is confronted by Tyler Adams and the press again, tipped off by a vengeful Felicity (who had actually taken advantage of Kit's death to have an affair with Bette and escape her false heterosexual life with Tyler, while never having any real feelings for Bette), and a scuffle ensues when Tyler tries to hit Angelica but is instead knocked to the ground and injured by Bette, threatening her campaign again. Distraught, Bette prepares to drop out, but is visited by Tina, who was called by Angelica, for support. Bette and Tina reminisce about their past experiences, though Bette remains bitter over Tina abandoning her and not even attending Kit's funeral. Finally, Bette is told by Dani that Tyler will not press charges as long as Bette publicly apologizes, but Bette refuses, on the basis that Tyler started the fight and she was merely defending her daughter, and instead makes a public statement, finally revealing that her reason for running for Mayor was due to Kit's heroin overdose which stemmed from a car accident that left her dependent on opioids, since the hospital, as a favour to the pharmaceutical companies running the country, deliberately did not ask Kit if she had a history of addiction. After the speech, Bette and Tina admit that to a certain degree, they still love each other, and share an embrace, during which Bette asks Tina not to leave. A while later, while at \"Dana's\", Tina asks Bette to dinner. At Bette's house, over dinner, Tina tells Bette that she is moving to Los Angeles. Hoping to rekindle their relationship despite Tina's past manipulative and abusive behavior, Bette invites Tina to move in for the time being, but Tina reveals that she and Carrie are getting married and are moving together in order to be closer to Angelica, and that she wants the three of them to tell Angelica together. Though visibly devastated by the fact that she has lost Tina forever, Bette gives Tina her blessing. Meanwhile, Bette's rival candidate, Jeff Milner, posts a homophobic advert on the internet denouncing Bette as a womanizer with no family values. Despite this, Bette refuses to give up and shares a drink with Dani. Bette ultimately loses the election to Milner, but later learns that Milner wants her to spearhead a campaign investigating the opioid crisis. However, Bette is informed by Dani that she is being set up, and Milner had long-since made a deal with Dani's father for opioid production. In her depression, Bette goes with Angie to the place Kit's ashes were scattered and meets one of the reporters covering her campaign, Maya, who invites her on a dinner date. Bette accepts Maya's invitation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Kera Bolonik, ''The L Word: Welcome to Our Planet''.

It intends to measure the '''state of dankiness''' in 167 countries, of which 166 are [[sovereign state]]s and 164 are [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]].\n\nThe index was first published in 2006, with updates for 2008, 2010 and later years. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories, measuring [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[civil liberties]] and [[political culture]]. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorises each country in one of four regime types: ''full democracies'', ''flawed democracies'', ''[[hybrid regime]]s'' and ''authoritarian regimes''.\n\n==Method==\n{{Democracy}}\nAs described in the report,<ref name=\"index2012\" /> the [[democracy]] index is a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] based on the answers of 60 questions, each one with either two or three permitted alternative answers. Most answers are experts' assessments. Some answers are provided by public-opinion surveys from the respective countries. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing, survey results for similar countries, and expert assessments are used in order to fill in gaps.\n\nThe questions are grouped into five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture. Each answer is converted to a score, either 0 or 1, or for the three-answer questions, 0, 0.5 or 1. With the exceptions mentioned below, within each category, the scores are added, multiplied by ten, and divided by the total number of questions within the category. There are a few modifying dependencies, which are explained much more precisely than the main rule procedures. In a few cases, an answer yielding zero for one question voids another question; e.g. if the elections for the national legislature and head of government are not considered free (question 1), then the next question, \"''Are elections... fair?''\", is not considered, but automatically scored zero. Likewise, there are a few questions considered so important that a low score on them yields a penalty on the total score sum for their respective categories, namely:\n\n#\"Whether [[nation]]al [[election]]s are free and fair\";\n#\"The [[security]] of [[Voting|voters]]\";\n#\"The influence of foreign powers on government\";\n#\"The capability of the [[Civil service|civil servant]]s to implement policies\".\n\nThe five category indices, which are listed in the report, are then averaged to find the Democracy Index for a given country. Finally, the Democracy Index, [[rounding|rounded]] to two [[decimals]], decides the regime type classification of the country.\n\nThe report discusses other indices of democracy, as defined, e.g. by [[Freedom House]], and argues for some of the choices made by the team from the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. In this comparison, a higher emphasis is placed on the public opinion and attitudes, as measured by [[Survey (human research)|survey]]s, but on the other hand, economic living standards are not weighted as one criterion of democracy (as seemingly some other investigators have done).<ref name=\"index2010\" /><ref name=\"index2006\" />\n\nThe report is widely cited in the international press as well as in [[peer review]]ed academic journals.<ref>{{cite journal|last3=Manaev|first3=Oleg|last4=Manayeva|first4=Natalie|last5=Dzmitry|first5=Yuran|title=More State than Nation: Lukashenko's Belarus {{!}} JIA SIPA|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=1 December 2011|volume=65|issue=1|pages=93\u2013113|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|accessdate=26 January 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221152959/https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Classification definitions==\n'''[[Liberal democracy|Full democracies]]''' are nations where civil liberties and fundamental political freedoms are not only respected but also reinforced by a political culture conducive to the thriving of democratic principles. These nations have a valid system of governmental checks and balances, an independent judiciary whose decisions are enforced, governments that function adequately, and diverse and independent media. These nations have only limited problems in democratic functioning.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Illiberal democracy|Flawed democracies]]''' are nations where elections are fair and free and basic civil liberties are honoured but may have issues (e.g. media freedom infringement and minor suppression of political opposition and critics). These nations have significant faults in other democratic aspects, including underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Hybrid regime]]s''' are nations with regular [[electoral fraud]]s, preventing them from being fair and free democracy. These nations commonly have governments that apply pressure on political opposition, non-independent judiciaries, widespread corruption, harassment and pressure placed on the media, anaemic rule of law, and more pronounced faults than flawed democracies in the realms of underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Authoritarian regime]]s''' are nations where political pluralism has vanished or is extremely limited. These nations are often [[absolute monarchies]] or [[dictatorship]]s, may have some conventional institutions of democracy but with meagre significance, infringements and abuses of civil liberties are commonplace, elections (if they take place) are not fair and free, the media is often state-owned or controlled by groups associated with the ruling regime, the judiciary is not independent, and there are omnipresent censorship and suppression of governmental criticism.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n==Democracy Index by country 2019==\nListing by country is available on ''The Economist''

It intends to measure the '''state of democracy''' in 167 countries, of which 166 are [[sovereign state]]s and 164 are [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]].\n\nThe index was first published in 2006, with updates for 2008, 2010 and later years. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories, measuring [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[civil liberties]] and [[political culture]]. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorises each country in one of four regime types: ''full democracies'', ''flawed democracies'', ''[[hybrid regime]]s'' and ''authoritarian regimes''.\n\n==Method==\n{{Democracy}}\nAs described in the report,<ref name=\"index2012\" /> the [[democracy]] index is a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] based on the answers of 60 questions, each one with either two or three permitted alternative answers. Most answers are experts' assessments. Some answers are provided by public-opinion surveys from the respective countries. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing, survey results for similar countries, and expert assessments are used in order to fill in gaps.\n\nThe questions are grouped into five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture. Each answer is converted to a score, either 0 or 1, or for the three-answer questions, 0, 0.5 or 1. With the exceptions mentioned below, within each category, the scores are added, multiplied by ten, and divided by the total number of questions within the category. There are a few modifying dependencies, which are explained much more precisely than the main rule procedures. In a few cases, an answer yielding zero for one question voids another question; e.g. if the elections for the national legislature and head of government are not considered free (question 1), then the next question, \"''Are elections... fair?''\", is not considered, but automatically scored zero. Likewise, there are a few questions considered so important that a low score on them yields a penalty on the total score sum for their respective categories, namely:\n\n#\"Whether [[nation]]al [[election]]s are free and fair\";\n#\"The [[security]] of [[Voting|voters]]\";\n#\"The influence of foreign powers on government\";\n#\"The capability of the [[Civil service|civil servant]]s to implement policies\".\n\nThe five category indices, which are listed in the report, are then averaged to find the Democracy Index for a given country. Finally, the Democracy Index, [[rounding|rounded]] to two [[decimals]], decides the regime type classification of the country.\n\nThe report discusses other indices of democracy, as defined, e.g. by [[Freedom House]], and argues for some of the choices made by the team from the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]. In this comparison, a higher emphasis is placed on the public opinion and attitudes, as measured by [[Survey (human research)|survey]]s, but on the other hand, economic living standards are not weighted as one criterion of democracy (as seemingly some other investigators have done).<ref name=\"index2010\" /><ref name=\"index2006\" />\n\nThe report is widely cited in the international press as well as in [[peer review]]ed academic journals.<ref>{{cite journal|last3=Manaev|first3=Oleg|last4=Manayeva|first4=Natalie|last5=Dzmitry|first5=Yuran|title=More State than Nation: Lukashenko's Belarus {{!}} JIA SIPA|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=1 December 2011|volume=65|issue=1|pages=93\u2013113|url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|accessdate=26 January 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221152959/https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/more-state-nation-lukashenkos-belarus|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Classification definitions==\n'''[[Liberal democracy|Full democracies]]''' are nations where civil liberties and fundamental political freedoms are not only respected but also reinforced by a political culture conducive to the thriving of democratic principles. These nations have a valid system of governmental checks and balances, an independent judiciary whose decisions are enforced, governments that function adequately, and diverse and independent media. These nations have only limited problems in democratic functioning.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Illiberal democracy|Flawed democracies]]''' are nations where elections are fair and free and basic civil liberties are honoured but may have issues (e.g. media freedom infringement and minor suppression of political opposition and critics). These nations have significant faults in other democratic aspects, including underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Hybrid regime]]s''' are nations with regular [[electoral fraud]]s, preventing them from being fair and free democracy. These nations commonly have governments that apply pressure on political opposition, non-independent judiciaries, widespread corruption, harassment and pressure placed on the media, anaemic rule of law, and more pronounced faults than flawed democracies in the realms of underdeveloped political culture, low levels of participation in politics, and issues in the functioning of governance.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n'''[[Authoritarian regime]]s''' are nations where political pluralism has vanished or is extremely limited. These nations are often [[absolute monarchies]] or [[dictatorship]]s, may have some conventional institutions of democracy but with meagre significance, infringements and abuses of civil liberties are commonplace, elections (if they take place) are not fair and free, the media is often state-owned or controlled by groups associated with the ruling regime, the judiciary is not independent, and there are omnipresent censorship and suppression of governmental criticism.<ref name=\"index2015\" />\n\n==Democracy Index by country 2019==\nListing by country is available on ''The Economist''

''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #17 (February 2004). Art by [[Paul Azaceta]].]]\nAfter [[Genis-Vell]], then known as Captain Marvel, previously destroyed and recreated the universe, the \"new\" version was subtly altered with Phyla-Vell's existence being one of the changes. It is revealed that she is the second artificially created offspring of Captain Mar-Vell who was created by her mother [[Elysius]] in the \"new\" universe because her first attempt (Genis-Vell) had been so successful. Initially her origin conflicted with previously established storylines, but this is resolved in ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 4) #18 (February 2004).\n\nShe fights her brother Genis-Vell, who was insane at the time,<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 4 #17-18 (January\u2013February 2004)</ref> in the process helping to restore his sanity. She then tries to lay claim to the \"Captain Marvel\" title, though her brother refuses to give it up.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 4 #19 (March 2004)</ref> Phyla is next seen at the trial of [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #12-13, 2006</ref>\n\nThe ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 5) series heavily hinted that Phyla-Vell is a [[lesbian]], and in #25 (September 2004) the character admits that she is attracted to [[Moondragon]] and invites her on a tour of the \"[[spiral nebula]] near Renault VII\". Before Moondragon can accept the two wander through a portal.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 5 #25</ref>\n\n===Annihilation===\n{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}\nPhyla later appeared during ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' where she had been visiting her father's grave with Moondragon when the pair were attacked by [[Thanos]] who ripped off Moondragon's ear and gave it to Phyla, telling her to go to [[Drax the Destroyer]] and how his actions would determine Moondragon's fate shortly before teleporting away with Moondragon. Drax has indicated he will not be stopping his pursuit of Thanos.<ref>''Annihilation'' #2</ref>\n\nPhyla then goes with [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and [[Star-Lord]] to lead a final battle against [[Annihilus]], being saved at the last second by a massive energy wave caused by the just freed [[Galactus]], which left only the three heroes and Annihilus as survivors.  Ultimately in the battle, Phyla manages to steal away the [[quantum bands]] that Annihilus took from [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], weakening him and allowing Nova to finally bring an end to the Annihilation Wave.  She is then seen re-united with Moondragon, and deciding it's up to her to become the new Quasar.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6</ref>\n\n===Annihilation: Conquest&nbsp;\u2013 Quasar===\n{{See also|Annihilation: Conquest}}\nPhyla had her own mini-series as the new Quasar, stating July through October 2007, called ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]&nbsp;\u2013 Quasar''. The series was written by [[Christos Gage]] (who wrote ''[[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]]''), penciled by [[Mike Lilly]]. Phyla is finding it hard to follow the footsteps of the former Quasar and also to follow in the Mar-Vell family's footsteps. The story is a lot about her trying to handle this power, and seeing if she can contain it.  She's on a quest, and the object of the quest has real importance, not only to her, but to the entire storyline. Phylla and her lover Moondragon follow a voice to find the saviour for the [[Kree]] race who is attacked by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. In the end it turns out 'the voice' is the [[Supreme Intelligence]] of the Kree; thanks to the Supreme Intelligence they find a cocoon, in which [[Adam Warlock]] is restoring. The cocoon breaks open and Phyla and Moondragon ask Warlock to help them fight against the Phalanx. This story was continued in the main mini-series ''Annihilation: Conquest''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Back To Space In Marvel's Annihilation: Conquest|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=102941|website=[[Newsarama]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135443/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=102941|archivedate=September 29, 2007|date=February 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Guardians of the Galaxy===\n{{See also|Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)}}\nFollowing Annihilation, she joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #1</ref> While helping [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] search for Cammi, an Earth girl who he had taken into space before the Annihilation War, they consult a psychic to get a lead on Cammi's whereabouts only to be informed that Moondragon was trying to contact them.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #7</ref> They attempt to consult [[A'lars|Mentor]], who apparently kills them.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #9</ref> Mentor sends Phyla and Drax to [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]] where they encounter [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] and the [[Dragon of the Moon]].  After losing the Quantum Bands to Maelstrom Phyla is offered as a sacrifice to the Dragon so that Maelstrom can be in its good graces.  While inside the dragon she apparently makes a deal in exchange for Heather Douglas.  The dragon then releases them, with Phyla wearing a new red and black costume adorned with skulls and wielding a new sword, and they return to the world of the living where Phyla refuses to elaborate on the deal that she made with the Dragon.  It is later learned from Maelstrom that she agreed to become the new avatar of Oblivion.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #12</ref>\n\n===Martyr===\nNow calling herself Martyr, Phyla-Vell is a more abrasive and aggressive figure. When the Guardians attempted to negotiate with the Inhumans to stop the War of Kings, she ruined the attempt by taking [[Crystal (comics)|Inhuman princess Crystal]] hostage instead; this led to battle between the Inhumans and Guardians, while she continued to escalate.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #14</ref> Eventually, the Inhumans would try to end the war by detonating a weapon that shattered space itself, creating a multiversal Fault.<ref>''War of Kings'' #6</ref>\n\nWhen [[Adam Warlock]] stopped the Fault's growth by using a redundant timeline, one where he became the villainous [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], Phyla-Vell revealed that her deal with Oblivion was to kill \"the Avatar of Life\" and she'd know what to do when the time came. Knowing he would now become Magus, she ran Adam through but this failed to stop his transformation. Several of the Guardians, then stranded in the year 3009, were then sent back in time to stop Magus' creation and Phyla was prevented from making her move. This time when Warlock was transformed, she engaged him in combat - but Magus magically teleported her own sword from her hands and slew her with it.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #17, 19 (December 2009)</ref>\n\nHowever, Phyla was revealed to still be alive, along with Mantis, Gamora, Cosmo and Major Victory, but trapped in suspended animation and prisoners of the Magus.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #22 (January 2010)</ref> She then breaks free and frees the other Guardians, but after a fierce fight she is misled by Maelstrom into freeing [[Thanos]], who was concealed inside a cocoon. When the two teams of Guardians reunite, Phyla-Vell is reported as the first victim of Thanos' rampage, her remains seen by [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] but never shown on panel. She is later mourned by the Guardians on Knowhere.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #25, 19 (June 2010)</ref>\n\nPhyla is later shown in [[Hell]] when Thanos and [[Deadpool]] venture there in search of the missing [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Tim Seeley|penciller = Elmo Bondoc|inker = Elmo Bondoc|colorist = Ruth Redmond|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

She can fire energy blasts and fly. She also acts like an \"energy sponge,\"  absorbing any energy attacks directed at her and returning them as energy blasts. She has cosmic awareness and is a proficient fighter.\n\nShe then came into possession of the [[Quasar (comics)#Quantum Bands|Quantum Bands]] formerly owned by [[Wendell Vaughn]]. The Bands grant vast energy manipulation powers, such as absorbing and transforming energy on a stellar level, forming solid energy constructs and forcefields, allowing for space travel and providing protection from telepathic attacks, but gaining the Bands has caused her to lose her cosmic awareness.\n\nWhile searching for Heather Douglas, Phyla lost the Quantum Bands to the villain Maelstrom. She has gained unknown new powers by becoming the new avatar of Oblivion. However, Wendell has stated that her Quantum Sword will still draw power from the Quantum Bands and that they will always be a part of her.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #12, 19 (May 2009)</ref>\n\n== Other versions ==\n=== Infinity Countdown ===\nDuring ''[[Infinity Countdown]]'', when Gamora was collecting the Infinity Stones, an alternate version of Phyla-Vell and Moondragon from Earth-TRN707 arrived on the Prime Earth to get their universe's Reality Stone.

''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #17 (February 2004). Art by [[Paul Azaceta]].]]\nAfter [[Genis-Vell]], then known as Captain Marvel, previously destroyed and recreated the universe, the \"new\" version was subtly altered with Phyla-Vell's existence being one of the changes. It is revealed that she is the second artificially created offspring of Captain Mar-Vell who was created by her mother [[Elysius]] in the \"new\" universe because her first attempt (Genis-Vell) had been so successful. Initially her origin conflicted with previously established storylines, but this is resolved in ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 4) #18 (February 2004).\n\nShe fights her brother Genis-Vell, who was insane at the time,<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 4 #17-18 (January\u2013February 2004)</ref> in the process helping to restore his sanity. She then tries to lay claim to the \"Captain Marvel\" title, though her brother refuses to give it up.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 4 #19 (March 2004)</ref> Phyla is next seen at the trial of [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]].<ref>''She-Hulk'' #12-13, 2006</ref>\n\nThe ''Captain Marvel'' (vol. 5) series heavily hinted that Phyla-Vell is a [[lesbian]], and in #25 (September 2004) the character admits that she is attracted to [[Moondragon]] and invites her on a tour of the \"[[spiral nebula]] near Renault VII\". Before Moondragon can accept the two wander through a portal.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 5 #25</ref>\n\n===Annihilation===\n{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}\nPhyla later appeared during ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' where she had been visiting her father's grave with Moondragon when the pair were attacked by [[Thanos]] who ripped off Moondragon's ear and gave it to Phyla, telling her to go to [[Drax the Destroyer]] and how his actions would determine Moondragon's fate shortly before teleporting away with Moondragon. Drax has indicated he will not be stopping his pursuit of Thanos.<ref>''Annihilation'' #2</ref>\n\nPhyla then goes with [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and [[Star-Lord]] to lead a final battle against [[Annihilus]], being saved at the last second by a massive energy wave caused by the just freed [[Galactus]], which left only the three heroes and Annihilus as survivors.  Ultimately in the battle, Phyla manages to steal away the [[quantum bands]] that Annihilus took from [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], weakening him and allowing Nova to finally bring an end to the Annihilation Wave.  She is then seen re-united with Moondragon, and deciding it's up to her to become the new Quasar.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6</ref>\n\n===Annihilation: Conquest&nbsp;\u2013 Quasar===\n{{See also|Annihilation: Conquest}}\nPhyla had her own mini-series as the new Quasar, stating July through October 2007, called ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]&nbsp;\u2013 Quasar''. The series was written by [[Christos Gage]] (who wrote ''[[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]]''), penciled by [[Mike Lilly]]. Phyla is finding it hard to follow the footsteps of the former Quasar and also to follow in the Mar-Vell family\u2019s footsteps. The story is a lot about her trying to handle this power, and seeing if she can contain it.  She\u2019s on a quest, and the object of the quest has real importance, not only to her, but to the entire storyline. Phylla and her lover Moondragon follow a voice to find the saviour for the [[Kree]] race who is attacked by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. In the end it turns out 'the voice' is the [[Supreme Intelligence]] of the Kree; thanks to the Supreme Intelligence they find a cocoon, in which [[Adam Warlock]] is restoring. The cocoon breaks open and Phyla and Moondragon ask Warlock to help them fight against the Phalanx. This story was continued in the main mini-series ''Annihilation: Conquest''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Back To Space In Marvel's Annihilation: Conquest|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=102941|website=[[Newsarama]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135443/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=102941|archivedate=September 29, 2007|date=February 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Guardians of the Galaxy===\n{{See also|Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)}}\nFollowing Annihilation, she joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #1</ref> While helping [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] search for Cammi, an Earth girl who he had taken into space before the Annihilation War, they consult a psychic to get a lead on Cammi's whereabouts only to be informed that Moondragon was trying to contact them.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #7</ref> They attempt to consult [[A'lars|Mentor]], who apparently kills them.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #9</ref> Mentor sends Phyla and Drax to [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]] where they encounter [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] and the [[Dragon of the Moon]].  After losing the Quantum Bands to Maelstrom Phyla is offered as a sacrifice to the Dragon so that Maelstrom can be in its good graces.  While inside the dragon she apparently makes a deal in exchange for Heather Douglas.  The dragon then releases them, with Phyla wearing a new red and black costume adorned with skulls and wielding a new sword, and they return to the world of the living where Phyla refuses to elaborate on the deal that she made with the Dragon.  It is later learned from Maelstrom that she agreed to become the new avatar of Oblivion.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #12</ref>\n\n===Martyr===\nNow calling herself Martyr, Phyla-Vell is a more abrasive and aggressive figure. When the Guardians attempted to negotiate with the Inhumans to stop the War of Kings, she ruined the attempt by taking [[Crystal (comics)|Inhuman princess Crystal]] hostage instead; this led to battle between the Inhumans and Guardians, while she continued to escalate.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #14</ref> Eventually, the Inhumans would try to end the war by detonating a weapon that shattered space itself, creating a multiversal Fault.<ref>''War of Kings'' #6</ref>\n\nWhen [[Adam Warlock]] stopped the Fault's growth by using a redundant timeline, one where he became the villainous [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], Phyla-Vell revealed that her deal with Oblivion was to kill \"the Avatar of Life\" and she'd know what to do when the time came. Knowing he would now become Magus, she ran Adam through but this failed to stop his transformation. Several of the Guardians, then stranded in the year 3009, were then sent back in time to stop Magus' creation and Phyla was prevented from making her move. This time when Warlock was transformed, she engaged him in combat - but Magus magically teleported her own sword from her hands and slew her with it.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #17, 19 (December 2009)</ref>\n\nHowever, Phyla was revealed to still be alive, along with Mantis, Gamora, Cosmo and Major Victory, but trapped in suspended animation and prisoners of the Magus.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #22 (January 2010)</ref> She then breaks free and frees the other Guardians, but after a fierce fight she is misled by Maelstrom into freeing [[Thanos]], who was concealed inside a cocoon. When the two teams of Guardians reunite, Phyla-Vell is reported as the first victim of Thanos' rampage, her remains seen by [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] but never shown on panel. She is later mourned by the Guardians on Knowhere.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #25, 19 (June 2010)</ref>\n\nPhyla is later shown in [[Hell]] when Thanos and [[Deadpool]] venture there in search of the missing [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Tim Seeley|penciller = Elmo Bondoc|inker = Elmo Bondoc|colorist = Ruth Redmond|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Jordan D.

She can fire energy blasts and fly. She also acts like an \"energy sponge,\"  absorbing any energy attacks directed at her and returning them as energy blasts. She has cosmic awareness and is a proficient fighter.\n\nShe then came into possession of the [[Quasar (comics)#Quantum Bands|Quantum Bands]] formerly owned by [[Wendell Vaughn]]. The Bands grant vast energy manipulation powers, such as absorbing and transforming energy on a stellar level, forming solid energy constructs and forcefields, allowing for space travel and providing protection from telepathic attacks, but gaining the Bands has caused her to lose her cosmic awareness.\n\nWhile searching for Heather Douglas, Phyla lost the Quantum Bands to the villain Maelstrom. She has gained unknown new powers by becoming the new avatar of Oblivion. However, Wendell has stated that her Quantum Sword will still draw power from the Quantum Bands and that they will always be a part of her.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2 #12, 19 (May 2009)</ref>\n\n== Other versions ==\n=== Infinity Countdown ===\nDuring ''[[Infinity Countdown]]'', when Gamora was collecting the Infinity Stones, an alternate version of Phyla-Vell and Moondragon from Earth-TRN707 arrived on the Prime Earth to get their universe's Reality Stone.

Notable differences include:\n\n*''Hairstyle'': Patty has an [[afro]], while Selma's similarly textured hair is parted in the middle to form an \"M\".\n[[File:Patty_and_Selma_in_their_real_hair_color.jpg|thumb|right|Patty and Selma showing their real hair color to their sister Marge (episode \"[[The Blue and the Gray (The Simpsons)|The Blue and the Gray]]\").]]\n*''Attire'': Patty wears a short-sleeved pink dress and pink shoes while Selma wears a hemmed sleeveless blue dress and blue shoes.\n*''Earrings'': Patty wears orange or blue triangular earrings while Selma wears purple or orange circular earrings (and, in earlier episodes, earrings shaped in an \"S\").\n*''Necklace'': Patty wears orange or blue spherical beads while Selma wears purple or orange elliptical beads\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Blue and the Gray (The Simpsons)|The Blue and the Gray]]\", it is revealed that Selma is actually a blonde, while Patty is a redhead. Their hair has turned blue-gray from long-term exposure to cigarette smoke and ash.\n\n==Biography ==\nRarely seen apart, Patty and Selma are known for their distinctive gravelly voices, their cynical outlook on life, their bitter and unpleasant personalities, and their love of cigarettes. They share an apartment at the [[Spinster]] City apartment complex and both work at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]]. The two are avid, sometimes maniacal fans of the TV series, ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]''. The two seem to be aroused by the character and smoke a cigarette after every viewing of the show.\nWhen [[Jay Sherman]], on advice from Homer, told Patty and Selma that MacGyver is gay, they stripped him to his boxers and hung him from the gutters.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[A Star is Burns]]\"</ref> On the eve of Selma's marriage to [[Sideshow Bob]], he insulted MacGyver and the wedding was almost cancelled as a result.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Black Widower]]\"</ref> Selma and Patty once met the actor who portrayed MacGyver, [[Richard Dean Anderson]], and kidnapped him.<ref name=\"kiss kiss bangalore\">''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore]]\"</ref> Patty and Selma have taken many vacations together to various places including\n[[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Dead Sea]], where Selma sunk to the bottom when she attempted to float on her back.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Flaming Moe's]]\"</ref> Patty and Selma have also brought home \"souvenirs\" from their vacations, including a pillowcase full of seashells from their trip to Sulfur Bay that they forced the family to help them clean and organize.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]\"</ref> They drove away Richard Dean Anderson by showing him slides of their trip to the [[Remington Carriage Museum]] in [[Cardston, Alberta]].<ref name=\"kiss kiss bangalore\"/>\n\nPatty and Selma have a strong, mutually reciprocated dislike for their brother-in-law [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]. They regret that Marge chose Homer over her former boyfriend [[Artie Ziff]],<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[The Way We Was]]\"</ref> and have unsuccessfully tried to help Artie win her back.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Half-Decent Proposal]]\"</ref><ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[The Ziff Who Came to Dinner]]\"</ref> However, Marge made it clear to her sisters that she loves Homer and there's nothing they can do to change her mind. Homer usually tries to be polite to them out of respect for Marge, but Patty and Selma do not hide their contempt for him. They showed little concern when Homer suffered a heart attack. While he was undergoing bypass surgery, they tried to set Marge up with a sleazy man named Andre.<ref name=\"TripleBypass\">''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]\"</ref> They own a tombstone inscribed with the epitaph \"Homer J. Simpson. We are richer for having lost him\" and use it as a coffee table,<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Mother Simpson]]\"</ref> stick pins in a voodoo doll which looks like Homer<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Homer and Apu]]\"</ref> and even commissioned a billboard urging voters to evict Homer from Springfield.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Three Gays of the Condo]]\"</ref> When Homer contemplated suicide, they encouraged him to go through with it and then pushed him off the bridge, though this was actually part of a plot by the townspeople to bring Homer to his surprise party on a cruise ship.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind]]\"</ref> Patty has also given stoner [[Otto Mann]] a driver's license due to their mutual dislike for Homer,<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[The Otto Show]]\"</ref> and both she and Selma deliberately failed Homer on his limousine driver's test, but their victory smoking nearly cost them their jobs until Homer intervened.<ref name=\"vsPattyAndSelma\">''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Homer vs. Patty and Selma]]\"</ref> They once kidnapped Homer before his and Marge's second wedding and imprisoned him in a cellar in the hope that Marge would find someone else. Moved to tears by his obvious devotion to Marge, they let him go and paid for their wedding ceremony in order to avoid being exposed by Bart and Lisa.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Wedding for Disaster]]\"</ref> For his part, Homer regards them as the \"Gruesome Twosome\"<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Krusty Gets Busted]]\"</ref> or \"Fatty and Smellma\"<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[The Fat and the Furriest]]</ref> and was delighted when he (mistakenly) heard they had died.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[American History X-cellent]]\"</ref>\n\nAs children, Patty and Selma were apparently domineering towards Marge and ridiculed her ambition of becoming an astronaut. In return for their allowance, Marge used to do chores for them. The free time they now had led to them taking up smoking.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]\"</ref> As adults, the Bouvier twins have a friendly relationship with their sister and seem very protective of her and thus frequently visit the Simpsons. They seem relatively fond of their nieces and nephew, but seem to like them more when they are young, as one of them remarks \"The older they get, the cuter they ain't.\"<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Lisa's First Word]]\"</ref> On occasions, they babysit Bart, Lisa and Maggie, something not relished by the kids. Bart and Lisa were left traumatized when they had to stay with their aunts for a week while a stressed out Marge left for Rancho Relaxo. Maggie managed to take evasive action and got to stay with Homer instead.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Homer Alone]]\"</ref>\n\n===Patty Bouvier===\n'''Patricia Maleficent Bouvier''' is the younger of the two.<ref name=\"SomethingAbout\"/> Despite the similarities between her and Selma, Patty is more jaded than her sister, particularly towards relationships. It was once said by Marge that Patty chose a life of [[celibacy]], and that Selma had it thrust upon her.<ref name=\"PrincipalCharming\">''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Principal Charming]]\"</ref> Her decision to not have relationships has been implied to be due to her then closeted sexuality. Generally, Patty is more hostile to Homer than Selma is. However, when Patty came out as a lesbian, she found a surprising supporter in Homer (in contrast to Marge who was at first surprised and angry about it), and she swallowed her pride and asked him to perform her marriage ceremony.<ref name=\"SomethingAbout\"/> They also teamed up to try to scupper the burgeoning relationship between Selma and Homer's father [[Abe Simpson|Abe]].<ref name=\"RomeJuli\" /> Patty also joined Homer's group to ghost-write an original fantasy fiction novel, and also to stop their novel from being replaced with a drastically revamped version by the book publishing company.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[The Book Job]]\"</ref> In one episode, where Patty stayed at the Simpson house during a fight with Selma despite Homer's reluctance, Patty privately admitted to Homer that she only mocks him because she is jealous of him having a successful marriage and family with Marge, while all she has is Selma, leaving Homer feeling grateful for her having opened, albeit briefly, a window of kindness.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Puffless]]\"</ref>\n\n====Relationships====\nPatty's only known relationship with a man was [[Principal Skinner]].<ref name=\"PrincipalCharming\"/> On a blind date arranged by Homer, Skinner was supposed to fall for Selma, but he noticed Patty first and fell in love with her instead. They dated for a while but she turned down his marriage proposal, telling him she was too devoted to Selma to abandon her. However, she did consider Skinner a gentleman and ended their relationship with the words \"Good night, sweet principal.\"<ref name=\"PrincipalCharming\"/> Like Selma, Patty also has a long-running fixation on ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'', although this aspect of her personality has been played down in later episodes.\n\nAfter coming out as a lesbian,<ref name=\"SomethingAbout\"/> Patty exclaims \"you could see it from space!\". There had been many previous hints of her sexuality: she was seen visiting a burlesque house;<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Bart After Dark]]\"</ref> she exclaimed (upon seeing Homer naked) \"There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality.\";<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Treehouse of Horror III]]\"</ref> she was seen hiding in a closet with [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] on a parade float during a gay pride parade.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Jaws Wired Shut]]\"</ref> In another nod to Patty's sexuality being obvious, Homer [[sarcasm|sarcastically]] quipped, \"Here's another bomb for ya, Marge: I like beer!\" when Marge was shocked at the revelation.\n\nPatty wooed a tenured professor from [[Yale University]] away from her husband<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Homer Simpson, This is Your Wife]]\"</ref> and has also been attracted to [[Edna Krabappel]].<ref name=\"RomeJuli\"/> Selma says \"I can't face prison\" and Patty replies \"I can.\"<ref name=\"kiss kiss bangalore\"/> Patty's only serious relationship with a woman however was with Veronica, a pro-golfer. It was later discovered by Marge and revealed during Patty's wedding that Veronica was actually a man in disguise.\n\n===Selma Bouvier===\n'''Selma Bouvier''' is two minutes older than Patty. Due to a childhood bottle rocket accident, she has no sense of taste or smell.<ref name=\"BlackWidower\">''[[The Simpsons]]''- \"[[Black Widower]]\"</ref> According to Marge, Selma \"likes ''[[Police Academy (franchise)|Police Academy]]'' movies and [[Hummel figurines]], and walking through the park on clear autumn days.\" In contrast to her twin, Selma yearns for male companionship and children. She is also slightly more sympathetic towards Homer than Patty. Selma helped reunite Homer and Marge after seeing how upset Marge was without him, despite an agreement with Patty not to say anything.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[I Married Marge]]\"</ref> Homer was sympathetic to her when she broke down after a disastrous trip to Duff Gardens with Bart and Lisa, remarking \"I just couldn't cut it today\", referring to raising kids.<ref name=\"SelmasChoice\"/> Homer also agreed to pose as Selma's husband to help her adopt a baby from China.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Goo Goo Gai Pan]]\"</ref> During Homer and Marge's trial separation, when Marge went out on a date with someone else, Selma called Homer and offered to help him save their marriage, but was left frustrated when Homer mistook her for Patty over the phone.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Every Man's Dream]]\"</ref>\n\nUnable to find companionship in a man, Selma has also sought to have children. At one point she considered using a [[sperm donor]] which Homer mistakenly thought meant Selma would have sex with a robot.<ref name=\"SelmasChoice\"/> After babysitting [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] for a day, she realized she was not ready to have children and wound up adopting [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Jub-Jub|Jub-Jub]], her late Aunt Gladys's pet iguana.<ref name=\"SelmasChoice\">''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Selma's Choice]]\"</ref><ref>According to a ''The Simpsons'' [[DVD commentary]] and by episode writer O'Brien on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''</ref> Much later, she adopted a Chinese baby girl, [[Simpson family#Ling Bouvier|Ling]]. During the adoption process, Selma pretended to be married to Homer, since the Chinese government only allows children to be adopted by married couples.<ref>[http://www.wnyc.org/shows/tnbt/episodes/2003/10/10 \"In the Family Way\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028042157/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/tnbt/episodes/2003/10/10 |date=October 28, 2006 }}, ''[[The Next Big Thing (radio series)|The Next Big Thing]]'', October 10, 2003. [[Julia Sweeney]] tells about the messages she received from Chinese adoption agencies trying to confirm her heterosexuality due to government opposition to gay adoption</ref> After the fraud was exposed, Selma managed to keep the baby as a Chinese dignitary (voiced by [[Lucy Liu]]), who had also been raised by a single parent, became sympathetic.\n\n====Relationships====\nDespite being identical twins, Patty and Selma have very different track records when it comes to finding dates. According to Marge, Patty chose a life of [[celibacy]], while Selma had celibacy thrust upon her. Her standards are extremely low, as evidenced by her comments on [[Mr. Burns]]: \"Single, eh? Well, he passes the Selma Test.\"\n\nSelma has actively sought out a husband, and has been married to six different men. Her current name has evolved into '''Selma Bouvier-Terwilliger-Hutz-McClure-Stu-Simpson-D'Amico'''.

Notable differences include:\n\n*''Hairstyle'': Patty has an [[afro]], while Selma's similarly textured hair is parted in the middle to form an \"M\".\n[[File:Patty_and_Selma_in_their_real_hair_color.jpg|thumb|right|Patty and Selma showing their real hair color to their sister Marge (episode \"[[The Blue and the Gray (The Simpsons)|The Blue and the Gray]]\").]]\n*''Attire'': Patty wears a short-sleeved pink dress and pink shoes while Selma wears a hemmed sleeveless blue dress and blue shoes.\n*''Earrings'': Patty wears orange or blue triangular earrings while Selma wears purple or orange circular earrings (and, in earlier episodes, earrings shaped in an \"S\").\n*''Necklace'': Patty wears orange or blue spherical beads while Selma wears purple or orange elliptical beads\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Blue and the Gray (The Simpsons)|The Blue and the Gray]]\", it is revealed that Selma is actually a blonde, while Patty is a redhead. Their hair has turned blue-gray from long-term exposure to cigarette smoke and ash.\n\n==Biography ==\nRarely seen apart, Patty and Selma are known for their distinctive gravelly voices, their cynical outlook on life, their bitter and unpleasant personalities, and their love of cigarettes. They share an apartment at the [[Spinster]] City apartment complex and both work at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]]. The two are avid, sometimes maniacal fans of the TV series, ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]''. The two seem to be aroused by the character and smoke a cigarette after every viewing of the show.\nWhen [[Jay Sherman]], on advice from Homer, told Patty and Selma that MacGyver is gay, they stripped him to his boxers and hung him from the gutters.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[A Star is Burns]]\"</ref> On the eve of Selma's marriage to [[Sideshow Bob]], he insulted MacGyver and the wedding was almost cancelled as a result.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Black Widower]]\"</ref> Selma and Patty once met the actor who portrayed MacGyver, [[Richard Dean Anderson]], and kidnapped him.<ref name=\"kiss kiss bangalore\">''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore]]\"</ref> Patty and Selma have taken many vacations together to various places including\n[[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Dead Sea]], where Selma sunk to the bottom when she attempted to float on her back.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Flaming Moe's]]\"</ref> Patty and Selma have also brought home \"souvenirs\" from their vacations, including a pillowcase full of seashells from their trip to Sulfur Bay that they forced the family to help them clean and organize.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]\"</ref> They drove away Richard Dean Anderson by showing him slides of their trip to the [[Remington Carriage Museum]] in [[Cardston, Alberta]].<ref name=\"kiss kiss bangalore\"/>\n\nPatty and Selma have a strong, mutually reciprocated dislike for their brother-in-law [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]. They regret that Marge chose Homer over her former boyfriend [[Artie Ziff]],<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[The Way We Was]]\"</ref> and have unsuccessfully tried to help Artie win her back.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Half-Decent Proposal]]\"</ref><ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[The Ziff Who Came to Dinner]]\"</ref> However, Marge made it clear to her sisters that she loves Homer and there's nothing they can do to change her mind. Homer usually tries to be polite to them out of respect for Marge, but Patty and Selma do not hide their contempt for him. They showed little concern when Homer suffered a heart attack. While he was undergoing bypass surgery, they tried to set Marge up with a sleazy man named Andre.<ref name=\"TripleBypass\">''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]\"</ref> They own a tombstone inscribed with the epitaph \"Homer J. Simpson. We are richer for having lost him\" and use it as a coffee table,<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Mother Simpson]]\"</ref> stick pins in a voodoo doll which looks like Homer<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Homer and Apu]]\"</ref> and even commissioned a billboard urging voters to evict Homer from Springfield.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Three Gays of the Condo]]\"</ref> When Homer contemplated suicide, they encouraged him to go through with it and then pushed him off the bridge, though this was actually part of a plot by the townspeople to bring Homer to his surprise party on a cruise ship.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind]]\"</ref> Patty has also given stoner [[Otto Mann]] a driver's license due to their mutual dislike for Homer,<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[The Otto Show]]\"</ref> and both she and Selma deliberately failed Homer on his limousine driver's test, but their victory smoking nearly cost them their jobs until Homer intervened.<ref name=\"vsPattyAndSelma\">''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Homer vs. Patty and Selma]]\"</ref> They once kidnapped Homer before his and Marge's second wedding and imprisoned him in a cellar in the hope that Marge would find someone else. Moved to tears by his obvious devotion to Marge, they let him go and paid for their wedding ceremony in order to avoid being exposed by Bart and Lisa.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Wedding for Disaster]]\"</ref> For his part, Homer regards them as the \"Gruesome Twosome\"<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Krusty Gets Busted]]\"</ref> or \"Fatty and Smellma\"<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[The Fat and the Furriest]]</ref> and was delighted when he (mistakenly) heard they had died.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[American History X-cellent]]\"</ref>\n\nAs children, Patty and Selma were apparently domineering towards Marge and ridiculed her ambition of becoming an astronaut. In return for their allowance, Marge used to do chores for them. The free time they now had led to them taking up smoking.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]\"</ref> As adults, the Bouvier twins have a friendly relationship with their sister and seem very protective of her and thus frequently visit the Simpsons. They seem relatively fond of their nieces and nephew, but seem to like them more when they are young, as one of them remarks \"The older they get, the cuter they ain't.\"<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Lisa's First Word]]\"</ref> On occasions, they babysit Bart, Lisa and Maggie, something not relished by the kids. Bart and Lisa were left traumatized when they had to stay with their aunts for a week while a stressed out Marge left for Rancho Relaxo. Maggie managed to take evasive action and got to stay with Homer instead.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Homer Alone]]\"</ref>\n\n===Patty Bouvier===\n'''Patricia Maleficent Bouvier''' is the younger of the two.<ref name=\"SomethingAbout\"/> Despite the similarities between her and Selma, Patty is more jaded than her sister, particularly towards relationships. It was once said by Marge that Patty chose a life of [[celibacy]], and that Selma had it thrust upon her.<ref name=\"PrincipalCharming\">''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Principal Charming]]\"</ref> Her decision to not have relationships has been implied to be due to her then closeted sexuality. Generally, Patty is more hostile to Homer than Selma is. However, when Patty came out as a lesbian, she found a surprising supporter in Homer (in contrast to Marge who was at first surprised and angry about it), and she swallowed her pride and asked him to perform her marriage ceremony.<ref name=\"SomethingAbout\"/> They also teamed up to try to scupper the burgeoning relationship between Selma and Homer's father [[Abe Simpson|Abe]].<ref name=\"RomeJuli\" /> Patty also joined Homer\u2019s group to ghost-write an original fantasy fiction novel, and also to stop their novel from being replaced with a drastically revamped version by the book publishing company.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[The Book Job]]\"</ref> In one episode, where Patty stayed at the Simpson house during a fight with Selma despite Homer's reluctance, Patty privately admitted to Homer that she only mocks him because she is jealous of him having a successful marriage and family with Marge, while all she has is Selma, leaving Homer feeling grateful for her having opened, albeit briefly, a window of kindness.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Puffless]]\"</ref>\n\n====Relationships====\nPatty's only known relationship with a man was [[Principal Skinner]].<ref name=\"PrincipalCharming\"/> On a blind date arranged by Homer, Skinner was supposed to fall for Selma, but he noticed Patty first and fell in love with her instead. They dated for a while but she turned down his marriage proposal, telling him she was too devoted to Selma to abandon her. However, she did consider Skinner a gentleman and ended their relationship with the words \"Good night, sweet principal.\"<ref name=\"PrincipalCharming\"/> Like Selma, Patty also has a long-running fixation on ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'', although this aspect of her personality has been played down in later episodes.\n\nAfter coming out as a lesbian,<ref name=\"SomethingAbout\"/> Patty exclaims \"you could see it from space!\". There had been many previous hints of her sexuality: she was seen visiting a burlesque house;<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Bart After Dark]]\"</ref> she exclaimed (upon seeing Homer naked) \"There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality.\";<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Treehouse of Horror III]]\"</ref> she was seen hiding in a closet with [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] on a parade float during a gay pride parade.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Jaws Wired Shut]]\"</ref> In another nod to Patty's sexuality being obvious, Homer [[sarcasm|sarcastically]] quipped, \"Here's another bomb for ya, Marge: I like beer!\" when Marge was shocked at the revelation.\n\nPatty wooed a tenured professor from [[Yale University]] away from her husband<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Homer Simpson, This is Your Wife]]\"</ref> and has also been attracted to [[Edna Krabappel]].<ref name=\"RomeJuli\"/> Selma says \"I can't face prison\" and Patty replies \"I can.\"<ref name=\"kiss kiss bangalore\"/> Patty's only serious relationship with a woman however was with Veronica, a pro-golfer. It was later discovered by Marge and revealed during Patty's wedding that Veronica was actually a man in disguise.\n\n===Selma Bouvier===\n'''Selma Bouvier''' is two minutes older than Patty. Due to a childhood bottle rocket accident, she has no sense of taste or smell.<ref name=\"BlackWidower\">''[[The Simpsons]]''- \"[[Black Widower]]\"</ref> According to Marge, Selma \"likes ''[[Police Academy (franchise)|Police Academy]]'' movies and [[Hummel figurines]], and walking through the park on clear autumn days.\" In contrast to her twin, Selma yearns for male companionship and children. She is also slightly more sympathetic towards Homer than Patty. Selma helped reunite Homer and Marge after seeing how upset Marge was without him, despite an agreement with Patty not to say anything.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[I Married Marge]]\"</ref> Homer was sympathetic to her when she broke down after a disastrous trip to Duff Gardens with Bart and Lisa, remarking \"I just couldn't cut it today\", referring to raising kids.<ref name=\"SelmasChoice\"/> Homer also agreed to pose as Selma's husband to help her adopt a baby from China.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Goo Goo Gai Pan]]\"</ref> During Homer and Marge's trial separation, when Marge went out on a date with someone else, Selma called Homer and offered to help him save their marriage, but was left frustrated when Homer mistook her for Patty over the phone.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \u2013 \"[[Every Man's Dream]]\"</ref>\n\nUnable to find companionship in a man, Selma has also sought to have children. At one point she considered using a [[sperm donor]] which Homer mistakenly thought meant Selma would have sex with a robot.<ref name=\"SelmasChoice\"/> After babysitting [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] for a day, she realized she was not ready to have children and wound up adopting [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Jub-Jub|Jub-Jub]], her late Aunt Gladys's pet iguana.<ref name=\"SelmasChoice\">''[[The Simpsons]]''. \"[[Selma's Choice]]\"</ref><ref>According to a ''The Simpsons'' [[DVD commentary]] and by episode writer O'Brien on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''</ref> Much later, she adopted a Chinese baby girl, [[Simpson family#Ling Bouvier|Ling]]. During the adoption process, Selma pretended to be married to Homer, since the Chinese government only allows children to be adopted by married couples.<ref>[http://www.wnyc.org/shows/tnbt/episodes/2003/10/10 \"In the Family Way\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028042157/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/tnbt/episodes/2003/10/10 |date=October 28, 2006 }}, ''[[The Next Big Thing (radio series)|The Next Big Thing]]'', October 10, 2003. [[Julia Sweeney]] tells about the messages she received from Chinese adoption agencies trying to confirm her heterosexuality due to government opposition to gay adoption</ref> After the fraud was exposed, Selma managed to keep the baby as a Chinese dignitary (voiced by [[Lucy Liu]]), who had also been raised by a single parent, became sympathetic.\n\n====Relationships====\nDespite being identical twins, Patty and Selma have very different track records when it comes to finding dates. According to Marge, Patty chose a life of [[celibacy]], while Selma had celibacy thrust upon her. Her standards are extremely low, as evidenced by her comments on [[Mr. Burns]]: \"Single, eh? Well, he passes the Selma Test.\"\n\nSelma has actively sought out a husband, and has been married to six different men. Her current name has evolved into '''Selma Bouvier-Terwilliger-Hutz-McClure-Stu-Simpson-D'Amico'''. Her first marriage, to [[Sideshow Bob|Robert \"Sideshow Bob\" Terwilliger]], ended when his plan to kill her was foiled by Bart.<ref name=\"BlackWidower\"/> After an off-screen marriage to [[Lionel Hutz]],<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' \"[[Much Apu About Nothing]]\"</ref> she began dating [[Troy McClure]]. They married, but she soon discovered it was just a sham to boost his flagging career.
