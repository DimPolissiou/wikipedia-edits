In the process, Hope runs into her old friend Landon, who is also Rafael's foster brother, but since the school for the supernatural is deemed to be too dangerous for humans, Landon is turned away. When student vampire MG fails to compel Landon to forget his knowledge of the supernatural, it is assumed that Landon has ingested vervain and he is locked up until it can clear his system. Hope visits Landon in his cell while Alaric's daughters Josie and Lizzie give Rafael a tour of the school. Hope tells Landon the truth about her supernatural origins and, knowing that his mind will be erased, he kisses her. Once Landon leaves, it is revealed that the compulsion has still not worked and that Landon stole a knife from the school. Hope enlists Josie to help her locate the knife and Landon.

When student vampire MG fails to compel Landon to forget his knowledge of the supernatural, it is assumed that Landon has ingested vervain and he is locked up until it can clear his system. Hope visits Landon in his cell while Alaric's daughters Josie and Lizzie give Rafael a tour of the school. Hope tells Landon the truth about her supernatural origins and, knowing that his mind will be erased, he kisses her. Once Landon leaves, it is revealed that the compulsion has still not worked and that Landon stole a knife from the school. Hope enlists Josie to help her locate the knife and Landon.

It was not the historical capital of the region. Earlier, Purig consisted of a number of small but independent kingdoms, which included Pashkum, Chiktan, Fokar, Soth and the [[Suru Valley|Suru]] Valley. These tiny principalities would often fight among themselves over petty issues. Gasho \u201cThatha Khan\u201d, an exiled prince in the 9th century AD, is perhaps the first ruler who brought together all the territories under a united administration.\nAnother sultan of Purig extended his kingdom to include [[Zanskar]], Sot, Barsoo, Sankoo pretty much the territory of the present [[Kargil district]]. He is referred to as \u201cThe Purig Sultan\u201d. His capital was based at Karpokhar in the Suru Valley. The other famous kings of Kargil were Boti Khan, Abdal Khan, Amrood Choo, Tsering Malik, Kunchok Sherab Stan and Thi Sultan.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIt is said that it was the period of [[Ali Sher Khan Anchan]], the famous ruler of [[Skardu]], in the late 16th and early 17th centuries which had a great influence on the area. This prince from [[Baltistan]] conquered most of the principalities of Purig and introduced Balti culture in the Kargil district. Subsequently, it was the Dogras who united Baltistan, Purig, Zanskar and present-day [[Leh district]] in the first half of the 19th century under a single administrative unit, which lasted until 1947 when a new line of control was demarcated between India and Pakistan separating Skardu and Kargil.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ismail Khan |title=A peaceful Kargil |url=http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/050904/dmag6.htm |newspaper=Dawn |date=4 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013140325/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/050904/dmag6.htm |archive-date=13 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{better source|reason=Scholarly source needed for history|date=November 2016}}\n\nBefore the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, Kargil was part of the ''wazarat'' (district) of [[Ladakh]], a sparsely populated region with diverse linguistic, ethnic and religious groups, living in isolated valleys separated by some of the world's highest mountains. The Ladakh ''wazarat'' had three ''tehsils'' (sub-districts), named after the cities of their headquarters: [[Leh district|Leh]], [[Baltistan|Skardu]] and [[Kargil district|Kargil]]. The district headquarters shifted between the three locations each year.{{sfn|Aggarwal, Beyond Lines of Control|2004|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Kargil.map.gif|thumb|left|Location of Kargil with respect to the [[Line of Control]]]]\nThe [[First Kashmir War]] (1947\u201348) concluded with a ceasefire line that divided the Ladakh ''wazarat'', putting roughly the Kargil and Leh ''tehsils'' on the Indian side, and the Skardu ''tehsil'' on the Pakistan side. The two Indian ''tehsils'' were soon promoted to districts and Ladakh was named a Division, on par with the [[Jammu Division|Jammu]] and [[Kashmir Division|Kashmir]] Divisions in the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. Pakistan renamed the Skardu ''tehsil'' [[Baltistan]] and divided it into further districts.\n\nAt the end of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], the two nations signed the [[Simla Agreement]], converting the former ceasefire line with some adjustments into a [[Line of Control]], and promising not to engage in armed conflict with respect to that boundary.<ref>{{cite book | first=Pervaiz Iqbal |last=Cheema | title=The Armed Forces of Pakistan | publisher=Allen & Unwin | year=2003 |isbn=1-86508-119-1}} Pg 4</ref>\n\nIn 1999 the area saw infiltration by Pakistani forces, leading to the [[Kargil War]].

204&nbsp;km from [[Dras|Drass]] and [[Srinagar]] to the west respectively, 234&nbsp;km from [[Leh]] to the east, 240&nbsp;km from [[Padum]] to the southeast and 1,047&nbsp;km from [[Delhi]] to the south. Kargil was the location of centre at the time of Ladakh wazarat till 1979 which consists of 3 prominent places that are Skardu, Kargil and Leh.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Kargil'' is said to derive from the words ''Khar'', meaning castle, and ''rKil'' meaning \"centre\". \"Kargil denotes a place between many forts, a central place where people could stay\". It appears to be a fitting description for a place that is equidistant from [[Srinagar]], [[Leh]] and [[Skardu]] (the capitals of the [[Kashmir Valley]], [[Ladakh]] and [[Baltistan]] respectively).{{sfnp|Radhika Gupta, Allegiance and Alienation|2013|p=49}}\n\nHistorically, the region around Kargil was called Purig.{{sfn|Grist, Urbanisation in Kargil|2008|p=80}} A major study of the history of Purig is included in the 1987 book ''Qadeem Ladakh'' by [[Kacho Sikander Khan]], which includes genealogies of various dynasties that ruled the region.<ref name=\"Kalla1997\">{{cite book |last=Kalla |first=Krishan Lal |title=Kashmir Panorama |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3JuAAAAMAAJ |year=1997 |publisher=Raj Publications |isbn=978-81-86208-07-6}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nKargil is the main town in the historical region of [[Purig]], which consists of the [[Suru River (Indus)|Suru]] river basin. It was not the historical capital of the region. Earlier, Purig consisted of a number of small but independent kingdoms, which included Pashkum, Chiktan, Fokar, Soth and the [[Suru Valley|Suru]] Valley. These tiny principalities would often fight among themselves over petty issues. Gasho \u201cThatha Khan\u201d, an exiled prince in the 9th century AD, is perhaps the first ruler who brought together all the territories under a united administration.\nAnother sultan of Purig extended his kingdom to include [[Zanskar]], Sot, Barsoo, Sankoo pretty much the territory of the present [[Kargil district]]. He is referred to as \u201cThe Purig Sultan\u201d. His capital was based at Karpokhar in the Suru Valley. The other famous kings of Kargil were Boti Khan, Abdal Khan, Amrood Choo, Tsering Malik, Kunchok Sherab Stan and Thi Sultan.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIt is said that it was the period of [[Ali Sher Khan Anchan]], the famous ruler of [[Skardu]], in the late 16th and early 17th centuries which had a great influence on the area. This prince from [[Baltistan]] conquered most of the principalities of Purig and introduced Balti culture in the Kargil district. Subsequently, it was the Dogras who united Baltistan, Purig, Zanskar and present-day [[Leh district]] in the first half of the 19th century under a single administrative unit, which lasted until 1947 when a new line of control was demarcated between India and Pakistan separating Skardu and Kargil.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ismail Khan |title=A peaceful Kargil |url=http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/050904/dmag6.htm |newspaper=Dawn |date=4 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013140325/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/050904/dmag6.htm |archive-date=13 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{better source|reason=Scholarly source needed for history|date=November 2016}}\n\nBefore the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, Kargil was part of the ''wazarat'' (district) of [[Ladakh]], a sparsely populated region with diverse linguistic, ethnic and religious groups, living in isolated valleys separated by some of the world's highest mountains. The Ladakh ''wazarat'' had three ''tehsils'' (sub-districts), named after the cities of their headquarters: [[Leh district|Leh]], [[Baltistan|Skardu]] and [[Kargil district|Kargil]]. The district headquarters shifted between the three locations each year.{{sfn|Aggarwal, Beyond Lines of Control|2004|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Kargil.map.gif|thumb|left|Location of Kargil with respect to the [[Line of Control]]]]\nThe [[First Kashmir War]] (1947\u201348) concluded with a ceasefire line that divided the Ladakh ''wazarat'', putting roughly the Kargil and Leh ''tehsils'' on the Indian side, and the Skardu ''tehsil'' on the Pakistan side. The two Indian ''tehsils'' were soon promoted to districts and Ladakh was named a Division, on par with the [[Jammu Division|Jammu]] and [[Kashmir Division|Kashmir]] Divisions in the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. Pakistan renamed the Skardu ''tehsil'' [[Baltistan]] and divided it into further districts.\n\nAt the end of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], the two nations signed the [[Simla Agreement]], converting the former ceasefire line with some adjustments into a [[Line of Control]], and promising not to engage in armed conflict with respect to that boundary.<ref>{{cite book | first=Pervaiz Iqbal |last=Cheema | title=The Armed Forces of Pakistan | publisher=Allen & Unwin | year=2003 |isbn=1-86508-119-1}} Pg 4</ref>\n\nIn 1999 the area saw infiltration by Pakistani forces, leading to the [[Kargil War]].

Workbench provides the user with a graphical interface to work with [[file system]]s and launch applications. It uses a workbench [[metaphor]] (in place of the more common [[desktop metaphor]]) for representing file system organisation.\n\nConfusingly, \"Workbench\" was also the name originally given to the entire [[Amiga]] [[operating system]] up until version 3.1. From release 3.5 the operating system was renamed \"AmigaOS\" and subsequently \"Workbench\" refers to the native file manager only (similarly{{clarifyme|date=April 2020|post-text=\u2013 [[Talk:Workbench (AmigaOS)#The GUI frontend vs the file manager|discuss]]}}, \"System\" was the name given to [[classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] up until version 7.6).\n\n== Overview ==\n\n[[File:Amiga Workbench 1.3 UK diskette.jpg|thumb|Workbench 1.3 UK on floppy disk.]]\n\nThe Amiga Workbench uses the [[metaphor]] of a [[workbench]] (i.e. a workbench of manual labor), rather than the now-standard [[desktop metaphor]], for representing file system organization. The desktop itself is called ''Workbench'' and uses the following representations: ''drawers'' (instead of folders) for directories, ''tools'' for executable programs, ''projects'' for data files, and a ''[[trash (computing)|trash can]]'' as a folder intended to contain deleted files. These representations may be considered somewhat unusual by a modern user, but at the time there were no commonly accepted metaphors and Commodore chose to use different idioms from their competitors ([[Apple Inc.|Apple]] had already pursued legal action to prevent other software companies from offering graphical user interfaces similar to its own).\n\nWorkbench is a [[spatial file manager]] in the sense that it uses a spatial metaphor to represent files and folders as if they are real physical objects. Under this concept, each drawer (folder) opens in its own window, rather than within a single browser under the now more common [[navigational file manager|navigational]] concept.\n\nWorkbench utilizes the Amiga's native windowing system called [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]] to provide the [[graphical user interface]]. Intuition manages the rendering of screens, windows, and gadgets (graphical elements, equivalent to widgets). Later versions of AmigaOS enhanced the interface with more complex [[object-oriented]] widget systems, such as ''gadtools.library'' and [[BOOPSI]] (AmigaOS 2.0 and later) and [[ReAction GUI|ReAction]] (AmigaOS 3.5 and later). Intuition also handles user input events, such as, input from the keyboard and mouse. Workbench requires a two button mouse, where right click operates pull-down menus and left click is used for all other purposes.\n\nThe underlying AmigaOS allows the Workbench to launch multiple applications that can execute concurrently. This is achieved through [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]], the Amiga's multi-tasking kernel, which handles [[memory management]], [[message passing]], and [[scheduling (computing)|task scheduling]]. Applications launched from Workbench could report their success back to Workbench, but this was not a requirement and few actually did.\n\nWorkbench itself has always been a disk-based component, though much of the underlying functionality is stored in the Amiga's [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] firmware, usually stored in [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. As a consequence, it is necessary to boot from a system disk to launch Workbench. This setup streamlines the process of launching games (which typically do not require Workbench) and ensures that memory is not used unnecessarily by the OS in memory-limited systems.\n\nWorkbench was shipped with all Amiga models from Commodore. Workbench was provided either on [[floppy disk]] or later (as part of AmigaOS) on [[CD-ROM]]. Initially, Workbench was designed to be launched and operate from floppy disk (or other [[removable media]]). Later versions could be installed on [[hard disk]], for which an installer was developed for use with AmigaOS 2.0 and later. AmigaOS (including Workbench) often came pre-installed on systems shipped with hard disks.\n* 1985 Workbench 1.0\n* 1990 Workbench 2.0\n* 1992 Workbench 3.0\n* 1994 Amiga OS 3.1\n* 1999 Amiga OS 3.5\n* 2000 Amiga OS 3.9\n* 2006 Amiga OS 4.0\n\n== Versions ==\nUp until release 3.1 of the Amiga's operating system, Commodore used ''Workbench'' to refer to the entire Amiga operating system. As a consequence Workbench was commonly used to refer to both the operating system and the file manager component. For end users Workbench was often synonymous with AmigaOS. From version 3.5 the OS was renamed \"AmigaOS\" and pre-3.5 versions were also retroactively referred to as \"AmigaOS\" (rather than Workbench). Subsequently, \"Workbench\" refers to the native graphical file manager only.\n\nFrom its inception, Workbench offered a highly customizable interface. The user could change the aspect of program icons replacing it with newer ones with different color combinations. Users could also take a \"snapshot\" of icons and windows so the icons will remain on the desktop at coordinates chosen by user and windows will open at the desired size.\n\n=== Workbench 1.x ===\n[[Image:Amiga Workbench 1 0.png|thumb|250px|Amiga Workbench 1.0]]\n\nWorkbench 1.0 was released with the first Amiga, the [[Amiga 1000]], in 1985. The 1.x versions of Workbench used a garish blue and orange color scheme, designed to give high contrast on even the worst of television screens (the colors can be changed by the user). Versions 1.1 consists mostly of bug fixes and, like version 1.0, was distributed for the Amiga 1000 only.\n\nThe display was highly customizable for the era. The user was free to create and modify system and user icons, while [[Atari TOS]] featured only default system icons whose appearance could not be modified and customizing icons on the Macintosh required using [[ResEdit]]. Icons can be of arbitrary size and design and can have two image states to produce a pseudo-animated effect when selected. Users could customize four display colours and choose from two resolutions: {{nowrap|640\u00d7200}} or {{nowrap|640\u00d7400}} (interlaced) on [[NTSC]], or {{nowrap|640\u00d7256}} or {{nowrap|640\u00d7512}} on [[PAL]] systems. In later revisions, the TV or monitor overscan could be adjusted.\n\nSeveral features were deprecated in later versions. For example, the gauge meter showing the free space on a file system was replaced with a percentage in Workbench 2.0. Under Workbench 1.x, right clicking on icons opens a display of the files metadata, whereas from Workbench 2.0 right clicking activates pull-down menus only. The default \"busy\" pointer (a comic balloon showing \"Zzz...\") was replaced with a stopwatch in later versions.\n\n=== Workbench 2.0, 2.1 ===\n[[File:Wb 20.png|thumb|250px|Amiga Workbench 2.0]]\n\nWorkbench 2.0 was released with the launch of the [[Amiga 3000]] in 1990. Until AmigaOS 2.0 there was no unified [[look and feel]] design standard and application developers had to write their own widgets (both buttons and menus) if they wished to enhance the already-meager selection of standard basic widgets provided by Intuition. With Workbench 2.0 ''gadtools.library'' was created, which provided standard widget sets. The ''Amiga User Interface Style Guide'',<ref>[[#Com91|Commodore-Amiga 1991]]</ref> was published which explained how applications should be laid out for consistency. Intuition was improved with [[BOOPSI]] (Basic Object Oriented Programming system for Intuition) which enhanced the system with an [[object-oriented]] interface to define a system of classes in which every class individuate a single widget or describes an interface event. It can be used to program object oriented interfaces into Amiga at any level. As of Workbench 2.0 all files became visible as icons without the need of associated .info files, thus streamlining the process of starting executables in the GUI.\n\nWorkbench 2.0 also added support for ''public screens''. Instead of the Workbench screen being the only shareable screen, applications could create their own named screens to share with other applications.\n\nWorkbench 2.0 included and integrated ''[[ARexx]]'', allowing users to control the system and other programs from user scripts.\n\nWorkbench 2.0 introduced ''[[AmigaGuide]]'', a simple text-only [[hypertext]] markup scheme and browser, for providing online help inside applications. It also introduced ''[[Installer (programming language)|Installer]]'', a standard software installation program, driven by a [[LISP]]-like scripting language.\n\nFinally, Workbench 2.0 rectified the problem of applications [[hooking]] directly into the input-events stream to capture keyboard and mouse movements, sometimes locking up the whole system. Workbench 2.0 provided ''Commodities'', a standard interface for modifying or scanning input events. This included a standard method for specifying global \"hotkey\" key-sequences, and a ''Commodities Exchange'' registry for the user to see which commodities were running.\n\n=== Workbench 3.0, 3.1 ===\n[[File:Amiga_Workbench_3.1_screenshot.png|thumb|250px|Amiga Workbench 3.1]]\n\nVersion 3.0 was originally shipped with the Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000 computers. Version 3.0 added datatypes support and Workbench could load any background image in any format, as long as the required datatype was installed. This feature was also used in Multiview. Its capabilities were directly related to the datatypes installed in Devs:Datatypes. Localisation was added to allow Workbench, and any installed programs that had localisation, to appear in any supported language.\nThe established AmigaGuide hypertext system gained more usability by using document links pointing to mediafiles, for example pictures or sounds, all recognized by the datatypes.\n\n=== Workbench 3.5, 3.9 ===\n[[File:Amiga Workbench 3.9.png|thumb|250px|Amiga Workbench 3.9, (2000)]]\nFollowing Commodore's demise and around six years after Workbench 3.1 was released, [[Haage & Partner]] were commissioned to update AmigaOS, which was released in 1999 as a software-only update for existing systems.\n\nThe Workbench [[look and feel]], though still largely based on the earlier 3.1 release was revised somewhat, with an improved user interface based on ReAction, improved icon rendering and official support for [[24-bit color|true color]] [[Computer wallpaper|backdrops]]. These releases included support for existing third-party GUI enhancements, such as [[NewIcons]], by integrating these patches into the system. The 3.5 and 3.9 releases included a new set of 256 color icons and a choice of desktop wallpaper. These replaced the default all-metal gray 4/8 color scheme used on AmigaOS from release 2.0 to 3.1.\n\nThe 3.9 release of Workbench was again developed by Haage&Partner and released in 2000. The main improvements were the introduction of a program start bar called AmiDock, revised user interfaces for system settings and improved utility programs.\n\n=== Workbench 4.0, 4.1 ===\n[[File:AmigaOS4.png|thumb|250px|Amiga Workbench 4.0]]\nThis new Workbench, called Workbench 4.0{{Ref label|Workbench 4.0 image for fair use|1}}, has been rewritten to become fully [[PowerPC]] compatible.

Additional enhancements include: a new icon set to complement higher screen resolutions, new window themes including drop shadows, AmiDock with true transparency, scalable icons, and a Workbench auto-update feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperion-entertainment.biz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=135:update-1-of-amigaos-41-available-for-immediate-download&catid=36:amigaos-4x&Itemid=18|title=Update 1 of AmigaOS 4.1 available for immediate download|author=Hans-J\u00f6rg Frieden|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Workbench icons ==\nThe [[icon (computing)|icons]] that Workbench uses to represent the files in a volume or a drawer are stored in special <code>.info</code> files, with the name of the <code>.info</code> file matching the name of the file it represents. For example, the icon for <code>NotePad</code>, a [[text editor]], is found in the file <code>NotePad.info</code>. This <code>.info</code> extension is the only file extension required by AmigaOS.\n\nThe <code>.info</code> file contains the icon image and its spatial position within its parent window. The icon also specifies the type of the file, as used by Workbench. Workbench recognises five different file types:<ref>[[#Rya90|Ryan 1990]]</ref>\n* Tool: An executable program.\n* Project: A data file of an executable program. The program which created the file is named in the icon file, double-clicking on the icon loads the program that created it.\n* Drawer: A directory containing files, and other drawers.\n* Volume: A physical disk or a [[RAM disk]].\n* Garbage: The Trashcan \u2013 a deleted file backup, which works in a similar way to the '[[Recycle bin (computing)|Recycle bin]]' in [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nAn additional three file types are available and are intended for future expansion:\n* Device: designed for displaying information about attached devices\n* Kick: The icon of a bootable disk\n* App Icon: An icon which will be used as (part of) the GUI for an application\n\nOf these three file types, only \"App Icons\" currently are used by any part of Workbench/AmigaOS.\n\nWhile an icon may represent or suggest a file type, the type of the related file is specified by its very own properties, along with the restrictions(AmigaDOS: protection flags) given to thi file. For example, if you add a tool icon to a text document file, AmigaOS will tell you the file \"is not executable\" or \"is not of required type\" as it has no 'e'-protection-flag (AmigaDOS: Hold, Script, Pure, Archived, Read, Writeable, Executable, Deletable) nor does it have the startup header of an executable. Also, stripping an 'application' from its counterpart icon file ('application'.info) will not render this application useless; it still remains executable, it will run, only missing the (required) options and arguments delivered from workbench via icons \"tool types\", e.g. stack size, public screen, etc..\n\nStarting in Workbench 2.x, a file without a <code>.info</code> counterpart (such as a file on non-native media) is represented by the default system icon for one of the five types listed above. These default icons are also customizable. Icon-less files are only displayed in this manner if the drawer is configured to [Show All Files] \u2013 if this option is not set (which is the case in Workbench 1.x), such files will not appear at all and can only be seen from a CLI.\n\nTool (application) files can include \"tool types\" in the <code>.info</code> file. These are used as configuration options for the program. Each tool type is a single line of text, which can optionally include parameters written after an <code>=</code> sign. Tool types can be commented out by writing them in [[bracket|parentheses]]. For example, the tooltype \"<code>CX_POPKEY=ctrl alt f1</code>\" defines that the application (a ''Commodity'') will activate the user interface in response to the key sequence Ctrl-Alt-F1.\n\nThe colours used in the icon are normally only stored as indices to the Amiga Workbench screen's current palette. Because of this, the icons' colour scheme is inherently tied to the chosen hues in the screen's palette, and choosing non-standard colours can give the icons an ugly appearance. This problem was partly solved by a third-party system called [[NewIcons]], which adds additional features to the standard <code>.info</code> files. Unlike normal Workbench icons, NewIcons include actual [[RGB]] colour information, and the system tries its best to match the icons' colour hues to those in the screen palette.\n\nSince AmigaOS 3.5, Workbench supports icons with up to 256 colors. This release of AmigaOS features the [[NewIcons#GlowIcons|GlowIcons]] icon set by Matt Chaput. With AmigaOS 3.5, a screen-palette-independent system is used. The 4.0 icons, designed by Martin Merz, can use a 24-bit palette.\n\nBoth [[AROS]] and [[MorphOS]] support [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] icons natively. PNG allows using full 24-bit palette with alpha blending. On Amiga Workbench PNG icons are supported through plugins.\n\n== Comparison to other file managers ==\nIn comparison to the competing [[Mac OS]] and [[Atari]], the early Amiga Workbench (pre-Workbench 2.04) featured, as the default, a 4 color blue desktop screen with color icons at {{nowrap|640 \u00d7 200}} [[NTSC]] American standard or {{nowrap|640 \u00d7 256}} on European [[PAL]] television sets, in contrast to the {{nowrap|512 \u00d7 342}} black and white interface presented by the Mac. The Amiga user was also free to create and modify system and program icons, while [[Atari TOS]] featured only default system icons whose appearance could not be modified.\n\nWorkbench contributed many other unique features/philosophies to intuitive GUI design (starting with version 2.04/2.1):\n* Menu item indenting, which immediately indicated the item was a \"toggle\" function, eliminating guesswork for the user.\n* The concept of tri-level information using [[bevel]] shading to simulate a 3d appearance. Indented controls indicated information-only text, surface-level controls represented labels for GUI elements, and raised GUI elements indicated data editable by, or interactive with, the user.\n* Much like the \"File\" and \"Edit\" menus became standard on most GUIs, Workbench implemented the concept of a \"Settings\" menu designed to standardize the location for all options within an application.\n* Standardized buttons for OS-level preferences or settings dialog boxes through \"Save\", \"Use\", and \"Cancel\" provided a simple and consistent means for short- and long-term settings use.\n* Standardized preference settings for user-level import and export through a \".prefs\" extension and file format.\n* Commodities Exchange: a consistent programming standard and GUI for easy launch, control, and removal of all TSRs or background-process utilities/mini-apps.\n* Datatypes: a modular and user-customizable data identification system that the OS used to recognize, launch, edit, and provide a means of importing and exporting data between OS and applications alike.\n* Locale: an OS and application-wide GUI that provided the means for implementing user-selectable language, time, and other locale-specific settings.\n\n== Criticisms ==\nThe freedom in customization and the multitude of color settings and aspects available to the user were sometimes seen as chaotic. Customization permitted icons of a vastly different size and appearance than those of the original system icons. Before Workbench 2.0, there were no [[User interface design|user interface design guidelines]], so the look and feel of menu options could be different from one application to the next (i.e. the layout of basic items like ''Load'', ''Save'', ''Open'', ''Close'', ''Quit'', etc.). This was seen as a problem with the Amiga by its detractors. The historical GUI site GUIdebook<ref>[http://www.guidebookgallery.org/guis/amigaos Amiga OS] GUIs \u2013 GUIdebook: Graphical User Interface gallery</ref> calls Amiga Workbench a \"unique (if slightly chaotic) GUI for Amiga machines\".\n\n== Use in fictional media ==\nThe [[Ren'py]] visual novel ''[[Digital: A Love Story]]'' uses an Amiga Workbench 1.0 design (known as Amie Workbench within the game).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Amiga}}\n* [[Ambient (desktop environment)|Ambient]]\n* [[Zune (widget toolkit)#Wanderer|Wanderer]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n* {{note|Workbench 4.0 image for fair use}} {{nowrap|AmigaOS 4.0}} Image included in this article it is intended for fair use.

Workbench provides the user with a graphical interface to work with [[file system]]s and launch applications. It uses a workbench [[metaphor]] (in place of the more common [[desktop metaphor]]) for representing file system organisation.\n\nConfusingly, \"Workbench\" was also the name originally given to the entire [[Amiga]] [[operating system]] up until version 3.1. From release 3.5 the operating system was renamed \"AmigaOS\" and subsequently \"Workbench\" refers to the native file manager only (similarly, \"System\" was the name given to [[classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] up until version 7.6).\n\n== Overview ==\n\n[[File:Amiga Workbench 1.3 UK diskette.jpg|thumb|Workbench 1.3 UK on floppy disk.]]\n\nThe Amiga Workbench uses the [[metaphor]] of a [[workbench]] (i.e. a workbench of manual labor), rather than the now-standard [[desktop metaphor]], for representing file system organization. The desktop itself is called ''Workbench'' and uses the following representations: ''drawers'' (instead of folders) for directories, ''tools'' for executable programs, ''projects'' for data files, and a ''[[trash (computing)|trash can]]'' as a folder intended to contain deleted files. These representations may be considered somewhat unusual by a modern user, but at the time there were no commonly accepted metaphors and Commodore chose to use different idioms from their competitors ([[Apple Inc.|Apple]] had already pursued legal action to prevent other software companies from offering graphical user interfaces similar to its own).\n\nWorkbench is a [[spatial file manager]] in the sense that it uses a spatial metaphor to represent files and folders as if they are real physical objects. Under this concept, each drawer (folder) opens in its own window, rather than within a single browser under the now more common [[navigational file manager|navigational]] concept.\n\nWorkbench utilizes the Amiga's native windowing system called [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]] to provide the [[graphical user interface]]. Intuition manages the rendering of screens, windows, and gadgets (graphical elements, equivalent to widgets). Later versions of AmigaOS enhanced the interface with more complex [[object-oriented]] widget systems, such as ''gadtools.library'' and [[BOOPSI]] (AmigaOS 2.0 and later) and [[ReAction GUI|ReAction]] (AmigaOS 3.5 and later). Intuition also handles user input events, such as, input from the keyboard and mouse. Workbench requires a two button mouse, where right click operates pull-down menus and left click is used for all other purposes.\n\nThe underlying AmigaOS allows the Workbench to launch multiple applications that can execute concurrently. This is achieved through [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]], the Amiga's multi-tasking kernel, which handles [[memory management]], [[message passing]], and [[scheduling (computing)|task scheduling]]. Applications launched from Workbench could report their success back to Workbench, but this was not a requirement and few actually did.\n\nWorkbench itself has always been a disk-based component, though much of the underlying functionality is stored in the Amiga's [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] firmware, usually stored in [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. As a consequence, it is necessary to boot from a system disk to launch Workbench. This setup streamlines the process of launching games (which typically do not require Workbench) and ensures that memory is not used unnecessarily by the OS in memory-limited systems.\n\nWorkbench was shipped with all Amiga models from Commodore. Workbench was provided either on [[floppy disk]] or later (as part of AmigaOS) on [[CD-ROM]]. Initially, Workbench was designed to be launched and operate from floppy disk (or other [[removable media]]). Later versions could be installed on [[hard disk]], for which an installer was developed for use with AmigaOS 2.0 and later. AmigaOS (including Workbench) often came pre-installed on systems shipped with hard disks.\n* 1985 Workbench 1.0\n* 1990 Workbench 2.0\n* 1992 Workbench 3.0\n* 1994 Amiga OS 3.1\n* 1999 Amiga OS 3.5\n* 2000 Amiga OS 3.9\n* 2006 Amiga OS 4.0\n\n== Versions ==\nUp until release 3.1 of the Amiga's operating system, Commodore used ''Workbench'' to refer to the entire Amiga operating system. As a consequence Workbench was commonly used to refer to both the operating system and the file manager component. For end users Workbench was often synonymous with AmigaOS. From version 3.5 the OS was renamed \"AmigaOS\" and pre-3.5 versions were also retroactively referred to as \"AmigaOS\" (rather than Workbench). Subsequently, \"Workbench\" refers to the native graphical file manager only.\n\nFrom its inception, Workbench offered a highly customizable interface. The user could change the aspect of program icons replacing it with newer ones with different color combinations. Users could also take a \"snapshot\" of icons and windows so the icons will remain on the desktop at coordinates chosen by user and windows will open at the desired size.\n\n=== Workbench 1.x ===\n[[Image:Amiga Workbench 1 0.png|thumb|250px|Amiga Workbench 1.0]]\n\nWorkbench 1.0 was released with the first Amiga, the [[Amiga 1000]], in 1985. The 1.x versions of Workbench used a garish blue and orange color scheme, designed to give high contrast on even the worst of television screens (the colors can be changed by the user). Versions 1.1 consists mostly of bug fixes and, like version 1.0, was distributed for the Amiga 1000 only.\n\nThe display was highly customizable for the era. The user was free to create and modify system and user icons, while [[Atari TOS]] featured only default system icons whose appearance could not be modified and customizing icons on the Macintosh required using [[ResEdit]]. Icons can be of arbitrary size and design and can have two image states to produce a pseudo-animated effect when selected. Users could customize four display colours and choose from two resolutions: {{nowrap|640\u00d7200}} or {{nowrap|640\u00d7400}} (interlaced) on [[NTSC]], or {{nowrap|640\u00d7256}} or {{nowrap|640\u00d7512}} on [[PAL]] systems. In later revisions, the TV or monitor overscan could be adjusted.\n\nSeveral features were deprecated in later versions. For example, the gauge meter showing the free space on a file system was replaced with a percentage in Workbench 2.0. Under Workbench 1.x, right clicking on icons opens a display of the files metadata, whereas from Workbench 2.0 right clicking activates pull-down menus only. The default \"busy\" pointer (a comic balloon showing \"Zzz...\") was replaced with a stopwatch in later versions.\n\n=== Workbench 2.0, 2.1 ===\n[[File:Wb 20.png|thumb|250px|Amiga Workbench 2.0]]\n\nWorkbench 2.0 was released with the launch of the [[Amiga 3000]] in 1990. Until AmigaOS 2.0 there was no unified [[look and feel]] design standard and application developers had to write their own widgets (both buttons and menus) if they wished to enhance the already-meager selection of standard basic widgets provided by Intuition. With Workbench 2.0 ''gadtools.library'' was created, which provided standard widget sets. The ''Amiga User Interface Style Guide'',<ref>[[#Com91|Commodore-Amiga 1991]]</ref> was published which explained how applications should be laid out for consistency. Intuition was improved with [[BOOPSI]] (Basic Object Oriented Programming system for Intuition) which enhanced the system with an [[object-oriented]] interface to define a system of classes in which every class individuate a single widget or describes an interface event. It can be used to program object oriented interfaces into Amiga at any level. As of Workbench 2.0 all files became visible as icons without the need of associated .info files, thus streamlining the process of starting executables in the GUI.\n\nWorkbench 2.0 also added support for ''public screens''. Instead of the Workbench screen being the only shareable screen, applications could create their own named screens to share with other applications.\n\nWorkbench 2.0 included and integrated ''[[ARexx]]'', allowing users to control the system and other programs from user scripts.\n\nWorkbench 2.0 introduced ''[[AmigaGuide]]'', a simple text-only [[hypertext]] markup scheme and browser, for providing online help inside applications. It also introduced ''[[Installer (programming language)|Installer]]'', a standard software installation program, driven by a [[LISP]]-like scripting language.\n\nFinally, Workbench 2.0 rectified the problem of applications [[hooking]] directly into the input-events stream to capture keyboard and mouse movements, sometimes locking up the whole system. Workbench 2.0 provided ''Commodities'', a standard interface for modifying or scanning input events. This included a standard method for specifying global \"hotkey\" key-sequences, and a ''Commodities Exchange'' registry for the user to see which commodities were running.\n\n=== Workbench 3.0, 3.1 ===\n[[File:Amiga_Workbench_3.1_screenshot.png|thumb|250px|Amiga Workbench 3.1]]\n\nVersion 3.0 was originally shipped with the Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000 computers. Version 3.0 added datatypes support and Workbench could load any background image in any format, as long as the required datatype was installed. This feature was also used in Multiview. Its capabilities were directly related to the datatypes installed in Devs:Datatypes. Localisation was added to allow Workbench, and any installed programs that had localisation, to appear in any supported language.\nThe established AmigaGuide hypertext system gained more usability by using document links pointing to mediafiles, for example pictures or sounds, all recognized by the datatypes.\n\n=== Workbench 3.5, 3.9 ===\n[[File:Amiga Workbench 3.9.png|thumb|250px|Amiga Workbench 3.9, (2000)]]\nFollowing Commodore's demise and around six years after Workbench 3.1 was released, [[Haage & Partner]] were commissioned to update AmigaOS, which was released in 1999 as a software-only update for existing systems.\n\nThe Workbench [[look and feel]], though still largely based on the earlier 3.1 release was revised somewhat, with an improved user interface based on ReAction, improved icon rendering and official support for [[24-bit color|true color]] [[Computer wallpaper|backdrops]].

The Amiga user was also free to create and modify system and program icons, while [[Atari TOS]] featured only default system icons whose appearance could not be modified.\n\nWorkbench contributed many other unique features/philosophies to intuitive GUI design (starting with version 2.04/2.1):\n* Menu item indenting, which immediately indicated the item was a \"toggle\" function, eliminating guesswork for the user.\n* The concept of tri-level information using [[bevel]] shading to simulate a 3d appearance. Indented controls indicated information-only text, surface-level controls represented labels for GUI elements, and raised GUI elements indicated data editable by, or interactive with, the user.\n* Much like the \"File\" and \"Edit\" menus became standard on most GUIs, Workbench implemented the concept of a \"Settings\" menu designed to standardize the location for all options within an application.\n* Standardized buttons for OS-level preferences or settings dialog boxes through \"Save\", \"Use\", and \"Cancel\" provided a simple and consistent means for short- and long-term settings use.\n* Standardized preference settings for user-level import and export through a \".prefs\" extension and file format.\n* Commodities Exchange: a consistent programming standard and GUI for easy launch, control, and removal of all TSRs or background-process utilities/mini-apps.\n* Datatypes: a modular and user-customizable data identification system that the OS used to recognize, launch, edit, and provide a means of importing and exporting data between OS and applications alike.\n* Locale: an OS and application-wide GUI that provided the means for implementing user-selectable language, time, and other locale-specific settings.\n\n== Criticisms ==\nThe freedom in customization and the multitude of color settings and aspects available to the user were sometimes seen as chaotic. Customization permitted icons of a vastly different size and appearance than those of the original system icons. Before Workbench 2.0, there were no [[User interface design|user interface design guidelines]], so the look and feel of menu options could be different from one application to the next (i.e. the layout of basic items like ''Load'', ''Save'', ''Open'', ''Close'', ''Quit'', etc.). This was seen as a problem with the Amiga by its detractors. The historical GUI site GUIdebook<ref>[http://www.guidebookgallery.org/guis/amigaos Amiga OS] GUIs \u2013 GUIdebook: Graphical User Interface gallery</ref> calls Amiga Workbench a \"unique (if slightly chaotic) GUI for Amiga machines\".\n\n== Use in fictional media ==\nThe [[Ren'py]] visual novel ''[[Digital: A Love Story]]'' uses an Amiga Workbench 1.0 design (known as Amie Workbench within the game).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Amiga}}\n* [[Ambient (desktop environment)|Ambient]]\n* [[Zune (widget toolkit)#Wanderer|Wanderer]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n* {{note|Workbench 4.0 image for fair use}} {{nowrap|AmigaOS 4.0}} Image included in this article it is intended for fair use.
